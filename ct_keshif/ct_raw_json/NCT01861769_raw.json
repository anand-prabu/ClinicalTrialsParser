            "textblock": "Approximately 9% of Canadians will have Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) in their\n      lifetime. In the military veteran population, the lifetime prevalence of PTSD has been\n      estimated to be as high as 20%. Numerous research studies have demonstrated that short-term,\n      cognitive-behavioral psychotherapies, such as Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT), lead to\n      substantial improvements in PTSD symptoms. However, research suggests that a minority of\n      clinicians provide these therapies in clinical settings. The transfer of this research\n      knowledge into clinical settings remains one of the largest hurdles to improving the health\n      of Canadians with PTSD.\n\n      It is well established that attending a 2-day workshop on these therapies alone is\n      insufficient to promote adequate knowledge transfer and sustained skillful use. The current\n      study aims to contrast whether two forms of post-workshop support (6-month duration), with\n      different levels of expert oversight, will result in superior levels of clinician skill and\n      patient outcomes versus no formal post-workshop support. The three forms of post-workshop\n      support are 1) technology-enhanced group tele-consultation 2) standard group\n      tele-consultation 3) no tele consultation. The primary and secondary outcomes will be the\n      assessment of the clinicians' competence in CPT and patient symptoms,respectively. This\n      study will inform how best to transfer evidence based therapy outcomes to the clinical\n      milieu to attain comparable outcomes as those observed in research.\n\n      The investigators' hypotheses are as follows: Hypothesis 1:The technology enhanced group\n      tele-consultation condition will evidence the highest levels of fidelity, the standard group\n      tele-consultation condition will evidence intermediate levels of fidelity, and the\n      no-consultation/fidelity monitoring only condition will evidence the lowest fidelity.\n      Hypothesis 2: Fidelity to the CPT protocol, irrespective of consultation condition, will be\n      positively associated with improved client outcomes. Hypothesis 3: Organizational context\n      variables, such as the organizational climate and readiness for change, will influence the\n      uptake of CPT skills, as well as the extent to which these skills are utilized in practice."
