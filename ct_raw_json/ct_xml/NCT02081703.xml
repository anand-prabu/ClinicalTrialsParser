        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Scheduled to undergo primary unilateral TKA for painful osteoarthritis without
             congenital knee pathology

          -  American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status Classification System â‰¤ 3

          -  Medically stable as determined by the Investigator based on pre-study medical
             history, physical/neurological examination, clinical laboratory tests, and 12-lead
             electrocardiogram (ECG) findings

          -  Body Mass Index of 18-40 kg/m2

          -  Stable medical regimen for at least 1 month before randomization

          -  Able to read and understand study instructions in English, and willing and able to
             comply with all study procedures

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  More than 2 other current focal areas of pain, none greater in intensity than the
             target knee and no other active chronic pain conditions that would compromise
             operative knee pain evaluation

          -  Inflammatory arthridities (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, ankylosing spondylitis,
             psoriatic arthritis), with the exception of clinically stable/non-active gout that
             does not affect the knee and does not interfere with walking

          -  Operative arthroscopy in the surgical knee in the last 4 months (except for meniscal
             repair which will be no shorter than 6 months before randomization), or other prior
             surgery in either knee in the last 12 months, except for diagnostic arthroscopy

          -  Planned use of any of the following for TKA: general anesthesia using potent
             inhalational agents, peripheral nerve block (i.e., femoral nerve block), neuroaxial
             (intrathecal or epidural) opioids postoperatively, or knee capsule injections

          -  Received aspirin within 1 week of randomization, or any nonsteroidal
             anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) within 5 half-lives prior to randomization, or planned
             use of NSAIDS post-operatively through Day 28

          -  Daily use of benzodiazepines in the 3 months prior to randomization (unless used for
             sleep and dosage will be consistent after surgery)

             or intra-articular steroid injections within 1 month prior to randomization, or
             planned use of either post-operatively through Day 28

             cardiac prophylaxis (as long as discontinued within 1 week of randomization)

          -  Current neurologic disorder, which could confound the assessment of pain (e.g.,
             Parkinson's, Multiple Sclerosis)

          -  Current active depression symptoms

          -  Has had a change in dose or regimen of SSRIs or SNRIs for depression within 1 month

          -  Mini Mental State Exam score &lt; 24 at Screening

          -  Severe chronic obstructive or restrictive pulmonary disease, current diagnosis of
             obstructive sleep apnea documented by a sleep laboratory study, or current home use
             of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or bi-level positive airway pressure
             (BIPAP)

          -  Current evidence of alcohol abuse or history of alcohol-related complications within
             1 year of randomization including, but not limited to, alcoholic withdrawal seizures,
             hallucinations, delirium tremens or detoxification treatment

          -  Known or suspected history of illicit drug abuse within 1 year before randomization,
             current or planned use of medical marijuana, or history of opioid dependence within 2
             years before randomization

          -  Any malignancy within the past year, with the exception of basal cell carcinoma or
