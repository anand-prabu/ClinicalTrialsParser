      The primary objective of this study is to determine if exercise, fasting, or eating prior to
      a molecular breast imaging study will have an effect on the uptake of the radiotracer Tc-99m
      sestamibi in the breast tissue.

      Tc-99m sestamibi is primarily extracted by the liver. Changes in hepatic blood flow may
      therefore influence the amount of radiotracer available for uptake in the breast tissue.

    <description>MBI will be performed in 52 subjects after an overnight fast with 4-6 mCi Tc-99m sestamibi. The subject will receive the usual Mayo gown for breast imaging. A skin temperature sensor will be taped to the anterior of one breast and skin temperature will be recorded. The subject will be asked to sit for 15 minutes in the waiting room prior to injection of the Tc-99m sestamibi. Just prior to injection, skin temperature will be recorded again. After completion of the first study the subject will then be given a warm towel robe and a small heating pad to be placed over the chest area. After 30 minutes, skin temperature will be recorded again immediately prior to injection of the second dose of Tc-99m sestamibi. The second MBI study will then be performed.</description>

    <description>MBI will be performed in 52 subjects after an overnight fast with 4-6 mCi Tc-99m sestamibi. The subject will then be instructed to consume 200 mg caffeine in tablet form. This is equivalent to the caffeine content of an 8 oz brewed coffee from Starbucks. After 45 minutes after consumption of the caffeine tablet, patients will receive a second injection of 4-6 mCi Tc-99m sestamibi and a repeat MBI study will be performed.</description>

    <description>MBI will be performed in 25 subjects after an overnight fast with 4-6 mCi Tc-99m sestamibi. Patients will then be asked to perform moderate exercise on a treadmill for 6-10 minutes at a level of 70%-80% of maximum predicted heart rate. At ~10 minutes, patients will receive a second injection of 4-6 mCi Tc-99m sestamibi and a repeat MBI study will be performed.</description>

    <description>MBI will be performed in 25 subjects after an overnight fast with 4-6 mCi Tc-99m sestamibi. Patients will then be instructed to consume 8-16 fluid oz of Ensure (350-700 calories). At 30 minutes after consumption of the meal, patients will receive a second injection of 4-6 mCi Tc-99m sestamibi and a repeat MBI study will be performed.</description>
