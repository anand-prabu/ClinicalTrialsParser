Our study will evaluate a\n      comprehensive plan for treatment of knee OA by primary care physicians. Primary care\n      physicians will provide standard care for knee OA to half of the study participants (150\n      people), and will use the comprehensive treatment plan guidelines to treat the other half.\n      The comprehensive plan includes careful use of medications along with non-drug approaches\n      such as patient education, exercise, and social support. People who participate in the study\n      will receive care for knee OA for 1 year. We will measure the results (outcomes) of\n      treatment at the start of the study and at 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months after patients\n      join the study. The results we will measure include joint pain, physical function, drug side\n      effects, quality of life, satisfaction with OA care, and the cost of medical care."

            "textblock": "Anticipating trends toward generalism in medicine, the rheumatology community has begun to\n      set forth guidelines for managing osteoarthritis (OA). These guidelines emphasize a\n      comprehensive approach toward nondrug treatment (e.g., patient education, exercise, social\n      support) and a conservative approach to drug management to minimize the side effects of\n      nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Unfortunately, few primary care physicians\n      provide conservative, comprehensive care for OA as promoted in the recent rheumatology\n      literature. Also, although researchers have studied individual elements of a comprehensive\n      approach to OA care and largely validated them in isolation, no research support exists to\n      suggest that uniformly adopting OA care guidelines will result in better patient outcomes\n      and/or reduced costs of care.\n\n      In this project, we will implement, in a controlled fashion, and evaluate a comprehensive\n      plan for treating patients with knee OA by primary care physicians in a managed care\n      environment. Comprehensive care for knee OA will be guided by a procedure designed to\n      introduce and reinforce (a) an array of nondrug, self-care procedures intended to combat\n      joint pain and preserve function and (b) a stepped protocol for drug management of knee pain\n      that minimizes the risk of adverse side effects of NSAIDs.\n\n      Participants will be 300 patients with a confirmed clinical diagnosis of knee OA who receive\n      their medical care in a large health maintenance organization (HMO) in Indianapolis,\n      Indiana. We will randomly allocate geographically discrete offices of the HMOs  to\n      experimental (OA care by algorithm) or control (routine OA care) conditions (150\n      subjects/group). Patients who enroll in the study at each location will receive care for\n      knee OA for 1 year under the guidelines specified by random assignment.\n\n      We will measure outcomes at baseline and 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months after enrollment,\n      and outcomes will include joint pain, physical function, drug side effects, quality of life\n      (i.e., general health status), satisfaction with OA care, and direct costs of medical care.\n      We think that comprehensive care, as guided by our algorithms, will result in significant\n      improvement in knee pain, physical function, and patient satisfaction, and lower direct\n      costs compared to care delivered under routine circumstances."
