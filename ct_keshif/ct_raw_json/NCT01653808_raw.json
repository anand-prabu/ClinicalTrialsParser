            "textblock": "Hemodiafiltration, a convective-based therapy combining both diffusive and convective\n      transports appears as the treatment modality of choice for hemodialysis patients. Indeed,\n      this innovative technique offers an effective dialysis modality removing spectrum of uremic\n      solutes with an optimized biocompatibility of the extracorporeal circuit obtained with use\n      of ultrapure dialysis and sterile substitution fluids. However, such therapy can not be\n      proposed in all dialysis centers due to major drawbacks of this technique over conventional\n      hemodialysis, the complexity of the system and its increased costs. Alternatively,\n      enhancement of convective transport may now be achieved by use of innovative dialyzers\n      allowing more internal filtration. This is the case of ELISIO\u2122-H dialyzers which possess\n      fibers of a greater internal length which potentially allow more internal filtration. Aim of\n      the present study was therefore to evaluate efficacy and biocompatibility of internal\n      filtration-enhanced hemodialysis using this dialyzer compared to hemodiafiltration, over a\n      four-month period."
