The participants performed three sets of 8-10 repetitions with resting periods of 1-2 min on the weightlifting machines. Load was gradually increased 5-10 % as the participant strength was adapted. The load started at 70% of 6RM.\nFunctional exercises (abdominal crunch, low back extension, and push-ups) were performed at the end of the session to strengthen the core musculature consisting of 3 sets of 15s of isometric contractions at the beginning of the program and 30 s at the end. Dynamic contractions were added, starting with 10 repetitions at the beginning to 30 repetitions at the end of the program.",
