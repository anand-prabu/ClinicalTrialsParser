The focus is on the quantitative\n      determination of active cancer-specific proteases in blood via simple fluorescence\n      measurements.  The matrix metalloproteinases, urokinase-type plasminogen activator, and\n      cathepsins, are up-regulated in the vast majority of progressing cancers and can, therefore,\n      serve as markers for cell survival/tumor progression, angiogenesis, and tissue\n      remodeling/invasion"
