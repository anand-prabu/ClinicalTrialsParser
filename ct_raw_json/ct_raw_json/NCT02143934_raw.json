In order the clear\n      liver-stage/blood-stages G6PD-normal children were randomised to receive Chloroquine (3\n      days, standard dose) and Coartem (3 days, standard dose) plus either i) primaquine (20 days,\n      0.5mg/kg) or ii) placebo (20days). These drugs were administered over a period of 4 weeks.\n\n      In addition to this epidemiological data, the study will assess the natural acquisition of\n      cellular and humoral immune responses to P. falciparum and P. vivax, thus assisting in the\n      determination of correlates of clinical immunity to P. falciparum and P. vivax in PNG\n      children aged 5-10 years.\n\n      These data will not only be essential for development of future vaccines against P. vivax\n      and P falciparum but provide invaluable insight into the contribution of long-lasting\n      liver-stages to the force of infection with P. vivax that will contribute towards designing\n      more rational approaches to the treatment of P. vivax both in the context of case management\n      and future attempts at elimination."
