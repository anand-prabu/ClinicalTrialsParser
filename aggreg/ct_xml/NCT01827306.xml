  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Biofreeze® is a topical analgesic, frequently used in the office or given to a patient for
      home use as a way to mitigate pain during the course of treatment. Rehabilitative exercises
      are considered an important component of care for shoulder pain patients, although pain can
      be a limiting factor in the advancement of rehabilitation. The purpose of this study is to
      evaluate the addition of Biofreeze® to an in-office group of shoulder pain patients to
      determine its impact on pain reduction. Methods: Patients 18-64 years old with mechanical
      shoulder pain who are candidates for FUNHAB® will be randomized into two groups (N=20). The
      Control group (N=10) will receive FUNHAB® alone while the Intervention group (N=10) will
      receive FUNHAB® plus Biofreeze® just prior to initiating the in-office exercise program.
      Values of pain (NPRS) and disability (ASES) will be recorded at baseline, 2 weeks, and 4
      weeks. Hypotheses will be addressed by repeated measures ANOVAs within and between group,
      time, and interaction main effects. Clinical Relevance: Progression of therapeutic exercises
      can be limited by pain and the associated disability. The ability to decrease shoulder pain
      and disability with a topical analgesic will allow health care professionals to advance
      patients through a therapeutic exercise program without the restriction of pain. In turn,
      patients will correct the underlying condition of their shoulder pain at a faster rate.
