            "textblock": "Pain and reduced function are the most common symptoms of coxarthritis. Pain relief and\n      normal range of motion (ROM) restoration are the objectives of a Total Hip Arthroplasty\n      (THA) procedure. It is recognized that increased head-neck ratio results in increased ROM\n      due to the fact that prosthetic impingement between neck and acetabular liner occurs with\n      wider arcs of motion. This head-neck ratio has been investigated extensively only in vitro\n      (on cadavers or sawbones) or using mathematical modeling in computer simulations. These\n      studies are limited by the lack of soft tissues and muscle activations in the models. This\n      study will clinically assess the effect of prosthetic head diameter on patient capability of\n      performing movements which require extreme arcs of motion of the hip joint. Therefore, the\n      research questions are:\n\n        -  What role do soft tissues play in limiting ROM?\n\n        -  Can prosthetic impingement really occur in a well positioned THA?\n\n        -  Can a bigger head diameter alone reduce the risk of impingement?"

Patient recruitment will last 12 months and the Study will have a\n      follow-up period of 12 months. A total number of 45 patients will be recruited. Patients\n      will be randomly allocated into three groups: the first group will undergo THA with a 28mm\n      diameter head (Pinnacle Acetabular System, with a ceramic on ceramic - CoC - bearing), in\n      the second group THA will be performed using a 36 mm diameter head (DeltaMotion), finally\n      patients in the third group will undergo THA with a 40 mm diameter head (DeltaMotion).\n      Patients will be operated by three surgeons of the same hospital according to the same\n      surgical procedure and using the same direct lateral approach. All patients will receive a\n      Corail stem and will follow the same rehabilitation program.\n\n        -  Primary endpoint: Gait analysis and fluoroscopy will provide quantitative information\n           of prosthesis in vivo performance, e.g. what is the arc (degrees) of active or passive\n           motion when prosthetic impingement occurs?\n\n        -  Secondary endpoint(s): these analyses will also allow to: 1) assess ROM of the operated\n           hip versus contralateral non operated hip and the effect of prosthetic head diameter\n           and any correlation to hip functional scores validated and commonly used in the\n           Literature; 2) set reproducible criteria for in vivo fluoroscopic analysis of ROM in\n           THA patients."
