Upon\n      arrival participants will fill out a questionnaire about their dietary and medication\n      intakes and physical activity for the past 72 hours to ensure compliance. Compliant\n      participants' weight and blood pressure will be measured and a fasting blood draw will be\n      taken before participants consume their test meal in the form of a milkshake (control,\n      PC700KL, PC700KL + Niacin). On each test day, participants will be given only this meal and\n      provided with ample supply of bottled water.\n\n      Participants will only consume this test meal and water freely for the duration of the test\n      day. Blood will be drawn serially at 2 and 4 hours postprandially. Participants will also be\n      asked to provide 3 urine samples throughout the study: before and 2, and 4 hours after\n      consumption of the milkshake. Participants will be tested on two additional separate test\n      days after the first day separated by a two-week washout. The first two test days will be\n      randomized, however the third test day will always contain niacin in order to require\n      participants remain at Ragle for the first two hours of the study to monitor niacin flushing\n      reactions. Participants have the option of participating in two out of three of the test\n      days if they wish to exclude themselves from the niacin test day."
