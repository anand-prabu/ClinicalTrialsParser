            "textblock": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) accounts for 10% to 15% of all cancers and is the second leading\n      cause of cancer deaths in Western countries. Approximately half of all patients develop\n      metastatic disease and become candidates for the palliative chemotherapy which has been\n      proved to prolong survival and improve quality of life (QOL) in patients with metastatic\n      CRC. The most active chemotherapy regiments include oxaliplatin or irinotecan combined with\n      fluoropyrimidines.\n\n      With overall survival in metastatic CRC nowadays routinely around 2 years, the same\n      intensity of therapy can hardly be maintained throughout the course of therapy. The\n      continuum of care therefore mandates changes in therapy, with treatment breaks or phases of\n      less-intensive maintenance therapy interspersed with periods of more-intensive therapy to\n      control tumor progression. Thereby, chemo-holidays conceivably reduce the cumulative\n      toxicities of chemotherapy, potentially prevent the unplanned, premature discontinuation of\n      therapy, preserve the ability to administer further phases of therapy, potentially maximize\n      the time on therapy, reduce cost, and could increase QOL for patients. Several trials have\n      tested the influence of chemo-holidays on patient outcome, with various rules on when to\n      stop which component of antitumor therapy as follows; 1) Completely stopping all therapeutic\n      agents, giving patients a completely chemotherapy-free interval (OPTIMOX-2, GISCAD), or 2)\n      Stopping only those agents associated with significant (cumulative) toxicity while\n      continuing other agents as maintenance therapy (OPTIMOX-1, Combined Oxaliplatin\n      Neurotoxicity Prevention Trial [CONcePT]).\n\n      Therefore, we'd like to test if capecitabine maintenance after 8 cycles of capecitabine\n      combine with oxaliplatin (XELOX) could prolong progression-free survival without\n      deterioration of QOL and toxicities in patients metastatic CRC."
