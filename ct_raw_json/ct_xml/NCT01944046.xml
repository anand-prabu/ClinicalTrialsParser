    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to learn about the effects of intranasal oxytocin as a
      supplemental treatment for improving social difficulties in children and adolescents with
      autism. This study will also provide additional information about the safety and
      tolerability of intranasal oxytocin. Investigators expect oxytocin will increase social
      motivation, improving daily living skills and quality of life.

      There is a tremendous unmet need for accessible treatments that address core symptoms of ASD
      and are safe for sustained use. The Study of Oxytocin in ASD to improve Reciprocal Social
      Behaviors or (SOARS-B) will test a very promising potential treatment−intranasal
      oxytocin−for ASD's fundamental social communication deficits in a large, group of verbal and
      nonverbal children.  SOARS-B will also provide information about the regulation of DNA
      methylation and transcription of the oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR), as well as other genes
      relevant to oxytocin's CNS activity, as a function of time and in response to oxytocin
      treatment. These data will fill a key gap in our understanding of oxytocin's role in ASD and
      its ability to alter epigenetic modifications of the OXTR.

    <description>Investigators will obtain blood, urine and vital signs from participants at regular intervals in order to assess the safety of oxytocin.  In addition,the blood samples will also be used to assess oxytocin levels, OTXR differential methylation status and to assess mRNA expression.  Investigators will obtain saliva at the same time points to perform salivary oxytocin levels.</description>

    <description>Each insufflation will deliver 8 IU or 24 IU of oxytocin. A maximum of 3 insufflations at a time will be required. Dosing will be flexible between 8 IU/day and 80 IU/day, typically in two divided doses delivered in the morning and in the afternoon. Doses will typically increase by 8 IU twice daily (BID) at week 2 and months 1 and 2  until achieving the target dose of 24 IU BID at Month 2. Subsequently doses may be increased in 8 IU BID increments ONLY at each visit until a maximum dose of 40 IU BID is achieved.</description>
