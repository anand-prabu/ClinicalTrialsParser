      Resect and discard (RD) is a new paradigm for management of diminutive colorectal polyps
      wherein histology is determined by real-time endoscopic imaging; polyps are then resected
      and discarded rather than sent for histopathological review. The aims of this study were to
      compare the surveillance recommendations between RD and the standard of care where polyps
      are sent for histopathological review in a mixed setting of academic and community
      gastroenterologists and to evaluate the diagnostic performance of an RD program for
      management of diminutive polyps.

      Introduction: Diminutive (≤5 mm) colorectal polyps are prevalent in the screening population
      but have low risk for harboring advanced villous or dysplastic components and for developing
      into colorectal cancer. &quot;Resect and discard&quot; (RD) is a new paradigm for management of these
      diminutive polyps wherein histology is determined by real-time endoscopic imaging; polyps
      are then resected and discarded rather than sent for histopathological review.

      Aim: The aim of this study were to compare the surveillance recommendations between RD and
      the standard of care where polyps are sent for histopathological review in a mixed setting
      of academic and community gastroenterologists and to evaluate the diagnostic performance of
      an RD program for management of diminutive polyps.

      Methods: This is a prospective, observational study conducted in a single outpatient
      endoscopy center over 12 months. Screening and surveillance colonoscopies were performed by
      four academic and two community gastroenterologists. All diminutive polyps (defined as ≤5
      mm) were endoscopically imaged and histology predictions (adenoma vs. non-adenomatous polyp)
      were made using high-definition white light (HDWL) with/without narrow band imaging (NBI) at
      the discretion of the endoscopist. Diagnostic performance and accordance of recommended
      surveillance intervals from endoscopic imaging were compared to histopathological review of
      the polyps.
