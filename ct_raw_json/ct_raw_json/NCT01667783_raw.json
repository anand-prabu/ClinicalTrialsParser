The investigators propose a pilot study in 45 subjects with mild\n      to moderate obesity to compare how losing 10% of initial body weight via one of three common\n      weight loss strategies (medical weight loss with a low calorie diet, Roux-en-Y gastric\n      bypass surgery, and adjustable gastric banding) affects diabetes.  While the investigators\n      do not expect this pilot study to provide definitive answers, it will provide valuable\n      information to design a larger trial which will help guide therapy for people with\n      mild-moderate obesity and substantial comorbidities."
