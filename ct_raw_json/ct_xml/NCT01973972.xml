    <textblock>
      The proposed research will test a novel program that combines intensive weight management
      with shared (group) medical appointments for patients with diabetes. This research is
      important because diabetes is increasingly prevalent, it requires complex management by the
      provider and the patient, and weight loss is a critical component of its management. Adding
      weight management to shared medical appointments could potentially improve blood sugar
      control while reducing medications and their side effects such as low blood sugar.

      Anticipated Impacts on Veteran's Healthcare: Weight management is an important focus of VA
      as evidenced by its VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline and MOVE! program targeting
      overweight/obesity. VA is also committed to using group visits to increase the efficiency
      and effectiveness of health care delivery. We aim to test a novel intervention that combines
      intensive weight and diabetes management using the SMA platform. This research addresses
      important missions to VA because diabetes is more prevalent in Veterans than in the general
      population, and because weight management is more challenging and complex in patients with
      diabetes. Project Background: SMAs involve groups of patients who share a common chronic
      condition and meet over time to receive education, self-management enhancement, and
      medication management to improve clinical outcomes. A systematic review by VA found that
      SMAs modestly improve glycemia in patients with diabetes. Although these SMA programs
      sometimes included diet and physical activity counseling, weight management was not a
      primary goal, and weight typically was not reduced. Instead, medication intensification was
      the primary strategy for improving glycemia, and this strategy can lead to weight gain.

      For overweight patients with diabetes, weight loss is first-line therapy because it can
      improve glycemic control and because excess weight leads to poorer outcomes. Moreover, many
      antiglycemic medications cause weight gain and hypoglycemic events, which may counteract the
      potential macrovascular benefits of glycemic control. Dietary interventions, however, can
      lower weight and improve glycemic control while reducing antiglycemic medication needs and,
      therefore, subsequent risk for hypoglycemic episodes.

      In our prior research, we induced weight loss and improved glycemic control while decreasing
      antiglycemic medications. A combination of an intensive weight management program with the
      diabetes management offered in SMAs has potential to further improve diabetes outcomes,
      reduce complications, decrease costs and increase health-related quality of life. Such a
      combined intervention is ideal for patients with diabetes because of their unique dietary
      considerations, and their need for careful glycemic and medication management during weight
      loss. Project Objectives: We will examine whether an intensive, group-based weight
      management program followed by an SMA intervention (WM/SMA arm) is comparably effective
      (non-inferior) to the SMA intervention alone for improving glycemic control while using less
      antiglycemic medication and resulting in fewer hypoglycemic events and lower healthcare
      costs. Project Methods: 308 overweight VA outpatients with uncontrolled (hemoglobin A1c
      8.0%) type 2 diabetes will participate in this RCT. Similar to prior SMAs, the SMA visits
      will occur every 4 weeks for 16 weeks and then every 8 weeks for 32 weeks for a total of 9
      visits. Sessions will be led by a physician and trained interventionists, and will include
      educational topics related to diabetes management (including diet and physical activity),
      self-management training, and medication adjustment. Similar to our prior weight management
      trials, the WM/SMA group will meet every 2 weeks for 16 weeks and then every 8 weeks for 32
      weeks for a total of 13 visits. The weight management program will focus on a low
      carbohydrate dietary pattern because of its potential to lower glycemia, leading to reduced
      antiglycemic medication needs. After 16 weeks, meeting content will shift to the SMA
      intervention content but weight management will continue to be addressed at the meetings.
      The primary outcome is glycemic control assessed by hemoglobin A1c assessed at baseline and
      at 16, 32, and 48 weeks. Secondary outcomes include hypoglycemic events, changes in the
      antiglycemic medication regimen as assessed by a summary score, weight and healthcare costs.
      Diabetes-specific health-related quality of life and medication adherence will also be
      assessed.

    <description>All episodes of hypoglycemia will be recorded by participants on provided standard log forms, noting the date, time, duration, symptoms, treatment received, and concurrent blood glucose. Participants will additionally be asked if they received medical attention for hypoglycemia, and the details if so, since the last assessment. Only one episode will be counted per 24 hours. Serious episodes, defined as &lt;50 mg/dL or 50-69 mg/dL and requiring assistance, will supersede minor episodes in this case.</description>
