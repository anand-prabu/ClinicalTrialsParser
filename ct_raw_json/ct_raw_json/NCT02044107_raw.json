We will evaluate the\n      adherence of caregivers in 10 health posts in 5 municipalities randomly assigned to receive\n      the health center level co-packaging and counseling messages in addition to current standard\n      care, by comparing them with the caregivers in 10 health posts in 5 municipalities randomly\n      assigned to the receive only the current standard of care. Cost-effectiveness of\n      co-packaging at the health-center level, as a means of improving provider treatment and\n      counseling practices and caregiver adherence, will be evaluated.\n\n      The main objective is to establish the effectiveness of a facility level co-packaging and\n      counseling messages for increasing the adherence by caregivers of children aged 2-59 mo old\n      to the prescribed 10 day treatment with zinc to complement ORS for the treatment of diarrhea\n      and zinc to complement the antibiotics for the treatment of pneumonia diagnosed and treated\n      in public health posts.\n\n      Specific Quantitative Objectives:\n\n      \u2022 To determine if visible co-packaging with pre-tested counseling messages:\n\n        -  Improves adherence of caregivers of children towards the prescribed zinc treatment.\n\n        -  Improves knowledge, awareness or attitudes of caregivers of children and health\n           providers at public health care centers towards the prescribed zinc treatment.\n\n        -  Results in overall increase in health care-seeking for the treatment of diarrhea and\n           pneumonia at public health care centers.\n\n      Specific Qualitative Objectives:\n\n        -  To establish the perception, attitudes and experiences of caregivers towards the\n           visible co-packaging with pre-tested counseling messages to promote the prescribed zinc\n           treatment.\n\n        -  To establish the perception, attitudes and experiences of health providers at public\n           health care centers towards the visible co-packaging with pre-tested counseling\n           messages to promote the prescribed zinc treatment.\n\n        -  To establish the perception, attitudes and experiences of children aged 4 to 5 years\n           old towards the visible co-packaging with pre-tested counseling messages to promote the\n           prescribed zinc treatment."
