      To determine whether the 8-week Hopeful Outdoor Parkinson's Exercise (HOPE) Program would be
      effective in reducing fall rate, improving balance performance, balance confidence, physical
      functions, gait parameters, disease-specific motor performance and health-related quality of
      life in Parkinson's disease (PD) non-fallers and single fallers.

      Previous studies demonstrated that multi-modal balance training program was effective in
      improving balance performance in people with PD. However they did not include all the
      balance domains and outdoor fall-prone activities have been overlooked. And it is still
      inconclusive if these interventions could reduce fall rate and enhance balance confidence.
      We designed an exercise program  based on the framework of the Balance Evaluation Systems
      Test (BESTest)  to target six balance domains including biomechanical constraints, stability
      limits and verticality, anticipatory postural adjustments, reactive postural responses,
      sensori-motor integration and dynamic gait control.
