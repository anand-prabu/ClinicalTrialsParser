The overarching\n      aim of CALIBER is to better understand the aetiology and prognosis of specific coronary\n      phenotypes across a range of causal domains, particularly where electronic records provide a\n      contribution beyond traditional studies. CALIBER has received both Ethics approval (ref\n      09/H0810/16) and ECC approval (ref ECC 2-06(b)/2009 CALIBER dataset)."
