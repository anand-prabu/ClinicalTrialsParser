  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently, over 47 million adults in the United States are known to have metabolic syndrome.
       Metabolic syndrome is comprised of a cluster of conditions including obesity, elevated
      cholesterol, high blood sugar, and high blood pressure.  People with metabolic syndrome have
      an increased risk for the development of chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease and
      diabetes.  Recent studies have shown that a build-up of fat in the muscle of overweight and
      obese people may partially explain the link between metabolic syndrome and the development
      of chronic diseases. There is evidence to suggest that diets with a higher amount of protein
      can improve some aspects of metabolic syndrome, including the build-up of fat in muscle. The
      purpose of this study is to examine the effects of eating a larger amount of dairy-based
      protein on risk factors for metabolic syndrome.
