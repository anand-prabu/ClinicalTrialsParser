Two\n      treatment groups will be used, one with therapist contact and one without, as well as a\n      wait-list control group. It is assumed that the treatment group with therapist contact will\n      be superior to the treatment group receiving no therapist contact since procrastination can\n      be partially explained as a self-regulatory failure. Both treatment groups are presumed to\n      be superior to the wait-list control."
