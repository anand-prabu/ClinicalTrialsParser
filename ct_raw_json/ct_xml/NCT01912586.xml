  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although the high prevalence of erectile dysfunction (ED) was detected among male patients
      after the treatment for colorectal cancer,  published reports depicting  the erectile
      dysfunction experience of patients with colorectal cancer ot underpin service development
      are insufficient. Furthermore,unlike patients with prostate cancer, men with colorectal
      cancer are not routinely offered information and treatment for erectile dysfunction.However,
      investigations on patients after surgery for prostate cancer could provide some potentially
      useful insights. The ability of sildenafil and vacuum erection device (VED) to aid in the
      return of erections after nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy has been established, which
      may benefit rectal cancer patients after surgery with ED.

      Laparoscopic surgery, although technically demanding and associated with a long learning
      curve, has the advantage of clear visualization for the smallest structures,including the
      autonomic nerves. Laparoscopic resection for rectal cancer could thus facilitate
      preservation of the pelvic autonomic nerves.

      This study aimed to identify whether early intervention is effective at reducing the rate of
      ED at 12 months.
