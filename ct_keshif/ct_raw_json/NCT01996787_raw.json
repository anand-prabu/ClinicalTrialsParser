Study characteristics:\n\n      The clinical study evaluates the clinical performance of a silicone hydrogel contact lens\n      for daily wear, Clariti (including handling tint) (Sauflon Pharmaceuticals Ltd.) versus a\n      predicate device, Air Optix Aqua (Alcon Inc.), in terms of lens performance, physiological\n      response and subjective acceptance.\n\n      Subjects used OptiFRee Replenish solution (Alcon Laboratories Inc.) for daily lens\n      maintenance, care and storage.\n\n      The key features were as follows:\n\n        1. One month duration.\n\n        2. Three investigator sites.\n\n        3. Daily wear soft (hydrophilic) silicone hydrogel contact lenses, replaced on a monthly\n           basis: Clariti Monthly (with handling tint)and Air Optix Aqua. Replenish was used as a\n           care system by all subjects.\n\n        4. A total of 38 subjects were enrolled, and 38 subjects accounted for 76 eyes were\n           dispensed lenses. This group was randomized into 25 test subjects (50 eyes) and 13\n           control subjects (26 eyes).\n\n        5. Of the 25 test subjects, 25 (100%) completed one month of use. Of the 13 control\n           subjects, 12 (92.3%)completed one month of use.\n\n        6. There were no adverse reactions.\n\n      II. Study period:\n\n      The study was conducted over one month of wear. Subjects were examined initially, and at two\n      follow-up visits after two weeks and four weeks respectively. Study visits commenced on June\n      26, 2013 and completed on September 14, 2013."
