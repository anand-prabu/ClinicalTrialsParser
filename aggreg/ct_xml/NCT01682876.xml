      This study is designed to conduct a comparative trial to further evaluate the safety,
      immunogenicity and antibody persistence of two doses of Novartis MenACWY conjugate vaccine,
      given 2 months apart, versus one dose of Novartis MenACWY conjugate vaccine in children 2
      through 10 years of age.
