Each part will consist of three treatment periods separated by a\n      minimum washout period of 14 days. In each treatment period, subjects will receive seven\n      daily doses of one of the 3 treatments: FF, LEV or FF/LEV FDC, via an intranasal spray\n      according to one of the 6 possible randomization sequences. The study will use an adaptive\n      design with an interim review following Part A to confirm whether Part B is required."
