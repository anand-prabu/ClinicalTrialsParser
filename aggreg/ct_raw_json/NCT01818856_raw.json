To assess the changes in the plasma pharmacokinetic parameters of Atazanavir\n           administered as 200 mg/12h with respect to its administration as 300/100 mg/day when\n           administered together with TVR (750 mg/8h or 1125 mh/12h).\n\n      Method: open labelled clinical trial with a planned duration of 24 weeks in which 14\n      HIV/Hepatitis C virus genotype 1 patients under treatment with pegylated \u03b1-interferon,\n      Ribavirin and Telaprevir will be enrolled. A 24 hours pharmacokinetic profile  will be\n      obtained after a supervised drug intake while taking TVR and ATV/rtv. Afterwards, the\n      patients will take un-boosted ATV 200 mg bid for 7 - 10 days. Subsequently, a new\n      pharmacokinetic profile will be obtained."
