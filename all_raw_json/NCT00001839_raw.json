As in aplastic anemia, the cytopenia of MDS may be partly due to\n      cytotoxic T cell activity.  Immunosuppressive therapy may therefore reverse the cytopenia.\n      In a phase II pilot study of anti-thymocyte globin (ATG) to treat myelodysplastic syndrome\n      (MDS); 41% of patients (61% of patients with refractory anemia) have responded in terms of\n      transfusion independence.  Recently, Jonasova et al [32] reported a 82% substantial\n      hematological response rate in 18 patients with MDS of the refractory anemia (RA) subtype\n      treated with cyclosporine alone.  Just over 50% of the patients in this series had MDS of\n      the hypocellular type.  Cyclosporine alone if indeed efficacious would be a powerful\n      therapeutic option that could be readily used by hematologists in the community to treat\n      patients with MDS.  This efficacy needs to be proven in a larger study which includes\n      patients with the other subtypes of MDS and more patients with the non-hypocellular forms of\n      MDS (which constitute approximately 70% of the cases in the community).  As MDS is a\n      heterogeneous group of disorders, a randomized comparison with the other immunomodulating\n      intervention of proven benefit, ATG, is appropriate.  In this randomized study patients with\n      MDS will receive either ATG alone or cyclosporine alone."
