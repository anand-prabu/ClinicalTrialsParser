  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the effects of altering the time of day of dosing (morning or
      evening) with Fluticasone Furoate 100 (FF 100) micrograms (mcg) once daily administered via
      a dry powder inhaler (DPI) in subjects with persistent bronchial asthma.  This is a
      repeat-dose, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, three-way crossover study to
      compare the effect of morning (AM) and evening (PM) dosing with FF 100 on lung function.
      Twenty-four male and female subjects with persistent bronchial asthma will be enrolled to
      ensure twenty evaluable subjects.  The three treatments will be FF 100 AM (with placebo PM),
      FF 100 PM (with placebo AM) and matching placebo (AM and PM).  All treatments will be
      administered for 14 (+/-2) days with 14 day run-in and 14 to 21 day washout periods. The
      total duration of the study will be approximately 13 to18 weeks for each subject.

    <description>To investigate the effect of the time of dosing (AM or PM) on the efficacy of repeat dose FF 100 administered via a DPI. Three technically acceptable measurements will be made and the highest one will be recorded. FEV1 is the maximal amount of air forcefully exhaled in one second. FEV1 will be measured using site equipment (spirometer). The weighted mean is similar to an arithmetic mean (average), where instead of each of the data points contributing equally to the final average, some data points contribute more than others. FEV1 values were measured from Day 14 to Day 15.</description>

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with a documented history of persistent asthma, with the exclusion of other
             significant pulmonary diseases (pneumonia, pneumothorax, atelectasis, pulmonary
             fibrotic disease, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, chronic bronchitis, emphysema, chronic
             obstructive pulmonary disease, or other respiratory abnormalities other than asthma).

          -  Male or female between 18 and 70 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the
             informed consent.

          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is:

          -  Of non-childbearing potential defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented
             tubal ligation or hysterectomy or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous
             amenorrhea. Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status
             is in doubt will be required to use contraception method, if they wish to continue
             their HRT during the study.  Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow
             confirmation of post-menopausal status prior to study enrollment.  For most forms of
             HRT, at least 2 to 4 weeks will elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood
             draw; this interval depends on the type and dosage of HRT.  Following confirmation of
             their post-menopausal status, they can resume use of HRT during the study without use
             of a contraceptive method.

          -  Child-bearing potential with negative pregnancy test as determined by serum human
             chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) test at screening and serum or urine hCG test prior to
             dosing and agrees to use one of the contraception methods for an appropriate period
             of time (as determined by the product label or investigator) prior to the start of
             dosing to sufficiently minimize the risk of pregnancy at that point.  Female subjects
             must agree to use contraception until completion of the follow up visit or has only
             same-sex partners, when this is her preferred and usual lifestyle.

          -  All subjects must either be clinically stable on a low to mid dose inhaled
             corticosteroid (ICS) (with or without a short acting beta-2 receptor agonist [SABA])
             such as Fluticasone Propionate (FP) 100 to250 mcg twice-daily (total daily dose 200
             to 500 mcg) or equivalent, for at least 4 weeks preceding the screening visit or be
             clinically stable on a low dose ICS/ long acting beta-2 receptor agonist (LABA)
             combination, such as SERETIDE/ADVAIR 100/50 twice- daily or equivalent (administered
             either in combination or from separate inhalers), for at least 4 weeks preceding the
             screening visit. Higher ICS/LABA doses (i.e. equivalent to SERETIDE/ADVAIR 250/50 or
             500/50) would not be acceptable.  Subjects must refrain from using their LABA for at
             least 24 hour (h) prior to the screening visit

          -  Subjects with a screening pre-bronchodilator FEV1 &gt;= 60 percent of predicted.
             Predicted values will be based upon National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
             (NHANES III).

          -  During the screening visit, subjects must demonstrate the presence of reversible
             airway disease, defined as an increase in FEV1 of &gt;= 12.0 percent over baseline and
             an absolute change of &gt;= 200 mL within 60 minutes following 4 inhalations of
             albuterol/salbutamol inhalation aerosol (or equivalent nebulized treatment with
             albuterol/salbutamol solution).

          -  All subjects must be able to replace all their current asthma treatments with
             albuterol/salbutamol aerosol inhaler at screening for use as needed for the run-in
             period and throughout the duration of the study. Subjects on LABAs must also withhold
             this for at least 24 h prior to the screening visit. Subjects will therefore be on
             SABA alone for the duration of the study, and on SABA and FF during the FF treatment
             periods.  Subjects must be able to withhold albuterol/salbutamol for at least 6 h
             prior to screening and study visits.

          -  Subjects who are current non-smokers and who have a pack history of &lt;= 10 pack years.
             A subject may not have used inhaled tobacco products within the past 3 months (i.e.,
             cigarettes, cigars or pipe tobacco).

          -  Body weight &gt;= 50 kilograms (kg) and Body Mass Index (BMI) within the range 19.0
             to29.9 kg/meter^2 (inclusive)

          -  Based on single or averaged QT duration corrected for heart rate by Fridericia's
             formula (QTcF) values of triplicate electrocardiograms (ECGs) obtained over a brief
             recording period: QTcF &lt; 450 millisecond (msec); or QTcF &lt; 480 msec in subjects with
             Bundle Branch Block.

          -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &lt; 2x Upper limit
             of normal (ULN), alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin &lt;= 1.5xULN (isolated bilirubin
             &gt;1.5xULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin &lt;35
             percent).

          -  Capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the
             requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form.

          -  Able to satisfactorily use the DPI

        Inclusion Criteria for Randomisation to Treatment

          -  Evening pre-dose FEV1 of &gt;=60 percent of their predicted normal at Day 1

          -  Culture-documented or suspected bacterial or viral infection of the upper or lower
             respiratory tract, sinus or middle ear that is not resolved within 4 weeks of
             screening and led to a change in asthma management or, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, is expected to affect the subject's asthma status or the subject's
             ability to participate in the study.

          -  Any asthma exacerbation requiring oral corticosteroids within 12 weeks of screening
