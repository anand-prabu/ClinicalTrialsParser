            "textblock": "Hysteroscopic examination is currently the most informative investigation for patients with\n      abnormal uterine bleeding and infertility. Outpatient hysteroscopy involves the use of\n      miniaturized endoscopic equipment to directly visualise the endometrial cavity, without the\n      need of formal theatre facilities, general or regional anaesthesia.\n\n      Outpatient hysteroscopy is increasingly being used as a cost-effective alternative to\n      in-patient hysteroscopy under general anaesthesia. Like other outpatient gynaecological\n      procedures, however, it has the potential to cause pain severe enough for the procedure to\n      be abandoned.\n\n      Several drugs have been used to reduce pain during the procedure. Celecoxib is a highly\n      selective Cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor (COX-2 inhibitor) whereas other Non-steroidal\n      anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) like Ibuprofen, Diclofenac, and Naproxen inhibit both COX-1\n      and COX-2. COX-1 is the only isoenzyme found in platelets, and plays a role in the\n      protection of the gastrointestinal mucosa, renal hemodynamics, and platelet thrombogenesis.\n      In theory, this selectivity allows celecoxib and other COX-2 inhibitors to reduce\n      inflammation and pain while minimizing gastrointestinal adverse drug reactions. COX-1 is\n      involved in synthesis of prostaglandins and thromboxane, but COX-2 is only involved in the\n      synthesis of prostaglandin. Therefore, inhibition of COX-2 inhibits only prostaglandin\n      synthesis without affecting thromboxane, so offers no cardioprotective effects of\n      nonselective NSAIDs .\n\n      Opioid analgesics are widely used for the control of moderate to severe pain. Tramadol\n      hydrochloride, a synthetic opioid is an orally active, clinically effective centrally acting\n      analgesic having a lower incidence of respiratory depression, cardiac depression, side\n      effects on smooth muscle and abuse potential as compared to typical opioid agents.\n\n      The study will be conducted in the outpatient hysteroscopy clinic in Cairo university\n      hospitals. All patients attending the outpatient hysteroscopy clinic will be invited to\n      participate in the study. The invitation will include a clear full explanation of the study\n      and patients will provide oral consent. Written informed consent is not needed since the\n      procedure and intervention carries almost no risk to the patient and the patient will not\n      receive anesthesia and will be fully conscious. Only patients consenting verbally to\n      participate will be included in the trial.\n\n      Tramadol, celecoxib and placebo will be enclosed in sealed envelopes which will be numbered\n      using computer generated random table. Neither the patient nor the physician will be aware\n      of the drug used. 210 women will be categorized into 3 groups: Group I who will receive\n      Tramadol 100mg (Trama SR\u00ae, Global Napi) orally 1 hour before the procedure, group II who\n      will receive Celecoxib 200mg (Celebrex\u00ae 200, Pfizer) 1 hour before the procedure, and group\n      III who will receive placebo acting as the control group.\n\n      Full history will be taken followed by general and local examination. The procedure will be\n      done in the lithotomy position. Hysteroscopy will be done using a 5mm outer diameter\n      continuous flow hysteroscope with a French working channel and a 30 degrees direction of\n      view provided by Techno GmbH and CO. The hysteroscope will be introduced using the\n      vaginoscopy technique, in which no speculum will be used. The cervix will be detected and\n      the external os will be identified using the hysteroscope. The hysteroscope will be\n      introduced in the uterine cavity. Saline will be used as the distension medium and the\n      pressure will be set at 100mm Hg. The anterior wall, posterior wall and tubal ostea will be\n      visualized, any polyps, adhesions septa, congenital malformations or submucous fibroids will\n      be noted.\n\n      Base line characteristics and perception of pain will be compared."
