            "textblock": "Approximately two thirds of the adult population in developed countries is categorized as\n      over-weight or obese (BMI>30). In spite of worldwide increasing awareness, obesity is a\n      major health concern. In the presence of numerous diets, medical therapies, and robust\n      research, bariatric surgery remains the most effective means of weight reduction in morbidly\n      obese patients (BMI>40, or BMI>35 with co-morbidities). However, bariatric surgery harbors a\n      relatively high risk for postoperative complications; of them, venous thromboembolic events\n      (VTE) are not common, but potentially lethal. Taken  together with the propensity of\n      morbidly obese patients to develop VTE, perioperative thromboprophylaxis is mandatory.\n\n      To date, low molecular weight heparins (LMWH) are most commonly used for VTE prophylaxis in\n      the aforementioned population. Due to the pharmacologic properties of LMWH and the\n      characteristics of surgically treated obese patients, the optimal dose that is to be\n      utilized for VTE prophylaxis in this population remains unclear. Assessment of anti-FXa\n      levels in the patients' plasma can be used in order to monitor LMWH activity. Levels of\n      0.2-0.5 U/ml have been proposed by some authors for VTE prophylaxis.\n\n      Few studies have compared different dosing regimens of enoxaparin (between 30mg-60mg q/12h)\n      for VTE prophylaxis in the population undergoing bariatric surgery; nevertheless, these were\n      small non- randomized trials, containing numerous methodological weaknesses. Hence, the\n      optimal regimen of enoxaparin to be used for the prevention of VTE in the discussed\n      population remains unclear.\n\n      The aim of the present study is to evaluate plasma levels of anti-FXa activity, comparing\n      two most commonly used enoxaparin prophylactic regimens (40mg vs 60mg q/24h) in a large and\n      homogenous cohort of sleeve gastrectomy patients.  Although universally used by bariatric\n      surgeons, the pharmacologic efficacy of these regimens has not been evaluated in patients\n      undergoing bariatric surgery."
