Our hypothesis is that substantial\n      weight loss after Bariatric Surgery  (BS) or dietary intervention is also accompanied by\n      changes in the balance of reward and inhibitory networks. Therefore the investigators will\n      conduct a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study investigating functional and\n      structural measures."
