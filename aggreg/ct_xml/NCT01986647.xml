  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Community-dwelling older adults fear loss of independence and nursing home placement more
      than death.  Walking difficulty often leads to loss of independence.  Exercise is beneficial
      to physical and mental health and may prevent walking difficulty and promote independence.
      Recognizing the importance of exercise, senior housing facilities offer exercise programs to
      their residents.  The exercise programs are often group-based, seated range of motion
      exercises that do not challenge the older adult; consequently participation rates and
      resident satisfaction are low.

      If the goal is to improve walking to promote independence than the exercise program should
      specifically target walking.  Therefore, we developed a challenging, group exercise program
      entitled &quot;On the Move&quot; which focuses on the fundamentals of walking.  In this research study
      we will determine if the On the Move program is better than a standard program at improving
      walking and promoting independence and if the same benefits can be obtained if the On the
      Move program is delivered by staff of the senior living facilities instead of an exercise
      leader.  To answer these questions, 560 community-dwelling older adults living in 28
      different Independent Living Facilities and Senior High Rises will be randomly assigned to
      either the 12 week On the Move group exercise program or the standard group exercise program
      delivered by either an exercise leader or staff activity personnel.  Participants' walking
      and reported ability to carry out everyday activities (functional ability) will be assessed
      before and after the 12 week program.  We will also assess participant safety and
      satisfaction with the exercise program and instructor.

      The findings from this research study will provide evidence for the value of the On the Move
      group exercise program and will better inform patient choices regarding participation in
      exercise programs. If successful in improving walking and promoting independence and
      acceptable to the older adult, the On the Move program could be incorporated into exercise
      programming for older adults in community centers, health clubs, and senior residences
      across the country.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Community-dwelling older adults fear losing their independence more than death.  Walking
      difficulty often leads to loss of independence.  Exercise is beneficial to physical and
      mental health and may prevent walking difficulty in older adults.  Exercise interventions to
      prevent walking difficulty have mainly focused on improving strength and endurance and have
      overlooked an important component of walking, the timing and coordination of movement.  Our
      preliminary work demonstrates that an individualized exercise program that targets timing
      and coordination of movement has a greater impact on walking than a standard strength and
      endurance exercise program.  Though effective, an individualized, physical therapist led
      exercise program is not a cost effective model for the prevention of walking difficulty.  A
      group exercise program is a cost efficient alternative which would likely promote adherence
      through socialization.  Therefore, with input from older adults, we developed a challenging
      group timing and coordination exercise program entitled &quot;On the Move&quot;.  The next key step
      and the main goal of this research is to examine the effectiveness and sustainability of the
      On the Move exercise program.  Therefore, the primary aims of the proposed project are to 1)
      compare the effects of the On the Move group exercise program to a standard program
      delivered by exercise leaders on self-reported function and disability and walking ability,
      2) assess the sustainability and the effectiveness of On the Move compared to a standard
      program when delivered by staff activity personnel 3) compare the acceptability and the
      risks of the On the Move and standard exercise programs delivered by exercise leaders and
      staff activity personnel, and 4) explore potential baseline predictors of benefit and risks
      of participation in On the Move program to facilitate informed patient decision making.
      This single-blinded cluster randomized trial targets 560 community-dwelling older adults
      residing in 28 different Independent Living Facilities and Senior High Rises within the
      University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Senior Communities.  The trial compares type of
      exercise program (12 week standard group exercise program to the 12 week On the Move group
      exercise program) and the mode of delivery (exercise leader to staff activity personnel).
      Primary outcomes include function, disability and walking ability.  We will also examine
      acceptability and risks associated with exercise participation.  The findings from this
      trial will provide evidence for the value of the On the Move group exercise program in
      promoting independence and will provide research evidence that can better inform patient
      choices regarding participation in exercise programs.
