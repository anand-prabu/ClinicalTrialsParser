      Short title :

      X-linked biological response to HIV sensing: the ANRS EP 53 study.

      Main outcome :

      To demonstrate that HIV-infected women carry the TLR7 c.32A&gt;T SNP at a higher frequency than
      uninfected women, arguing in favor of a role of impaired production of IFN-alpha by pDCs in
      the risk of becoming infected by HIV-1.

      Secondary outcome :

      To directly demonstrate at a single cell level that the TLR7 c.32A&gt;T SNP is responsible for
      a reduce production of IFN-alpha by pDCs after activation of TLR7 by HIV-1 RNA.

      Short abstract  (public dissemination) :

      Male and female display some differences in how their immune system responds to pathogens.
      This could be related to hormonal or genetic factors located on the X chromosome. This
      project aims at characterizing X-linked factors that can influence the innate immune
      response to HIV-1.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) are key actors of innate immunity that produce high
      levels of interferon (IFN)-alpha after activation of their Toll-Like Receptors (TLR) by
      pathogens. A difference between men and women has recently been shown in the level of
      IFN-alpha produced by pDCs after TLR activation. The production of IFN-alpha in response to
      TLR7 activation is higher in the presence of estrogens. This could be responsible for gender
      differences in the level of plasma HIV-1 RNA, that is lower in female as compared to male by
      about 50%, and for the sex-based differences in the susceptibility to HIV infection. Besides
      the role of estrogens, X-linked genetic factors could also be involved in the sex-dependent
      differences in the TLR7-mediated responses of pDCs. TLR7 gene is located on the X
      chromosome. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of the TLR7 gene, c.32A&gt;T, have been
      associated with accelerated disease progression in male HIV patients, and was found over
      represented in female HIV as well as HCV patients, suggesting that the T allele is
      associated with a gender-dependent increase of susceptibility to RNA virus infections. A
      peripheral blood sample will be collected from HIV-infected women and healthy control to
      measure TLR-7 SNP frequency by PCR. IFN-alpha production from pDCs after HIV-1 RNA sensing
      by TLR7 will also be assessed.
