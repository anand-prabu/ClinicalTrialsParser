            "textblock": "11.3% of the population aged 20 years or older (25.6 million individuals) has diabetes.  In\n      the population aged 65 years or older, the prevalence of diabetes reaches to 26.9%.\n\n      Type 2 DM is caused by insulin resistance accompanied by insufficient compensatory insulin\n      response.  Therefore insulin secretagogues are a significant component of the therapeutic\n      armamentarium.  Insulin secretagogues, such as sulphonylureas and meglitinides, are\n      routinely prescribed to lower post prandial glucose levels in type 2 DM.  However, these\n      medications are cleared by the liver and the kidneys and cannot be used in the presence of\n      relevant co-morbidities.  These medicines can also cause side effects, including\n      hypoglycemia.  Limitations of these medicines are likely to lead diabetic patients and their\n      health care providers to seek alternate methods to treat postprandial hyperglycemia.  Thus,\n      our research which aims to identify an alternate insulin secretagogue is important and\n      timely.\n\n      Whey protein (WP), a rich source of essential and branch chain (BC) amino acids (AA), is a\n      potent insulin secretagogue.  Although it is well known that protein and/or AA intakes\n      stimulate insulin secretion, protein supplements are not being used clinically in order to\n      lower post-prandial glycemia. WP can be a satisfactory alternative to the pharmaceutical\n      insulin secretagogues."
