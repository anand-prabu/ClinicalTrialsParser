However, lack of\n      standardization is the major obstacle for any scientific evaluation of any CAM trial.\n      Mucositis is a major complication of irradiation in head and neck (H&N) tumors, the addition\n      of chemotherapy to irradiation may enhance this dose limiting problem. Licorice is a strong\n      demulcent that had been effectively used in treatment of peptic ulcer. The main purpose of\n      this study was to compare the therapeutic safety and efficacy of T. and L. mucoadhesive\n      films on oral mucositis in terms of pain control and/or ulcer treatment.\n\n      Methods and Materials: the study was a double-blind, randomized prospective trial of two\n      types of mucoadhesive films in the management of oral mucositis occurred during head and\n      neck cancer ( HNC ) radiotherapy. oral mucositis was assessed using a quantitative scale\n      (WHO scales) and symptoms were assessed using visual analogue scales (VAS). 60 patients were\n      enrolled in the study; there were 30 patients in the Triamcinolone (T) and 30 in the\n      Licorice (L) group. In the T- group, patients received triamcinolone acetonide mucoadhesive\n      films containing 1mg of the drug and patients in the L- group received licorice mucoadhesive\n      films, an herbal agent. Data were collected at baseline, then twice a week for 4 weeks."
