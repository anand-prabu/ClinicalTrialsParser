            "textblock": "Background: The disruptive symptoms of ADHD caused academic, interpersonal functions\n      impairments and affects about 5% of children. Dysregulation in immunological functions were\n      reported either in the patients with ADHD and other often comorbid neuropsychiatric\n      disorders. Our study is designed to investigate the novel agent, dextromethorphan, with its\n      antiinflammation by neuroprotection in the way to reduce ADHD symptoms and the concurrent\n      conditions like tics, or autistic features.\n\n      Methods: In the first year, we will correlate the cytokine level between the ADHD severity\n      (N=30) and the level of proinflammatory cytokines will be measured with the cytokine protein\n      array. The level of cytokines will be correlated with the severity of symptoms. In the\n      second year,. the patients with ADHD will be randomly divided into two groups treated with\n      dextromethorphan added on methylphenidate (MPH) (N=30) or MPH only (N=30) for 8 weeks. The\n      difference of the presence of good responders between two groups will be analyzed. In\n      addition, we will investigated the correlation between the reduction of cytokine and\n      improvement of severity of ADHD."
