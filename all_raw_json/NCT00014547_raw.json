Determine the duration of\n      response and time to progression in patients treated with this drug. III. Determine the\n      overall survival of patients treated with this drug. IV. Determine the incidence and\n      severity of toxic effects of this drug in this patient population. V. Determine the\n      pharmacokinetics of this drug in this patient population.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to disease\n      (refractory vs sensitive). Patients receive BBR 3464 IV over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment\n      repeats every 21 days for at least 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or\n      unacceptable toxicity. Patients with complete or partial response or stable disease may\n      receive up to 6 courses of therapy. Patients without progressive disease after 6 courses may\n      continue treatment at the investigator's discretion. Patients are followed every 9 weeks for\n      3 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24-74 patients (12-37 per stratum) will be accrued for this\n      study."
