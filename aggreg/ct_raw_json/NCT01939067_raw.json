            "textblock": "Respiratory distress and the need for respiratory support continues to be a common problem\n      for preterm infants. Presence of the breathing tube and duration of respirator provided\n      breaths have been shown to be associated with increased risk for secondary lung injury and\n      subsequent development of chronic lung disease of prematurity. Early application of\n      noninvasive nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP) has been shown to be an\n      effective, non-invasive, mode of respiratory support in preterm infants and to be associated\n      with a lower incidence of chronic lung disease. A recently published large randomized\n      multicenter study concluded that, among infants born at 28 weeks and longer gestation,\n      heated humidified high flow nasal cannula (HHHFNC) had similar clinical efficacy and safety\n      as compared to NCPAP. Both NCPAP and HHHFNC are currently used to assist infants with\n      breathing problems.\n\n      This study is designed to evaluate the effect of HHHFNC as compared to NCPAP on lung\n      function as a measure of lung injury in preterm infants born at 28 to 37 weeks gestation\n      requiring continuing respiratory support. In this study, infants will remain on the assigned\n      treatment of either NCPAP or HHHFNC until they require more support as provided by a\n      respirator or until a treatment cross-over from NCPAP to HHHFNC, or the reverse, as decided\n      by their attending physician. The infant's respiratory support will be managed according to\n      his/her attending doctor as per accepted standards of care. A pulmonary function test will\n      be performed twice weekly on each enrolled infant while receiving either NCPAP or HHHFNC\n      support, followed-up by once weekly lung function measurements post respiratory support\n      while infants are breathing only room air until discharge."
