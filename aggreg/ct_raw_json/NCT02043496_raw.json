This treatment is a type of individual psychotherapy\n      called Integrative Cognitive-Affective Therapy (ICAT) that focuses on helping people change\n      their behaviors, feelings, thoughts about themselves, and relationships.  This new treatment\n      is being compared to an existing treatment called Cognitive-Behavior Therapy-Guided Self\n      Help (CBTgsh), which focuses on changing behavior patterns through the use of reading and\n      homework assignments along with sessions with a therapist.  The primary hypothesis of this\n      investigation is that ICAT will be associated with greater reductions in binge eating at end\n      of treatment and follow-up compared to CBTgsh."
