In this study the investigators will\n      compare women within 2 weeks of delivery to age matched controls and anticipate that pain\n      inhibition is increased after delivery, pain facilitation is decreased, and that there is a\n      relationship between these pain responses and the degree of pre-existing stress."

            "textblock": "Nearly half of the world's population experiences labor and delivery processes which are\n      associated with microscopic or gross tissue injury to the mother.  Since this experience is\n      widespread and occurs relatively early in life, the psychosocial, medical, and financial\n      consequences of chronic pain following childbirth could be enormous.  Surprisingly, previous\n      studies with long term follow up of new mothers have included pain as a secondary measure\n      and / or have focused on prevalence of pain without determining whether pain predated\n      delivery or even pregnancy itself.  The investigators recently performed a long term follow\n      up study of over 1,200 women, and noted that pain which began during the childbirth itself\n      was surprisingly rare in comparison to other physical injuries.  Additionally, two central\n      factors hypothesized to confer risk of chronic pain after other injuries including surgery,\n      pre-dating chronic pain and degree of tissue and nerve injury, contributed minimally to the\n      acute and sub-acute pain after childbirth.  These two observations, low incidence of chronic\n      pain and minimal effect of degree of tissue injury and history of chronic pain on sub-acute\n      pain, point towards a potential protective effect of pregnancy or delivery on the response\n      to physical injury."
