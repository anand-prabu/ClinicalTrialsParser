This international cross-sectional\n      study follows on from the publication of large-scale randomized controlled trials and\n      meta-analyses of fluid resuscitation, which provide evidence of how fluid resuscitation may\n      affect patient-centered outcomes.\n\n      Fluid-TRIPS is a repeat of the Saline versus Albumin for Fluid Evaluation (SAFE)-TRIPS which\n      was an international cross-sectional survey conducted in 2007 that had 391 ICU's participate\n      from 25 countries and provided insight into international fluid resuscitation practice at\n      that time. Along with establishing if fluid resuscitation practices have changed since\n      SAFE-TRIPS, Fluid-TRIPS also aims to determine the relationship between fluid choice and\n      evidence, along with understand other factors that may influence the choice of bolus fluid\n      in clinical practice."
