Stable or responding patients may receive a second\n      treatment 1 month later.\n\n      Cohorts of 1 or 3 patients receive escalating doses of bispecific antibody MDX447 and\n      activated monocytes until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined\n      as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 patients experience dose limiting toxicities.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 13 patients will be accrued for this study."
