      The purpose of this trial is to investigate the effect of dairy products on the so called
      metabolic syndrome. Metabolic syndrome is a cluster of risk factors, such as high blood
      pressure and high cholesterol, for the development of diabetes and heart disease.
      Participants will be randomly assigned to either eat a portion of a Norwegian traditional
      cheese which is high in protein and low in fat (group 1), or eat a slightly higher than
      normal intake of regular Gouda-type cheese (group 2), or to limit their intake of cheese
      (group 3).

      Dairy products are a significant source of bioactive peptides, small pieces of protein which
      may have an effect on our health. These effects may be antimicrobial, antioxidative, or
      blood pressure lowering. The traditional Norwegian cheese, Gamalost, which is naturally high
      in protein (50%) and low in fat (&lt;1%), has been found to be particularly high in these
      bioactive peptides. Specifically, the cheese was found to have a very high ACE-inhibitory
      activity, meaning it has the potential to lower blood pressure without the use of
      pharmaceuticals.

      A pilot study was performed in May 2012. No intervention was given in this trial, but
      participants answered an extensive questionnaire about dietary habits and lifestyle. This
      trial found that the people who ate the most Gamalost had a slightly lower blood pressure
      than those that did not eat the cheese. Since that was just a point-in-time study with no
      intervention or control, the investigators are not able to say anything certain about cause
      and effect, which is why the investigators want to perform this larger controlled study.

      In total, the investigators aim to recruit 300 people to participate in this trial, i.e. 100
      in each group. The participants will be randomly placed in one of the groups and they will
      have to do the intervention for eight weeks. At inclusion, the investigators measure blood
      pressure, fasting blood glucose, weight, height, waist circumference, and the investigators
      draw a fasting blood sample to measure cholesterol. The same measurements will be repeated
      at the end of the eight weeks. At inclusion they will also fill out an extensive
      questionnaire about their diet and lifestyle. A shorter version of the same questionnaire
      will also be given at the end of the trial period.

      The overall goal of the study is to assess the effect of dairy products on the metabolic
      syndrome, but the main hypothesis is to assess whether a high intake of Gamalost can reduce
      blood pressure in a group of people.
