Part of this effect is thought to be due to the flavonoid content\n      of these foods although it is currently unknown which flavonoids play a role. Epicatechin is\n      one the major flavonoids in cocoa while quercetin is largely found in tea.\n\n      During this study the investigators plan to investigate the effects of pure epicatechin and\n      quercetin supplementation on vascular function and blood pressure in untreated\n      (prehypertensive) subjects by way of a three-armed double-blind crossover intervention.\n      Participants will sequentially consume supplements containing quercetin, epicatechin or\n      placebo for a period of 4 weeks. Before and after this 4 week period, measurements of\n      vascular function and blood pressure will be taken.\n\n      The investigators hypothesize that the supplementation of epicatechin and quercetin will\n      improve vascular function and blood pressure."
