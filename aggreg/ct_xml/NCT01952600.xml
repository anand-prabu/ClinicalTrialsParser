  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The EPOCH-RRT study seeks to fill knowledge gaps by gaining more understanding of chronic
      kidney disease (CKD) patients' priorities; assessing the comparative benefits of
      hemodialysis (HD) versus peritoneal dialysis (PD), with respect to these priorities; and
      providing tailored information to assist patients with identifying the best dialysis
      modality fit for their own unique circumstances and perspectives.

      The outcomes most relevant to patients (&quot;patient-centered&quot;) extend beyond those
      traditionally assessed in clinical research, with the relative importance varying across
      patient groups. A tailored decision aid based on these findings can improve patient
      decision-making processes regarding choice of dialysis modality.

      Empowering Patients On Choices for Renal Replacement Therapy (EPOCH-RRT)study  seeks to
      identify factors that matter the most to patients with kidney disease and study how they are
      impacted by different types of dialysis. The inclusion of patients, caregivers, and patient
      advocacy organizations as research partners will assure that the study addresses questions
      of greatest relevance to patients facing the need for dialysis.

      Aim One of EPOCH-RRT identifies outcomes that are most important to different groups of
      advanced CKD and dialysis patients through qualitative methods applied for conducting
      in-depth interviews.
