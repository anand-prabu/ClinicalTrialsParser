            "textblock": "Otitis media is a ubiquitous disease in young children which can persist through\n      adolescence, and arise or recur in adults. A consequence of an infection and/or Eustachian\n      tube dysfunction, it manifests as an effusion that disrupts the normal impedance matching\n      function of tympanic membrane-ossicular chain system. Eustachian tube dysfunction prevents\n      the equilibration of middle ear pressures and drainage of the accumulated effusion. It is\n      thought that middle ear status modulates the function of the Eustachian tube via afferent\n      signals processed centrally resulting in changes in its tonus or muscular function. This\n      pilot study of right-handed 21-35 year olds of either sex will validate a published fMRI\n      method for visualizing cortical brain activation in response to external ear canal pressure\n      changes (N=5). The outcome measure is intensity changes of the cortex associated with\n      applied stimuli."
