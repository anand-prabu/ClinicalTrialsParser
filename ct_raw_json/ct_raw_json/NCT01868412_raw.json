The objective of this prospective,\n      randomized and controlled clinical trial is to investigate healing rate and healing time of\n      surgical wounds in patients, who have undergone peripheral vascular surgery, and whose\n      complicated wounds are candidate for topical treatment with the resin or honey. In addition,\n      factors contributing with delayed wound healing, antimicrobial properties, safety and\n      cost-effectiveness of the resin salve and medical honey will be analyzed."
