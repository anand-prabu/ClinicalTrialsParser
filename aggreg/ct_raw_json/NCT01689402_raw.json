Today MRI-scan is normally done 3-4 weeks after symptom onset but very little is\n      known about the early use of MRI to detect underlying pathology. This would allow an early\n      intervension and less uncertainty for the patients.\n\n      We further want to investigate the metabolic penumbra-zone surrounding the hematoma. It is\n      the current perception in the litterature that this zone represent a metabolic zone marked\n      by apoptosis and inflammation rather than ischemia.\n\n      We are planning to:\n\n      When patients arrive in our stroke department they will within 7 hours be subject to MRI\n      scan with the protocoled sequences. Standard sequences: Axial T2, axial DWI, Sagittal T1, T2\n      flair og axial GRE-sequence.\n\n      Susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI)\n\n      Chemical Shift Imaging (CSI) multivoxel spectroscopi\n\n      Post contrast 3D box reconstruction\n\n      After 8 weeks the patients are subject to another MRI-Scan in accordance with the standard\n      clinical guideline to rule out underlying pathology.\n\n      After 3 month the patients are seen in the outpatient-clinic to follow-up evaluation.\n\n      To sum up the purpose of this present study is to conduct a pilot investigation of MRI in\n      the early evaluation of ICH-patients. Second it is our intension to use multivoxel magnetic\n      resonance spectroscopy to study the metabolic penumbra-zone surrounding the ICH."
