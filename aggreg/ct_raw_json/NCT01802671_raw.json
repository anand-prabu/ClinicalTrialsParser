However the effect sizes are still modest and there is room for\n      improvement. A way to progress in this line is enhancing treatment adherence and\n      self-management by means of information and communication technologies (ICT). The objective\n      of this study is to investigate the short- and long-term efficacy of a Cognitive Behavioural\n      Treatment (CBT) group program for CLBP supported versus non-supported by ICTs. A secondary\n      objective is to evaluate the influence of relevant variables in treatment response. Possible\n      barriers in the implementation of CBT with and without ICT will be also investigated.\n\n      Methods: A randomized controlled trail with 180 CLBP patients recruited in specialized care\n      will be conducted. Participants will be randomly assigned to three conditions: Control group\n      (CG), Cognitive Behavioural program (CBT), and CBT supported by ICTs (CBT + ICT).\n      Participants belonging to the three conditions will receive a conventional rehabilitation\n      program (back school). The CBT group program will last six sessions. The CBT + ICT will use\n      the Internet and SMS in order to practice the therapeutic strategies between sessions and in\n      the follow-ups in their homes. Primary outcome variables are self-reported disability and\n      pain intensity. Assessment will be carried out by blinded assessors in five moments:\n      pre-treatment, post-treatment and 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up. The influence of\n      catastrophizing, fear-avoidance beliefs, anxiety and depression in response to treatment in\n      the primary outcomes will be also analysed.\n\n      Discussion This study will show data of the possible benefits of the use of ICTs in the\n      improvement of CBT for the treatment of CLBP"
