These patients are treated commonly, and followed up for one year. We check\n           out all the cardiovascular events, linked to atherothrombosis.Two groups of patients\n           might be formed:\n\n             -  The first group is composed of all diabetic patients, with chronic Kidney disease\n                (CKD). CKD is defined by albuminuria (micro or macroalbuminuria) and/or renal\n                failure, present for more than 3 months . All the patients with CKD are considered\n                to be \"exposed\" to atherothrombotic events.\n\n             -  The second group is composed of all diabetic patients, without CKD. This group is\n                considered to be \"not exposed\" to the atherothrombotic events.\n\n      We will compare the two groups, on occurence of cardiovascular events,after adjustment of\n      age and  major cardiovascular risk factors, and after excluding patients 'not exposed'\n      having had a prior treatment with conversion enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor\n      antagonist .\n\n        -  The size of the sample is calculated with statistical formula:\n\n           n= E2 Po Qo / i2 n= size of the sample E= 1.96 with error risk : alpha= 5% Po= 30% Qo=\n           1-Po \"n\"  is at least egal to 323 patients\n\n        -  Statistical analysis is performed with epi info 6.04b and all tests are performed with\n           an error risk alpha= 5%\n\n             -  Descriptive statistics of patients characteristics:\n\n                  -  For quantitative variables,we will calculate means,standard deviations,\n                     median and quantiles.\n\n                  -  for qualitative variables, percentage will be calculated.\n\n             -  Comparative statistics according to existence of renal disease or not\n\n                  -  Chi-square test is performed for qualitative variables\n\n                  -  Student test: for two means comparison\n\n                  -  Anova test: to compare more than two means\n\n             -  Multivariate analysis will be done on SPSS v: 21 software program,  adjustment\n                will be done for age, sexe and  major cardiovascular risk factors."
