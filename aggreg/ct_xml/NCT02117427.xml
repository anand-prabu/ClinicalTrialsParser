      The objectives of this study are to assess safety and to evaluate the biologic activity of
      EPODURE treatment.

      This is a Phase I-II, open-label study. Each patient will receive targeted dose of EPO
      delivered via EPODURE Biopumps. The targeted doses will be determined according to 3 cohorts
      as follows: Group A (18-25 IU/Kg/day), Group B (35-45 IU/Kg/day), Group C (55-65 IU/Kg/day).
      The objective is to evaluate safety and biologic activity of EPODURE treatment when
      maintaining Hb levels within the target range of 9-11 g/dl. Biological activity assessments
      will include duration of EPODURE secretion as measured by serum EPO levels above baseline
