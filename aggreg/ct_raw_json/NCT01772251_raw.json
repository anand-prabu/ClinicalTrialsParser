            "textblock": "Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic disease of carbohydrate, fat, and protein metabolism\n      caused by an absolute or relative deficiency of insulin, an anabolic hormone. The current\n      methods of insulin therapy for diabetic patients are multiple daily injection therapy and\n      continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion with an external pump. This rout of administration\n      may lead to hyperinsulinemia as insulin is administered in a non physiological way,\n      targeting mainly extra hepatic tissues (muscle, fat).\n\n      A method of providing insulin without the need for injections has been a goal in drug\n      delivery.\n\n      Oshadi Drug Administration Ltd. has developed oral carrier for proteins based on\n      biochemistry and quantum theory of biochemical reactions. The carrier enables the absorption\n      of proteins from the gastrointestinal tract in their full structure. Oshadi has also\n      developed the Oshadi Icp - insulin, proinsulin and C-peptide in Oshadi carrier,\n      administrated orally. This study was design in order to evaluate the safety and feasibility\n      of multiple administration of Oshadi Icp"
