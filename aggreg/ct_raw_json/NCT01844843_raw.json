            "textblock": "Purpose of this study is to evaluate, after implantation of a drug eluting stent (DES),\n      coverage of the stent struts by new tissue. The evaluation will be performed by means of\n      intravascular imaging technology (optical frequency domain imaging, OFDI). Renewed tissue\n      coverage over the implanted stent struts prevents direct contact between blood and\n      metal/polymer, which could lead to adverse events: patients need to take blood-thinning\n      drugs to prevent these events. Ous new stent has drug and polymer only on the outside of the\n      stent, and the polymer is degraded by the body leaving a bare metal stent after 3-4 months.\n      This should allow fast coverage of the struts, and might allow to reduce duration of the\n      supportive medical treatment. Our hypothesis is that <20% of the struts remain uncovered at\n      3 months after implantation, as assessed by OFDI."
