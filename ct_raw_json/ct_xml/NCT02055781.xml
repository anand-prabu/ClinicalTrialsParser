  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary hypothesis of the study is that treatment with either once-daily or twice-daily
      pacritinib results in a greater proportion of patients with thrombocytopenia and
      myelofibrosis achieving ≥ 35% reduction in spleen volume from baseline to Week 24 than
      treatment with Best Available Therapy, and a greater proportion of patients achieving a ≥
      50% reduction in total symptom score from baseline to Week 24 as measured by the
      Myeloproliferative Neoplasm Symptom Assessment Form 2.0.

    <description>To compare the efficacy of two dose-schedule arms of pacritinib (pooled once-daily and twice-daily dosing arms) with that of Best Available Therapy in patients with thrombocytopenia and primary myelofibrosis, post-polycythemia vera myelofibrosis, or post-essential thrombocythemia myelofibrosis; the efficacy measure for this analysis is the proportion of patients achieving a ≥ 35% reduction in spleen volume from baseline to week 24 by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) and the proportion of patients achieving  a ≥ 50% reduction in total symptom score from baseline to Week 24 as measured by the Myeloproliferative Neoplasm Symptom Assessment Form 2.0.</description>

    <description>Best Available Therapy includes any physician-selected treatment for primary myelofibrosis, post-polycythemia vera myelofibrosis, or post-essential thrombocythemia myelofibrosis, such as approved JAK2 inhibitors, and may include any treatment received before study entry. Best Available Therapy may include ruxolitinib, other approved JAK2 inhibitors, hydroxyurea, glucocorticoids, erythropoietic agents, immunomodulatory agents, mercaptopurine, danazol, interferons, cytarabine, melphalan, or other agents and may also include no treatment and symptom-directed treatment without myelofibrosis-specific treatment.</description>
