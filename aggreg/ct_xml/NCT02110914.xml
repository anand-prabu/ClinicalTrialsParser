  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The treatment burden for patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) is significant and poor
      adherence has been well-documented. The investigators hypothesize that a health coaching
      intervention will empower young adults with CF to manage their lives with CF and improve
      health-related quality of life (HRQoL).  The main aim of the study is to establish the
      feasibility and acceptability of a Motivational Interviewing based coaching-intervention.

    <description>The primary effect outcome is change in health-related quality of life (HRQoL), with special focus on the two domains: Social and Emotional functioning on the Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R).
For the intervention group HRQoL is measured at baseline, midway (after 5 coaching sessions), post intervention (after 10 coaching sessions) and at follow up (12 months post intervention) For the control group HRQoL is measured at baseline, midway (after 4 months), post intervention (after 9 months) and at follow up (12 months post intervention)</description>
