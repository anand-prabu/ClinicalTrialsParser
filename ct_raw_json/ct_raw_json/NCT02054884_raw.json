            "textblock": "F16IL2 has been studied in two clinical pase I/II trials in patients with different advanced\n      cancer types. One of them (Nr. EudraCT: 2007-006457-42) tested the administration of\n      therapeutic doses of paclitaxel (up to 90 mg/m2 on a weekly basis) together with escalating\n      doses of F16IL2 (from 5 Mio IU of IL2 equivalents in a weekly administration schedule, until\n      definition of MTD). More than 40 patients were treated in this clinical trial. As of today,\n      the highest F16IL2 dose tested corresponds to 45 Mio IU, but the dose escalataion of the\n      F16IL2/paclitaxel combination study is still ongoing.\n\n      In general, treatment of patients with F16IL2 plus paclitaxel was very well  tolerated not\n      exceeding the expected toxicity of chemotherapy alone. Multiple  objective and durable tumor\n      responses were observed in the F16IL2/paclitaxel  combination trial(particularly in patients\n      with non small cell lung cancer or melanoma who had previously failed several lines of\n      chemotherapy). In addition  to several disease stabilizations of previously progressive\n      patients.\n\n      Paclitaxel promotes the assembly of microtubules from tubulin dimers and stabilizes\n      microtubules by preventing depolymerisation. This stability results in the inhibition of the\n      normal reorganization of the microtubule network that is essential for vital interphase and\n      mitotic cellular functions. In addition, paclitaxel reduces abnormal arrays or bundles of\n      microtubules throughout the cell cycle and multiple asters of microtubules during mitosis.\n\n      F16 is a human recombinant antibody fragment in the scFv (single chain Fragment variable)\n      format that is directed against tenascin C, an angiogenesis marker common to most solid\n      tumors independent of the tumor type. ScFv(F16) selectively localizes in tumor tissues in\n      animal models as demonstrated both histologically and during mechanistic studies involving\n      mice transfected with orthotopic human tumours.\n\n      IL2, the human cytokine interleukin-2, is a potent stimulator of the immune response. It has\n      a central role in the regulation of T cell responses and effects on other immune cells such\n      as natural killer cells, B cells, monocyte/macrophages and neutrophils (Smith, 1988). IL2\n      can induce tumor regression through its ability to stimulate a potent cell-mediated immune\n      response in vivo (Rosenberg, 2000)."
