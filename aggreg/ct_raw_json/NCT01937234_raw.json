Avoiding  a long , protracted  labor  entails  shorter  exposure  to pain\n      anxiety and stress and  would  translate  into a major  improvement  in  maternal\n      satisfaction  with  the child  birth  experience.\n\n      The  purpose  of  this  study  is  to  determine  the  effectiveness  of  metoclopramide\n      for  reducing  the  duration  of  spontaneous labor  among  nulliparous  women  managed\n      according  to a standard  intrapartum  protocol."

Record of group allocation will be maintained by a resident physician\n      whose responsibility is randomization and drawing up the injection, but has no direct\n      involvement in the intrapartum decision making.\n\n      After through history and physical examination, each participant will take the selected\n      medication slowly IV over 2 min, the assigned medication will be repeated every two hours\n      for a maximum of three doses.\n\n      Monitoring of fetal well-being and labor progress with Partographic representation   will be\n      performed.\n\n      Management of labor will be according the labor and delivery standard protocol, if labor\n      dilatation will not progress appropriately, i.e. cervical dilatation rate of <1cm/hour,\n      amniotomy will be performed if membranes are intact. Oxytocin augmentation  will  be\n      considered after rupture of membranes only if  the  cervix  remains unchanged  on  two\n      consecutive  pelvic  examination  conducted  two hours  apart. Oxytocin  infusion  will\n      start  with  5mIU/min  and  increase  by  5mIU/min  every  15min  to achieve  seven\n      contractions  in 15 min, the maximal  rate of  oxytocin  being  30Miu/min.\n\n      The following  parameters  will be  recorded for every patient:\n\n        -  Timing of metoclopramide or placebo  injections\n\n        -  Timing of  full  dilatation  of cervix\n\n        -  Duration of first stage of labor\n\n        -  Duration of second stage of labor\n\n        -  Duration of third stage of labor\n\n        -  Mode  of delivery\n\n        -  Injection  to delivery  interval\n\n        -  Cervical dilatation rate\n\n        -  Neonatal  condition  at birth"
