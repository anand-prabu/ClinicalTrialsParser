            "textblock": "DLBCL is an aggressive malignant disease which evolves from B-cells and affects mainly the\n      lymphatic tissue. Due to its aggressive nature the disease is characterized by a fast course\n      which is lethal without therapy. Potentially curative therapy options are available even at\n      advanced stages. Standard-first line leads to a high initial response rate (85-90%) and an\n      approximate cure rate of 50% of patients. Patients refractory to or with early relapse after\n      this treatment (10-15%) have a very poor prognosis.\n\n      Blinatumomab is a bispecific single-chain antibody derivative against CD19 and CD3, designed\n      to link B-cells and T-cells resulting in T-cell activation and a cytotoxic T-cell response\n      against CD19 expressing cells. In vitro data indicate CD19+ lymphoma and leukemia cell lines\n      to be extremely sensitive to blinatumomab-mediated cytotoxicity. A phase 1 study (MT103-104)\n      has indicated dose-dependent efficacy and acceptable tolerability of blinatumomab in\n      patients with relapsed B-cell Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (B-NHL).\n\n      The purpose of this study is to confirm wether the bispecific T-cell engager blinatumomab is\n      effective and safe in the treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory Diffuse Large\n      B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL). The patients will be treated with 2 different dosing schedules of\n      continuous intravenous blinatumomab treatment .\n\n      Patients will receive up to 2 cycles (first cycle 8 weeks, second cycle 4 weeks."
