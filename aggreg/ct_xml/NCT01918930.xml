    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to gain a better understanding about how the study drug MGA271
      works. No test drug will be given in this study. Patients with easily accessible tumors at
      the screening visit for participation in Study CP-MGA271-01 will be asked to participate in
      this substudy. Patients will undergo two excisional biopsies, punch biopsies, or core needle
      biopsies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with easily accessible tumors (generally, metastatic deposits involving skin,
      subcutaneous tissues, or peripheral lymph node whose excision would not require general
      anaesthesia or the invasion of a body cavity) at the screening visit for participation in
      Study CP-MGA271-01 (the main study) will be asked to participate in this substudy. After
      providing appropriate informed consent, patients will undergo excisional biopsy, punch
      biopsy, or core needle biopsy of the accessible tumor prior to receiving study drug in the
      main study and then again after the first cycle of study drug is completed.

      Some of the biopsy tissue will be sent to a central laboratory for research purposes. The
      central lab will analyze the tissue to see what effects that the study drug might have on
      tumors.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Qualified, by meeting all inclusion and exclusion criteria, for participation in
             Study CP-MGA271-01.

          -  Must have provided informed consent to participate in Study CP-MGA271-01.

          -  Must have accessible tumors (generally speaking, metastatic deposits involving skin,
             subcutaneous tissue, or peripheral lymph node whose excision, punch biopsy, or core
             needle biopsy would not require general anaesthesia or the invasion of a body
             cavity).

          -  Willing to undergo two minor surgical procedures with no expectation of personal
             benefit

          -  Have provided Informed Consent for this substudy as indicated by a signature on an
             approved consent document obtained from the patient or his/her legally authorized
             representative

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any medical condition that would contraindicate the use of local or locoregional
             anaesthesia, or conscious sedation for the intended minor surgical procedure.

          -  Any medical condition (eg. skin disease or bleeding diathesis) that would hinder
             wound healing following a minor surgical procedure.

          -  Dementia or altered mental status that would preclude understanding and rendering of
             informed consent.
