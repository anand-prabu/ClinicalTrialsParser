Drivers experience pain in the forearms due to increased blood\n      pressure in forearm muscle compartments. No strategies nor methods have been used to\n      diminish the risk to suffer from arm pump within motor cross.\n\n      This project aims to look at ergonomics of driving and its relationship with the occurrence\n      of arm pump.\n\n      The investigators will first investigate the experience of motor cross athletes with arm\n      pump through motor cross federations in Belgium and The Netherlands (survey).\n\n      Two groups of athletes will be selected (20 persons within each group) who will be invited\n      to the motor cross track to investigate their hand grip strength, motor driving position,\n      muscle activity."
