Despite the availability of effective antibiotic therapy\n      for otitis media, treatment failures, persistent effusions, and recurrences are common. This\n      Phase III outpatient study aims to test whether adjuvant therapy (an antihistamine or a\n      corticosteroid), in addition to antibiotic therapy, improves the acute and long-term\n      outcomes of patients with acute otitis media. This study is targeted to recruiting 200\n      infants (age less than one year); patient (and parent) participation is estimated to\n      continue for one year after enrollment."
