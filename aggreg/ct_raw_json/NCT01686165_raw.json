Studies in the\n      laboratory suggest that drugs such as PXD101 can act upon specific cancer cell processes to\n      cause either death of the cancer cells or prevention of their growth. In human studies with\n      a small number of patients with this lymphoma, PXD-101 has shown the ability to shrink and\n      slow tumor growth. When Zevalin is delivered directly to the tumor, the lymphoma cells are\n      destroyed and this may result in the disappearance of the tumor (remission)"
