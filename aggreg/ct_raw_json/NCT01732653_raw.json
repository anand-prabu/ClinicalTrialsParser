All\n      subjects will be trained 3 times a week for 6 weeks, each session will last approximately 45\n      minutes.Training progression will be based on increasing both motor and cognitive\n      challenges, individualized to the participant's level of performance.\n\n      Primary outcome measures:\n\n      The primary outcome measure of the study is fall rate for 6 months post intervention.\n      Secondary outcome measures will include gait speed and gait variability under usual and dual\n      task conditions and while negotiating physical obstacles will be measured. Endurance will be\n      assessed using the 2 Minute Walk Test and mobility will be assessed using the Four Square\n      Step Test (FSST), The Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) and the mini-Balance\n      Evaluation Systems Test (mini-BESTest). Community ambulation will be assessed using a\n      tri-axial accelerometer ('Axivity' Ltd.)which will be worn by the participants for 7 days.\n      Cognitive function will be assessed using a computerized neuropsychological test battery\n      (Mindstreams, 'NeuroTrax' Corp., NJ) as well as standardized neuropsychological tests\n      (Montreal Cognitive Assessment,The Trail Making Test; Verbal Fluency).
