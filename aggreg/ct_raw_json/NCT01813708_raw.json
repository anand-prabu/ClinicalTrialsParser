No age limits.\n\n      Exclusion criteria: Psychosis or personality disorders, other illnesses thought to be fatal\n      in 6 months or less (e.g. AIDS, liver Cirrhosis, etc), unable to read and write, and\n      currently taking other drugs that impair blood glucose metabolism, such as glucocorticoids.\n      Patients unable to perform physical activity because of other neurological, orthopedic or\n      rheumatological conditions, patients on drug treatment for depression or obesity.  Patients\n      with alcohol or other drug dependencies, and being a relative of a patient already included\n      in the study.\n\n      Patients will be randomly assigned to either intervention and will not be told to which\n      intervention he/she was assigned.\n\n      The Intensive intervention is structured in 16 sessions to be held every week for groups of\n      up to 15 patients in family medicine clinics in Mexico City.  This includes healthy\n      nutrition and physical activity plus behavioural modification techniques; the treatment\n      goals will be instituted by the case manager (lowering body weight by 5% 10%, and increasing\n      physical activity to 150 minutes/week).\n\n      The Educational Collaborative group will attend 16 weekly sessions where  nutritional and\n      physical activity will also be discussed, along with knowledge about diabetes and its\n      treatment. Behavioural modification techniques are included in the curricula but the\n      treatment goals will be selected by the patients themselves.\n\n      Blood samples will be drawn from an antecubital vein before the program starts and every 3\n      months thereafter. Measurements will include: A1c, glucose, total cholesterol, LDL, HDL\n      cholesterol and triglycerides.  Furthermore, body weight and abdominal girdle will be\n      measured by a trained nurse observer who does not know the patient's group allocation.\n      Questionnaires for physical activity, quality of life, psychological well-being and\n      self-efficacy will be answered by patients every 3 months.\n\n      The statistical analysis will be conducted as an intention-to-treat analysis, and will\n      include comparison of proportions of patients attaining treatment goals, adjusted by age,\n      sex, BMI, and base-line values with logistic regression; continuous variables will be\n      analyzed with Analysis of Covariance."
