Our randomised,\n      controlled, double-blinded trial aims to evaluate efficacy of continuous wound infiltration\n      after major spine surgery.\n\n      Methods : After written consent is obtained, the surgeon inserts, at the end of surgery, a\n      multiholes catheter under muscular layers. Patients are randomised in two groups : The\n      \"treated group\" receives ropivacaine 0.2% infusion (bolus of 10 milliliters (mL) followed by\n      8 mL/h continuous infusion during 48 hours) and the \"control group\" receives saline solution\n      (0.9%). In addition, all patients receive patient-controlled intra-venous morphine\n      analgesia. The investigators hypothesize that the \"treated group\" will consume morphine less\n      than the \"control group\"."
