      RATIONALE: Placing a gene that has been created in the laboratory into white blood cells may
      make the body build an immune response to kill cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying genetically engineered lymphocyte therapy in
      treating patients with B-cell leukemia or lymphoma that is resistant or refractory to
      chemotherapy.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the safety and feasibility of the chimeric antigen receptor T cells transduced
      with the anti-CD20 vector (referred to as CART-20 cells).

      II. Determine duration of in vivo survival of CART-20 cells. RT-PCR analysis of whole blood
      will be used to detect and quantify survival of CART-20 TCR zeta:4-1BB and TCR zeta cells
      over time.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. For patients with detectable disease, measure anti-tumor response due to CART-20 cell
      infusions.

      II. To determine if the 4-1BB transgene is superior to the TCR zeta only transgene as
      measured by the relative engraftment levels of CART-20 TCR zeta:4-1BB and TCR zeta cells
      over time.

      III. Estimate relative trafficking of CART-20 cells to tumor in bone marrow and lymph nodes.

      IV. For patients with stored or accessible tumor cells (such as patients with active CLL,
      ALL, etc) determine tumor cell killing by CART-20 cells in vitro.

      V. Determine if cellular or humoral host immunity develops against the murine anti-CD20, and
      assess correlation with loss of detectable CART-20 (loss of engraftment).

      VI. Determine the relative subsets of CART-20 T cells (Tcm, Tem, and Treg).

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 groups according to order of enrollment.

      Group 1 (Patients 1-5): Patients receive anti-CD20-CAR  vector-transduced autologous T cells
      with 41BB-gamma vector on days 0,1, 2, and 11 in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Group 2 (Patients 6-10): Patients receive anti-CD20-CAR vector-transduced autologous T cells
      with either 41BB-gamma vector or TCR zeta vector on days 0,1, 2, and 11 in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed intensively for 6 months, every 3
      months for 2 years, and annually thereafter for 13 years.
