The epidemiology\n      of many end-organ toxicities has been described, yet the pathophysiologic mechanisms of\n      injury are incompletely understood.  One mechanism may be damage to the circulatory system,\n      in particular the endothelial layer, initiating an inflammatory state leading to dysfunction\n      and premature atherosclerotic disease.  This process may begin and significantly progress in\n      a sub-clinical nature for many years prior to manifesting as a cardio- or cerebrovascular\n      event.  Using established and novel biomarkers predictive of atherosclerotic disease\n      combined with unique measurements of vascular function, this study will assess pre-clinical\n      vascular disease in a population of childhood and adolescent cancer survivors.  The goals of\n      this project are to investigate the effects of cancer therapy on the vascular system and\n      acquire new knowledge with which to risk-stratify survivors and plan interventional studies\n      to prevent or reduce premature vascular morbidity and mortality."
