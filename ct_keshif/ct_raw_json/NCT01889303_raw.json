Docetaxel plus cisplatin regimen\n      as adjuvant chemotherapy for gastric cancer has been proofed Safe and Effective in many\n      clinical trials about gastric cancer. The purpose of this study is to evaluate efficacy and\n      safety of docetaxel plus cisplatin regimen as adjuvant chemotherapy and concurrent\n      chemoradiotherapy regimen compared with classical FOLFOX6 regimen as adjuvant chemotherapy\n      and 5-FU/CF as chemoradiotherapy in patients of locally advanced gastric cancer after D2\n      radical surgery.
