A phone interview at 2 months\n      and a visit with a psychologist at four months after ICU discharge are specific to the\n      study.\n\n      The main objective of this study is to make a first estimate of the percentage of patients\n      (CI = +- 10%) with cognitive impairment at four months after ICU discharge. The presence /\n      absence of cognitive impairment will be determined by the D2 test."
