  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Even 20-50% of patients under sedation and mechanical ventilation develops myopathy and / or
      neuropathy which difficulties both the process of extubation and the functional recovery.
      The objective of this project is to analyze the effect of muscle electrostimulation (ESM) on
      muscle weakness acquired in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and its consequences. Study design: a
      single center, prospective, randomized trial to be held in the ICU of &quot; Universitarian
      hospital La Fe&quot;  in collaboration with the service of Neurophysiology of the hospital. All
      patients undergoing sedation and mechanical ventilation (with an expected duration longer
      than 48h) and without any of the exclusion criteria detailed in the Methodology section will
      be included in the study. The intervention will consist of a muscular electrostimulation
      with the Super Pro Excel 70,UltratoneTM. The stimulation will be performed in 10 muscle
      groups (5 per side) following established protocols, at least 5 days a week.  We will
      evaluate muscle strength by Medical Research Council scale, functional capacity  by  Barthel
      scale and Neurophaty Disability Scale,  all clinical events will be collected and
      electrophysiologic, echographic and histologic parameters will be measured. The process of
      extubation will be performed following an established protocol, the duration will be
      collected as the same manner as ICU.
