This study\n      uses a simple validated measure of brain atrophy as a surrogate marker in a repurposing\n      effort that could recast an antihypertensive medication as a cognitive enhancer\n      /neuroprotective agent and possibly as a drug of choice for Alzheimer patients and patients\n      at risk for AD. If the proof of concept result is positive, a larger study would be\n      warranted with potential practice-changing impact."
