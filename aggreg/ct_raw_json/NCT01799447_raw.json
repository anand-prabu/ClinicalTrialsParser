Intervention study in a community setting\n\n      Background Infants develop their mentality, social and psychologically competencies in\n      relations with parents and sensitive and responsive caregiving is important for infant's\n      healthy development. Maternal responsiveness defined as the mother's ability to recognise\n      infant's cues and act on those is a key to promote a secure child. At risk are\n      unsecure/uncertain mothers, postpartum depressed mothers, mothers with preterm children and\n      infants who in the perspective of the mother cries persistent and/or does not sleep well.\n\n      Danish public health nurses do home-visiting parents and they have opportunity to support\n      parents in the development of relations to the infants. Some nurse's uses video-guidance\n      with the Marte Meo method to promote the development of a healthy parent-infant relations,\n      but knowledge about the effect of parent's having received video-guidance with the method is\n      lacking.\n\n      Study part 1 Aim: To develop a screening tool to help public health nurses to identify\n      unsecure mothers.\n\n      Design: Intervention Mapping step 1. Need assessment and development of few questions as a\n      screening tool. Test of questions by face and content validation.\n\n      Study part 2 Develop a standardised preventive program step 2-4 in Intervention Mapping. The\n      intervention is done by public health nurses, in home visits to first times mothers in the\n      period from the child 2 to 6 months aged. The intervention includes 2-5 home visits with\n      video-guidance's and has focus on the mother's ability to recognise infant's cues and act on\n      those.\n\n      Excluded are families at sever risk who have been referred to treatment by psychiatric,\n      psychological or social apartment.\n\n      Study 3 Test the program. Goal: to promote mothers parental self-efficacy, minimise mother's\n      stress and mother's depressive mood. To promote infants social competences and promote\n      mothers responsiveness and interaction with the infant.\n\n      Design: Quasi-experimental design. The intervention within 5 municipals with 34\n      \"interventions public health nurses\" (having a 1 \u00bd year educations as a Marte Meo therapist)\n      and 80 \"control public health nurses\" who works as usually. The intervention group will\n      include 150 families and they will be matches with 150 families from the control groups.\n\n      Test: All first times mothers in the 5 municipals, when the children are 8 weeks old and\n      after the intervention has stopped, when the children are 6 months old.\n\n      Test: All public health nurses when the interventions start and when the intervention stops."
