In addition, these patients are at increased risk of\n             lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies\n             will be undertaken in patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when\n             indicated.\n\n          -  Patients with any standard contraindication to chemotherapy or radiation therapy are\n             ineligible.\n\n          -  Transplant recipient patients on immune-suppressant agents are ineligible due to\n             increased risk of infection."
