At baseline all study subjects will be assessed by\n      clinical examination, imaging of the shoulder by x-ray and sonography and by the self-report\n      section of the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score (ASES). Follow-up will be\n      performed after 1 and 4 weeks (score only), 3 (clinical, score, ultrasound, x-ray), 6 and 12\n      months (score only), and after 24 months (clinical, score, ultrasound, x-ray). Patients with\n      insufficient treatment effect will be offered physiotherapy, re-lavage or surgical treatment\n      by acromioplasty.\n\n      Purpose of the study: The investigators want to find out\n\n        -  if shoulder function, measured by a shoulder score, will increase during follow-up\n\n        -  how much of the calcific material can be aspirated (in ml)\n\n        -  to which extend the calcific deposit disappears on x-rays and sonographic images\n\n        -  how many patients will need surgical treatment"
