      Background:

        -  Inflammatory pustular skin diseases are a type of autoinflammatory disease in which the
           immune system attacks the body   s tissues. These diseases cause painful and itchy skin
           rashes, eye and mouth irritation, joint pain and fever. Several drugs for treating
           these diseases suppress the immune system. However, they can cause severe side effects
           when taken over a long period of time.

        -  IL-1 is a small protein that may be important in causing the inflammation seen in
           pustular skin disease. Anakinra is a drug that works by blocking IL-1. It has been
           effective in treating some inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis.
           However, anakinra has not been studied for use in patients with pustular skin disease.
           Researchers want to see whether anakinra will be effective in treating pustular skin
           disease.

      Objectives:

      - To see if anakinra can be used to treat inflammatory pustular skin disease.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have inflammatory pustular skin disease.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Their disease
           will be evaluated with blood tests, urine tests and imaging studies. Skin biopsies may
           also be collected.

        -  Participants will have an initial visit to receive the first dose of anakinra. They
           will be shown how to give themselves daily injections of anakinra.

        -  Participants will take anakinra for up to 12 weeks as long as there are no severe side
           effects. During this time, they will keep a study diary to record the severity of any
           rashes, pustules, itching, fevers, and skin or joint pain. They will bring this diary
           to their study visits.

        -  Participants will have study visits at weeks 4, 8 and 12. Treatment will be monitored
           at these visits with blood tests, urine tests and physical exams. Depending on the
           effects of the treatment, participants may have the dose of anakinra increased or
           decreased.

        -  Participants will have a final study visit 4 weeks after they stop taking anakinra.

      Background

      Inflammatory disorders that present with neutrophilic pustular skin lesions, including
      generalized pustular psoriasis, are characterized by severe cutaneous manifestations,
      generalized inflammation and significant morbidity.  Recent studies in patients with
      phenotypically similar pustular diseases have identified two monogenic forms of neutrophilic
      pustular psoriasis implicating interleukin (IL)-1 in disease pathogenesis.  Deficiency of
      the IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL1RN, DIRA) is an autosomal recessive condition characterized
      by severe generalized pustular eruptions in the neonatal period, osteopenia, lytic bone
      lesions, joint pain, respiratory insufficiency, thrombosis, elevated acute phase reactants
      and significant mortality. Patients with this condition have responded rapidly to IL-1
      receptor antagonist, anakinra.  Deficiency of IL-36 receptor antagonist (IL-36RN/IL1F5,
      DITRA) is an autosomal recessive condition with episodic widespread pustular skin lesions,
      fevers and systemic inflammation defined by marked leukocytosis and elevated creactive
      protein.  Both IL1RN and IL36RN/IL1F5 are highly expressed in epidermal keratinocytes,
      suggesting a role for keratinocytes in initiating innate immunity-mediated inflammatory skin
      diseases, and ultimately manifesting in a pustular phenotype. Patients with inflammatory
      pustular diseases often respond poorly to conventional treatment with methotrexate,
      cyclosporine and anti-TNF agents. Two recent case reports describe patients with pustular
      psoriasis unresponsive to TNF inhibition who responded to anti-IL-1 receptor therapy with
      anakinra. We hypothesize that monogenic and polygenic inflammatory pustular skin diseases
      share common pathogenic mechanisms mediated by IL-1. We propose a phase 2 study that will
      utilize a collaborative bench-to-bedside approach, applying targeted anti-IL-1 therapy,
      novel imaging modalities, and laboratory techniques including immunohistochemistry, gene
      expression and cytokine studies, and in vitro manipulations of skin to dissect and validate
      pathways in these complex diseases.

      Objectives

      To characterize the clinical efficacy, optimal dosing and safety of anakinra in patients

      with pustular dermatoses.

      Eligibility

      Age   (Bullet) 18 years.

      Active macroscopic noninfectious pustular skin lesions involving   (Bullet) 5% of the total
      body

      surface area, or palmoplantar involvement.

      Histopathologic confirmation of epidermal neutrophilic pustulosis.

      Patients must have maintained a stable dose of immunosuppressant therapy, retinoids or

      anti-neutrophil therapy for 2 weeks prior to study initiation with resultant stable or

      worsening skin disease.

      Use of biologic agents requires a washout period of at least 3 half-lives prior to study

      initiation.

      Patients must have organ and marrow function as defined below:

      leukocytes &gt; 3,000/mcL

      absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1,500/mcL

      platelets &gt; 100,000/mcL

      creatinine within normal institutional limits OR creatinine clearance &gt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m2
      for patients with creatinine levels above institutional normal.

      Design

      A 16-week, open-label phase 2 study.  Patients will initially receive treatment with
      anakinra 100 mg/day by self-administered subcutaneous injection. Disease response will be
      assessed every 4 weeks, and determination of dose escalation will be made based on clinical
      assessment. Dose escalation can increase up to 200 mg/day, and for patients &gt; 75 kg up to
      300 mg/day at the end of week 8. If a response is achieved with anakinra, other
      immunosuppressants administered for the purpose of treatment of pustular skin disease may be
      tapered per physician discretion. Clinical assessment, and laboratory and subjective data
      will be collected in-person every 4 weeks to determine disease response. Telephone
      assessments will be performed weekly. Twenty-five evaluable patients will be enrolled onto
      this trial. The accrual ceiling for this study will be set to 30.

        initiation.

        Subjects who experience a significant flare after discontinuation of a TNF inhibitor as
        part of this study that requires urgent medical management or hospitalization, or in the
        estimation of the principal investigator poses excessive risk to the patient to enter the
        study.

        Other defined dermatologic conditions which may include pustules as part of the clinical
        presentation, but which clinically and/or histologically do not resemble pustular
        psoriasis. Examples include, but are not limited to acute generalized exanthematous
        pustulosis (AGEP, a drug-induced pustular dermatosis typically caused by beta-lactam
        antibiotics, tetracyclines, oral antifungals and other drugs),  bacterial or fungal
        folliculitis, cutaneous candidiasis, tinea pedis, tinea corporis, neutrophilic eccrine

        composition to anakinra or other agents used in study. Known hypersensitivity to CHO-cell
        derived biologics or any components of anakinra.

        Treatment with a live virus vaccine during the 3 months prior to baseline visit. No live
        vaccines will be allowed throughout the course of this study.

        Pregnant or lactating females.

        Patients with active or untreated malignancy-- with the exception of cutaneous basal or
        squamous cell carcinomas, or in situ cervical carcinoma-- are ineligible because of the
        immunomodulating effects of anakinra. The risk of recurrent malignancy secondary to this
        drug is unknown.

        Presence of active infection. History of exposure to TB (positive PPD) who have not been
        treated with a TB prophylaxis regimen for at least one month.

        Chest x-ray demonstrating pleural scarring and/or calcified granuloma consistent with
        prior or current untreated TB.

        History of chronic or recurrent infection including but not limited to HIV, hepatitis B or
        hepatitis C.

        Individuals with severe or uncontrolled recurrent cutaneous infections who are considered
        at elevated risk for serious infection on anakinra therapy will be excluded per physician
        discretion.

        Presence of other known significant autoimmune or inflammatory disease. Examples include
        major chronic infectious/inflammatory/immunologic diseases such as systemic lupus
        erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, Sjogren   s syndrome and periodic fever syndromes.

        Other immunoregulatory or immunodeficiency diseases, such as multiple sclerosis.

        Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
        infection, uncontrolled or unmonitored psychiatric illness/social situations, or history
        of congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris or medically significant cardiac
        arrhythmia that would limit compliance with study requirements.

        Presence of other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition, or significant
        laboratory abnormality requiring further investigation that may cause undue risk for the
        subject   s safety, inhibit protocol participation, or interfere with interpretation of
        study results, and in the judgment of the investigator would make the subject enrollment
        inappropriate.

        The effects of anakinra on the developing human fetus are unknown. Women of childbearing
        potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of
        birth control or abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study
        participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her
        partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician
        immediately. Females of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test
        at screening. Females must also have a negative serum pregnancy test at baseline and prior
        to performance of any radiologic procedure or administration of study medication and
        during each NIH visit. Lactating mothers will discontinue breastfeeding prior to study
        enrollment.
