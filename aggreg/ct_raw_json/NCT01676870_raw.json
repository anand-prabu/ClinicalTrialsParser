Therefore, the investigators will also determine whether one bout of\n      AIT (1-AIT (1x4min aerobe interval training)) can give beneficial effects compared to 4-AIT\n      and CME.\n\n      Evaluation criteria are risk factors constituting metabolic syndrome, aerobic capacity\n      measured as peak oxygen uptake and compliance to intervention. Assessments will be made\n      before and after the 16-week program, and at six month, and 1 and 3 years follow-up.\n      Calculations based on previously results suggest a total number of 750 patients randomized\n      1:1:1 (250 in each group) to the three intervention groups is sufficient to detect larger\n      beneficial effects with AIT with a p-value of 0.05 (two-sided test) and statistical power of\n      0.85 (primary endpoint is reduction in cardiovascular risk factors constituting metabolic\n      syndrome)."
