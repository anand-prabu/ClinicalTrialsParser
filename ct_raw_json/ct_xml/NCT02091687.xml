      Track behavioral and qualitative longitudinal outcomes in children with hemiparesis who
      previously participated in a randomized, controlled trial (RCT) of intensive therapy
      combined with repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS)

      This longitudinal study will evaluate the subjective and behavioral outcomes of a previous
      randomized controlled study (RCT) rTMS/CIT (Pediatric Hemiparesis: Synergistic Treatment
      using rTMS and CIT (NIH Grant Number: 1RC1HD063838-01; PI: Dr. James Carey). The previous
      rTMS/CIT study evaluated the safety and efficacy of 5 treatments of 6-Hz primed
      low-frequency rTMS applied to the non-stroke hemisphere combined with constraint induced
      therapy (CIT) to promote recovery of the paretic hand in children and adolescents. CIT has
      shown improved behavioral outcomes as well as cortical reorganization in representation of
      the affected limb. The previous RCT was a rTMS-Sham/CIT study design (real rTMS n=10 and
      sham rTMS n=9).

      Our research question, 'What is the medical status and perception of previous participants
      concerning their involvement in an intensive rTMS/CIT RCT specific to symptom monitoring,
      the TMS experience, and their current functional status'.
