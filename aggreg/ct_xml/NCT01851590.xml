    <textblock>
      The aim of this prospective, investistigator-blinded, randomized and controlled clinical
      trial is to explore potential differences between 5 % amorolfine and 30 % resin lacquer in
      topical treatment of onychomycosis. In addition, topical treatment methods are compared with
      the most effective 'drug of choice' for onychomycosis according the current guidelines i.e.
      oral medication with terbinafine.

      Altogether 90 patients (30 patients per group) who have culture or KOH stain verified
      onychomycosis are randomly allocated into three treatment groups to receive either topical
      treatment or oral medication for toe- or fingernail onychomycosis classified according to
      the current guidelines as follows:

        1. White superficial onychomycosis (WSO)

        2. Distal and lateral subungual onychomycosis (DLSO)

        3. Proximal subungual onychomycosis (PSO)

        4. [Total dystrophic onychomycosis) (TDO)] [Excluded]

        5. [Candidal onychomycosis] [Excluded]

      Participants are randomized into three groups to receive:

        1. Topical treatment: 30 % resin lacquer (Abicin®)

        2. Topical treatment: 5 % amorolfine lacquer (Loceryl®)

        3. Oral medication: 250 mg terbinafine

      All patients visit at outpatient department before the launch of the study, and three and
      nine months thereafter. Clinical examination is done by four physicians. At every visit, the
      panel of laboratory tests (S-Krea, S-GT, B-TVK), nail samples for mycological culturing and
      KOH staining (Sk-SienVi), and digital photographs are taken from the most severely affected
      onychomycotic nails. At the end of the study, all patients are ordered to discontinue using
      the resin- or amorolfine lacquer four weeks before the last visit (washout period). During
      the trial, all participants are contacted at least twice by phone in order to monitor the
      patient's compliance and willingness to continue in the trial.

      In order to control safety and assess potential contraindications for terbinafine,
      amorolfine or resin, blood samples regarding kidney and liver function are taken in the
      beginning of the study, as well as at three and nine months, thereafter. The patients'
      permanent medication is verified against terbinafine, amorolfine and resin in order to
      exclude potential cross-reactions between the patient's permanent medication and current
      antifungal treatment. Sensitivity or allergy for terbinafine, amorolfine or resin is taken
      into account, and if any symptoms of allergic reactions appear, the study is discontinued
      for this particular patient.
