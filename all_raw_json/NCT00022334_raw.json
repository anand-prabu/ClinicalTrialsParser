Treatment repeats every 2 weeks for a total of 3 doses in the absence of\n      unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-12 patients receive escalating doses of vaccine until the maximum tolerated\n      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 or 2\n      of 12 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed at weeks 1, 4, and 12 and then every 6 months thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-18 patients will be accrued for this study."
