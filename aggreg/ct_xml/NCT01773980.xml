  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this project is to develop and pilot test an innovative approach for overcoming
      barriers to cancer screening among women with physical disabilities (WWD) in rural Oregon.
      Many studies have shown that people with disabilities receive fewer indicated cancer
      screening services and are more likely to have poor  cancer-related outcomes, such as late
      stage at diagnosis, compared to those without disabilities.
