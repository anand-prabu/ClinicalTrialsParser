            "textblock": "Increased intraocular pressure (IOP) has been identified as the most important risk factor\n      for the development and the progression of glaucoma. Data from large interventional studies\n      have shown that a decrease of IOP is associated with a reduced risk of progression of the\n      disease. This underlines the importance of a potent and save IOP lowering therapy. The\n      introduction of preservative free tafluprost offers a new treatment possibility using a\n      potent topical prostaglandin analogue without the disadvantages of a co-administered\n      preservative. The current study seeks to investigate the effect of an 8 week therapy with\n      preservative free tafluprost on intraocular pressure in patients with ocular hypertension or\n      primary open angle glaucoma having an IOP of 30 mmHg or more."
