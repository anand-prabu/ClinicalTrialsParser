It would be of great importance to\n      be able to select the individuals at risk to develop exercise-induced asthma, already at the\n      start of their enrollment in the 'elite sport school. This would allow physicians to follow\n      their lung function parameters very closely and regularly; and, if necessary, start\n      treatment early after the first signs of exercise-induced asthma."
