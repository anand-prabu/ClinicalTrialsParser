  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Significant pain may occur following posterior spinal fusion despite the use of
      conventionally accepted techniques including patient controlled analgesia.  If detected, a
      significant reduction in opioid requirements may lead to improved patient satisfaction and
      decreased opiate side effects.

      The current study would use a prospective, randomized trial investigating the efficacy of
      one of 2 regimens as adjuncts to intraoperative anesthesia and postoperative analgesia,
      along with a third control group. The patients would be randomized to receive remifentanil
      plus a single intraoperative dose of methadone; remifentanil plus a bolus followed by an
      infusion of magnesium; or remifentanil alone.  In addition, the two medications being
      studied might make it easier to determine the efficacy of neurophysiologic monitoring
      including somatosensory evoked potential (SSEP) (amplitude and latency) and motor evoked
      potential (MEP) (mA) required to elicit the response.

      The purpose of this study would be to explore the effects of intraoperative methadone vs
      magnesium on intraoperative anesthetic requirements, postoperative opioid requirements, the
      efficacy of neurophysiologic monitoring including SSEP and MEP, inspired concentration of
      desflurane, remifentanil, and the need for intraoperative supplemental agents to control
      blood pressure.

    <description>To determine the effects of methadone and magnesium on intraoperative parameters including:
the inspired concentration of desflurane to maintain a bispectral index of 50-60 (general anesthesia)
the dose of remifentanil required to maintain the mean arterial pressure at 50-65 mmHg
the need for supplemental agents for blood pressure control despite a maximum remifentanil infusion of 0.3 Âµg/kg/min
the effect of magnesium on the efficacy of neurophysiologic monitoring including SSEP (amplitude and latency) and MEP (mA required to elicit the response post-operative pain scores and opioid requirements for the initial 24 postoperative hours</description>
