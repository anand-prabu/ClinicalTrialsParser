  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      -  Subjects will be enrolled in this open-label long-term follow-up study after they have
           completed one of the two core studies, GLPG0634-CL-203 (DARWIN1) or GLPG0634-CL-204
           (DARWIN2) and will be evaluated for any side effects that may occur (long-term safety
           and tolerability) when taking GLPG0634 (daily dose of 200 mg, either as once daily (QD)
           or twice daily (BID) regimen depending on the regimen in the preceding core study).

        -  During the course of the study, patients will also be examined for long-term effects of
           GLPG0634 administration on disease activity (efficacy), subjects' disability, fatigue,
           and quality of life.

             the Investigator's judgment

          -  Females of childbearing potential and sexually active men must agree to use highly
             effective method of birth control as specified in the protocol, during the study and
             for at least 12 weeks after the last dose of GLPG0634

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects prematurely withdrawn from one of the 2 core studies (GLPG0634-CL-203 or
             GLPG0634-CL-204), for any reason

          -  Persistent abnormal lab values during one of the 2 core studies (GLPG0634-CL-203 or
