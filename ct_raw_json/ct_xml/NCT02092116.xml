  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The REDUC (&quot;Kick and Kill&quot;) trial's objective is to address one of the core issues with the
      treatment of HIV, which is that some HIV infected cells hide in so-called latent reservoirs.
      The reservoirs are unaffected by conventional HIV medication and invisible to the immune
      system. HDACi have the potential to activate (&quot;Kick&quot;) these latently infected cells. This
      will make the HIV infected cells visible to the immune system; the immune response generate
      by Vacc-4x will be able to attack and eliminate (&quot;Kill&quot;) the infected cells.
