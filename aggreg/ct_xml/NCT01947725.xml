  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine whether behavioral activation as an adjuvant to
      standard smoking cessation treatment improves smoking cessation outcomes among veterans with
      PTSD relative to a comparably intense combination of standard smoking cessation treatment +
      health and smoking education. It is expected that behavioral activation will produce more
      successful results than health and smoking education when paired with standard smoking
      cessation treatment.

      The purpose of this study is to examine whether behavioral activation as an adjuvant to
      standard smoking cessation treatment improves smoking cessation outcomes among veterans with
      PTSD relative to a comparably intense combination of standard smoking cessation treatment +
      health and smoking education. It is expected that behavioral activation will produce more
      successful results than health and smoking education when paired with standard smoking
      cessation treatment.

      After an initial phone screen, in-person screening, and baseline assessment, enrolled
      participants will be randomized to either behavioral activation therapy and standard smoking
      cessation treatment (BA+ST) or health and smoking education and standard smoking cessation
      treatment (HSE+ST). Both groups will meet with a therapist once a week for 8 weeks to
      receive either BA+ST or HSE+ST. Participants' mood and smoking outcomes will be monitored
      throughout the 8 weeks of treatment and at 2 follow-up visits and 2 follow-up phone calls.

    <description>Health and Smoking Education (HSE) Treatment will be delivered in eight, 30 minute individual sessions over an 8-week period. HSE treatment will focus on smoking, health, and the impact of smoking on the subject's health.  In addition, this arm will receive standard smoking cessation therapy, nicotine patch, and either nicotine gum or nicotine lozenge.</description>

    <description>Behavioral Activation (BA) Treatment will be delivered in eight, 30 minute individual sessions over an 8-week period. BA treatment will focus on encouraging subjects to participate in activities that they find enjoyable and rewarding.  In addition, this arm will receive standard smoking cessation therapy, nicotine patch, and either nicotine gum or nicotine lozenge.</description>

    <description>Subjects in all arms will receive 12 weeks of nicotine patch.  The dosage will be 4 weeks of 21 mg, 4 weeks of 14 mg, and 4 weeks of 7 mg patches as is approved by the FDA and is standard treatment at the study facility.  This dosage may be adjusted based on the needs of the subject as is the standard of care.</description>

    <description>Subjects in all arms will receive either nicotine gum or nicotine lozenge (depending on their preference).  Participants who smoke less than 25 cigarettes/day will receive 2-mg gum/lozenge; participants smoking 25 or more cigarettes/day will receive 4-mg gum/lozenge.  Participants will be told to try to use one piece of gum every 1-2 hours.  However, participants will also be told that they may not be able to take a full, recommended dose of oral Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) given their conjoint use of the patch.  Participants will be urged to use at least 5 pieces/day, unless this amount of use produces negative (toxic) effects.</description>
