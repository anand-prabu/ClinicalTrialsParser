Our pilot data, along with converging findings in the literature,\n      suggests that odor identification deficits, both incremental change over time and change in\n      response to an anticholinergic challenge, may be clinically simple, relatively inexpensive,\n      predictors of cognitive improvement with acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (ACheI) treatment\n      with potential clinical implications for predicting improvement and monitoring ACheI\n      therapy."

Recruitment will be from clinics and/or advertisements. In the\n      protocol, all 60 amnestic MCI patients will receive baseline memory and olfactory\n      assessments and begin treatment with donepezil.  Patients will be followed for a total of 1\n      year. During this time, patients will be monitored closely by the study physician and will\n      receive memory and olfactory assessments at weeks 8, 26, and 52.  In addition, an olfactory\n      challenge test will be done at baseline.\n\n      This project will be of value in the selection of patients with mild cognitive impairment\n      for treatment based on the evaluation of olfaction tests to predict response to donepezil\n      and other ACheI. Since mild cognitive impairment is widespread and Alzheimer's disease\n      represents a major public health problem, this study has considerable public purpose and\n      significance."
