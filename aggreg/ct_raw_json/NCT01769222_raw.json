Monoclonal antibodies,\n      such as ipilimumab, can block cancer growth in different ways. Some block the ability of\n      cancer cells to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and help kill them or carry\n      cancer-killing substances to them. Radiation therapy uses high energy x rays to kill cancer\n      cells. Giving monoclonal antibody therapy together with radiation therapy may be an\n      effective treatment for melanoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, colon, or rectal cancer"
