All patients\n      participated in 40-minute training sessions three times per week for 12 weeks. The IG\n      performed the following eight strengthening exercises using a Swiss ball: lateral rise,\n      simultaneous biceps curl, squat, two arms triceps extension, abdominal, one arm dumbbell\n      row, reverse crucifix and crucifix. The SG performed exercises targeting the same muscle\n      groups trained in IG. Outcome measures were as follows: visual analogue scale (VAS) for\n      pain, 1 repetition maximum test for muscle strength; fibromyalgia impact questionnaire (FIQ)\n      to evaluate disease impact, and short form health survey (SF-36) to assess quality of life.\n      All participants underwent an evaluation at baseline, at 6 weeks and at 12 weeks of\n      training. The assessor was blind to patient allocation."
