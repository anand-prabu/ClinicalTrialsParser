Both physiologic and empiric data suggest that renal hypoxia\n      due to OSA is associated with worsening kidney function. Hospitalized patients are often\n      exposed to multiple nephrotoxins such as antibiotics, contrast agents, and diuretics, which\n      place them at risk for acute worsening of kidney function. This study aims to determine\n      whether immediate diagnosis and treatment of OSA in CKD patients will decrease the incidence\n      of acute kidney injury during hospitalization. The investigators will evaluate the extent to\n      which this effect can be attributed to a decrease in nocturnal hypoxia and improved blood\n      pressure control. Secondary endpoints include hospital length of stay, and a composite\n      outcome comprised of hemodialysis initiation, major cardiovascular events, and mortality."
