The natural history of AAA is gradual expansion and if left untreated may\n      result in rupture and death. The mechanism of the development of this disease is unknown\n      however it appears to be multifactorial and possibly related to degradation processes within\n      the arterial wall. There is growing evidence that Angiotensin receptor blockers ( ARBS) may\n      have an inhibitory effect on remodelling processes within the arterial wall, thus inhibiting\n      degeneration of the vessel wall.\n\n      Study hypothesis: ARBS are associated with smaller diameters of aortas among hypertensive\n      patients, and are associated with a lower rate of aortic expansion compared to other\n      antihypertensive drugs."
