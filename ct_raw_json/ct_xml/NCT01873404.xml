    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to assess the efficacy of Intravenous (IV) BG00010
      (Neublastin) in improving pain in painful lumbar radiculopathy subjects when administered 3
      times per week for 1 week.

      The secondary objectives of this study in this study population are as follows: To explore
      the duration of the effect of BG00010 in improving pain; To explore the dose response curve
      on pain reduction; To assess the safety and tolerability of BG00010; To assess the serum
      exposure to BG00010.

      During the study, frequent assessment of allocation probability will be conducted to guide
      subsequent randomization of subjects into dose groups.
