  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Insulin resistance (IR) is an important contributor to increased cardiovascular disease risk
      in type 1 diabetes (T1D). Non-esterified fatty acid elevation is a significant contributor
      to IR in T1D and may be a  target of intervention. The hypothesis of the study is that
      isolated fatty acid lowering with acipimox will improve insulin action and blood vessel
      function and have the benefit of reducing mitochondrial oxidant generation and improving
      mitochondrial function in T1D. Targeting IR through fatty acid lowering is a novel approach
      to T1D treatment that may significantly improve current management of TID and of
      cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in this high risk population.
