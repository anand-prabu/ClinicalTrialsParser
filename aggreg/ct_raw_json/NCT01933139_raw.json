All subjects will\n      undergo knowledge questionnaires at four separate time points - prior to their preoperative\n      appointment, immediately after their preoperative appointment, day of surgery, and at the\n      six-week follow-up visit. The control group will be consented in the standard fashion with\n      face-to-face interaction with their surgeon. The intervention group will watch a 10-minute\n      scripted video explaining the procedure, risks, benefits, expectations, and long term\n      complications that relate to hysterectomies before face-to-face interaction with the\n      surgeon. Patients in both arms will then sign the same standard pre-surgical informed\n      consent form before undergoing the procedure.  All interactions with the physicians (control\n      and experimental) will be audiotaped to assess the number of patient questions, the time\n      spent with each patient, and the quality of subject material discussed in the control group.\n      Subjects will also receive satisfaction questionnaires after the preoperative visit.\n\n      Setting: Research will take place in the gynecology clinic and surgical suites of San\n      Antonio Military Medical Center.\n\n      Subjects: Approximately 120 subjects will be recruited from the San Antonio Military Medical\n      Center gynecology clinic (50 in each arm). Eligible subjects include all patients scheduled\n      for hysterectomy with or without salpingo-oophorectomy for benign indications, civilian and\n      military, female only, older than 18yo, English-speaking, with intact hearing and vision,\n      and able to provide consent without representation.\n\n      Measures: In this study, patient literacy will be determined using the REALM score (Rapid\n      Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine). Patient knowledge questionnaires were created by\n      the investigators of the study. Satisfaction will be measured by a validated questionnaire\n      (CSQ-8). Primary objectives will be addressed through analysis of subjects' difference\n      scores on comprehension assessments at each of four time points.  Secondary objectives\n      including patient satisfaction, time spent by physician in face-to-face interaction,\n      questions asked by the patients, and quality of physician counseling (inclusion of key items\n      in control arm) will also be analyzed between groups."
