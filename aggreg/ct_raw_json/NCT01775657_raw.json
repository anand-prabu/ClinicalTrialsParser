Patients within two groups (air leak and no air leak) will be randomized to\n      receive either the analogue system or the digital system. Both systems are approved for use\n      in hospitals by Health Canada.  There will be 80 patients in each group (digital and\n      analogue).\n\n      Hypothesis: Continuous, quantitative monitoring of PAL following lung resection leads to\n      more efficient chest tube management as measured by an improvement in primary outcomes."
