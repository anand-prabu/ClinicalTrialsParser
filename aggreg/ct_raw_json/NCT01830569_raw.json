Medical records are not centralized in Belgium. Patients are free\n             to choose any physician, and can even see several physicians at the same time. To\n             encourage a patient to have their medical records held by a single physician, 'Global\n             Medical Records' werr introduced a decade ago. In return for a registration fee,\n             patients can choose a main general practitioner who keeps their central medical\n             records. This registration is a requirement for patient inclusion in the trial.\n             Patients with 'Global Medical Records' are reimbursed a larger proportion of the\n             consultation fees by the health insurance fund.\n\n          -  Patients have an established diagnosis of diabetes at the baseline time point of the\n             study (identified as having (1) an ICPC (International Classification of Primary\n             Care) code of diabetes or (2) a prescription for a diabetes-specific or (3) the\n             necessary labo results to confirm diabetes)\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  Pregnancy\n\n          -  Cognitive impairment"
