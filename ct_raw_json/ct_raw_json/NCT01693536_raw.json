Finland\n      has shown that five dietician visits/year could change diet in respect to fat and fibre. In\n      Australia the National Health Insurer (Medicare) funds five allied health visits/year for\n      those with chronic disease, hence our use of this model. This is consistent with WHO\n      guidelines for a national approach using existing health infrastructure. The elderly\n      (75-95yrs) were chosen as this group is thought most difficult to change behaviour and has a\n      higher incidence of dementia."
