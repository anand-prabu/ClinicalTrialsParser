            "textblock": "Cannabis dependence is the most common illicit substance dependence and people with cannabis\n      dependence are highly vulnerable to anxiety disorders. The co-occurrence of anxiety\n      disorders among those with cannabis dependence is a pressing public health matter given\n      elevated anxiety is related to poorer cannabis treatment outcomes. Cannabis-related problems\n      among those with anxiety disorders may be maintained by a reliance on cannabis to manage\n      anxiety. Investigations of the treatment of these conditions when they co-occur have been\n      virtually absent. Motivation enhancement therapy (MET) combined with cognitive-behavioral\n      therapy (CBT) is an efficacious intervention for cannabis dependence, yet outcomes are\n      highly limited for anxious patients. Transdiagnostic anxiety treatments can facilitate the\n      treatment of patients with anxiety psychopathology regardless of the specific type of\n      anxiety disorder. One such treatment, False Safety Behavior Elimination Treatment (FSET),\n      may be particularly useful with cannabis dependent anxious patients as it focuses on the\n      elimination of behaviors that may be effective in decreasing anxiety in the short-term, but\n      can maintain and even exacerbate anxiety in the long-term (i.e., false safety behaviors).\n      The use of cannabis to manage anxiety can, therefore, be targeted in such a treatment. This\n      project tests the feasibility and utility of a novel, integrated approach to treatment of\n      patients with cannabis dependence and anxiety disorders. Phase I of the project includes\n      development and refinement of a specialized group protocol (i.e., Integrated Cannabis and\n      Anxiety Reduction Treatment or ICART) for integrating MET-CBT for cannabis dependence with\n      FSET. The initial protocol will be modified based on the experience gained during group\n      treatment with the integrated treatment. Phase II will be a randomized controlled trial\n      examining the relative efficacy of the refined ICART treatment versus MET-CBT alone. After\n      post-treatment assessments, the ICART group will be followed for 3 months to examine\n      maintenance of gains; the participants originally assigned to the control condition will be\n      offered ICART. It is hypothesized that ICART will produce better outcomes than the control."
