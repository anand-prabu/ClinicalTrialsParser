  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine the effect of dexmedetomidine infusion on the
      Apnea / Hypopnea Index (AHI) of individuals with previously documented obstructive sleep
      apnea. We hypothesize that dexmedetomidine infusion may reduce the AHI in patients with
      obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All individuals who have previously undergone diagnostic polysomnography in the Sleep
             Lab which documented significant OSA, and who have not undergone any changes that are
             likely to alter the severity of their condition since the time of their diagnostic
             sleep study (loss of weight; surgical therapy for OSA; removal of tonsils;
             discontinuation of medications likely to affect arousal or respiratory function,
             etc.) are eligible to participate. Subjects will be identified as they complete
             outpatient sleep studies or from records of previous sleep studies performed in the
             Duke Sleep Laboratory. After obtaining informed consent, subjects will be screened by
             history and physical examination, 12-lead electrocardiogram, and comprehensive
             metabolic profile.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Exclusion criteria will include a history of illicit drug or alcohol dependence,
             impaired hepatic (aspartate aminotransferase or alanine aminotransferase &gt; 2x upper
             limit of normal range) or renal function (receiving dialysis or serum creatinine &gt;
             1.5 mg/dL), high-grade (&gt; 1st degree) heart block, or known allergy to
             dexmedetomidine.
