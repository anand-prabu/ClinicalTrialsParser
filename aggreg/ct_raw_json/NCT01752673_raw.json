When physicians are faced with patients' symptoms or signs, their\n      thought processes follow either direct shortcuts to suspect a diagnosis or go into a deeper\n      and more analytic process to reach a diagnosis. The second pathway is less prone to biases\n      and errors. This study explores whether the use of an interactive visual display of\n      probabilities of pulmonary embolism generated from positive or negative test results will\n      increase the adherence to evidence based guidelines in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism."
