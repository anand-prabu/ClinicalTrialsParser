Current Australian guidelines recommend\n      initiation of statin therapy on the basis of cholesterol level and the presence of other\n      risk factors for heart disease (such as diabetes) but do not take into account whether a\n      patient is infected with HIV. This study aims to determine what benefit HIV infected people\n      will receive from starting statin therapy earlier then currently recommended."
