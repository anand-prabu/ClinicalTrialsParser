  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study goal is to examine whether the use of an objective computerized neuroassessment
      (the Quotient System) for Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is related to
      improved outcomes among pediatric patients being assessed and treated for ADHD.

    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, controlled trial using a 2-phase data collection.  The first
      phase is the initial assessment for ADHD and includes all patients eligible to be assessed
      for ADHD as determined by their clinician in the course of usual care. The baseline
      measurements will be used to compare groups at baseline, and also for longitudinal analyses
      of medication management.  Patients are randomized at this point. Patients in both treatment
      arms who then receive an ADHD diagnosis and who start medication for ADHD will be eligible
      for the second phase of the study:  three follow-up assessments over six months.  Patients
      who do not have an ADHD diagnosis will not continue in the study, and will be treated by
      their clinician as usual.

    <description>The primary outcome measure will be change in the dose of ADHD medication as measured across three followup time points, comparing a Usual Care group and a Quotient test group.  The hypothesis is that patients who receive the Quotient test (the computerized neuroassessment) will reach a stable therapeutic dose of ADHD medication more quickly, compared to Usual Care.</description>
