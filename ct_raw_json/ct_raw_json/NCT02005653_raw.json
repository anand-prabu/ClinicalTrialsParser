It takes about one year for\n      the individuals to completely clear the microfilaria from the blood. It takes another two to\n      four years to clear the antigen. The aim of the present study is to shorten the time taken\n      for clearing the Mf and antigen from the blood either by co-administration or sequential\n      administration of a macrofilaricidal drug, Albendazole or doxycycline. This study is a\n      randomized, double blind, controlled clinical trial to study the efficacy of these drug\n      combinations in complete clearance the Mf and antigen from the blood in shorter span of 180\n      days and 365 days respectively."
