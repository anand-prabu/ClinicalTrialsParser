  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The individual ingredients in IQP-AK-102 have been widely used. Backed by data from several
      studies demonstrating their efficacy, we are conducting this study to look into the efficacy
      and safety of this novel combination of glucomannan, kappa-carrageenan and xanthan gum, in
      appetite regulation, aiming to reduce the appetite.
