    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to collect blood from families with a child who has been
      diagnosed with a chromosomal disorder including microdeletions in order to further develop a
      non-invasive prenatal screening test based on fetal DNA isolated from maternal blood.

    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to collect family triads from families affected by a
      genetic or microdeletion/duplication (MD/D) syndrome to further develop  non-invasive
      prenatal testing based on fetal DNA isolated from maternal blood.  To assist with the
      development of the test, we will need to collect blood samples from women whose child was
      diagnosed with a genetic or MD/D syndrome, a blood sample from that child as well as a blood
      sample from their confirmed unaffected siblings.  Since the test is based on Natera's
      Parental Supportâ„¢ technology, buccal or blood samples from the biological fathers will also
      be requested.

      A recent abstract from a five year study on prenatal microarray testing revealed that 1.6%
      of women who present for routine prenatal indications have a positive microarray test.  With
      the frequency of microdeletions and microduplications (MD/D) now known to be higher than
      previously thought, the field is likely to move toward offering invasive testing for
      microarray abnormalities to all pregnant women.  Although non-invasive prenatal testing for
      aneuploidy is now clinically available, it has become clear that non-invasive prenatal
      testing for MD/D is equally important.  However, access to these samples is made difficult
      as the standard of care for offering microarray analysis to all pregnant women will take
      time to come to fruition.  We would like to develop this non-invasive as the standard of
      care so that less women will have to undergo invasive testing for the diagnosis of
      microarray abnormalities.  Thus, there is an unmet need for the development of novel tests
      that would increase the scope of non-invasive prenatal screening.
