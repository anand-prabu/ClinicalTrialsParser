BAV patients are also at high risk to develop aneurysms of the\n      ascending aorta, which may lead to aortic dissections. Dr. Prakash and his colleagues plan\n      to use individual genetic information to identify persons with BAV who are at high risk for\n      complications and to customize therapies."
