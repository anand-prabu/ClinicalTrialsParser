Determine the complete and partial response rates, duration of complete\n      response, freedom from progression, event free survival, and overall survival in patients\n      with relapsed or refractory intermediate or high grade lymphoma treated with arsenic\n      trioxide. II. Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients receive arsenic trioxide IV over 2-4 hours for a maximum of 25 cumulative\n      days followed by a rest period of 3-4 weeks. Patients with complete or partial response may\n      receive 6 additional courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n      Patients with minor response (25-50% tumor regression) may also receive further courses of\n      treatment. Patients are followed at 4 weeks.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 22-41 patients will be accrued for this study."
