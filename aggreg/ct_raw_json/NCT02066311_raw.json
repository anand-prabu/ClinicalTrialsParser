            "textblock": "Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease in which the body's\n      immune system attacks different parts of the body.  SLE is characterized by inflammation\n      that leads to tissue damage in different organ systems. Any organ system may be involved,\n      including the skin, the joints, the kidneys, the nervous system, the heart, the lungs, and\n      the blood.   The exact cause of SLE is not known.  Patients with SLE often have elevated\n      levels of anti-double stranded DNA antibodies.  These levels are often associated with\n      disease flares and disease severity.  These antibodies can bind to tissue leading to organ\n      damage.  Preventing these antibodies from binding to their targets may help decrease disease\n      activity.\n\n      Protease inhibitors are medications that have been approved by the Food and Drug\n      Administration (FDA) for use in the treatment of HIV (human immunodeficiency virus).\n      Nelfinavir (also called viracept) is one of these protease inhibitors. Separate from their\n      anti-viral effects, protease inhibitors have been found to decrease inflammation.  These\n      medications have been shown to interfere with binding of anti-double stranded DNA antibodies\n      to their targets and may decrease inflammation in SLE.  This research study tests whether\n      the protease inhibitor, nelfinavir, will decrease anti-double stranded DNA antibody binding\n      and decrease disease activity."

Subject is \u2265 18 years old and \u2264 65 years old\n\n          3. Meets at least 4 of 11 modified American College of Rheumatology (ACR) (1997) Revised\n             Criteria for the Classification of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus\n\n          4. Has mild to moderate disease activity defined as\n\n               -  A minimum SLEDAI score of 2 excluding points for serology (anti-dsDNA antibody\n                  and complement)\n\n               -  No active renal or nervous system disease\n\n               -  No BILAG A in any organ system\n\n               -  No expectation by the investigator that corticosteroids will need to be added or\n                  doses increased during the 8 week treatment period for any reason\n\n               -  No expectation by the investigator that immunosuppressive medication will need\n                  to be added or doses increased during the 8 week treatment  period\n\n          5. Has elevated titers of anti-ds DNA antibody at the time of screening (defined as the\n             titer that meets criteria for \"high\" in the Core Laboratory at the North Shore/LIJ\n             Health Systems; unequivocal high titer as opposed to borderline, indeterminate or\n             intermediate).\n\n          6. Has elevated titers of cross-reactive anti-DNA/DWEYS antibodies at the time of\n             screening (the assays for anti-DNA/DWEYS antibodies will be performed in Dr. B.\n             Diamond's laboratory; study sites will be notified of results within 3 days of\n             receipt of the samples).\n\n          7. If on glucocorticoids, the dose must be \u226410 mg daily and stable for the 4 weeks prior\n             to screening and baseline\n\n          8. If on immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory medication such as azathioprine,\n             methotrexate, leflunomide, mycophenolate, or hydroxychloroquine, the dose must have\n             been stable for the 3 months prior to screening, and expected to remain stable over\n             the course of the study.\n\n          9. Males and females with potential for reproduction must agree to practice effective\n             birth control measures (2 approved methods of contraception).  Nelfinavir can\n             decrease serum levels of oral contraceptives; the slightly increased risk of\n             pregnancy due to an interaction between oral contraception and nelfinavir will be\n             discussed when appropriate and the requirement for a second approved method of\n             contraception will be addressed.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          1. Current or prior treatment with rituximab, belimumab or anti-CD22 monoclonal antibody\n             in the 12 months prior to this study or any other biologic agent for 90 days prior to\n             this study\n\n          2. Treatment with cyclophosphamide within the 6 months prior to screening\n\n          3.

Laboratory/clinical evidence of: pancreatitis: amylase/lipase >3x upper limit of\n             normal at screening\n\n          9. Known current/active infections including HIV, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C\n\n         10.

Any condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would jeopardize the\n             subject's safety following exposure to the study drug."
