  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study the investigators will assess how useful and safe acupuncture is in easing the
      pain, tingling and numbness that is caused by chemotherapy. The researchers hope this will
      prevent the need to reduce the amount of chemotherapy a patient receives.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, pilot (phase IIb), randomized, standard care- and placebo (sham
      acupuncture)-controlled clinical trial (N=60) assessing the effects of acupuncture to
      prevent chemotherapy dose reduction due to chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN)
      and to elucidate the mechanism of action.  Breast or colorectal cancer patients receiving
      neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy containing neurotoxic agents (taxanes or oxaliplatin)
      at the University of Maryland Marlene &amp; Stewart Greenebaum Cancer Center (UMGCC) will be
      screened for CIPN.  Once these patients develop greater than or equal to National Cancer
      Institute-Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI-CTC) grade 2 CIPN, they will be recruited for this
      study.  Severity of CIPN as defined by NCI-CTC is listed in Appendix A. Patients will be
      stratified based on cancer type (breast cancer vs colorectal cancer).  The patients will
      then be randomly assigned to one of three arms: (A) real acupuncture, (B) sham acupuncture
      or (C) standard care.  All patients will follow the same chemotherapy dose reduction
      algorithm (Appendix B).  No concomitant anti-neuropathy medication is allowed.  Patients in
      the intervention arms will be randomly assigned to undergo weekly real or sham acupuncture
      until the end of their chemotherapy. In these two arms, the patient, the patient's medical
      oncologist, pharmacist, research nurse, and study coordinator will be blinded to the
      treatment assignment. In standard care arm, patients will not receive additional therapy for
      CIPN.  Their CIPN will be managed according to the standard chemotherapy dose reduction
      algorithm.  In all arms, chemotherapy dose will be documented during the patient's scheduled
      chemotherapy sessions.  The chemotherapy relative dose intensity (RDI) will be calculated at
      the end of their chemotherapy.  Validated patient-reported outcome questionnaires:
      Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy/ Gynecologic Oncology Group-Neurotoxicity
      (FACT/GOG-Ntx) questionnaire and Neuropathy Pain Scale (NPS), described later, will be used
      to assess CIPN severity weekly in all patients until the end of their chemotherapy and at
      the 4 week follow up.  Nerve conduction study will be performed by a neurologist at baseline
      and after chemotherapy is finished.  Side effects from real or sham acupuncture will be
      recorded weekly.  Approximately 4 ml of blood will be drawn from patients before each real
      or sham acupuncture treatment, or with routine weekly blood work check (in the standard care
      arm), at the end of chemotherapy, and at the 4 week follow up to measure changes in nerve
      growth factor and other neurotrophic factors such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor,
      neurotrophin-3, the insulin-like growth factors, and vascular endothelial growth factor.
      They will be analyzed in the cytokine lab at the University of Maryland School of Medicine
      (UMSOM).

    <description>The main objective is to assess efficacy and safety of acupuncture using Seirin acupuncture needles in colorectal and breast cancer patients who developed chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy while receiving adjuvant/neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Safety will be assessed by recording side effects from acupuncture treatment. Efficacy will be assessed by measuring the proportion of patients in each arm who are required to undergo dose reduction or discontinuation due to chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy.</description>
