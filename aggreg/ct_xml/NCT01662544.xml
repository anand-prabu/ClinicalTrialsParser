  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bronchiolitis is a common cold weather seasonal respiratory illness affecting infants and
      children.  Multiple supportive therapies have been tried in infants with bronchiolitis
      including albuterol, racemic epinephrine, hypertonic saline nebulization, but to date
      supportive therapy with oxygen is the only proven therapy to decrease respiratory distress
      in infants with bronchiolitis, with hypertonic saline showing a borderline statistically
      significant improvement.  This prospective, randomized study will compare CSS and PEWS
      scores on infants who receive oxygen by standard flow nasal cannula and to those who receive
      oxygen via Humidified High-Flow Nasal Cannula (HHFNC).  The results will help determine if
      infants with viral bronchiolitis who receive humidified high flow nasal cannula oxygen
      therapy have improved Clinical Severity Score (CSS) and Pediatric Early Warning System
      (PEWS) scores and ultimately decreased lengths of admissions when compared to patients
      treated with nasal cannula oxygen therapy with/without bronchodilator therapy.

      Hypothesis Heated Humidified High-flow Nasal Cannula Delivery of Oxygen decreases
      respiratory distress as measured by pediatric CSS and PEWS when compared with routine nasal
      cannula oxygen delivery in infants with bronchiolitis.
