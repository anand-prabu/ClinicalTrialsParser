      Open label multicentric randomized phase II trial, using high throughput genome analysis as
      a therapeutic decision tool, aimed at comparing a targeted treatment administered according
      to the identified molecular anomalies of the tumor with a standard treatment (pemetrexed in
      Non squamous disease and erlotinib in squamous disease)
