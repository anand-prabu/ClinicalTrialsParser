PET/CT methods developed in the pig studies are translated to studies in healthy humans\n      and patients with cholestatic disorders. Dynamic PET/CT scans of the liver and biliary\n      system are combined with measurements of tracer concentrations in a radial artery and a\n      liver vein and measurements of hepatic blood flow by intravenous infusion of indocyanine\n      green (ICG)/Ficks principle. Kinetic parameters from PET/CT measurements and invasive\n      measurements are compared for validation of the PET estimated parameters and refinement of\n      the PET modeling, if required. Based on these invasive studies, a protocol without liver\n      vein catheterization is develop for subsequent clinical applications."
