With disease\n      progression, exacerbations are frequent and have a negative impact on health related quality\n      of life and pulmonary function as well as increase mortality. More severe exacerbations\n      require hospitalization resulting in enormous health expenditures, severely reducing daily\n      life activities and declining peripheral muscle strength that can be only partially reversed\n      after 3 months. Despite many features have been pointed out as responsible for the decrease\n      in muscle strength during hospitalization, physical inactivity seems the most important.\n\n      Resistance training is an interesting therapeutic option to prevent and/or reverse muscular\n      dysfunction due to immobilised in healthy subjects and stable COPD patients because induces\n      hypertrophy of type II fibers, increases muscle strength and exercise tolerance. In\n      addition, provokes lower dyspnea perception during effort compared with other exercise\n      training. Despite these benefits for stable COPD, the impact of a resistance exercise\n      program during hospitalization remains poorly known."
