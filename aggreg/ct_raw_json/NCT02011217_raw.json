We will evaluate how the intake of rye crisp\n      breads affects appetite, insulin secretion and glucose levels in the blood in healthy\n      humans. We will also investigate microstructural properties of the crisp breads with\n      microscopy, as well as to characterize the food products with respect to the content of\n      dietary fibre and certain bioactive compounds. The aim is also to try to elucidate how\n      observed effects on appetite are related to changes in insulin and glucose levels, appetite\n      related hormonal signals and microstructural properties to verify findings from previous\n      studies."

Each\n      participant will consume three different breakfasts consisting of two different rye crisp\n      breads and one wheat crisp bread on three different occasions separated by a 1 week wash-out\n      period. Participants will rate subjective appetite (satiety, hunger and desire to eat) by\n      using a visual analogue scale (VAS) every 30 min during a 4-hour period, starting 30 min\n      before breakfast. Blood samples will be collected before breakfast and at regular intervals\n      throughout the day for analysis of glucose, insulin and hormone levels. Gastric emptying\n      rate will also be evaluated using paracetamol as an indicator. Glucose and hormonal\n      responses will be related to subjective appetite and to differences in composition of the\n      breakfasts."
