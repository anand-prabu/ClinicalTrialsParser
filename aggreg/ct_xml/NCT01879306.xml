    <textblock>
      This randomized phase 2 clinical trial is comparing the anticancer efficacy of ipilimumab
      (an immune boosting antibody currently approved by the FDA for metastatic melanoma) versus a
      combination of a chemotherapy drug (Abraxane) given together with a blood vessel suppressing
      antibody (Bevacizumab) in patients with metastatic melanoma that do not have the BRAF
      mutation.  Previous clinical studies demonstrate that the Abraxane/Bevacizumab combination
      offers clinical benefit (measured as progression free survival).  Patients in this study
      will be randomized to either ipilimumab or Abraxane/Bevacizumab as first line therapy for
      their melanoma.  At the time of tumor progression, patients will have the opportunity to
      cross over to the other treatment if eligible.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess whether the combination nab-paclitaxel (paclitaxel albumin-stabilized
      nanoparticle formulation) and bevacizumab (AB) prolongs progression-free status relative to
      ipilimumab as a 1st line treatment in patients with unresectable stage IV melanoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the hazard of death among those randomized to AB then ipilimumab relative to
      those randomized to ipilimumab then AB as first line treatment in patients with unresectable
      stage IV melanoma.

      II. To assess whether tumor response rate (as determined by Response Evaluation Criteria in
      Solid Tumors [RECIST] criteria 1.1) differs with respect to 1st treatment course.

      III. To estimate whether the tumor response rate differs with respect to 2nd treatment
      course for those who progressed during their first treatment course.

      IV. To further examine the safety profile of each of these regimens.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To examine the pharmacokinetics of nab-paclitaxel when combined with bevacizumab therapy.

      II. To examine pharmacodynamic changes of blood-derived parameters (biomarkers) of
      angiogenesis and immunity as a function of therapy.

      III. To examine whether changes in serum biomarkers are also seen in the tumor.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM A: Patients receive bevacizumab intravenously (IV) over 30-90 minutes on days 1 and 15
      and paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8,
      and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients experiencing progressive disease may cross-over to Arm B within 2-4
      weeks.

      ARM B: Patients receive ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21
      days for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Patients experiencing progressive disease may cross-over to Arm A within 2-4 weeks.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for up to 5 years.

    <description>The distribution of PFS times for each treatment arm will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.
