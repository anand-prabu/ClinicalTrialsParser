Current\n      therapies for COPD are only partially effective and may also have side effects.  Although\n      increasing evidence indicates that quercetin supplementation may be beneficial in treating\n      COPD, key methodological issues have not been resolved. The overall objective of this study\n      is to determine the dosage of quercetin supplementation, bioavailability of quercetin,\n      safety, dose-response relationship and appropriate biomarkers which reflect clinical\n      outcomes in patients with COPD that is necessary for conducting large clinical trials in\n      this patient population."

            "textblock": "In our preclinical study, we have demonstrated that 4 fold increase in plasma quercetin\n      levels significantly decreased lung inflammation and prevented progression. Clinical studies\n      in healthy volunteers 4 fold increase in plasma quercetin levels (0.22 to 1 \u00b5M) could be\n      achieved by supplementing with 500mg of quercetin/day. However, safety of quercetin\n      supplementation and quercetin dose required to achieve 4 fold increases in plasma quercetin\n      levels in 'at-high-risk' COPD population is yet to be established. This study involves two\n      phases; the first phase examines the safety of quercetin supplementation in subjects with\n      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and the second phase determines the efficacy of\n      quercetin in COPD patients. In this study, we will enroll COPD patients with mild to\n      moderate disease between the age group of 40 to 65 years.  During the first phase, we will\n      enroll a total of 9 patients to examine the tolerance and safety of three doses of quercetin\n      (500, 1000 and 2000 mg/day) in a dose escalation manner. First cohort consisting of three\n      subjects will receive placebo or 500 mg of quercetin per day for one week and the safety of\n      quercetin supplementation will be assessed by monitoring adverse events and any changes in\n      outcomes of blood test that include complete blood counts (CBC)and comprehensive metabolic\n      panel prior to after supplementation. If this dose is safe and tolerated, second cohort of 3\n      subjects will receive placebo or 1000 mg of quercetin per day quercetin for one week and\n      again safety will be assessed.  If the dose is safely tolerated, the third cohort will\n      receive either placebo or 2000 mg of quercetin per day for a week and the safety will be\n      assessed. Based on this initial study, we will choose the highest quercetin dose tolerated\n      with no adverse events and the dose (500 mg of quercetin per day) that was found to increase\n      plasma quercetin levels by 4 fold over baseline in healthy volunteers to examine the\n      efficacy of quercetin in reducing inflammatory and oxidative stress markers and improving\n      lung function in COPD subjects. In the second phase, we will enroll a total of 75 subjects\n      and randomized into three arms; placebo (15 subjects) or one of the two doses of quercetin\n      (30 subjects per arm). All enrolled subjects will be asked to avoid quercetin rich foods\n      throughout the study period. One week after enrollment (run-in), subjects will be either\n      supplemented with either placebo or one of the two doses of quercetin for 4 weeks. All\n      participants will be blinded for study agents. Plasma and sputum quercetin levels, lung\n      function, and markers of oxidative stress and inflammation will be determined at the start\n      of the study (following run-in period), at the end of 4 weeks treatment period."
