There is a female predominance with a sex ratio of 2/1 and median age at\n      diagnosis is about 30 years.\n\n      Only a complete surgical excision is recommended in desmoids tumors. Some forms of desmoid\n      tumors are recurrent and/or symptomatic and are not accessible to a conservative surgical\n      treatment. In these clinical situations, only a medical treatment may achieve tumor control\n      and quality of life maintenance. Place of systemic treatments in the management of desmoids\n      tumors is poorly evaluated. Regarding chemotherapy, methotrexate and vinblastine protocol is\n      actually the best evaluated combination, which allowed observing objective response rate\n      between 40 and 75%. Toxicity was mainly marked by the risk of haematological toxicity.\n\n      Pazopanib is an inhibitor of multi-target tyrosine kinase, in oral form, with selective type\n      receptors -1, -2 and -3 of VEGF receptors on the PDGFA and B, and c-Kit. It is currently\n      under clinical development in humans in the treatment of several tumor types."
