The control group will be evaluated in\n      the same manner as the treatment group.\n\n      The Spiration Valve is a small, umbrella-shaped, one-way valve that is placed inside the\n      airways of one lung. It is used to redirect air from the less healthy to the more healthy\n      parts of the lung. This helps to reduce over-inflation and may improve overall lung function\n      and quality of life for people living with emphysema."
