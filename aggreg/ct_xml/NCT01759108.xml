  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Xerostomia is a major distressing symptom in Sjőgren's syndrome(SS). Preclinical and
      clinical studies have demonstrated an increase in saliva volume following rebamipide
      administration.We thus hypothesize that rebamipide may be efficacious in the treatment of
      dry mouth symptoms related to Sjőgren's syndrome.We will recruit SS patients in a randomized
      placebo-controlled trial for 12 weeks. The main outcome measure that will concern us is
      patient-assessed improvement of dry mouth symptoms and increase in salivary secretion Safety
      and efficacy was assessed at each visit.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Xerostomia is a major distressing symptom in Sjőgren's syndrome (SS). Persistent dryness of
      the mouth causes oral pain, discomfort and significantly interferes with the quality of
      life. Rebamipide, in addition to its gastro-protective effect has displayed various
      anti-inflammatory actions including inhibition of neutrophilic leukocyte activation.
      Preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated an increase in saliva volume following
      rebamipide administration.

      The aim of the present study is to assess efficacy of rebamipide in the treatment of dry
      mouth symptoms related to Sjőgren's syndrome.

      Methods: Fifty-five patients with American European Consensus Criteria Group (AECG)-based
      diagnosis of SS will participate in this randomized placebo-controlled trial. Inclusion
      criteria will include SS patients with dry mouth symptoms. Patients with dry mouth due to
      other conditions will be excluded. Patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive either 300mg/d
      (100mg x3/day) of rebamipide or placebo for 12 weeks together with their usual therapy.
      Outcome measures will include patient-assessed improvement of dry mouth symptoms and
      increase in salivary secretion (evaluation of unstimulated saliva; questionnaires including
      the visual analogue scale (VAS) for Sicca-syndrome VAS 0-100mm). Subjective and objective
      findings of dry mouth will be recorded at baseline, two, four, six, eight, ten and twelve
      weeks. Safety and efficacy will be assessed at each visit.
