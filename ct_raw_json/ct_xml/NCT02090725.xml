  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose for this study is to provide access to 3,4 DAP, a drug which has
      demonstrated to be effective in treating weakness associated with Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic
      Syndrome.  LEMS is a rare autoimmune cause of a defect in neuromuscular transmission.  The
      disorder is clinically characterized by fluctuating muscle weakness, hyporeflexia and
      autonomic dysfunction.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      More than half of LEMS cases are associated with malignancy, usually small  cell lung
      cancer.  These paraneoplastic cases progress more quickly than primary autoimmune LEMS.  An
      overlap syndrome with other autoimmune diseases is often detected in LEMS patients.

      3,4 DAP is effective in LEMS because it increases calcium influx into the nerve terminal  by
      blocking potassium efflux and thereby prolonging the presynaptic action potential.  3,4 DAP
      is less likely to provoke epileptic seizures than its precursor, 4-aminopyridine, because it
      is less able to cross the blood-brain barrier.  3,4 DAP is effective in increasing strength
      and improving autonomic symptoms in LEMS patients of both the primary autoimmune and
      paraneoplastic etiologies.

    <description>Muscle weakness will be assessed monthly for the first 3 months based on office visits and blood tests (complete blood count (CBC), electrolytes, glucose, liver function tests, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine). Muscle weakness will then be assessed every 6 months once the patient is stabilized based on office visits and blood tests (CBC, electrolytes, glucose, liver function tests, BUN, creatinine).</description>
