The study aims to learn more about the strength and duration of the\n      protection provided by the vaccine in adults, and to observe the immune response to an\n      additional dose of chickenpox vaccine in adults who had received the vaccine at least 5\n      years earlier.  This is especially relevant to workers in a hospital who may be exposed to\n      chickenpox."
