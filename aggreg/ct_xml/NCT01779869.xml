  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective for this pilot study is to develop an optimized, clinically usable myocardial
      PET-MR perfusion protocol and to determine which of all data potentially available should be
      acquired for a clinical myocardial perfusion examination.  Hypothesis:  The hypothesis is
      that high resolution, high sensitivity DCE MRI could replace the rest PET myocardial
      perfusion imaging, significantly decreasing examination time and patient radiation dose
      while maintaining the comprehensive reference-quality PET myocardial stress perfusion
      coverage.

      The primary outcome will be comparison of diagnostic accuracy of each combination of imaging
      to detect clinically significant coronary artery stenosis (≥70% diameter stenosis). The
      secondary outcome will be comparison of confidence for presence of disease among data sets.

    <textblock>
      Simultaneous acquisition PET-MRI is a new technology that has the potential to significantly
      impact diagnostic patient care. It combines high signal resolution MRI anatomic imaging and
      PET biological measurements, with the added benefit of radiation dose reduction in
      comparison to PET-CT.  As the incidence of false positive SPECT-MPI studies secondary to
      attenuation artifact is relatively high and MRI coverage of the left ventricular myocardium
      is limited, it is likely that one of the immediate applications of PET-MRI technology is
      myocardial ischemia assessment.

      PET has long been considered the noninvasive reference standard for myocardial perfusion.
      However, delayed contrast enhanced (DCE) MRI is very sensitive for infarct detection.
      Indeed, both PET and MR imaging have the potential to provide comprehensive whole heart
      ischemia and infarct detection.

      PET-MR technology, with its ability to obtain simultaneous perfusion information via both
      PET and MRI, has the potential to obtain multiple, possibly redundant, data sets. On the
      other hand, it also has the potential to combine the best of both techniques to provide a
      highly robust examination that is both shorter and of lower radiation dose than the standard
      myocardial PET perfusion examination.  Optimization of a protocol is necessary to develop a
      comprehensive protocol without redundancy.  Because of its single injection capability,
      regadenoson is ideally suited to a protocol that will assess and employ dual-modality
      myocardial perfusion data collection.

      It is expected that the best candidates for PET-MR myocardial perfusion imaging will likely
      be a) patients whose body habitus suggests that their SPECT-MPI examination would be limited
      by attenuation artifact -- women with large breasts and patients (usually men) with
      abdominal obesity and/or b) patients who may have a smaller region of ischemia that might be
      missed on an MRI examinations with limited perfusion coverage.
