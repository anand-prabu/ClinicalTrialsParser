    <description>YMRS: an 11-item scale that measures the severity of manic episodes. Four items are rated on a scale from 0 (symptom not present) to 8 (symptom extremely severe). The remaining items are rated on a scale from 0 (symptom not present) to 4 (symptom extremely severe). The YMRS total score ranges from 0 to 60.</description>

    <description>CGI-S: 7-point clinician rated scale to assess severity of participant's current illness state; range: 1 (normal - not ill at all) to 7 (among the most extremely ill patients).  Higher score = more affected</description>

    <description>CGI-I: 7-point clinician rated scale ranging from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse). Improvement is defined as a score of 1 (very much improved), 2 (much improved), or 3 (minimally improved) on the scale.  Higher score = more affected</description>
