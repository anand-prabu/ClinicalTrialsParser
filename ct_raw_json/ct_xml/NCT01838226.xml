    <textblock>
      Prevention of cardiovascular disease is a primary focus of the Secretary's New Models of
      Care Transformational Initiative. However, prevention has been hard to accomplish. The VA is
      committed to using group visits to address a wide array of primary care problems. Coaching
      is a method to help veterans set and reach health goals by helping them overcome barriers to
      behavior change. Coaching can be performed one-on-one or in groups. Our study will test the
      effectiveness of a group prevention coaching (GPC) intervention in improving cardiovascular
      risk. GPCs will focus on changing a behavior of the patient's choice that is likely to lead
      to improvements in heart disease risk. The coach will adopt a problem-solving approach to
      helping veterans make these improvements. The primary outcome will be change in 10-year risk
      of major cardiac event; we will also assess improvements in food choice, physical activity
      and weight

    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular (CV) event prevention (e.g., myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident)
      remains the single most important public health problem in the United States, and
      cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of death among VA users. Improving the provision
      of prevention services is a primary focus of the Secretary's New Models of Care
      Transformational Initiative. However, prevention has been challenging to achieve.
      Multifactorial behavioral interventions are effective in treating a number of chronic
      illnesses (e.g., hypertension, diabetes), but less is known about their ability to reduce
      risk among patients without a unifying chronic illness. Group visits are an efficient,
      effective strategy for delivering a multifactorial behavior change intervention; the VA is
      committed to the group visit strategy to address a wide array of primary care problems.
      Groups have been shown to be an effective means of improving a number of outcomes in a
      number of individual diseases, but, again, their role in cardiovascular prevention among
      patients without a single common illness is unknown. Coaching is a type of multi-factorial
      behavioral intervention that involves goal-setting, and working to overcome barriers to
      behavior change. Coaching can be performed one-on-one, but coaching interventions have been
      delivered in group settings. We have shown, in a 150-subject RCT, that group coaching plus
      individualized telephone coaching reduces cardiovascular risk, but the population in that
      study was very different from typical VA users. We propose a three-site, two-arm randomized
      trial measuring the effectiveness of a group prevention coaching (GPC) intervention in
      improving cardiovascular risk, compared to VA usual care. The study will be performed at the
      Durham, Buffalo, and Syracuse VAMCs. Each arm will have 200 patients; patients will be VA
      users without prior history of cardiovascular event, but with at least 5% risk of such an
      event, and with either inadequately controlled hypertension or dyslipidemia, or current
      smoking. The GPC intervention will focus on changing a behavior of the patient's choice that
      is likely to lead to improvements in cholesterol, blood pressure, or to smoking cessation.
      Behaviors that will be reinforced will include but not be limited to healthy eating,
      decreased caloric intake, increased physical activity, stress reduction, and participatory
      decision making with physicians. Barriers to these behaviors will be identified. The coach
      will adopt a problem-solving approach to overcoming the above barriers and reinforcing the
      above behaviors; problem-solving is a well-described framework for behavior change. The GPC
      coach/interventionist for will be either the facility's Health Behavior Coordinator (HBC) or
      a person hired for the research enterprise but trained and credentialed identically to an
      HBC. All outcomes will be obtained at baseline, 6, and 12 months after enrollment by blinded
      research personnel. The primary outcome will be change in 10-year risk of fatal coronary
      event or non-fatal MI 6 months after enrollment, as measured by Framingham Risk Score. Key
      secondary outcomes will include dietary content by Food Frequency Questionnaire, physical
      activity as measured by International Physical Activity Questionnaire, and weight. We will
      also determine if group cohesion, as measured by the Group Dynamics Inventory, influences
      the effectiveness of GPC. We well also assess whether time spent in contact with a coach
      influences the effectiveness, by database log-in timekeeping strategies.

    <description>A group problem-solving intervention, with interval phone calls delivered to check in on goal progress and reinforce group learning. Groups will meet monthly for 6 months, and each patient will be called once between each group session. Each group will consist of 10 patients. Problem-solving teaches patients to overcome internal barriers to healthful behaviors. Problem solving will be combined, at all group sessions, with self-efficacy training, so that patients will be taught simultaneously to overcome both internal and external barriers. Participants will be asked to develop personal goals related to CVD-related behaviors (e.g., smoking and weight reduction).</description>
