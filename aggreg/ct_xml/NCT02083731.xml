  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) in
      the treatment of refractory cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection after allogeneic hematopoietic
      stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Viral infections are common complications after allo-HSCT. With wide use of HLA-mismatch,
      unrelated and cord blood donors as alternative sources of hematopoietic stem cells, and
      anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) as the standard prophylaxis of graft versus host disease
      (GVHD) in HLA-mismatch and unrelated donor transplantation, allo-HSCT recipients are at
      increasing risk for viral infections.

      Till now, CMV remains one of the most important viruses and causes of death in the
      recipients of allo-HSCT. Approximately 75% of CMV-seropositive recipients develop CMV
      reactivation, and 20-30% of these patients develop CMV disease without intervention.
      Ganciclovir is the first-line treatment of CMV diseases.  However, bone marrow suppression,
      which is the main and common side effect, limits the utility of ganciclovir in allo-HSCT
      recipients. Besides,  ganciclovir and other antiviral agents resistance has been reported up
      to 28%. Since it has been known that specific immune response to CMV is important to control
      reactivation, CMV-specific CTL has been used in prophylaxis and treatment of CMV viremia in
      several studies. In view of the fact that CMV infects 70-80% of the healthy individuals,
      most donors have CMV-specific cytotoxic T cell (CTL) in lymphocytes in theory. Therefore, we
      hypothesise that DLI might be effective to treat CMV infection. In addition, Mesenchymal
      stem cells (MSCs) are a form of multipotent adult stem cells that can be isolated from bone
      marrow (BM), adipose tissue, and cord blood. In vivo experiment showed that MSCs have
      antimicrobial activity.

      In this trial, we will use DLI or DLI combined with MSCs in the recipients with refractory
      CMV infections.

    <description>Adverse Events include GVHD, primary underlying disease relapse and any other side effects. Side effects of treatment includes acute toxicity and late side effects. Acute toxicity principally involves the heart,live and kidney. Late toxic side effects involves principally the development of secondary tumors and relapse of the primary disease.</description>
