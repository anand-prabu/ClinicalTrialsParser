Treatment\n      continues for at least 2 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable\n      toxicity. Patients achieving stable disease may continue treatment.\n\n      Tumors are measured every 8 weeks for 2 years, every 3 months for the third and fourth\n      years, every 6 months for the fifth and sixth years, and then annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study."
