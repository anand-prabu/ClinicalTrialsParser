  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary axillary hyperhidrosis is a common idiopathic disorder of the eccrine sweat glands
      that interferes with daily activities and causes significant social distress.  This pilot
      study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and histologic effects of the 1210nm diode laser
      for the treatment of axillary hyperhidrosis.  Initial results may inform the design of an
      anticipated larger prospective controlled trial. Study participants will receive one laser
      treatment to one randomly-assigned axilla using the 1210 nm diode laser, and two treatments
      to the opposite axilla. Changes in sweating will be measured both by quantitative
      gravimetric analysis of sweat production and by expert panel evaluation of photographs of
      the starch-iodine test performed on each axilla.  Participants will also be asked to
      subjectively classify the severity of their axillary sweating.  These measures will be
      performed at pretreatment and at one, three, and six months following treatment.  Biopsies
      of both axillae will be done before and two weeks after treatment to assess histologic
      changes to the eccrine gland and surrounding structures.  Treatment of axillary
      hyperhidrosis with the 1210nm diode laser is a novel approach based on the unique absorption
      characteristics of this wavelength.  We hypothesize that selective heating of lipids at the
      appropriate tissue level will impact adjacent eccrine glands typically seated at the
      dermo-hypodermal junction, leading to subjective and/or objective decreases in eccrine
      secretions.  This type of treatment may offer an effective, non-invasive and safe
      alternative to current treatment modalities.

Changes in sweat production from a single and double treatment using treatment parameters designed to deliver heat to the dermo-hypodermal junction will be measured. Subjective assessment of outcome will also be measured. The objective and subjective measurement instruments are detailed in the methods section below.Prior to any treatment, baseline level of sweat production will be evaluated with three instruments: A subjective global assessment questionnaire, gravimetric analysis, and the modified starch-iodine test.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects must be at least 18 years old, and no older than age 65.

          2. Subjects must have localized hyperhidrosis only (axillae +/- palms of the hands,
             soles of the feet, face and other localized areas) without evidence of generalized
             hyperhidrosis.

          3. Subjects must be fully informed and read and sign the informed consent.

          4. Subjects must be willing and able to comply with all follow-up requirements.
