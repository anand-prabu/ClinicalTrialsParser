  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adequate visualization during shoulder arthroscopy is of great importance for the procedure
      to be efficiently and effectively performed. The use of dilute epinephrine in irrigation
      fluid has been historically utilized to help with visualization. Given the potential safety
      issues documented in the literature related to epinephrine use, as well as the significant
      improvements in technique and instrumentation over the last decade, the need for this
      additive should be reexamined.  The objective of the current study was to compare surgeon
      determined visualization in shoulder arthroscopy using irrigation fluid with and without
      epinephrine.
