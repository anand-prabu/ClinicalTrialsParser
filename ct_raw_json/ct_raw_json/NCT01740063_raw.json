The full analysis set will be used for activity\n      analysis and will include all randomized subjects with baseline and treatment data. Per\n      protocol, the safety analysis sets are described below in statistical methods.\n\n      A subpopulation of 60 participants will also have additional PK and Immunogenicity blood\n      samples collected. For this subgroup, PK and Immunogenicity samples will be collected at all\n      study visits."
