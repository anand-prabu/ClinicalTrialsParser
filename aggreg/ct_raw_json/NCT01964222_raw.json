An additional benefit of conducting this work at\n      Siteman Cancer Center is that Siteman and the Program for the Elimination of Cancer\n      Disparities (PECaD) already institute structural changes at the system level to improve\n      minority participation in trials. This study will activate and educate patients and will\n      complement the system-level interventions.\n\n      By random 1:1 assignment, 180 participants will either receive:\n\n      *Targeted, web-based decision aid (DA) about participating in cancer clinical trials.\n\n      or\n\n      *Usual care/control-Access to the Siteman Cancer Center website about clinical trials.\n\n      Outcomes from the DA group will be compared to outcomes in a usual care/control group."
