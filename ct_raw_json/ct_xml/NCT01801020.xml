  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Introduction: Temperature measurement is a crucial and integral element in the assessment of
      the emergency department patients. The basis of triage and treatment is often directly
      influenced by temperature measurement. The finding of hyper/hypothermia may differentiate
      between a simple urinary tract infection and pyelonephritis, or in more extreme cases may
      discern &quot;weakness&quot; in the elderly from sepsis. This brief encounter of temperature
      measurement may be paramount to the medical treatment of the emergency department patient.
      The investigators will explore the different modes of temperature measurements in emergency
      department patients.

      to the medical treatment of the emergency department patient.We will explore the different
      modes of temperature measurements in emergency department patients. We will check which
      temperature measurement is beneficial.
