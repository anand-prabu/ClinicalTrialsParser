      Vitamin D (Vitamin D) deficiency is very common. We recently showed that 97% of 204 patients
      admitted to Truman Medical Center were Vitamin D deficient (&lt;30 ng/ml).  However, the
      consequences of Vitamin D deficiency, particularly with respect to infection, are not well
      understood.  It is known that production of cathelicidin, an important antimicrobial
      peptide, is critically dependent upon Vitamin D.  It is also established that levels of
      cathelicidin correlate inversely with urinary tract infection risk.  We hypothesize that
      restoration of Vitamin D levels to normal in patients undergoing major surgery will result
      in significant decreases in levels of perioperative infections due to restoration of normal
      levels of circulating Vitamin D, which in turn will elevate cathelicidin levels.  As an
      initial test of this hypothesis, we propose a double-blind, prospective, randomized study of
      pre-operative Vitamin D supplementation.  Fifty subjects undergoing surgery will receive
      daily Vitamin D3 (50,000 IU) for five days pre-operatively, with controls receiving placebo.
       Levels of Vitamin D, calcium,  cathelicidin, and the pro-inflammatory protein resistin,
      will be monitored before Vitamin D supplementation (pre-operatively) and after Vitamin D
      supplementation (post-operative days 1 and 2). The effect of these changes should be to
      decrease the incidence of infectious complications.  We expect to observe Vitamin D levels
      increase to normal, and cathelicidin levels become elevated.    We expect to see increased
      levels of resistin in patients developing infections.  This study will provide strong pilot
      evidence for future NIH funding.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The long term goal in our research is to develop and implement effective, evidence-and
      mechanism-based interventions to improve outcomes for surgical and trauma patients. Of
      potential importance, findings from our own recent pilot studies have established that &gt; 95%
      of patients seen at Truman Medical Center (TMC) are seriously Vitamin D deficient with
      plasma levels significantly lower than normal.  Our objective in this application,
      therefore, is to assess the short term therapeutic benefit of high dose Vitamin D in
      patients admitted to TMC for elective major abdominal surgery.  We propose to measure plasma
      Vitamin D and Calcium levels before supplementation (pre-operatively), and after
      supplementation (post-operatively), and monitor the biomarker proteins cathelicidin and
      resistin at the same times. Data on Vitamin D levels will be used to assess direct
      biochemical effects.  Measurement of cathelicidin levels will provide additional
      information.  Since Vitamin D has been shown to induce increased expression of this
      antimicrobial protein. Monitoring of circulating levels of resistin provides a highly
      sensitive early measure of infection (unpublished observations). Calcium levels will also be
      monitored since there is a significant chance that pre-operative calcium levels will be low
      in some patients, and that supplementation with vitamin D may increase the calcium level.

      Measures of secondary clinical outcomes will include length of hospital stay and incidence
      of post-operation infection. Our central hypothesis is that, relative to patients receiving
      peri-operative standard of care, patients receiving 250,000 units of Vitamin D
      pre-operatively will manifest levels of Vitamin D to within the normal range and will have
      elevated levels of cathelicidin.  We further hypothesize that patients receiving Vitamin D
      will have reduced incidence of infection, which will correlate with lower levels of
      resistin, and will exhibit trends toward shorter hospital stay.  Our proposed specific aims
      are:

      Specific Aim #1: Determine biochemical consequences of Vitamin D supplementation in elective
      surgery patients   We hypothesize that preoperative supplementation with high dose Vitamin D
      will result in levels of Vitamin D in treated patients within the normal range,
      corresponding with significant increases in plasma levels of cathelicidin, relative to
      control patients receiving standard of care.

      Specific Aim # 2: Evaluate clinical benefits of Vitamin D supplementation in post-elective
      surgery patients   We postulate that patients given Vitamin D will trend toward lower rates
      of post-surgery infection, as evidenced by the absence of circulating resistin and decreased
      detection of pulmonary or wound-site infection, and will have shorter hospital stays
      relative to patients receiving standard of care.

      It is our expectation that, at the completion of this pilot study, we will have provided
      strong evidence that plasma levels of Vitamin D, as measured by 25-OHD, can be reproducibly
      raised to normal levels as measured in post-surgery patients and that the administered
      Vitamin D will have detectable biochemical benefits. We further expect that, while the power
      of the proposed study will not be sufficient for statistically valid results, there will be
      trends toward clinical benefits in Vitamin D treated patients. Collectively, these findings
      would provide strong evidence to support feasibility of an NIH-supported Phase I trial to
      assess Vitamin D benefits in surgery and/or trauma.
