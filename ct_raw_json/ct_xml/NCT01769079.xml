  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic treatment of stable angina with nitrates long and short action is extremely
      frequent. In clinical practice the most commonly observed is a combination of anti-anginal
      agents, usually including nitrates fixed in an attempt to improve the quality of life of
      patients, which is not always met with success.

      Numerous questions and problems are seen with chronic use of oral nitrates. From a practical
      standpoint, some advocate the withdrawal of medication in stable patients, while many
      physicians still hesitate to withdraw the medication by the lack of definitive information
      about its consequences. In this sense there is a rationale for the attempted removal of
      nitrate fixed these patients, although evidence to support this action have not been
      adequately evaluated.

    <textblock>
      The Ischemic Heart Disease remains in recent years as a major cause of mortality in most of
      the world, and also the disease that consumes more resources in health in industrialized
      countries. The use of fixed nitrate in patients with stable angina is quite common, but
      there is a scarcity of studies showing the need for this medication in this class
      pacientes.Este study aims to evaluate the consequences of the withdrawal of fixed nitrate in
      patients with stable angina class I and II, hemodynamically stable for the past six months,
      as the frequency and duration of episodes of angina, silent ischemia and functional capacity
      by exercise testing, 24-hour Holter and measurement of quality of life and adherence to
      therapy. For this purpose, a randomized blinded multicenter clinical trial was designed to
      placebo (intervention group) X nitrate (control group) in a follow-up period for 4 months.
      Both groups will receive three evaluations (baseline, 30 days and 120 days) during
      follow-up.

    <description>Evaluate the occurrence of angina and/or worsening of functional class (CCS). Assess exercise tolerance and time to onset of ischemia (clinical and electrocardiographic parameters) and total exercise time, through the exercise test. Rate load silent ischemia through 24-hour Holter. Assess quality of life measured by questionnaire Short-Form 36 and Seattle and adherence to medication.
