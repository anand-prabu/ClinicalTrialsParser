  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of Kovacaine Mist, and Placebo for
      inducing pulpal anesthesia of the maxillary teeth in adults.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will employ a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      parallel-groups design to assess the safety and efficacy of Kovacaine Mist delivered
      intranasally for inducing pulpal anesthesia of maxillary teeth numbers 4 to 13 (maxillary
      right second premolar to maxillary left second premolar) sufficient to allow completion of
      the Study Dental Procedure.  The maxillary teeth will be categorized in two subsets,
      anteriors (teeth numbers 6 to 11) and premolars (teeth numbers 4, 5, 12 and 13).

      The intent is to treat 150 subjects at 3 study sites, 2:1 randomization within each study
      site, and an overall goal of 100 subjects treated with Kovacaine Mist and 50 treated with
      placebo. Recruitment will be from diverse dental patient populations with at least 25% of
      subjects over 50 years of age.  Randomization will be within strata defined by age (≤50 and
      &gt;50 years).
