  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of tapentadol oral solution, based on
      the total amount of supplemental opiod analgesic used over 12 hours or 24 hours after
      initiation of investigational medicinal product in children and adolescents who have
      undergone surgery that would produce moderate to severe pain during opiod treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized (the study medication is assigned by chance), multi-site, double-blind
      (neither physician nor participant knows the treatment that the participant receives),
      placebo-controlled (placebo is compared with the study medication to test whether the study
      medication has a real effect in clinical study), parallel group (each group of participants
      will be treated at the same time), and multiple oral dose study. This study will consist of
      an enrollment phase (up to 28 days), a treatment phase (2 days), and a follow-up phase (up
      to 12 days). A dose regimen of 1.25 mg/kg will be used for the first 24 hours of treatment
      in this study in children aged 6 years to less than 18 years old. After 24 hours after the
      start of study medication, and based on clinical judgment, the dose may either be continued
      at 1.25 mg/kg or it may be decreased to 1.0 mg/kg. A decision to maintain or alter the dose
      will depend on the effectiveness of the analgesia (pain killer) and the adverse event
      profile observed in each child over the first 24 hour dosing period. The doses for
      participants aged less than 6 years old will be defined based on the forthcoming
      pharmacokinetic (what the body does to a medication) data. The rescue medication will be
      available as patient or nurse controlled intravenous morphine or hydromorphone. This rescue
      medication will be given to control pain, as needed, in both the treatment and placebo
      groups. Safety evaluations will include assessment of adverse events, vital signs,
      laboratory parameters, electrocardiogram, and specific scale to assess suicidal ideation.
      The maximum study duration for each participant will be 42 days.

    <time_frame>Up to 48 hours</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Palatability of IMP will be assessed using 5-point hedonic scales in combination with verbal rating. A question &quot;How does the medication taste&quot; will be asked and the verbal rating will be from really good, good, a bit good/a bit bad, bad, and really bad. The pictorial scale of facial expressions will be co-related with verbal rating range where 5 = really good, 4 = good, 3 = a bit good/a bit bad, 2 = bad, and 1 = really bad. Higher scores represent good palatability.</description>

    <description>Acceptability of IMP will be assessed using 5-point hedonic scales in combination with verbal rating. A question &quot;Swallowing the medication is&quot; will be asked and the verbal rating will be from really good, good, a bit good/a bit bad, bad, and really bad. The pictorial scale of facial expressions will be co-related with verbal rating range, where 5 = really easy, 4 = easy, 3 = a bit easy/a bit difficult, 2 = difficult, and 1 = really difficult.

    <description>The FLACC scale is used to measure the pain intensity based on 5 criteria relating to face, legs, activity, crying, and consolability. Each criteria is assigned a score of 0, 1 or 2. The total score is the sum of the 5 individual criteria. Higher scores represent worse condition.</description>

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The FPS-R is a validated self-reported 6-point scale with 0 representing no pain and 10 representing very much pain. Facial representations are used to indicate how much the pain hurts. Higher scores represent worse condition.</description>

             surgery expected to affect the absorption of tapentadol [in the investigator's
             judgment]) that, in the investigator's opinion, would reliably produce moderate to
             severe pain requiring opioid treatment for at least 24 hours after
             allocation/randomization to investigational medicinal product (IMP) [a term used to
             describe the preparations under investigation in this study, ie, tapentadol oral
             solution and placebo]

          -  Participant has received post-operative morphine or hydromorphone by nurse controlled
             analgesia (NCA)/patient controlled analgesia (PCA), with or without a background
             infusion of the same opioid, according to standard of care prior to
             allocation/randomization to IMP and participant is expected to require this morphine
             or hydromorphone by NCA/PCA after starting IMP

          -  Participant is able to tolerate liquids at the time of allocation/randomization to
             IMP

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant has been previously exposed to tapentadol

          -  Participant has received an experimental drug or used an experimental medical device

          -  Participant has a concomitant disease or disorder (e.g., endocrine, metabolic,
             neurological, psychiatric, infection, febrile seizure, paralytic ileus) that in the
             opinion of the investigator may affect or compromise participant safety during the
             study participation

          -  Participant has history of suicidal ideation or behavior

          -  Participant has a history of alcohol and/or substance abuse in the investigator's
