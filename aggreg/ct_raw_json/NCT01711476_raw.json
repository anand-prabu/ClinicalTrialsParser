These women are insulin resistant and have compensatory hyperinsulinemia that\n      stimulates ovarian cytochrome P450c17 alpha activity that in turn stimulates ovarian\n      androgen concentrations.\n\n      In obese PCOS women, weight loss improves insulin resistance and hyperandrogenism, resulting\n      in improvement of clinical symptoms.\n\n      Since lean PCOS women do not have the option of weight loss, it is important to know if\n      composition and meal timing distribution may influence glucose metabolism and\n      hyperandrogenism and cytochrome P450c17 alpha activity.  We hypothesized that a timing\n      pattern of increased nutrient intake of protein and  carbohydrates in the morning, with\n      decreased caloric intake at night would improve insulin sensitivity and hyperandrogenism in\n      lean women with PCOS"
