      The purpose of this proposal is to determine the long-terms effects of hormone and lifestyle
      factors on bone health in young women over a 20-year time period. It is our primary
      hypothesis that premenopausal women with irregular periods or endocrine issues related to
      estrogen will have significantly poorer low back and hip bone health when compared to
      regularly menstruating women. It is our secondary hypothesis that long-term assessment of
      changes in endocrine function and lifestyle behaviors will assist in establishing risk
      factors for osteoporosis in young women. This study will include 1000 premenopausal women.
      The women will participate in the collection of a blood sample, bone scan, body fat
      measures, and lifestyle questionnaires. In addition, we hope to use this initial study to
      develop a group of women to follow throughout menopause, with additional visits occurring
      every 5 years over the course of their life.
