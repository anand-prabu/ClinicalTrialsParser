Previously, one small (n=40) randomized controlled trial (RCT)\n      involving 27 children showed that Lactobacillus rhamnosus casei Lcr35 compared with placebo\n      increased treatment success defined as \u2265 3 spontaneous defecations per week with no episodes\n      of faecal soiling, increased the defecation frequency, reduced the frequency of abdominal\n      pain, reduced the use of glycerin enemas during the four weeks of therapy, and decreased the\n      percentage of hard stools. However, there was no difference between groups in the use of\n      lactulose or the number of episodes of faecal soiling. Available evidence is insufficient to\n      draw meaningful conclusion.
