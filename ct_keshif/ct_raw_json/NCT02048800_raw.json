With promising early\n      results, Treosulfan has become the pre-HCT drug of choice, however, very little is currently\n      known about how the drug is metabolised and cleared from the body, particularly in children.\n\n      The investigators therefore plan to investigate the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of\n      Treosulfan in children undergoing HCT at GOSH and define which parameters affect its\n      metabolism and clearance, and what blood levels are associated with a favourable outcome\n      (graft take without toxicity) or a poor result (graft rejection and/or toxicity)."
