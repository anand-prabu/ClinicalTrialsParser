Patients are stratified according to maximum tumor\n      diameter (2 cm vs greater than 2 cm to 3 cm vs greater than 3 cm to 4 cm).\n\n      Patients undergo stereotactic radiosurgery at an assigned dose according to tumor diameter.\n      Patients undergo MRI or CT scan at 3, 6, and 12 months after treatment or until disease\n      progression.\n\n      All other therapies are allowed after stereotactic radiosurgery except external beam whole\n      brain radiotherapy or resection of brain metastases, unless there is documented progression\n      or unrelenting mass effect that necessitates craniotomy.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 36 patients will be accrued for this study within 7.2 months."
