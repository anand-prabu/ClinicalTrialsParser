This problem is of\n      great importance to the VA. The majority of the 25 thousand HIV-infected veterans are over\n      50 years of age (64%).  The combined effect of aging and inflammation increase the risk for\n      physical disability in older HIV-infected veterans. This translational exercise training\n      trial will examine the cardiac and skeletal muscle effects of combined aerobic exercise and\n      resistance training to attenuate the functional declines of aging with HIV by reducing the\n      deleterious consequences of chronic inflammation. Findings will guide future rehabilitation\n      research on cardiac remodeling and inflammation of skeletal muscle. The proposed research\n      will advance the goal to develop effective rehabilitation strategies that improve the health\n      of older HIV-infected veterans."

The study hypothesis is that a progressive aerobic and\n      resistance rehabilitation program will increase aerobic capacity and muscle strength, which\n      will be mediated by improved diastolic function, increased muscle mass, and decreased\n      systemic inflammation. To test this hypothesis, investigators will conduct a randomized\n      16-week trial of progressive aerobic and resistance training versus usual care control in 60\n      sedentary older (50+ years) HIV-infected veterans. The study will determine the effects of\n      exercise training on aerobic capacity and diastolic function, and their relationship to\n      changes in biomarkers of systemic inflammation and cardiac fibrosis (AIM 1). The study will\n      also determine the effect of exercise training on strength and muscle mass, and their\n      relationship to changes in biomarkers of systemic inflammation (AIM 2)."
