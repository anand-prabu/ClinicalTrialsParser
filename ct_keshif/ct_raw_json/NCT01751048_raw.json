The\n      parasites are transmitted from an animal or human reservoir through the bite of infected\n      female phlebotomine sand flies. This study is a randomized, open-label clinical trial\n      designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of the LEISH-F3\n      recombinant protein antigen formulated with GLA-SE, MPL-SE, or SE adjuvant in healthy adults\n      18 to 49 years of age. Each subject's duration of participation will be about 18 months.\n      Subjects will receive a total of 3 doses of vaccine, which will be given by intramuscular\n      injection on Days 0, 28, and 168. The volume of each vaccine dose will be 0.5 mL. A\n      computerized system will be used to acquire any data regarding halting criteria throughout\n      the study. Primary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of LEISH-F3\n      formulated with GLA-SE, MPL-SE, or SE following intramuscular administration of 20 \u00b5g of\n      LEISH-F3 together with 5 \u00b5g of GLA-SE, 10 \u00b5g of MPL-SE, or SE alone.

A substudy will be performed\n      using up to 12 subjects from each Study Group (Groups 1, 2 and 3) and an additional 12\n      subjects to serve as controls.  This substudy will investigate whether, as in murine cells,\n      cell surface markers (CD11a, CD49d) can be used as a surrogate to identify protective immune\n      CD4+ T cells in human subjects receiving a vaccine antigen."
