  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Benign pigmented lesions as solar lentigines are a common finding in Caucasian individuals.
      Their removal may be requested for aesthetic reasons.

      The goal of the study is comparing the efficacy and tolerance of two different therapy
      modalities established for treating solar lentigines.

      The right back of the hand side will be treated with the Q-switched SINON Rubin 694nm Laser,
      the left back of the hand side with a hydrochinon containing bleaching cream (Pigmanorm®
      cream).

      The investigators estimate that a physical therapy with a Q-switched Rubin laser system is
      more effective in the removal of solar lentigines than a topical chemical therapy with a
      hydrochinon containing bleaching cream.
