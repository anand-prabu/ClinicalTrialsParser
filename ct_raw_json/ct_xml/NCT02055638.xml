    <textblock>
      This study is designed to explore the safety and tolerability, and to compare the activity
      of SRX246 against placebo, in adults with Intermittent Explosive Disorder (IED).

      Adult Male and Female subjects with a current diagnosis of IED will be enrolled.  After a
      two-week baseline lead-in phase, study subjects who continue to meet enrollment criteria
      will be randomized to either SRX246 or Placebo treatment groups.

      Study subjects will be examined and asked to answer questionnaires at weekly scheduled
      visits throughout the trial.  The study results will be determined based on any changes
      observed over the study period.

      This exploratory Phase II study has been designed to examine the safety and tolerability
      profile, and to compare the activity of the novel V1a vasopressin antagonist (SRX246)
      against placebo, in adults with DSM-5 Intermittent Explosive Disorder (IED).

      Adult Male and Female subjects with a current DSM-5 diagnosis of IED will be enrolled.  All
      subjects will undergo systematic diagnostic assessment for DSM-5 Axis I and II disorders.
      Subjects with DSM-5 IED (without current, co-morbid, DSM-5 Major Depression) whose: (a) Life
      History of Aggression (LHA) score is &gt; 12, (b) Overt Aggression Scale Modified (OAS-M)
      &quot;Irritability&quot; score is &gt; 6 and, (c) screening OAS-M &quot;Aggression&quot; score is &gt; 15, will be
      entered into a two-week baseline lead-in phase.

      After the lead-in phase, study subjects who continue to meet OAS-M criteria will be
      randomized to one of the two (2) treatment conditions and stratified by gender so that equal
      numbers of males and females are assigned to SRX246 and Placebo Groups.  Those who do not
      meet the criteria will exit the protocol at that time.  Treatment Conditions: (a) 8-week
      course of SRX246 (4 weeks at 120 mg bid, and 4 weeks at 160 mg bid) or (b) 8-week course of
      Placebo, followed by a one-week &quot;taper&quot; to withdraw subjects from study medication.

      IED subjects in all conditions will have structured diagnostic interview sessions and
      questionnaires administered throughout the trial.  Blinding to treatment condition will be
      maintained by using different personnel for these activities.  Analysis of a change from
      baseline in the diagnostic measures will be performed.
