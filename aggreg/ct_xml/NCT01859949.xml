    <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship.  An SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent are events between first dose of study drug and up to &lt;X&gt; days after last dose that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state.</description>
