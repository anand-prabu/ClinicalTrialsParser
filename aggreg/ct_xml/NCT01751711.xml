  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The destruction of the World Trade Center (WTC) resulted in long-term adverse health effects
      for workers and volunteers involved in rescue and recovery (2002; 2004a; 2004b; Skloot et
      al. 2004). In addition, increasing data demonstrate persistent adverse health effects for
      local residents as well as for the responders (Lin in press; Reibman 2004).

      Screening programs for responders, funded by the CDC-NIOSH have included extensive medical,
      mental and exposure histories, combined with physical examinations, chest x-rays, and
      spirometry Screening programs for health effects in residents have been much more limited
      and have only studied selective populations; to date, our studies are the most comprehensive
      - and consisted of simple questionnaires with limited spirometry. The results of these
      studies, have now led to the recognition of extensive adverse health outcomes in the
      residential, as well as the worker and volunteer populations.

      Despite this information, many individuals, workers as well as residents, may not recognize
      that their ailments may be related to WTC exposures. Few programs exist that educate these
      populations as well as provide supportive services for medical treatment. Individuals with
      medical insurance may have sought care among health care providers but many individual
      practitioners have varying expertise in the predominantly pulmonary and mental health
      disorders experienced by these populations. Those lacking insurance may have gone untreated.
      The goal of this application will therefore be to address this unmet need by providing a
      multi-disciplined, comprehensive evaluation and treatment program for individuals with
      suspected World Trade Center-related health issues.

      Target populations who will participate in the Bellevue Hospital Red Cross WTC Health
      Impacts Program will include:

        -  residents (children and adults) of Lower Manhattan communities at the time of the
           attacks, who remained or returned to their homes soon after the attacks

        -  individuals involved in debris removal in surrounding commercial and residential
           buildings,

        -  individuals involved in rescue, recovery and debris removal who have been previously
           screened through the World Trade Center Worker and Volunteer Medical Screening Program
           and are in need of continued treatment.

      Goals of the Bellevue Red Cross WTC Health Impacts program will be to provide:

        -  Medical evaluation and treatment for suspected WTC-associated illness Initial medical
           evaluation or medical consultation with an integrated mental health and social service
           needs assessment Subspecialty testing or consultation for diagnosis and further
           evaluation of suspected WTC-associated illness

             -  Treatment for WTC-associated limited or prolonged illness

             -  Development of a multi-discipline referral program with preferred practitioners
                for:

                  1. Specialty care health needs

                  2. Primary care health needs

                  3. Mental health care needs

        -  Collaboration with WTC Worker and Volunteer Medical Screening and Monitoring Program to
           develop practice suggestions for further evaluation and diagnostic testing,
           interpretation of testing, and treatment of individuals with suspected WTC-associated
           health problems

        The populations to be served will consist predominantly of a) local residents who were
        impacted by the dispersion of the WTC dusts and fumes, b) individuals involved in cleaning
        and debris removal of local commercial spaces, and c) responders to the WTC collapse.
        These populations will be recruited from past and ongoing programs that we have developed
        as well as from ongoing collaborations with community organizations that include: the
        Beyond Ground Zero Network, 9/11 Environmental Action committee, and the WTC Residents
        Coalition. In addition, we will collaborate with the Charles B. Wang Community Health
        Center and the centers involved in the ongoing WTC Workers and Volunteer Medical Screening
        and Monitoring Program.
