Patients\n           also receive high-dose cytarabine IV over 3 hours every 12 hours for 4 infusions on\n           days 2-3 and days 9-10.\n\n      Patients who achieve a major response receive a second course of induction therapy.\n\n        -  Consolidation: Patients who achieve complete remission receive bryostatin 1 IV over 24\n           hours on days 1 and 10 and high-dose cytarabine IV over 3 hours every 12 hours for 2\n           infusions on days 2 and 9. Treatment continues for up to 6 courses in the absence of\n           disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Patients who achieve a response and subsequently relapse may receive additional induction\n      and consolidation therapy at the discretion of the investigator.\n\n      Patients are followed every 6 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-46 patients will be accrued for this study."
