Patients,\n      who received goserelin treatment in the main trial, will get a degarelix starting dose (240\n      mg; 40 mg/mL) at the first visit and continue on degarelix treatment. The purpose of this\n      2-year extension trial is to collect long-term safety and tolerability data for the\n      one-month dosing regimen."
