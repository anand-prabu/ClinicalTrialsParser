Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells.\n      Combining radiation therapy with chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of chemotherapy using cisplatin and\n      etoposide, radiation therapy, and surgery, with adjuvant therapy using cisplatin and\n      etoposide, in treating patients who have stage III non-small cell lung cancer."

Assess the feasibility and toxic effects of 2 courses of cisplatin/etoposide\n      given concurrently with continuous, fractionated chest irradiation followed by surgical\n      resection and boost chemotherapy in patients with Pancoast tumors without mediastinal or\n      supraclavicular nodal involvement. II. Assess the objective response rate, resectability\n      rate, and proportion of patients free of microscopic residual disease after such treatment.\n\n      OUTLINE: All patients receive Induction on Regimen A and, in the absence of progression,\n      proceed to Regimen B, then C. Patients who refuse or are medically unfit for surgery\n      following Regimen A proceed directly to Regimen C. Regimen A: 2-Drug Combination\n      Chemotherapy plus Radiotherapy. Cisplatin, CDDP, NSC-119875; Etoposide, VP-16, NSC-141540;\n      plus irradiation of the tumor and ipsilateral supraclavicular region using megavoltage\n      equipment (photons with peak energies of 4-15 MV). Regimen B: Surgery. Tumor resection.\n      Regimen C: 2-Drug Combination Chemotherapy. CDDP; VP-16.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 99 patients will be accrued over 2-4 years."
