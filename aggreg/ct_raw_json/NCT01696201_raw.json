Recent research findings indicate that antenatal maternal mood\n      state impacts on babies health. Nowadays, many researchers are focussed on examining the\n      effects of physical exercise on foetal and maternal outcomes.\n\n      The main aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of a supervised exercise program\n      consisted of 25-30 minutes of cardiovascular exercise,10 minutes of specific exercises\n      (strength and balance exercises), and 10 minutes of pelvis floor muscles training, on the\n      prevention and treatment of depression in pregnant women. Additionally, the other purpose of\n      the study was to analyze the effects of depression and physical exercise on outcomes.\n\n      Hypothesis: Pregnant women who do regular exercise during their pregnancies would have a\n      better mood state than pregnant women who are sedentary, without having any negative effect\n      on outcomes."
