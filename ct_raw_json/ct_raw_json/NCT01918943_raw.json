            "textblock": "Lumbar spinal fusion was introduced approximately 70 years ago and has evolved as a\n      treatment option for symptomatic spinal instability, spinal stenosis, spondylolisthesis, and\n      degenerative scoliosis.\n\n      Many techniques evolved since then, from wiring, rods, pedicle screws, and recently\n      inter-spinous fixation devices like the Aspen. Along its evolutionary trail, various methods\n      for achieving circumferential fusion have arisen. Distinct from staged anterior/posterior\n      fusion techniques, two methods of achieving an interbody fusion from a posterior approach\n      have emerged: posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) and transforaminal lumbar interbody\n      fusion (TLIF). Recently, the lateral approach for interbody fusion (XLIF) has became a more\n      common technique, requiring in some cases, complemental posterior fixation with pedicle\n      screws, facet screws or interspinous fixation devices like the Aspen device.\n\n      In this study, we address the clinical and radiological outcome of a novel technique using\n      standard PLIF interbody fusion and insertion of the Aspen device via posterior lumbar\n      approach."
