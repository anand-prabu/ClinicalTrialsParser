    <textblock>
      The study is being done to compare the combination of lenalidomide and dexamethasone
      followed by autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplant (PBSCT) and lenalidomide and
      dexamethasone without PBSCT in patients with untreated multiple myeloma. This comparison
      will include how many subjects respond to each study treatment combination, how long their
      responses last, whether they live longer, and what side effects are caused by each
      combination.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial will compare complete response rates and duration of complete response of patients
      receiving at least 6 to 8 cycles of therapy with lenalidomide plus low-dose dexamethasone
      and reached plateau of best response (Arm B) versus patients receiving 4 cycles of therapy
      with lenalidomide plus low-dose dexamethasone followed by autologous peripheral blood stem
      cell transplant conditioned with 200 mg/m2 melphalan (Arm A). Provide a brief abstract
      summarizing the specific aims, experimental design, methods and subject population.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must have histologically or cytologically confirmed Multiple Myeloma,
             Salmon-Durie Stage II or III or International Staging System II or III that has not
             been previously treated.  (See Appendix E)

          -  Bone marrow plasmacytosis with &gt; or = 10% plasma cells, or sheets of plasma cells or
             a biopsy-proven plasmacytoma which must be obtained up to 6 weeks prior to
             registration.

          -  Measurable levels of monoclonal protein (M protein): 1 g/dL IgG or .5 g/dL IgA on
             serum protein electrophoresis or &gt; 200 mg of monoclonal light chain on a 24 hour
             urine protein electrophoresis which must be obtained within 4 weeks prior to
             registration.  If both serum and urine monoclonal components are present, both must
             be followed in order to evaluate response.

        Serum free light chains (FLC) should be measured with each SPEP and is recommended to
        monitor for subjects with light chain disease.  Non-secretory MM subjects will be included
        if they have measurable parameters to follow, e.g. extramedullary plasmocytoma or
        measurable bone marrow infiltration, or FLC level ≥ 10 mg/dL (≥ 100 mg/L) provided serum
        FLC ratio is abnormal.29 Both SPEP and UPEP must be performed within 28 days prior to
        registration. For subjects presenting with aggressive disease or requiring immediate
        intervention, up to two weeks or two pulses of high dose dexamethasone (40 mg x 4 days = 1
        pulse) is allowed, prior to the start of study treatment.  If dexamethasone is given at
        reduced dose, the total allowed dose is 320 mg prior to enrollment.  Prior systemic
        glucocorticosteroid use for the treatment of non-malignant disorders is permitted;
        concurrent use after subject is on study treatment of non-malignant disorders is
        permitted; concurrent use for non-malignant disorders after a subject is on study
        treatment is permitted, but should be restricted to the equivalent of prednisone 10mg per
        day. Prior or concurrent topical or localized glucocorticosteroid therapy to treat
        non-malignant comorbid disorders is permitted.

        Subjects should not have received any radiation for the preceding 4 weeks before entry
        onto the study.  Exception: local radiation therapy for symptomatic bone lesions (eg,
        uncontrolled pain or high risk of pathologic fracture), superior or inferior vena cava
        syndrome, spinal cord compression or extramedullary soft tissue lesions, as clinically
        indicated to relieve severe symptoms.  Subjects with prior solitary plasmacytoma treated
        with radiation therapy with curative intent are eligible if the disease has now progressed
        to active multiple myeloma meeting all the eligibility criteria for this protocol.

          -  Age &gt;18 years.

          -  Life expectancy of greater than 12 months.

          -  ECOG performance status &lt;2 (Karnofsky &gt;60%) (See Appendix B).

             within 4 weeks prior to registration:

        Hgb &gt; 9 g/dL (which may be supported by transfusion or growth factors) Absolute Neutrophil
        Count &gt;1,500/ ml (use of growth factors to meet screening requirements is not permitted)
        Platelets &gt;50,000/mm3 (administration of platelet transfusions during screening to meet
        eligibility criteria is not allowed.  However, platelet transfusions may be administered
        as clinically indicated to subjects in both treatment arms who have begun lenalidomide
        therapy) Total Bilirubin &lt;1.5 mg/dL AST(SGOT) / ALT(SGPT) &lt;2.5 X institutional upper limit
        of normal Creatinine &lt;2.0 mg/dL (subjects with creatinine &gt; 2 should receive lenalidomide
        according to the dosing schedule (Appendix C).

        Creatinine Clearance &gt;50 ml/min (estimated). Subjects with creatinine clearance &lt; 50
        ml/min should receive lenalidomide according to the dosing schedule (Appendix C).

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent
             document.  Subject must be informed of the investigational nature of this study.

          -  Subjects with a history of prior malignancy are eligible provided there is no active
             malignancy and a low expectation of recurrence within 6 months.

          -  Subjects must be willing and able to take prophylaxis with either aspirin at 81
             mg/day or alternative prophylaxis with either low molecular weight heparin or
             warfarin as recommended.

          -  Subjects who are eligible for transplant with an age up to and including 75 years.

          -  Subjects in ARM A who are refusing transplant can go onto ARM B and will be evaluated
             separately.

          -  All study participants must be registered into the mandatory RevAssist® program, and
             be willing and able to comply with the requirements of RevAssist®.

          -  Females of childbearing potential (FCBP) must have a negative serum or urine
             pregnancy test with a sensitivity of at least 50 mIU/mL within 10 - 14 days prior to
             and again within 24 hours of prescribing lenalidomide (prescriptions must be filled
             within 7 days) and must either commit to continued abstinence from heterosexual
             intercourse or begin TWO acceptable methods of birth control, one highly effective
             method and one additional effective method AT THE SAME TIME, at least 28 days before
             she starts taking lenalidomide.  FCBP must also agree to ongoing pregnancy testing.
             Males must agree to use a latex condom during sexual contact with a FCBP even if they
             have had a successful vasectomy.  (See Appendix D: Risks of Fetal Exposure, Pregnancy
             Testing Guidelines and Acceptable Birth Control Methods)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy for multiple myeloma prior to
             entering the study. Patients should not have received any radiation for the preceding
             4 weeks before entry onto the study. Exception: local radiation therapy for
             symptomatic bone lesions (e.g., uncontrolled pain or high risk of pathologic
             fracture), superior or inferior vena cava syndrome, spinal cord compression or
             extramedullary soft tissue lesions, as clinically indicated to relieve severe
             symptoms. Patients with prior solitary plasmacytoma treated with radiation therapy
             with curative intent are eligible if the disease has now progressed to active
             multiple myeloma meeting all the eligibility criteria for this protocol.

          -  Patients receiving any other investigational agents or therapy within 28 days of
             baseline.

          -  Patients with known brain metastases will be excluded from this clinical trial
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse
             events.

          -  Patients who are pregnant or breast feeding. Due to the potential teratogenic
             properties of lenalidomide, the use of this drug in patients that are pregnant is
             absolutely contraindicated. Further, all women of childbearing potentialFCBP and
             sexually active males must agree to avoid conception while participating in this
             study. Specifically, women of childbearing potentialFCBP must either agree to refrain
             from sexual intercourse or employ a dual method of contraception, one of which is
             highly effective (IUD, birth control pills, tubal ligation or partners vasectomy),
             and another additional method (condom, diaphragm, or cervical cap) for 4 weeks prior
             to receiving lenalidomide, and for four weeks after discontinuing this therapy.
             Sexually active males cannot participate unless they agree to use a condom (even if
             they have undergone a prior vasectomy) while having intercourse with a woman of child
             bearing potentialFCBP while taking lenalidomide and for four weeks after stopping
             treatment. Women of child bearing potentialFCBP (those who have not had a
             hysterectomy or the absence of menstrual periods for at least 24 consecutive months)
             must have a negative pregnancy test 10-14 days prior to the initiation of therapy and
             a repeat negative pregnancy test 24 hours prior to the initiation of lenalidomide.

          -  Inability to comply with study and/or follow-up procedures.

          -  Patients with a history of previous deep vein thrombosisDVT or pulmonary embolismPE
             must be on anticoagulation therapy with low molecular weight heparin or warfarin at
             therapeutic dosages (e.g. INR 2-3).

          -  If a patient is on full-dose anticoagulants, the following criteria should be met for
             enrollment:

          -  Must not have active bleeding or pathological conditions that carry high risk of
             bleeding (e.g. tumor involving major vessels, known varices).

          -  Must not have thrombocytopenia requiring transfusion.

          -  Must have a platelet count &gt;50,000.

          -  Must have stable INR between 2-3.

          -  Patients with smoldering myeloma or monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined
             significance (MGUS) are not eligible.

          -  Patients must not have active, uncontrolled infection.

          -  Patients must not have active, uncontrolled seizure disorder. Patients must have had
             no seizures in the last 6 months.

          -  Concurrent use of other anti-cancer agents or treatments.

          -  Known positive for HIV or infectious hepatitis, type B or C.

          -  Known hypersensitivity to thalidomide.

          -  Any condition, including the presence of laboratory abnormalities, which places the
             subject at unacceptable risk if he/she were to participate in the study or confounds
             the ability to interpret data from the study.
