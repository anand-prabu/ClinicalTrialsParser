The detailed pathogenesis of exacerbations of\n      bronchiectasis, however, remains poorly understood.\n\n      Recent data suggested that airway infection and inflammation are important drivers of\n      exacerbations,therefore the imbalance between chronic bacterial infection and host immune\n      response may result in bronchiectasis exacerbations. Viral infection may be an important\n      factor that leads to this events.It has been established that respiratory viruses are mainly\n      responsible for the exacerbations of other chronic respiratory diseases, i.e. asthma, COPD\n      and cystic fibosis. However, the data regarding prospective studies that sought to\n      investigate the roles of viruses in acute exacerbation of bronchiectasis are lacking.\n      Furthermore,the associations between viruses and bacteria during exacerbation need to be\n      assessed. This study targets at indentifying the frenquency of common viral infections in\n      adults with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis and may shed light on the effects they have\n      on clinical parameters,i.e. the length of exacerbated symptom to recovery,lung function,\n      pulmonary inflammation, bacterial load and quality of life."
