In addition, the\n      relationship between activation of immune cells and biochemical markers of that activation\n      will be studied.\n\n      Treatment of patients with HIV infection must address both the primary viral infection and\n      the subsequent immune deficiency, which is the primary cause of mortality in AIDS. In vitro\n      studies of ampligen have shown it will inhibit HIV infection. Ampligen may also minimize the\n      toxicity of many drugs used in the treatment of AIDS and induce an antiviral state in the\n      brain that may be useful in treating neurologic symptoms of HIV infection. The time course\n      and degree of immunologic response to ampligen remain unknown although they are essential\n      for proper use of the drug in the treatment of HIV infection and perhaps other clinical\n      problems."
