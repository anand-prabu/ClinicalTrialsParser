            "textblock": "This study will test the safety and effectiveness of a protein called E-selectin, given as a\n      nasal spray, in preventing the formation of blood clots that can cause stroke.  In animal\n      studies, animals that received E-selectin in the nose on a regular schedule had almost no\n      strokes compared with those that did not receive it.\n\n      Patients over age 45 who have had a stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) within 1 to 4\n      months of this study may be eligible to participate.  Candidates will be screened with a\n      review of their past medical records and neurologic and medical evaluations that may include\n      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain, ultrasound or magnetic resonance angiography\n      (a type of MRI) of the carotid arteries (arteries in the neck that supply blood to the\n      brain), echocardiography (ultrasound test of the heart), electrocardiography (EKG) and blood\n      tests.\n\n      Participants will have a blood and urine test and will be assigned to one of four treatment\n      groups.  Patients in each group will spray a small amount of fluid into their nose according\n      to the following schedule: 5 doses once every other day for 10-days, followed in 3 weeks by\n      another 5 doses every other day for 10-days, followed in 3 weeks by a final series of 5\n      doses every other day for 10 days.  The spray for patients in each group contains the\n      following:\n\n        -  Group 1 - fluid with low dose of E-selectin\n\n        -  Group 2 - fluid with medium dose of E-selectin\n\n        -  Group 3 - fluid with high dose of E-selectin\n\n        -  Group 4 - fluid with no E-selectin\n\n      Patients will be seen for follow-up visits at 1 month and 3 months after starting E-selectin\n      therapy.  The visits will include a neurologic examination and blood and urine tests.\n      Patients will be contacted by phone, fax or e-mail in between the 1- and 3-month visits."

            "textblock": "In the United States, stroke is the third leading cause of death and the leading cause of\n      disability.  Despite the success of recent clinical trials of antithrombotic drugs for the\n      secondary prevention of stroke, annually about 10% of patients with recent cerebrovascular\n      accidents have recurrent strokes.  The development of new treatment strategies for the\n      secondary prevention of stroke is an important issue for modern medicine.  There is\n      increasing evidence that inflammation at the sites of endothelial activation plays an\n      important role in the pathogenesis of stroke.  Control of molecular inflammation at the\n      sites of endothelial activation can be achieved by induction of mucosal tolerance.  The\n      induction of mucosal tolerance with repeated, low-dose, intranasal administration of antigen\n      causes a shift of immune response from proinflammatory T(H)1 type to anti-inflammatory T(H)2\n      type at the sites of inflammation.  E-selectin is an adhesion molecule expressed only on\n      activated endothelium in response to proinflammatory cytokines.  The major goal of proposed\n      study is to test whether repeated administration of low-dose, intranasal E-selectin can\n      induce mucosal tolerance to this compound causing a shift of immune response from T(H)1 to\n      T(H)2 type in patients with recent stroke or TIA, and secondly to evaluate the safety and\n      tolerability of this strategy for the secondary prevention of stroke."
