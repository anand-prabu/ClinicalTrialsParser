    <textblock>
      In the context of improved survival from HIV infection itself, chronic obstructive pulmonary
      disease (COPD); a form of lung disease that includes emphysema, which makes breathing
      difficult) is emerging as an important cause of morbidity and perhaps ultimately mortality
      in this population. HIV-infected patients are at increased risk of chronic obstructive
      pulmonary disease, likely due to multiple factors, including an increased presence of
      smoking, chronic inflammation and progression of immunodeficiency, oxidant stress (excessive
      levels of natural chemicals called oxidants and free radicals that can damage tissue), and
      respiratory infections. While natural history data on COPD are limited in the era of potent
      antiretroviral therapy, earlier data suggest that the course of emphysema may be accelerated
      in this population. Our preliminary data suggest that several matrix metalloproteinases
      (MMPs) derived from alveolar macrophages (a type of immune cell found in the lungs) have an
      increased cellular response in HIV-infected smokers, which could contribute to accelerated
      emphysema.  Matrix metalloproteinases are enzymes that break down the structural support of
      tissues, including the airways in the lung.

      Based on these observations, the investigators hypothesize that pharmacologic inhibition of
      matrix metalloproteinases by doxycycline will favorably modify the natural history of
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in HIV-infected patients. To test this hypothesis, the
      investigators propose conducting a proof of concept pilot study as a prelude to a possible
      phase II randomized, placebo-controlled trial (testing safety and efficacy in a larger
      population controlled with a &quot;sugar pill&quot;) of doxycycline for COPD in HIV-infected patients
      should the proof of concept be successful. Our research team, led by a
      pulmonologist/researcher with expertise in HIV-associated COPD and an infectious diseases
      specialist/clinical trials expert, is well positioned to propose such a trial to the
      NIH-funded AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG).

      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is emerging as an important cause of morbidity
      in HIV-infected patients, likely due to multiple factors, including an increased prevalence
      of smoking, chronic inflammation and immune activation, oxidant stress and respiratory
      infections. Our preliminary data suggest that several lung matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)
      are upregulated in HIV-infected smokers, which could contribute to accelerated emphysema by
      virtue of their ability to degrade extracellular matrix and basement membrane components.
      Our aims are: (1) end, we first propose to conduct a pilot study to enable us to address the
      following Specific aims: Aim 1. To determine the safety, tolerability, and biologic effects
      of twice daily doxycycline for 6 months in HIV-infected subjects with COPD; and (2) to
      prepare and submit an application for a phase II clinical trial of doxycycline for COPD in
      HIV-infected subjects. To address the first aim, we will conduct a randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled pilot study of doxycycline 100 mg twice daily in 30 HIV-infected subjects
      with COPD(2:1 doxy:placebo). The primary endpoint will be safety/tolerability and secondary
      endpoints will include change in FEV1, reduction of MMP activity in epithelial lining fluid
      and cells obtained by bronchoscopy and doxycycline levels in blood, ELF and bronchoalveolar
      lavage (BAL) cell pellets. In addition to providing novel insights into the biologic effects
      of doxycycline in the lung, the pilot study will inform selection of endpoints for a phase
      II trial, which ultimately will address an unmet medical need for novel interventions for
      COPD/emphysema in HIV-infected patients.
