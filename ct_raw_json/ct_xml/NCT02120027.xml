  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Irritable Bowel Syndrome with diarrhoea (IBS-D) is a functional gastrointestinal disorder
      characterised by chronic or recurrent abdominal pain or discomfort and diarrhoea. This trial
      aims at the evaluation of the efficacy and safety of oral ibodutant 10 mg once daily as
      compared to placebo in women with IBS-D over a 24-week treatment period
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study evaluates the efficacy and safety of ibodutant 10 mg, given once daily for 24
      weeks in comparison with placebo in female IBS-D patients. Randomisation to ibodutant and
      placebo will be 1:1. Efficacy is evaluated in terms of weekly response for abdominal pain
      intensity and stool consistency over 24 weeks of treatment in at least 50% of the weeks of
      treatment.

      The clinical phase of the study comprises up to 2 weeks of screening for patient's
      eligibility, a 2-week run-in period (treatment-free) for IBS severity assessment, a first
      24-week double-blind treatment period, a second 26-week re-randomised treatment period
      period and a 2-week safety follow-up, resulting in a maximum 58-week overall duration of the
      study for each patient.

      Patients report their IBS-related symptoms daily in a telephone-based electronic diary from
      run-in until end of treatment.
