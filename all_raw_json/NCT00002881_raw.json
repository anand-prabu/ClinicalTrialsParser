            "textblock": "OBJECTIVES: I. Compare time to progression and survival in patients with metastatic or\n      recurrent adenocarcinoma of the prostate treated with orchiectomy or LHRH analogue (i.e.\n      leuprolide or goserelin) plus flutamide with vs. without suramin and hydrocortisone. II.\n      Compare these two treatments with respect to qualitative and quantitative toxic effects.\n      III. Evaluate normalization of prostatic-specific antigen (PSA), duration of PSA response,\n      and the use of PSA as a surrogate marker of tumor response in these patients. IV. Compare\n      these two treatments with respect to quality of life and pain status.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified by their choice of androgen\n      suppression technique and by participating institution. Within 3 days after randomization,\n      all patients receive daily flutamide. On day 4, patients undergo orchiectomy or begin\n      monthly LHRH analogue therapy with leuprolide or goserelin. Patients randomized to receive\n      suramin begin a 12-week course 8-25 days after orchiectomy/LHRH therapy. Hydrocortisone\n      replacement therapy begins concomitantly with suramin and continues for at least 3 months\n      after the completion of suramin treatment or until disease progression intervenes. Patients\n      are followed every 3 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 800-1,000 patients will be entered within 3.25 to 4.25 years."
