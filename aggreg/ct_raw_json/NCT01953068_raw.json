            "textblock": "Up to 50% of patients undergoing surgical aortic valve operation suffer from some level of\n      post-operative cognitive dysfunction (POCD). Frontal lobes of the brain, where executive\n      functions are located, are highly susceptible to trauma caused by possible blood\n      malperfusion to these areas of the brain during surgery. Conventional and established\n      neuropsychological test methods are poor in distinguishing these kinds of trauma, as they\n      are isolated, structured tests that do not require multitasking and processing of multiple\n      stimuli at the same time.\n\n      The phase 1 goal of this study is to employ an experimental Executive reaction time (RT)\n      test to see if this method could improve objective detection of subtle brain dysfunction\n      assumed to underlie persistent cognitive, somatic, and affective complaints reporter by\n      patients who have undergone cardiac surgery. Phase 2 of the study will explore whether EEG\n      recording reflecting the physiological state of the brain during the RT test provides any\n      relevant additional information compared to the stand-alone RT test."
