To investigate the specific reasons healthcare workers and other individuals order or\n           request CT scans for ED patients.\n\n        3. To determine the frequency of clinically important actions following CT scan results.\n\n      Once the drivers of ED CT utilization are identified, interventions including education,\n      incentives for compliance with evidence-based best practices, and interventions for\n      noncompliance could be targeted appropriately."
