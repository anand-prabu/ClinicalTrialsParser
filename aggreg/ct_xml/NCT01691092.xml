  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to look at that involvement of a process in the brain called the
      glutamate system in depression.  Participants will undergo a screening session, up to two
      fMRI scans, and up to three PET scans, as well as cognitive testing at each scan session.
      For one of the PET scans, a drug (either ketamine or n-acetyl cysteine) will be
      administered.

      Hypothesis 1: The investigators hypothesize administration of ketamine or n-acetylcysteine
      (NAC) will lead to a decrease in mGluR5.

      Hypothesis 2: The investigators  hypothesize an improvement in memory and attentional skills
      after drug challenge.

      Hypothesis 3: The investigators hypothesize an increase in mGluR5 availability and change in
      MRI measures post drug challenge as compared to baseline, signifying synaptogenesis.
