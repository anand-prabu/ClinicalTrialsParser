Unsuccessfully treated means that, despite the\n      participant was treated with an adequate dose of an appropriate oral antipsychotic for an\n      adequate period of time, previous treatment is considered unsuccessful due to lack of\n      efficacy, lack of tolerability or safety, lack of compliance and/or other reasons.\n      Throughout the study the investigators will adjust the dosage of each participant based on\n      the individual needs. In general, the recommended paliperidone ER dose will be 6 milligram\n      once daily. Participants can be either in- or outpatients and they may take their study drug\n      with or without food.
