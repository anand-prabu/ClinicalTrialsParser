  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aging US population threatens to overwhelm our healthcare infrastructure, especially
      since the rate of Alzheimer's disease (AD) alone is expected to triple in the coming
      decades. Memory cause functional impairment, reduced quality of life, increased caregiver
      burnout, and eventual institutionalization. The diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI)
      identifies those with memory deficits but who remain relatively independent in everyday
      life. MCI provides a window for interventions that target memory functioning. The proposed
      study focuses specifically on a groundbreaking combination of mnemonic rehabilitation and
      non-invasive brain stimulation. The main idea is that brain stimulation can enhance
      functioning in the specific brain regions/networks, thereby increasing the patients' ability
      to benefit from memory rehabilitation. This will be a randomized, double-blind study (active
      vs. fake brain stimulation), that provides multiple treatment session. Outcome will be
      examined using both laboratory-based and real-world memory testing as well as brain imaging.
      This first-of-its-kind study has the potential to meaningfully translate more &quot;basic&quot;
      science findings into neuroanatomically targeted and functionally meaningful treatments for
      our aging population.
