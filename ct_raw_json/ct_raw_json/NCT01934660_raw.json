            "textblock": "Background:\n\n      - Cardiometabolic diseases are a combination of medical disorders that, when they occur\n      together, increase the risk of heart disease and diabetes. Researchers want to learn if\n      there is a relationship between these diseases and inflammation (redness, swelling, and\n      pain). Inflammation affects the entire body. Researchers will study this relationship in\n      people with heart disease and diabetes, and compare it to healthy people.\n\n      Objectives:\n\n      - To learn if there are links between inflammation and cardiometabolic diseases.\n\n      Eligibility:\n\n        -  Adults 18 years of age or older with heart disease or diabetes.\n\n        -  Healthy volunteers 18 years of age or older.\n\n      Design:\n\n        -  Participants will have one study visit. At this visit they will have:\n\n        -  Blood taken with a needle in their arm.\n\n        -  An electrocardiogram. Small patches are stuck to the chest and limbs. A machine\n           measures electrical signals of the heart.\n\n        -  Some participants will also have a CT scan of their heart. A substance will be injected\n           through a tube in their arm. They will lie on a table in a large, donut-shaped machine.\n           An X-ray tube will move around their body, taking many pictures. This procedure can\n           last up to 2 hours.\n\n        -  Some participants will have other body scans (PET and MRI). The procedures are similar\n           to the CT scan. These other scans will last about 30 minutes total.\n\n        -  Some participants will have small samples of skin and fat tissue taken."

            "textblock": "Over the past two decades, the number of subjects with cardiometabolic diseases (CMD) such\n      as atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD), dyslipidemia, insulin resistance and\n      diabetes have been rising. Characterizing these disease states reveals that inflammation is\n      a common feature of CMD; however, mechanistic links between inflammation and these disease\n      states in humans remain poorly understood. In this protocol, we aim to characterize\n      inflammation within the blood vessels, blood, fat and skin in diabetes and coronary artery\n      disease compared to those without disease. We hypothesize that diabetes and coronary disease\n      will be systemic inflammatory states and will provide an important frame of reference for\n      parameters found on novel imaging techniques in another ongoing protocol trying to\n      understand how skin inflammation affects risk for CMD and CVD (13-H-0065)."
