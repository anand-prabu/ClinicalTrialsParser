Patients in placebo-controlled group will change to\n      take Triptolide wilfordii (20mg tid po) for another 24 weeks. All patients will be followed\n      up till 48 weeks. We hypothesis that Triptolide wilfordii might reduce immune activation and\n      inflammation of HIV immunological non-responders and increase CD4 T cell count, which\n      provides a new strategy for treatment of HIV-infected immunological non-responders."
