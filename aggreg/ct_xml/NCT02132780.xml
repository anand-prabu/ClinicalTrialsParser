  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a significant association between autonomic dysfunction and symptoms experienced by
      NAFLD patients mediated by increased systemic inflammation and insulin resistance, resulting
      in deteriorating quality of life of affected patients; fatigue and other symptoms drive
      worsening autonomic dysfunction in these patients. We aim to describe the severity of
      autonomic dysfunction (AD) in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and the relationship
      of AD to symptoms experienced by NAFLD patients (such as fatigue, chronic pain, depression,
      sleep disturbance, and cognitive dysfunction), and to the quality of life of NAFLD patients.
      We also hope to examine the impact of systemic inflammation and insulin resistance as
      mediators of manifestations of AD and symptoms experienced by NAFLD patients.

  <detailed_description>

      Aim 1. Describe the severity of AD in NAFLD and the relationship of AD to symptoms
      experienced by NAFLD patients (fatigue, chronic pain, depression, sleep disturbance, and
      cognitive dysfunction) (Aim 1a) and to the quality of life of NAFLD patients (Aim 1b).
      Primary screening for inclusion/exclusion criteria will be done at the VCUHS clinic.
      Subjects meeting inclusion criteria will be approached about study participation during
      their routine NAFLD clinic visit. Those who agree to participate in the study will return
      for a study visit at the CCTR Clinical Research Services. All subjects will be asked to fast
      and avoid caffeine for 12 hours prior to study visit. Demographic and clinical data will be
      collected by study coordinators. After a focused exam, conducted by a hepatologist to
      determine health status of the participants, the PI and a research nurse will interview
      participants to assess their symptoms and AD (Aim 1). Blood (20 ml) samples will be
      collected via venipuncture for serum and plasma inflammatory markers and IR (Aim 2).

      Aim 2. Examine the impact of systemic inflammation (SI) and insulin resistance (IR) as
      mediators of manifestations of AD and symptoms experienced by NAFLD patients. Increased
      presence of adipocytes may produce high, chronic levels of cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF-α
      resulting in higher levels of APRPs which contribute to overall inflammation as well as
      cognitive decline and fatigue. Secondly, elevated levels of IL-6 and TNF-α lower levels of
      CTRPs which exacerbate IR, AD, and muscle and cardiac problems reported in NAFLD. Through
      the use of plasma analysis, levels of cytokines such as IL-6, TNF-α, and APRPs can be
      performed in a high throughput BioPlex® assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.: Hercules, CA). We
      have extensive experience with these types of assays and have generated data using human
      samples in numerous studies conducted through the Center of Excellence for Biobehavioral
      Approaches to Symptom Management (CEBASM) at the School of Nursing. CTRP family members are
      also expressed in the plasma and at detectible levels. We will perform ELISA analysis to
      compare circulating levels of the various CTRPs using commercially available CTRP ELISA
      kits/reagents. Insulin resistance (IR) will be assessed by HOMO-IR utilizing fasting glucose
      and insulin.
