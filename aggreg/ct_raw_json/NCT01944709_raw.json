Identification of a number of melanoma-specific tumor antigens that are shared\n      by tumors from different patients, provides attractive targets for immune-based therapies\n      (http://www.bioinfo.org.cn/hptaa/). Different approaches like DNA-/RNA-vaccines, peptide\n      vaccines and dendritic cell (DC) vaccines are under investigation to induce peptide-specific\n      immune responses. In various animal models and in clinical trials it was shown that the most\n      potent induction of anti tumor-specific killer cells was achieved with DC vaccination. DCs\n      are professional antigen presenting cells (APC) that are critical in the initiation of\n      cellular responses in na\u00efve T lymphocytes, in vivo. They are armed with all the molecules\n      needed for the induction of immune responses and have the capacity to migrate into secondary\n      lymphatic organs. In vitro generated dendritic cells are loaded with tumor derived peptides\n      and injected subcutaneously. The concept is to induce or to propagate already existing tumor\n      specific killer T cells."
