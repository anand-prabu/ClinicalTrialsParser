      Evaluate the long-term outcomes following operative and nonoperative treatment of childhood
      scoliosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that sagittal alignment and thoracic volumes will predict
      successful treatment outcomes as measured by improved pulmonary function and health-related
      quality of life in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis patients at a minimum 20-year follow-up.
      Significant focus has been placed on the coronal plane in order to determine treatment
      indications for scoliosis, but with new understanding about the important of sagittal
      balance and pulmonary function, the treatment indications should be broadened.  Thus, the
      investigators propose the following study to explore parameters associated with a durable
      and acceptable outcome following scoliosis treatment, minimizing the need for further
      surgery and to optimizing quality of life and pulmonary health.  Beyond the standard
      radiographs and Scoliosis Research Society (SRS) scores, this study undertakes a
      comprehensive assessment of health-related quality of life, chest asymmetry and body
      satisfaction scoring, sagittal plane parameters, and 3D modeling of the childhood and
      current spinothoracic deformity.  Thus, the investigators research team is uniquely poised
      to determine broader treatment indications for scoliosis.   The overarching goal of this
      research effort is to determine new parameters based on thoracic volume and sagittal plane
      alignment in addition to coronal deformity in order to determine the appropriate treatment
      threshold for surgical intervention in children with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis.
