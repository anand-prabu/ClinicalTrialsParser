    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to show if the adoptive cellular therapy with autologous
      dendritic cells and cytokine-induced killer cells (CIK) combined with concurrent
      chemoradiation could improve the quality of life of the patients with locally advanced
      esophageal cancer, compared with concurrent chemoradiation only.

    <description>Radiotherapy:Patients will be conducted CT simulation, and three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3DCRT) or Intensity-modulated radiation therapy(IMRT)was performed. 1.8-2.0 Gy/fraction, 5 fractions a week, with a total dose of 60-66Gy will be delivered for all patients by 6-MV-X-ray of linear accelerator.
Chemotherapy: Patients will be concurrently administered with irradiation every 4 weeks with PT regimen (cis-platinum of 20 mg/m2/d, d2-5; PTX(paclitaxel)of 80mg/m2/d, d1,d8) for 4 cycles.The chemotherapy will be concurrently given with irradiation.
DC-CIK Immunotherapy:Mononuclear cells were collected aseptically with blood cell separator composition apheresis 3 days before concurrent chemoradiation, and cultured DC-CIK cells for 10 days. Cells were infused back to the patients in 3 times between the Chemoradiation intermittent period.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  cytologically or histologically confirmed locally advanced esophageal carcinoma

          -  Age: &gt; 18

          -  Karnofsky performance status ≥ 70

          -  At least one measurable tumor lesions according to the RECIST criteria.

          -  Normal functions of heart, lung, liver, kidney and bone marrow

          -  Blood exams qualified for chemotherapy, which included hemoglobulin ≥9 g/dl,
