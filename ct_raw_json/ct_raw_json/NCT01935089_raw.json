To this end, we propose to enroll 25 HIV-1-infected subjects\n      (please refer to power calculations in section 10.1 below) currently stably suppressed (> 1y\n      with VL < 50 copies/ml) on ART and with CD4 count > 450 cells/\u00b5l.\n\n      We hypothesize that 20 weeks of treatment with Peg-IFN-alpha-2b, in the presence of HIV\n      reactivation (i.e.: ART interruption), will result in activation of intrinsic and/or\n      immune-mediated anti-HIV mechanisms resulting in a decrease in the levels of viral reservoir\n      in chronically HIV-infected, immune-reconstituted individuals."
