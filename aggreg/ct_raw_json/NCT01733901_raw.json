            "textblock": "Coronary heart disease is the leading cause of death worldwide, contributing to over 7.2\n      million deaths annually. The main measures of secondary prevention of coronary heart disease\n      are optimizing drug therapy and changing lifestyle. optimizing drug therapy, including\n      aspirin, beta receptor blockers, lipid regulating drugs (mostly statins, a small part\n      fibrates) and vascular angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. However, the situation for\n      secondary prevention of coronary heart disease is not satisfying. EuroASPIRE III survey\n      found that despite effective drug used in the primary or secondary prevention of coronary\n      heart disease, coronary heart disease risk factors, such as high blood glucose,hypertension,\n      high cholesterol and obesity, are still poorly controlled. At the same time sympathetic\n      activation plays an extremely important role in the development of coronary heart disease,\n      and high sympathetic activity after acute myocardial infarction is closely related to\n      malignant arrhythmia and heart failure. Recently, many clinical researches have verified\n      that catheter-based renal sympathetic denervation(RSD) can safely be used to substantially\n      reduce blood pressure, reduce left ventricular hypertrophy, improve glucose tolerance and\n      sleep apnea severity. Simultaneously, a marked reduction in muscle and whole-body\n      sympathetic-nerve activity(MSNA) is apparent, with a decrease in renal and whole-body\n      norepinephrine spillover. Hypertension, diabetes, high norepinephrine level and obstructive\n      sleep apnea are all recognized as risk factors for the development and recurrence of\n      coronary heart disease. So, we design this randomized parallel control clinical study to\n      demonstrate whether RSD can reduce the mortality and the recurrence rate of a composite of\n      cardiovascular event  in patients after PCI, besides whether RSD can reduce the risk factors\n      for coronary heart disease."
