Determine whether low-energy laser therapy can prevent oral mucositis in\n      patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Patients are\n      randomized to one of three treatment arms. Arm I: Patients undergo low-energy laser therapy\n      with visible red light (650 nm) daily over 15-20 minutes beginning on the first day of their\n      transplant conditioning regimen and continuing until day 2 after bone marrow\n      transplantation. Arm II: Patients undergo low-energy laser therapy with invisible infra-red\n      light (780 nm) daily on the same schedule as in arm I. Arm III: Patients undergo sham laser\n      therapy daily on the same schedule as in arm I. Patients are followed on days 3, 7, 10, 14,\n      18, 21, and 24.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 66 patients (22 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this\n      study."
