The HRME will then be inserted through the biopsy channel of the endoscope and gently placed against the mucosa. The endoscopist will image each WL-discrete lesion first from the most distal to the most proximal. For each HRME imaged site, an optical read will be obtained (neoplastic vs. non-neoplastic) followed by a tissue biopsy of the imaged areas."

We believe the HRME will\n      provide an in-vivo \"optical biopsy\" that will be comparable to gold standard histopathology\n      and allow the endoscopist to make a more informed decision about whether to obtain a biopsy\n      or even perform endoscopic therapy (i.e. endoscopic mucosal resection, EMR).\n\n      Specific aims of this project are in patients with known Barrett's esophagus:\n\n        1. to compare the diagnostic yield of HRME with directed biopsy to standard white light\n           endoscopy\n\n        2. to prospectively assess the potential clinical impact of HRME on the diagnosis and\n           endoscopic surveillance of BE neoplasia\n\n        3. to determine the diagnostic accuracy of HRME for the in-vivo diagnosis of neoplasia in\n           surveillance population of patients with BE\n\n        4. to compare the total procedure time for imaging and mucosal  biopsy acquisition of HRME\n           and WL and to determine the average HRME imaging time."
