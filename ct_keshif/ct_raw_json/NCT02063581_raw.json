Participants will be randomize d to one of two treatment\n      sequences to receive a single oral administration of i patasertib in tablet or capsule\n      formulation followed, after a washout period, by a single oral administration of ipatasertib\n      in the second formulation. Pharmaco kinetics will be assessed, and standard physical and\n      clinical evaluations will b e performed throughout the study. Time on study is expected to\n      be 2 weeks."
