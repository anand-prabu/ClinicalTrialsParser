If necessary for logistical purposes, participants may return\n      for the baseline visit and initiation of the first BSE intervention any time during the 14\n      days following eligibility assessment.  At the baseline visit (day 1), participants will\n      undergo baseline blood and buccal cell collection.  Blood collection will be performed by a\n      trained phlebotomist.
