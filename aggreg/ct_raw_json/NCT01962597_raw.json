The\n      primary outcome is walking speed over 4-metres. Secondary outcomes will include:\n\n      (i) short physical performance battery; (ii) health-related quality of life [EuroQOL-5D-5L];\n      (iii) Dialysis recovery time; (iv) Nottingham extended activities of daily living (EADL)\n      index; (v) Leg strength; (vi) body composition and anthropometry."
