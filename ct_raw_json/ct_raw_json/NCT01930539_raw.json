            "textblock": "Vitamin D plays an integral role in bone metabolism and is one of the principal hormonal\n      regulators of calcium and phosphorus absorption in the body. In 2011, the Endocrine Society\n      defined Vitamin D deficiency as a 25 hydroxy vitamin D below 20 ng/ml and vitamin D\n      insufficiency as a 25 hydroxy vitamin D of 21 ng/ml to 29 ng/ml.Without vitamin D, only 10\n      to 15% of dietary calcium and about 60% of phosphorus is absorbed.\n\n      Intestinal Rehabilitation clinic at University of Nebraska Medical Center includes patients\n      with short bowel syndrome, multiple abdominal fistulae, and altered GI motility.\n\n      Hypovitaminosis D is associated with increased parathyroid hormone secretion,increased bone\n      turnover, osteoporosis, histological osteomalacia and increased risk of hip and other\n      fractures, and, in its most severe expression,clinical osteomalacia. These patients have\n      been given high doses of both oral vitamin D2 and vitamin D3 supplementation without an\n      improvement in vitamin D status due to poor intestinal absorption . Standardized treatment\n      of vitamin D deficiency in most healthy individuals is achieved by giving vitamin D2 50,000\n      IU once a week for few weeks and then daily supplementation with lower doses. In the\n      investigators Intestinal rehabilitation clinic, these patients are vitamin D insufficient or\n      deficient while on large replacement doses of vitamin D2/D3 with some taking 200,000 IU\n      daily.\n\n      It has been reported that irradiation with Ultraviolet B can be used safely and effectively\n      to treat vitamin D deficiency among vitamin D deficient patients. Exposure of the body in a\n      bathing suit to 1 Minimum Erythemal Dose (MED) of sunlight is equivalent to ingesting about\n      10,000 IU to 25,000 IU of vitamin D. Thus, exposure of 6% to 10% of the body surface to 1\n      MED is equivalent to ingesting about 600 to 2500 IU of vitamin D. Although ultraviolet\n      irradiation can be achieved from exposure to sunlight, it is generally available only\n      seasonally and difficult for persons who are too ill to spend much time outdoors.\n      Ultraviolet-Fluorescent lamp (KBD, Inc, Crescent Springs, Kentucky,USA) was designed to use\n      ultraviolet B emitting fluorescent bulbs that have lower heat emission and allows a larger\n      area of skin exposure. The Lamp is equipped with a timer for improved safety. This device is\n      FDA (Food and Drug Administration) approved.\n\n      Baseline labs include 25 hydroxy D, intact parathyroid hormone and complete metabolic\n      profile. Patients will receive a 3 minute skin exposure to Ultraviolet B light and if they\n      do not develop a sun burn, they will be randomized to Control or Ultraviolet B light group.\n      Patients will continue their current dose of Vitamin D2/D3 for 12 weeks in both\n      groups.Ultraviolet B light will be administered in 3 different areas on the same day for 5\n      minutes each, once a week at a distance of 14 inches wearing an UV eye shield. Areas of skin\n      exposure will be based on rule of nine for body surface area which includes back, abdomen,\n      thighs, and arms.\n\n      Patients will get blood draws every 4 weeks to monitor response to Ultraviolet B light. If\n      Ultraviolet B light is able to increase total 25 hydroxy vitamin D level, it can potentially\n      be used at home by these patients after receiving basic training and instructions."
