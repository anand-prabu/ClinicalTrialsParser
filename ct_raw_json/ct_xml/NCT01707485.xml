  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the feasibility of testing whether a 5-day course of antibiotics
      is as effective as a 10-day course for the treatment of uncomplicated community-acquired
      pneumonia (CAP) in children.  To accomplish this, previously well children aged 1-10 years
      who present to McMaster Children's Hospital (MCH) emergency department (ED) with CAP will,
      if they consent, be randomly chosen to be given either a 5 day or 10 day course of
      amoxicillin.  Neither the child, the child's caregiver, nor the researchers will know
      whether the child is in the 5- or 10-day antibiotic group.  Once the child has received the
      medication and for two weeks after that, caregivers of children will be asked to complete a
      daily symptom diary for their child, and will come to MCH at the end of the two week period
      (between day 14-18) to be assessed by one of the researchers.  This information will then be
      used to compare both groups of children to determine if a 5 days of treatment is
      non-inferior to 10 days.  The investigators hypothesize that running such a trial is
      feasible.
