Micro-osteoperforation, PROPEL, is conducted under local or topical\n      anesthesia AFTER the subject is banded and bonded. The procedure will be randomized to\n      either the left or right side in each subject.  Following the procedure, Chlorhexidine\n      rinses are to begin twice a day for a week.\n\n      The subjects will be advised to take Tylenol only in case of significant pain. Subjects will\n      be seen four to six weeks after completion of treatment for the first follow-up. Subjects\n      will be followed up with a telephone consult 24 hours after micro-osteoperforation is\n      performed. They will be asked if any pain medication was taken after being dismissed from\n      the research center and if so, they will be asked the name and dose of medication taken.\n\n      Study will conclude at the 6 month follow up visit or when space on the treating side is\n      closed."
