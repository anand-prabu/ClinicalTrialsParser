  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to define the mean, variance, and dose
      proportionality for tenofovir-diphosphate(TFV-DP) in dried blood spots resulting from 33%,
      67%, and 100% of daily dosing with 200mg emtricitabine and 300mg of tenofovir disoproxil
      fumarate (as Truvada®). With this information, a model will be established to predict
      adherence rates to TFV-DP using DBS. Forty-eight healthy HIV-uninfected adult participants
      who are at low risk for HIV infection will be randomized to one of 6 sequences consisting of
      two directly observed dosing regimens, 33%/67%, 33%/100%, 67%/33%, 67%/100%, 100%/33%, and
      100%/67% with each dose regimen lasting approximately 12 weeks, separated by an
      approximately 12 week washout period. DBS will be collected at regular intervals, including
      during the washout. The hypothesis of the study is that levels of TFV-DP in DBS will predict
      adherence rates in the preceding 1-3 months.
