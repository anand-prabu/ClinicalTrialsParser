The cause of AD is currently poorly understood;\n      therefore, there are no targeted treatment options at present. There have been recent\n      studies in adults with AD that explain the cause and give us new routes to investigate\n      treatment options, however no major studies in this arena have been done in children. We\n      hope to evaluate the skin and blood biomarkers that are found in pediatric AD and compare\n      them to adult AD.\n\n      Hypothesis: The immune system worsens the skin barrier issues that are common in atopic\n      dermatitis. We believe there are similar immune and skin abnormalities in adult versus\n      pediatric atopic dermatitis. Finally, blood levels of the activated molecules in atopic\n      dermatitis can serve as surrogates for skin immune activation and will correlate with\n      disease severity."
