  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Visual impairment in high myopic eyes is mainly due to the different types of myopic
      maculopathies, such as diffuse or patchy atrophy, lacquer cracks and choroidal
      neovascularization. Macular hemorrhage was one of those complications. Despite choroidal
      neovascularization, simple hemorrhage from rupture of Bruch's membrane and choroidal
      microcirculation is also the cause of hemorrhage. The prognosis of those eyes with simple
      hemorrhage is generally good. However, some patients had persistently poor vision after the
      absorption of the hemorrhage. In the literature, the visual prognosis in those patients was
      reported to be associated with the microstructure change under the optical coherent
      tomography (OCT) or the presentation of the autofluorescence. The investigators will collect
      the patients with high myopia and presenting with macular hemorrhage. High resolution OCT
      and autofluorescence imaging will be used to analyze the change of the microstructure of
      retina and its correlation with the visual prognosis.
