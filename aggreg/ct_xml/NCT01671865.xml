  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to identify and study changes in muscle in people with
      facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy using magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is being done to compare muscle imaging findings in people with
      facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) to people without FSHD. Both magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) will be used to evaluate
      skeletal muscle in research participants. MRS is a type of imaging used to measure the
      levels of different chemicals in body tissues. It is done as part of a routine clinical MR
      exam in other parts of the body such as the brain, but has yet not been widely used in the
      musculoskeletal system.  This research is being done to assess the effectiveness of MRS and
      MRI in helping doctors measure the type and severity of musculoskeletal disease. The
      investigators also hope to use MRI and MRS in developing outcome measures that can be used
      in future clinical trials for FSHD.
