In vitro study and animal models have shown that Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSC)\n      have the capacity to differentiate into osteoblastic lineage and that platelet reach fibrin\n      can represent a clinical source of growth factors, able to accelerate the processes of\n      tissue repair. This study intend to highlight how these factors, associated to two different\n      preparations of bone allograft, may accelerate the formation of new host bone in patients\n      with osteonecrosis of the femoral head that represents a common condition in clinical\n      practice with an high socio-economic impact.\n\n      Primary objective of the study is to delay or avoid total hip replacement in patients with\n      early necrosis of the femoral head, using different methods of regenerative medicine.\n\n      Secondary end points are described below:\n\n        -  To assess differences in outcome related to features, etiology and localization of the\n           necrosis of the femoral head and to assess variation in post-operative return to daily\n           activities.\n\n        -  To characterize the osteogenetic and angiogenic potential of marrow-derived Mesenchymal\n           Stromal Cells (MSC) in patients with avascular necrosis of the femoral head, and to\n           correlate these features with medical history and clinical outcome."
