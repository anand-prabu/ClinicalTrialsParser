  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to compare the effectiveness of standard for our
      practice postoperative physical therapy (PT) program to a PT program that incorporates lower
      body positive pressure (LBPP) treadmill training for the patients after lumbar discectomy
      and fusion surgeries.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A prospective, randomized, parallel group controlled clinical study is proposed. The
      patients will be divided into the two study groups according to the surgical procedure:

        1. patients undergoing one-level microdiscectomy for lumbar herniated disc

        2. patients undergoing one-level lumbar fusion for degenerative disc disease without
           notable spinal stenosis.

      Each group will consist of 60 patients (see sample size calculations below) who will be
      randomized into the two equal groups to undergo:

        1. Standard postoperative rehabilitation program

        2. Standard postoperative rehabilitation program with addition of lower body positive
           pressure (LBPP) treadmill training

    <description>All patients will begin an early postoperative rehabilitation program and standard PT no later than 4 weeks following surgery and continue for at least 6 weeks. The duration of standard PT program could be extended depending on the patient needs. The patients randomized to undergo (LBPP) treadmill training will have an additional 7-week 3 times a week training on the antigravity</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adults between 18 and 65 years old

          -  Willing and able to comply with protocol and PT requirements

          -  Patients with primarily radicular and back pain due to degenerative disc disease
             requiring one-level discectomy for herniated disc or lumbar fusion between L2 and S1

          -  Willing and able to sign a study specific informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Require more than one-level surgery

          -  No previous lumbar surgery

          -  Any ongoing health condition that would make it difficult to adhere to postoperative
             PT requirements

          -  Peri-operative or post-operative complications (infection, pneumonia, nerve injury,
             dural tear, etc.) that would constraint or delay the ability to participate in
             postoperative PT

          -  BMI greater than 40

          -  Active local or systemic infection
