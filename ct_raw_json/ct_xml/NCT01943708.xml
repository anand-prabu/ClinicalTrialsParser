  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This single-blind randomised crossover trial aims to compare the efficacy of a novel
      Auto-CPAP algorithm (SPAP) to conventional CPAP. Up to 50 patients will be recruited from an
      OSA population, aged over 18.

      Auto-CPAP devices change therapeutic pressure based on the needs of the patient. Algorithms
      differ from machine to machine. This single-blind randomised crossover trial aims to compare
      the efficacy of SPAP (a novel Auto-CPAP algorithm) to conventional CPAP.

      Up to 50 patients will be recruited from an OSA population, aged over 18. Participants will
      consist of male and female patients diagnosed with moderate−severe OSA (Apnea Hypopnea Index
      (AHI) greater than or equal to 15 per hour. Eligible participants, according to the protocol
      approved by the Northern X Region Ethics Committee, providing written informed consent will
      be enrolled into the study. Patients will be enrolled sequentially according to the
      randomisation list. Patients will be randomised to CPAP or SPAP.

      The therapeutic pressure will be based on the most recent titration night of each patient.
      Comparisons between data will be made using a one-tailed t-test for non-inferiority of the
      SPAP algorithm compared with conventional CPAP therapy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Aged ≥18 years with mild-to-severe OSA (Apnea Hypopnea Index equal to or greater than
             5 per hour).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any medical condition which contraindicates (see Appendix A) the use of CPAP or
             AutoCPAP.

          -  Unstable cardiovascular disease (untreated or resistant hypertension acceptable).

          -  Unstable psychiatric disease.

          -  Other significant sleep disorder.

          -  Inability to tolerate CPAP due to nasal obstruction or claustrophobia, as determined
             by the investigation investigator.

          -  Any known factor or disease that might interfere with treatment compliance,
             investigation conduct or interpretation of the results such as psychiatric disease,
             history of non compliance to medical regimens, or unwillingness to comply with
             investigational requirements.

          -  Participation in another clinical trial in the previous month.

          -  Less than 2 hours recorded sleep in either arm
