Women of child bearing potential must have a negative\n             serum or urine pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of\n             HCG) within 7 days prior to beginning of treatment. Post-menopausal women (surgical\n             menopause of lack of menses >12 months) do not need to have a pregnancy test, please\n             document status.\n\n          -  Women of childbearing potential and sexually active males must use an effective\n             contraception method during treatment and for three months after completing\n             treatment.\n\n          -  Required Initial Laboratory Values:\n\n               -  Neutrophils \u2265 1,500/mm3\n\n               -  Platelet count \u2265 100,000/mm3\n\n               -  Creatinine \u2264 1.5 mg/dL -or- creatinine clearance \u2265 60 mL/min\n\n               -  Total bilirubin \u2264 1.5 x ULN\n\n               -  AST (SGOT) & ALT (SGPT) \u2264 2.5 x ULN\n\n               -  Alkaline phosphatases < 2.5x ULN\n\n          -  Abdominal CT scan with contrast and chest CT/x-ray (CT of chest preferred) within 31\n             days of registration on study. Patients allergic to IV contrast can have MRI of the\n             abdomen/pelvis instead.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  Patients with serious medical risk factors involving any of the major organ systems\n             such that the investigator considers it unsafe for the patient to receive FOLFOX-A\n\n          -  Prior hypersensitivity to Oxaliplatin or Abraxane that in the investigators opinion\n             would put the patient at risk if re-exposed\n\n          -  Patients with islet cell (neuroendocrine) tumors, cystadenomas, cystadenocarcinomas,\n             carcinoid tumors, duodenal carcinomas, distal bile duct, and ampullary carcinomas.\n\n          -  Prior systemic chemotherapy for pancreas cancer; note that prior chemotherapy for a\n             different cancer is allowable. Patients must not have received chemotherapy for a\n             year prior to registering on study\n\n          -  No prior invasive malignancy within the prior two years. However, patients with an\n             early stage malignancy that is not expected to require treatment in the next 2 years\n             (such as early stage, resected breast cancer or asymptomatic prostate cancer) are\n             eligible.
