Transient elastography is\n      a user friendly technique that can be easily performed at bedside or in outpatient clinic\n      with immediate results and good reproducibility.\n\n      Liver stiffness values ranges from 2.5 to 75 kPa with lower values <6kPa suggest no fibrosis\n      where as higher values above 14kPa suggests cirrhosis. In the present study the\n      investigators hypothesis that the investigators can differentiate ACLF and acute severe\n      viral hepatitis based on fibroscan as patients with underlying fibrosis with superadded\n      inflammation would have higher fibroscan value than when patient have only inflammation with\n      no underlying fibrosis and hence the investigators can avoid unnecessary test in such\n      subgroup."
