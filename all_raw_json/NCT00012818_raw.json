It is therefore important to find a cost effective\n      non-pharmaceutical treatment to help CHF patients manage the disease. The relaxation\n      response has been found to be effective in managing CHF-related conditions. With its\n      favorable physiological changes, the relaxation response is likely to benefit CHF patients.\n\n      Objectives:\n\n      1.  To evaluate the effects of a 15-week relaxation response intervention program on\n      improving functional capacity and health-related quality of life as compared with an ongoing\n      15-week educational program for cardiac disease management, and a control group of usual\n      cardiac care; 2.  To identify the costs of conducting the intervention and the cardiac care\n      education and the costs associated with cardiac care services; and to compare cost among\n      three study groups.\n\n      Methods:\n\n      This is a single-blind three-armed randomized trial in CHF patients who receive care at the\n      Boston VA Medical Center. Enrolled patients are randomly assigned, with equal numbers, to\n      one of the three study groups. Outcomes include cardiac functional capacity and\n      self-reported health-related quality of life. We also conduct a qualitative study to\n      interview patients by phone about their experience in the study.\n\n      Status:\n\n      This project has completed the data collection phase and is in the data analysis phase."
