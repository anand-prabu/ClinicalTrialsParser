Determine the optimal dose of etanidazole derivative EF5 that is safely\n      tolerated and provides optimal binding in resected tumor specimens or tumor biopsies in\n      patients with breast, head and neck, prostate, or cervical carcinoma or high grade soft\n      tissue sarcomas. II. Define the toxic effects of EF5 in this patient population.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive etanidazole derivative EF5 IV\n      over 1-2 hours. Approximately 24-48 hours after EF5 treatment, patients undergo surgical\n      resection or biopsy of tumor. Cohorts of 6 patients receive escalating doses of EF5 until\n      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or optimal dose is determined. The MTD is defined as the\n      dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. The optimal\n      dose is defined as the dose level at or preceding the MTD and resulting in optimal\n      tumor-to-normal-tissue binding. Patients are followed at 28 days.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-36 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-18\n      months."
