Similar to a clip, the device seals the\n      skin edges within a pressure bar, enabling the creation of a hematoma where blood collects\n      under pressure to form a stable clot until definitive repair.   The iTClamp50 is indicated\n      for use as a skin closure device for short-term soft tissue approximation, including use in\n      trauma wounds, lacerations, junctional bleeds or surgical incisions.  The purpose of this\n      prospective clinical study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of the iTClamp50 in\n      the ambulance (pre-hospital) and emergency department setting.  This will be accomplished by\n      observing patients with the device applied from the pre-hospital through to patient\n      discharge.  The hypothesis is that the iTClamp50 will be safe and effective at providing\n      temporary wound closure to control hemorrhage in the pre-hospital and emergency department\n      setting."
