This study will assess these\n      parameters of bis-POM PMEA in children.\n\n      Patients are stratified by age, and separate cohorts from each age group receive 1 of 2\n      single doses of bis-POM PMEA. The lower dose is given to patients ages 3 months through 17\n      years; if toxicity is acceptable, the other cohort in this age range receives the higher\n      dose. At this point, accrual of infants < 3 months old may begin at the lower dose, followed\n      by accrual of this age group at the higher dose if toxicity is acceptable. Serum drug\n      concentrations are monitored up to 8 hours post dose.\n\n      AS PER AMENDMENT 5/2/97: Based on data from both the low- and high-dose cohorts of the older\n      age group (>= 3 months to < 18 years), the younger age group (<3 months) will be started at\n      the high-dose."
