This\n      study uses a new technology to study the absorption and metabolism of three different\n      compounds found in tomatoes.  These compounds are called:  phytoene, phytofluene, and\n      lycopene. We hypothesize that by studying the absorption and metabolism of these compounds,\n      we may be able to understand how the compounds may influence health and disease processes."
