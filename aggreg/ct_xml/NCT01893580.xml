  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background Lung cancer is one of the most frequently occurring cancer diagnoses in both men
      and women having the highest death rate. Lung cancer is divided into Small-Cell Lung
      Carcinoma (SCLC) and Non-Small Cell Lung Carcinoma (NSCLC). Surgery is at present the
      primary treatment for NSCLC. Modern surgical treatment includes both minimal invasive
      surgery, e.g. Video-Assisted Thoracoscopic surgery (VATS), and open surgery such as
      thoracotomy.

      Improved surgical techniques combined with effective adjuvant chemotherapy, has led to a
      better survival in individuals with NSCLC. The treatment of NSCLC and other cancer diseases
      are after all still complex and potentially lethal.  Accordingly, side-effects to the
      treatment of the lung cancer disease are clinically very important and comprise physical and
      psychological as well as social distress with symptoms such as reduced physical capacity,
      numbness, pain, tiredness (fatigue), anxiety, and depression. These side-effects are
      long-lasting or even chronic and may result in a limitation in activity of daily living and
      reduced quality of life.

      Study aim:

      The rationale for the study PROLUCA is to identify the optimal timing of exercise to improve
      recovery after surgery in patients operated for lunge cancer with focus on physical capacity
      and quality of life. The specific study aim are to compare a home based exercise program
      (carried out before surgery), combined with exercise initiated as early as two weeks after
      surgery, with usual care (exercise initiated six weeks after surgery).

      Who can participate? Both men and women with an age above 18 years and diagnosed with lung
      cancer and referred for operation. Participation in this study is not possible if Danish is
      not spoken or understood, or if the participants by a doctor are advise not to do strenuous
      exercise.

      What does the study involve? The intervention consists of a combination of (1) exercise
      before surgery and (2) exercise after surgery for lung cancer.

        1. Exercise before surgery is a home-based exercise program is individually designed. The
           goal of the home-based exercise program, carried out before surgery, is to encourage to
           perform physical exercise (could be walking, cycling,climbing stairs) for at least 30
           minutes every day until surgery. The home-based exercise program varies in length due
           to number of days until surgery, and the intention is not exceed 14 days.

        2. The exercise initiated two weeks and 6 weeks after surgery consists of a 12 weeks
           rehabilitation program containing 24 group-based exercise sessions, three individual
           counseling sessions, and three group based lessons in health promoting behavior.
           Special needs in terms of smoking cessation, nutritional counseling or patient
           education, this is also offered.

      The exercise consists of individually prepared supervised strength - and fitness exercise in
      a team, two sessions of 60 minutes/week. Containing the following elements: Warm-up (five
      minutes) and cycling exercise (25 minutes) on ergometer bike, individually prepared strength
      exercise (25 minutes) carried out using five strength machines (whole body). Trained
      physiotherapists and cancer nurse specialists supervise the training program following the
      recommended principles. All exercise sessions will at the end include supervised breathing
      exercises combined with stretching and relaxation techniques (five minutes).

      What interventions will be compared? A home-based exercise program (carried out before
      surgery), combined with exercise initiated as early as two weeks after surgery, will be
      compared with usual care (exercise initiated six weeks after surgery).

      Will all participants receive the same treatment?

      By draw it is decided which of the 4 groups the participants will attend to in the study:

        -  Group 1: Home-based exercise before surgery and rehabilitation initiated as early as
           two weeks after surgery

        -  Group 2: Home-based exercise before surgery and rehabilitation initiated six weeks
           after surgery

        -  Group 3: Rehabilitation initiated as early as two weeks after surgery

        -  Group 4: Rehabilitation initiated six weeks after surgery (Usual practice as control
           group)

      What are the possible benefits and risks of participating? There are no risks or side-
      effects of participating other than muscle soreness and exercise is beneficial when it comes
      to recover from an operation from lung cancer.

    <description>Home-based exercise pre surgery and postoperative exercise in a team initiated two weeks after surgery.
Intervention consists of:
Preoperative home-based exercise program - cardiovascular exercise of moderate-vigorous intensity (~60-80% of maximum heart rate (HRmax)) for at least 30 minutes every day until surgery.
Postoperative rehabilitation: A supervised 12-week rehabilitation program containing 24 group-based exercise sessions, three individual counseling sessions, and three group-based lessons in health-promoting behavior. If the participants have special needs in terms of smoking cessation, nutritional counseling or patient education, this is offered too.
The cardiorespiratory intensity is at ~50-60% of individual HRmax for the first four weeks. The next eight weeks the intensity increases to moderate-high intensity at ~70-90% of individually determined HRmax. The intensity of the strength exercise program is at ~60-80% of 1 RM.</description>
