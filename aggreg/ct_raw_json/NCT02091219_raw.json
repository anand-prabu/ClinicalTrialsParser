            "textblock": "The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of two different forms of vitamin D\n      supplements (vitamin D3 and 25-hyrdroxyvitamin D3 [25(OH)D3]) on vitamin D levels in the\n      blood, and on markers of skeletal and immune health. This study is designed as a pilot\n      study. A multi-ethnic cohort of 48 patients will be included (12 Caucasian, 12 African\n      American, 12 Hispanic/Latino, 12 Asian/Asian American). Potential study candidates will\n      undergo a screening visit during which a medical history will be taken, a physical exam\n      performed, a dietary questionnaire administered, and blood collected. The purpose of the\n      screening visit is to identify vitamin D-deficient (25-hydroxyvitamin D <20 ng/ml)\n      individuals who are candidates for vitamin D supplementation. Eligible patients will then be\n      randomly assigned to receive either vitamin D3 (2400 IU/day) or 25(OH)D3 (20 mcg/day) for 16\n      weeks. After initiating supplementation, study patients will return for follow-up visits at\n      weeks 4, 8, and 16. At each visit, blood will be collected to assess vitamin D levels in the\n      blood, as well as markers of skeletal and immune function. Participation in this study will\n      therefore involve a total of 5 visits (1 screening visit, 1 randomization visit during which\n      participants will receive their study supplements, 3 follow-up visits). After all data is\n      collected, changes in vitamin D levels in the blood following supplementation with either\n      vitamin D3 versus 25(OH)D3 will be determined, and correlated to markers of calcium balance\n      and immune function. Knowledge gained from this study may have a significant impact on how\n      vitamin D status is defined, and how vitamin D repletion is administered."
