  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn about the effect of the investigational agent
      tivozanib on the control of the tumor growth in hepatocellular (liver) cancer. The
      investigators also plan to collect information on the likelihood to develop side effects
      while on this treatment. Tivozanib is an oral medication (pill) taken once a day. This
      medication is designed to stop the tumor from developing new blood vessels.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Angiogenesis is the formation of new blood vessels. Angiogenesis is driven by cyokines
      including vascular endothelial growth factor. Tivozanib is an oral medication that inhibits
      vascular endothelial growth factor preventing tumor from developing new blood vessels.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of tivozanib on hepatocellular (liver)
      cancer. Participants in the study take tivozanib daily at a dose of 1 mg for  1month. if
      doing well the dose would be increased to 1.5 mg per day. Patients are monitored for
      response using CT or MRI scans every 2months. In addition, patients will have blood draws to
      evaluate the effects of tivozanib on blood vessels.

    <description>Measurable lesions:  Lesions that can be measured in at least one dimension as ≥ 20 mm with conventional CT scan techniques or as ≥ 10 mm with spiral CT scan.
Non-measurable lesions: All other lesions including small lesions (longest diameter &lt; 20 mm with conventional techniques) and other non-measurable lesions including: pleural effusions, ascites, and disease documented by indirect evidence (e.g. biochemical abnormalities).
Target lesions: All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 5 lesions. Target lesions are selected for their size and suitability for accurate repetitive measurements. The sum of the longest diameter of all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum LD. This will be used as a reference to further quantify objective response.
Non-target lesions: All other lesions are identified as non-target lesions and should be followed as present or absent.</description>

    <description>Patients would receive Tivozanib 1.0 mg/day orally, 3 weeks on, one week off, for one cycle starting day 1. If no adverse event is encountered, patients will continue subsequent cycles of Tivozanib 1.5 mg/day orally; 3 weeks on/1 week off, dosing schedule. Patients will continue on treatment until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or patient withdrawal from the study.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        1. Patients with measurable, histological diagnosis of HCC and whose disease is not
        amenable to surgical or regional therapy.

          1. Prior allowed therapy:

               -  Surgery including hepatic resection

                    1. Minimum of 4 weeks since any surgical procedure.

                    2. Patients must have adequately recovered from surgery

               -  Regional therapy

                    1. Includes transarterial chemoembolization (TACE, DEB-TACE), percutaneous
                       ethanol injection, radiofrequency/cryo ablation, Yttrium-90
                       radioembolization

                    2. More than 2 weeks must have lapsed from therapy

                    3. There must be an indicator lesion outside the treated area or clear
                       evidence of progression in the treated lesion, not amenable for further
                       local therapies.

                    4. Concomitant sorafenib with regional therapy is allowed as long as no
                       evidence of progression on sorafenib

               -  Prior adjuvant sorafenib is allowed, if completed more than 6 months prior to
                  disease recurrence.

          2. Adequate hematological, liver and metabolic organ function.

          3. Signed informed consent.
