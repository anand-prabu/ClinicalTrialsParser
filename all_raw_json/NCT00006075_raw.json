Laboratory tests suggest that a higher dose of chlorhexidine will be more\n      effective in killing HIV."

            "textblock": "The principal hypothesis of this protocol is that, in the context of routine oral/nasal\n      suctioning of infants, a higher concentration of chlorhexidine for peripartum vaginal and\n      postpartum newborn cleansing results in reduction in maternal child transmission (MCT) of\n      HIV. The in vitro data suggest that a higher concentration of chlorhexidine in the primary\n      wash solution is much more likely to have a virucidal effect perinatally and thus reduce\n      MCT.\n\n      Perinatal intervention consists of the following: 1) cervicovaginal wash of the entire birth\n      canal with a chlorhexidine solution at the time of each vaginal examination of a mother in\n      labor; 2) immediate suctioning of the nasal and oral passages of the infant at the time the\n      head emerges (fluids to be tested for viral load at future date); and 3) thorough washing of\n      the baby with a chlorhexidine solution immediately after delivery. Blood samples are\n      collected from some infants for measurement of chlorhexidine levels approximately 2 hours\n      post-washing. During the 24 to 48 hours following delivery, infants are examined and mothers\n      are queried using standardized questionnaires for subjective complaints related to the\n      chlorhexidine washes. Speculum-aided vaginal exams are done for any persistent (greater than\n      24 hours) or severe complaints."
