  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Urgency Incontinence (where the bladder muscles contract suddenly, causing an immediate urge
      to urinate that is difficult to prevent) is commonly experienced in patients with overactive
      bladder.  New findings have discovered that urgency incontinence may be connected to the
      interactions of certain regions of the brain and the bladder.  Although this is a common
      problem, researched still do not know how these interactions impact the process of urgency
      incontinence.  Furthermore, there is preliminary data to suggest that interventions such as
      Mindful-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) can potentially be used as therapy for UI. The purpose
      of this study is to determine the impact MBSR training on UI symptoms, quality of life, and
      anxiety measures.

    <description>The MBSR course developed by Jon Kabat-Zinn is a mind-body intervention that incorporates mindfulness techniques.  This is an eight week MBSR course at OHSU.  Class instruction will be augmented by daily home practices of listening to audiotapes, diary reflections, and reading preloaded on itouch devices provided to participants. Adherence will be assessed through in-house iMINDr tracking program loaded on the itouch.</description>
