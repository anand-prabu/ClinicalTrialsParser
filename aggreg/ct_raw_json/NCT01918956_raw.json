The safety of PURETHAL Birch\n      will be evaluated in a rush regimen (maximum dose reached in 3 injections during 3 weeks)\n      compared to the conventional regimen (maximum dose reached in 6 injections during 6 weeks).\n\n      The primary endpoint of the sudy is the comparison of the proportions of the patients who\n      have successfully reached the maintenance dose between the two treatment regimes.\n\n      A similar previous study with PURETHAL Grasses has shown that the rush up-dosing scheme is\n      as safe as the conventional up-dosing regime. Therefore it is expected that up-dosing with\n      PURETHAL Birch according to the rush regimen is as safe as using the conventional regimen."
