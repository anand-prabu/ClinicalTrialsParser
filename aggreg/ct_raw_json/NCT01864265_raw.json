Functional MRI represents a method\n      allowing detecting tiny changes in neuronal activity by measuring alterations of blood flow\n      in the context of neuronal activation. TNFi rapidly reversed the widespread activation of\n      brain centers involved in pain such as the thalamus and the somatosensoric cortex, as well\n      as those involved in the control, of mood and emotions such as the limbic system. Moreover,\n      as small phase I study with 10 patients with RA showed that high brain activity detected in\n      the functional MRI predicts clinical response to Certolizumab Pegol after 1 month,\n      suggesting the central nervous system activity may be used as a tool to predict response to\n      TNFi [8]. The rationale of this study is to test whether response to TNFi can be predicted\n      by using functional MRI."
