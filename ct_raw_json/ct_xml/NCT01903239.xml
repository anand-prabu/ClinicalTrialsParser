      The purpose of this study is to determine if narrow (1 and 2mm) margins are successful
      excision margins for National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) low-risk facial Basal Cell
      Carcinoma.

    <textblock>
      Current recommendations for excision (removal) of Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC), a type of skin
      cancer, vary by tumor (grouping of cancer cells) size, location on the body, appearance
      under the microscope, and surgeon preference. Recent articles have included more aggressive
      and larger size tumors, in addition to small low-risk tumors, within their study population.
      The purpose of this study is to determine the successful excision margins (area of skin
      around the tumor) for National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) low-risk facial BCC.

    <description>This study is purely about the technique of excision used to remove low-risk basal cell carcinomas. 1 - 2 mm surgical margins are being used to excise low risk facial basal cell carcinomas. The tools used for the excision and the surgical procure itself have not changed from the standard of care. The only change is the size of the margin being taken. Patients that typically would see a Mohs Surgeon to get the smallest possible margins and scars will no longer need to see a specialist. Dermatologist will be able to extract the low risk cancers with confidence that the complete lesion has been removed and minimal scar has been left.</description>
