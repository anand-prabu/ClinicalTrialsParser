  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 40 % of all patients undergoing fast-track total hip or knee arthroplasty
      needs intermittent bladder catheterization after surgery, as they are transient incapable of
      voluntary bladder emptying (postoperative urinary retention - POUR). The currently used
      interventional threshold for urinary bladder catheterization are a bladder volume of
      approximately 500 ml., but no evidence exists for this threshold. At the same time, the
      current knowledge suggest, that a bladder volume up to 1000 ml. for 2-4 hours are safe in
      humans, and as the use of urinary bladder catheterization are increasing the risk of
      complications, the investigators are hypothesizing that increasing  the interventional
      threshold for urinary bladder catheterization after fast-track total hip or knee
      arthroplasty, will reduce the number of patients needing urinary bladder catheterization,
      without increasing the incidence of urological complications - including urinary tract
      infections.
