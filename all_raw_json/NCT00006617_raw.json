This study\n      will test if a 4-drug combination will reduce HIV virus activity in blood and other tissues\n      and if it is safe and well tolerated. Doctors also want to know if the multidrug combination\n      is able to decrease viral activity over a long time period."

            "textblock": "With effective combination ART, there is a decrease in HIV-1 RNA in plasma after 2 to 3\n      weeks. A second, slower phase of viral decay is thought to occur in long-lived macrophages,\n      with a minimal contribution from lymphocytes. This study addresses whether there is a third\n      reservoir such as the central nervous system. Additionally, the study aims to provide a\n      better understanding of the type and length of ART required to suppress HIV-1 replication in\n      multiple reservoirs.\n\n      Patients receive treatment with ZDV, 3TC, ABC, and APV daily for 24 weeks. Clinic visits\n      occur weekly until Week 4, then every 2 weeks until Week 12, then monthly. Blood and urine\n      samples are collected and patients are monitored for clinical or laboratory abnormalities.\n      Laboratory tests to assess side effects and virologic and immunologic parameters, including\n      viral quantification of CSF on all chronically infected patients and selected consenting\n      acutely infected patients, are determined. In a pharmacoeconomic component of this study,\n      patients have interviews and complete questionnaires at 5 clinic visits."
