Determine the safety of IL-12 when administered as maintenance therapy in these\n      patients.\n\n      III. Evaluate overall survival of this patient population. IV. Evaluate serum and tissue\n      cytokine levels in these patients. V. Evaluate the effect of IL-12 on HIV viral load and on\n      functional T-cell assays in these patients.\n\n      VI. Evaluate the effect of IL-12 on Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) viral load in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is an open label study.\n\n      All patients receive ifosfamide IV by continuous infusion for 2 days, etoposide IV over 2\n      hours daily on days 1 and 2, and filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) daily on days 4-13.\n      Courses are repeated every 21 days.
