Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor\n      cells. Chemotherapy combined with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of temozolomide followed by radiation\n      therapy in treating children who have newly diagnosed malignant central nervous system\n      tumors."

Treatment repeats every 28 days for a\n      maximum of 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n      Patients with a partial or complete response may receive an additional 8 courses of\n      temozolomide following radiotherapy.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 100 patients (25 per stratum) will be accrued for this study\n      over 24-36 months."
