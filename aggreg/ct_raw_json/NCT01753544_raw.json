Acetic acid (1.5%) and indigo carmine dye are sprayed onto the lesion to\n      clarify the margin. Markings are made 10 mm outside the tumor margin using a laser fiber\n      with a power setting at 30 W. After marking, a mixture of sodium hyaluronate with indigo\n      carmine and epinephrine (1:25000) is injected into the submucosa outside the marking dots. A\n      circumferential mucosal incision and submucosal dissection are performed by a thulium laser\n      fiber with a power setting at 30 to 40 W. Activation of the laser beam is controlled by\n      stepping on a foot pedal. Hemostasis during procedure is also attempted using the thulium\n      laser. When hemostasis is not achieved properly, additional use of hemostatic forceps or a\n      hemoclip will be considered."
