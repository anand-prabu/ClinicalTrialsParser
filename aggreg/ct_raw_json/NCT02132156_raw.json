Cohorts of 14 toddlers (12 vaccine recipients and 2 placebo recipients) per\n      dose level will receive a single intramuscular injection. Cohorts of 16 infants (12 vaccine\n      recipients and 4 placebo recipients) per dose level will receive three study injections at 4\n      week intervals. The two highest dose levels tolerated in the infant cohort will be assessed\n      in an expanded infant cohort of 114 infants (38 at each dose level and 38 placebo\n      recipients). Study injections in the infant cohort will be administered concomitant with EPI\n      vaccinations (with the exception of rotavirus vaccination). All infants will receive Rotarix\n      at 4, 8 and 12 weeks after the third study injection, and fecal shedding of Rotarix will be\n      assessed during the week after the first dose. The third dose of Rotarix is being provided\n      to these infants to mitigate the theoretical risk that the P2-VP8 vaccine might interfere\n      with the benefit of Rotarix vaccination."
