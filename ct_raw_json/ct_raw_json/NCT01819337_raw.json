            "textblock": "The determination of the cardiopulmonary (c/p) capacity is very important for the evaluation\n      of every patient undergoing surgery. The ability to climb at least two flight of stairs is\n      seen to be an acceptable c/p capacity for surgery. There are several ways to evaluate the\n      fitness of patients. A common method to estimate the cardiopulmonary capacity is defining\n      patients through the MET's (metabolic equivalents) scale. MET's can be defined relatively\n      easy through a simple questionnaire. Patients with a reduced c/p capacity have less than 4\n      MET's, patients with a relatively good c/p capacity have 4-10 MET's and patients with a\n      excellent c/p capacity have more than 10 MET's.\n\n      The lactate level in blood serum is a common parameter to asses anaerobic metabolism in\n      patients. A high lactate level correlates with higher mortality rates and outcome.\n\n      To yet it is not clear if there exists a correlation between the preoperative\n      cardiopulmonary capacity measured in MET's and the perioperative lactate level. We\n      hypothysed that patients with a reduced cardiopulmonary capacity are associated with higher\n      perioperative lactate levels, as these group of patients compensate the stressors\n      operation/anesthesia less than patients with a good c/p capacity."
