Courses repeat every 21 days in the\n      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving complete\n      response (CR) receive 1 additional course of therapy after documented CR. Patients with\n      partial response or stable disease may receive therapy for up to 6 months.\n\n      Cohorts of 1-6 patients receive escalating doses of 3-AP, paclitaxel, and cisplatin until\n      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding\n      that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 25-30 patients will be accrued for this study."
