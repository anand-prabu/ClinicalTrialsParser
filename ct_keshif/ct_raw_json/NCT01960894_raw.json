            "textblock": "If the heart fails to pump a sufficient amount of blood, it is crucial to know why in order\n      to provide the best treatment. Pressure-volume analysis is the gold standard for evaluating\n      the heart's pumping function. Unfortunately, current techniques are invasive, so most\n      patients will not get this examination. By combining the strengths of echo-Doppler\n      ultrasound, blood pressure monitoring and biomedical computing, the investigators aim to\n      develop a non-invasive method for pressure-volume analysis, extending its applicability to\n      more patients and settings."
