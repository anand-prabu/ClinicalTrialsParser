            "textblock": "Specific challenges: In Pakistan rates of depression particularly in women are high, as well\n      as other risks to the growth and development of young children and child mortality.\n      Numerous studies provide compelling evidence that maternal depression not only affects\n      mothers but is also associated with long term emotional, cognitive and behavioural problems\n      in children.  Depressed mothers are unable to provide primary care necessary for growth of\n      their children during the first 3-years of life, a critical period for child development.\n      Disability due to depressive symptoms (such as fatigue, poor concentration, loss of\n      interest) is likely to affect child-care abilities directly, while impaired social\n      functioning is likely to have indirect consequences through lack of support in childcare.\n      Disturbances in mother-infant relationship in depressed mothers negatively influence the\n      child's development. There is now evidence from some low income countries that effectively\n      delivered participatory group interventions are cost effective intervention for improving\n      maternal and child health. The Community-Based participatory Intervention LTP Plus has been\n      designed to address maternal depression and a parenting program of child psychosocial\n      development through mother-infant play providing stimulation, and support for exploration\n      and autonomy for the infant.The proposed study will test the efficacy of an innovative\n      affordable intervention program that can be used by non-specialists, including mothers and\n      lay health workers with minimal training in low resource countries such as Pakistan.\n\n      Project Impact: LTP Plus is proposed as a low cost intervention to improve maternal mental\n      and physical health, reduce infant and children under five years' morbidity and mortality,\n      and promote healthy child development. Learning Through Play (LTP) Plus is a low-literacy,\n      sustainable program intended to provide parents with information on the healthy growth and\n      development of their young children. The LTP research-based activities enhance children's\n      development while simultaneously promoting attachment security through building parents'\n      ability to read and be sensitive to their children's cues and through active involvement in\n      their children's development. Plus the Thinking Healthy Program (THP) which adopts 'here and\n      now' problem-solving approach, THP uses cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) techniques of\n      active listening, changing negative thinking, and collaboration with the family."
