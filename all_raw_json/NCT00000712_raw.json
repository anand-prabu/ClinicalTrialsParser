The study evaluates two doses of AZT used alone versus two doses of\n      AZT combined with ACV. Per 12/11/92 amendment: Another antiretroviral agent may be\n      substituted for AZT.\n\n      AZT has been shown to increase the life span of patients with AIDS or advanced AIDS related\n      complex and patients being treated for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. Drugs that increase\n      the effectiveness of AZT against HIV may also decrease the need for high doses of AZT. This\n      might reduce some of the negative effects of AZT while not reducing the positive effects."

Therapy is for 104 weeks with an\n      optional extension of 24 weeks or until the end of the study whichever comes first. The\n      maximum duration of therapy for any patient will be 128 weeks. Medication is dispensed on a\n      biweekly basis for the first 4 weeks, then every other month for the remainder of the study.\n      Original design: Patients are randomly assigned to one of  four treatment plans to receive\n      AZT alone or AZT and ACV. Medications are given every 4 hours (q4h) orally (PO) while awake\n      (WA). A total of 5 doses/day are given. The per dose schedule for the four plans are:\n      Treatment plan 1: AZT plus placebo (an inactive medication) substituting for ACV. Treatment\n      plan 2: AZT and AZT placebo along with an ACV placebo. Treatment plan 3: AZT and ACV.\n      Treatment plan 4: AZT and AZT placebo and ACV."
