The study uses\n      an randomized, controlled trial design and is intended to lead to a larger clinical trial\n      with long-term follow-up.  The intervention incorporates small group instruction from a\n      trainer, a small wearable accelerometer to provide accurate data on physical activity, and\n      real-time feedback to participants about exercise levels.  The primary outcome measure will\n      be changes in fitness, measured as change in maximal oxygen consumption (VO2 max). The\n      control group will receive a comparable exercise intervention after they complete 12 weeks\n      of observation."
