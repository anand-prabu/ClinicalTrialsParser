Nevertheless; high humidity is maintained in vivo (uterus and\n      fallopian tubes) due to the fluid content and stable body temperatures at 37\u00b0C.  David\n      McCulloch reported 15% reduction of the miscarriage rate after changing the humidity from\n      76% to 100% (Textbook of Assisted Reproductive Techniques: Laboratory Perspectives, Fourth\n      Edition). Some embryologists claim that the humidity free incubators may increase the chance\n      of chemical pregnancy and early fetal loss (Private center IbnSina IVF, Sohag, Egypt.\n      unpublished data). This observations are never tested in a well designed randomized clinical\n      trial (RCT) to eliminate the probability of chance and to reach a solid evidence.\n\n      The question that should be asked : is  high humidity culture  should be applied or there is\n      no difference between dry and high humidity culture conditions?"
