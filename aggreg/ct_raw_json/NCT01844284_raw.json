Subject is currently participating in another clinical trial that has not yet\n             completed its primary endpoint.\n\n         24. Subject whose willingness to volunteer in a clinical investigation could be unduly\n             influenced by the expectation, whether justified or not, of benefits associated with\n             participation or of retaliatory response from senior members of a hierarchy in case\n             of refusal to participate (e.g. subordinate hospital staff or sponsor staff) or\n             subject is unable to read or write."
