  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study that will examine the
      efficacy of extended-release baclofen (Baclofen ER) for the treatment of cocaine dependence.
       The primary study outcome will be urines positive for benzoylecgonine (BE), a metabolite of
      cocaine, submitted during outpatient treatment (12-week) and follow-up (12-week). To examine
      brain mechanisms of relapse/recovery, participants will complete fMRI sessions before,
      during, and after treatment. Brain responses to specific probes of reward and inhibition
      will be used as biomarkers predicting drug use during and after the treatment.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Physically healthy cocaine-dependent (based on DSM-IV- TR criteria) male or female
             aged 18-60 yrs, voluntarily seeking treatment for cocaine dependence.

          2. Females must be non-pregnant, non- lactating and either be of non-childbearing
             potential (i.e. sterilized via hysterectomy or bilateral tubal ligation or at least 1
             year post-menopausal) or of child bearing potential, but practicing a medically
             acceptable method of birth control. Examples of medically acceptable methods for this
             protocol include barrier (diaphragm or condom) with spermicide, an intrauterine
             device (IUD), oral contraceptives, a levonorgestrel implant, intrauterine
             progesterone contraceptive system, medroxyprogesterone acetate contraceptive
             injection, and abstinence.

          3. Reading level at or above eighth grade.

          4. Participants provide voluntary informed consent.

          5. Smoking is primary route of cocaine administration.

          6. Available for an inpatient stay.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Participation in clinical trial and receipt of investigational drug(s) during
             previous 60 days, except as explicitly approved by the Principal Investigator.

          2. Clinically significant cardiovascular, hematologic, hepatic, renal, neurological or
             endocrinological abnormalities.

          3. History of serious head trauma or injury causing loss of consciousness that lasted
             more than 3 minutes or associated with skull fracture or inter-cranial bleeding or
             abnormal MRI.

          4. Presence of magnetically active prosthetics, plates, pins, broken needles, permanent
             retainer, bullets, etc. in patient's body (unless a radiologist confirms that its
             presence is unproblematic). An x-ray may be obtained to determine eligibility.

          5. Claustrophobia or other medical condition that disables the participant from lying in
             the MRI for approximately 60 minutes.

          6. Current or prior gambling problems (assessed by participants self-report)

          7. Non-removable skin patches

          8. Have received medication that could interact adversely with baclofen, including
             muscle relaxants (including tricyclic antidepressants), antiseizure medication, CNS
             depressants (tranquilizers, sleeping pills), MAO inhibitors), within the time of
             administration of study agent based on the study physician's guidance (e.g. 5 half
             lives)

          9. Have known or suspected hypersensitivity to baclofen.

         10. Be taking baclofen for any reason currently or during the past year.
