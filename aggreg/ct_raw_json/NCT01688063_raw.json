These subjects will have baseline elasticity measurements recorded on their face and right forearm before their procedures, and follow up measurements will be repeated 3 months following their last treatment. The second Arm will include 25 subjects who are not scheduled to receive any cosmetic procedures but who agree to return for repeated measurements 3 months following the first. Baseline elasticity measurements will be recorded from subjects' face and right forearm and subjects will return in 3 months for follow-up measurements.
