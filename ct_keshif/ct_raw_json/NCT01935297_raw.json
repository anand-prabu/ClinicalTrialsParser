The usual care group will receive general advice but no structured exercise\n      program. Exercise capacity is assessed by cardiopulmonary exercise testing and by the 6\n      minute walk test prior to and after the intervention period. In addition, life quality will\n      be assessed by validated questionnaires, while safety will be assessed by recording adverse\n      events and by echocardiography."
