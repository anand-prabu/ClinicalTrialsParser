            "textblock": "Background: Cardiac arrest is a life-threatening event. Intensivists are challenged with an\n      increasing number of patients with uncertain neurological outcome following cardiopulmonary\n      resuscitation (CPR). The prognostic value of current biomarkers for neurophysiologic\n      long-term outcome is limited. Therefore, identification of novel plasma markers with higher\n      predictive value for neurophysiological recovery is critical for patient management after\n      CPR.\n\n      Hypothesis: We hypothesize that specific brain-derived tissue leakage proteins can be\n      identified to reveal novel, more reliable prognostic biomarkers for good neurological\n      outcome.\n\n      Methods: This translational study (n=100) is a combination of a prospective basic science\n      study intended to reduce the number of potential plasma biomarker candidates by proteomic\n      shotgun analyses in brain tissue autopsy samples and plasma samples from resuscitated\n      patients (n=10) and a prospective clinical validation study in a large study population\n      (n=100) by high-throughput analyses, including the patients used for proteomic analysis, as\n      outcome was not compared in these patients. Samples will be analyzed by proteomic shotgun\n      analyses using the Q-Exactive quadrupole-orbitrap mass spectrometer (MS). MS/MS data will be\n      interpreted by the MaxQuant and Perseus Software. In order to identify brain-derived\n      proteins within plasma, the plasma proteome of 10 resuscitated patients will be compared to\n      the proteomic profile of brain tissue. This will reduce the number of potential plasma\n      biomarker candidates associated with neurologic outcome. The prospective validation in\n      plasma samples will be performed by a targeted proteomics approach using selected reaction\n      monitoring (SRM) on a triple quadrupole ion MS. Neurological outcome will be assessed by the\n      five-point scale (death, persistent vegetative state, severe disability, moderate\n      disability, and good recovery) according to the cerebral performance categories (CPC). A CPC\n      sore of <3 is considered a good neurological outcome. Selection of proteomic markers and\n      signature estimation will be performed by L1 regularized logistic regression, where the\n      tuning parameter will be optimized by cross-validated model performance. The signature's\n      ability to discriminate patients with good and poor outcome will be described by ROC\n      analysis.\n\n      Clinical perspective: An accurate predictor of neurological outcome following CPR is of\n      utmost clinical importance. However, previous studies focused on a very limited array of\n      biomarkers. Therefore, a structured proteomic analysis approach might identify the best\n      marker out of all proteins liberated during cellular damage."
