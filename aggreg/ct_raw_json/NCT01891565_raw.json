            "textblock": "The amount of active therapy provided to patients on an inpatient stroke rehabilitation unit\n      has been reported as often insufficient. Observational studies have found that in the first\n      14 days post stroke, patients receive very little therapy and have very low activity levels.\n      More opportunity to practice may, however, improve short-term outcomes such as the level of\n      mobility, endurance, use of the affected arm and leg, and length of stay. The Stroke\n      Inpatient Rehabilitation Reinforcement of ACTivity (SIRRACT) trial will utilize sensors that\n      reveal the type, quantity, and aspects of quality of patient activities outside of the\n      confines of research laboratories. SIRRACT will deploy inexpensive Personal Activity\n      Monitors (PAMs), comprised of triaxial accelerometers worn on the thighs.\n\n      The objectives of the study are:\n\n      i. To assess the impact of feedback from Personal Activity Monitors (PAM)s on amount of\n      active practice, walking speed and distance in stroke patients undergoing rehabilitation.\n\n      ii. To assess the impact of feedback from PAMs on physical, psycho-emotional, cognitive and\n      ecosocial Health-Related Quality of Life of stroke patients undergoing rehabilitation.\n\n      iii. To assess the acceptability of thigh-strapped accelerometer use among stroke patients\n      undergoing rehabilitation.\n\n      iv. To assess the reliability and validity of thigh-strapped accelerometer use among stroke\n      patients undergoing rehabilitation.\n\n      Hypotheses In moderate to severely disabled subjects who are receiving in-patient\n      rehabilitation, daily feedback from PAMs about purposeful activity will increase the amount\n      of active practice by >30%, a higher proportion of subjects who reach the level of\n      independence for walking, and increase walking speed by 25%, leading to higher mean walking\n      speeds and distances at the time of discharge from inpatient rehabilitation. Daily feedback\n      from PAMs on increase in walking speed and distances will improve physical, psychological,\n      cognitive and ecosocial domains of Health-related quality of life."
