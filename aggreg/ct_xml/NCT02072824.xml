  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the effectiveness of 2 doses of pregabalin to reduce
      seizure frequency as an add on therapy in pediatric subjects 1 month to &lt;4 years of age with
      refractory partial onset seizures. It is hypothesized that both doses of pregabalin will
      demonstrate superior efficacy when compared to placebo by reducing the partial onset seizure
      frequency and that pregabalin will be safe and well tolerated.
