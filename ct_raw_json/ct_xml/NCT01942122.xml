    <textblock>
      This is a 3-arm, prospective, randomized, double-blind, and controlled study of DLBS1442 for
      the treatment of pain in patients suspected endometriosis. It is hypothesized that the
      reduction of the composite-pain intensity (as measured by VAS) from baseline to the end of
      study (week 8th) resulting from administration of DLBS1442, regardless of the dosage
      regimen, is significantly greater than that of Control. In addition, the administration of
      DLBS1442 at higher dose also results in significantly greater reduction than that of
      DLBS1442 at lower dose and of Control.

      There will be three groups of treatment by dosage regimen in this study. Eligible subjects
      will be randomized to receive any of the following regimens: 1) DLBS1442 at a dose of 3 x
      100 mg daily, or 2) DLBS1442 at a dose of 3 x 200 mg daily; or 3) mefenamic acid at a dose
      of 3 x 500 mg daily. DLBS1442 will be taken every day along the study period (8 weeks),
      while mefenamic acid will only be taken for five (5) days at minimum, during the menstrual
      period, i.e. day 1st to day 5th or to the last day (whichever is longer) of menstrual
      period. Study treatment will be given for 8 weeks. Clinical and laboratory examinations to
      evaluate the investigational drug's efficacy and safety will be performed at baseline and
      every 4-week interval throughout the study period.
