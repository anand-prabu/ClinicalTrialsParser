MF is a disorder in which bone marrow tissue\n      develops in abnormal sites because the bone marrow itself undergoes fibrosis or scarring.\n      This study plans to evaluate whether adding the drug Ruxolitinib will further aid in\n      reducing pre-transplant spleen size, improve physical performance levels and reduce adverse\n      events (side effects) related to the transplant. Ruxolitinib is a drug that is approved by\n      the FDA for the treatment of patients with advanced forms of myelofibrosis. Using\n      Ruxolitinib prior to stem cell transplantation is experimental."
