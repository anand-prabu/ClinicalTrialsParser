            "textblock": "Summary of rationale:\n\n        1. As individual agents, both the histone deacetylase inhibitors and lenalidomide have\n           significant activity in each of the diseases in this study;\n\n        2. There is potential for the agents to synergize (to improve upon the response rates as\n           there are both overlapping and disparate mechanisms of action.)  Both agents may\n           synergize to induce cell death through caspase 8-mediated and other mechanisms; both\n           induce p21 and cell cycle arrest; both agents have anti-angiogenic effects; both are\n           likely to interfere with PI3K/Akt signaling.  One particularly attractive aspect of\n           this combination is the potential for synergistic immunological effects, particularly\n           related to T-cell polarization, NK cell activation, STAT signaling and cytokine\n           production, as discussed above;\n\n        3. With respect to PTCL, CTCL and HL, there is a clear path for further drug development\n           and registration if this trial proves that this is a safe and efficacious combination;\n\n        4. Myeloma is incurable and this is due to the persistence of a drug-resistant sub-clone\n           of tumor-propagating cells that is drug insensitive.  Preclinical data suggests that\n           both HDACi and lenalidomide may target these tumor-propagating cells. This argues for\n           examining this combination as part of early treatment in these diseases. This trial is\n           the first step to examine the feasibility of combining an HDACi with what is front-line\n           therapy in myeloma in the USA - lenalidomide.\n\n        5. Incorporating three separate arms (as opposed to three separate studies) will allow;\n\n           i. The investigators to accumulate data on this novel combination across the three\n           groups and evaluate the toxicity profiles to make informed decisions around\n           dose-escalation. Because it is a single study, valid comparisons can be made across the\n           groups, which would not be possible if they were separate studies.\n\n           ii. combined and simplified collection of correlative tests across the three studies."
