  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purposes of this study are to assess how the body handles baricitinib when it is given
      with another drug called probenecid.  The study doctor will measure the amount of
      baricitinib that is absorbed into the blood stream and the time that it takes to remove
      baricitinib from the body.  The safety and tolerability of these drugs will be studied.  The
      study will last about 18 days from the first dose to the end of the study (not including
      screening.)
