With this information, a model will be established to predict\n      adherence rates to TFV-DP using DBS. Forty-eight healthy HIV-uninfected adult participants\n      who are at low risk for HIV infection will be randomized to one of 6 sequences consisting of\n      two directly observed dosing regimens, 33%/67%, 33%/100%, 67%/33%, 67%/100%, 100%/33%, and\n      100%/67% with each dose regimen lasting approximately 12 weeks, separated by an\n      approximately 12 week washout period. DBS will be collected at regular intervals, including\n      during the washout. The hypothesis of the study is that levels of TFV-DP in DBS will predict\n      adherence rates in the preceding 1-3 months."
