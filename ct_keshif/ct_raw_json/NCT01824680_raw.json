Hormones assessed\n      are: leptin, grh\u00e9lin, Cholecystokinin, Glucagon-Like-Peptid-1 (GLP-1), PYY.\n\n      It is well known that in overweight adults and children also, an intense physical exercise\n      diminish the food intake relatively to the total energy expenditure and this effect is\n      persistent after a 6 weeks  physical activity program.\n\n      Our  hypothesis are:  a diminution of food intake after the intense physical exercise and a\n      persistent diminution of food intake after the 3 month physical activity program, an\n      augmentation of levels of GLP-1 and PYY during the intense exercise before and after the\n      physical activity program, a diminution of the level of GLP-1 and leptin before and after\n      the physical activity program"

Physical condition (VO2 max, DEXA, and muscular test), insulin-sensibility,\n      lipid profile, are also assessed.\n\n      During the \"exercise\" session: it is identical to the first session but an intense exercise\n      of 40 minutes is realized at 70% of the patient's VO2 max. The peripherical blood output is\n      measured by a non-invasive method: the Near-Infra-Red-Spectroscopy, during the exercise.\n\n      The 3-months-physical activity program : there is 4 sessions of 30 minutes and 2 sessions of\n      1 hour per week. Most of exercises sessions are  realized at home but one 1-hour session per\n      week is controled with a sports educator."
