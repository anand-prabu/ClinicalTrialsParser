Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from\n      dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining thalidomide with chemotherapy may kill more\n      cancer cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of thalidomide, doxorubicin, and\n      dexamethasone in treating patients who have untreated stage II or stage III multiple\n      myeloma."

Determine\n      the safety and toxicity of this regimen in this patient population.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral dexamethasone on days 1-4, 9-12, and 17-20, doxorubicin IV on\n      day 1, and oral thalidomide daily. Treatment repeats every 30 days for 4 courses in the\n      absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 21-45 patients will be accrued for this study within\n      approximately 1 year."
