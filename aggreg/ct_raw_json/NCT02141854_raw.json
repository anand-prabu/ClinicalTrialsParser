Current Asthma Therapy: Patients must have a short-acting \u03b22-agonist (for rescue use)\n             for a minimum of 8 weeks before the Screening Visit (SV) and a qualifying dose of an\n             inhaled corticosteroid (ICS). The ICS may be either as ICS monotherapy or as an\n             ICS/long-acting beta agonist (LABA) combination. The ICS component of the patient's\n             asthma therapy should be stable for a minimum of 3 months before providing consent.\n\n          3. Reversibility of Disease: Patients must have at least 15% reversibility (all\n             patients) and at least a 200 mL increase from baseline FEV1 (patients age 18 and\n             older) within 30 minutes after 2 to 4 inhalations of albuterol/salbutamol at the SV.\n             Note: Patients who do not qualify for the study due to failure to meet reversibility\n             will be permitted to perform a retest once within 7 days.\n\n          4. Patients must provide written informed consent/assent.. For minor patients (ages 12\n             to 17 years, or as applicable per local regulations), the written ICF must be signed\n             and dated by the parent/legal guardian and the written assent form must be signed and\n             dated by the patient (if applicable). Note: Age requirements are as specified by\n             local regulations.\n\n          5. Outpatient >= 12 years of age on the date of consent/assent. In countries where the\n             local regulations permit enrollment of adult patients only, patients must be 18 years\n             of age and older.\n\n          6. Asthma diagnosis: The patient has a diagnosis of asthma as defined by the NIH. The\n             asthma diagnosis has been present for a minimum of 3 months and has been stable\n             (defined as no exacerbations and no changes in asthma medication) for at least 30\n             days.\n\n          7. The patient is able to perform acceptable and repeatable spirometry.\n\n          8. The patient is able to perform PEF with a handheld peak flow meter.\n\n          9. The patient is able to use a MDI device without a spacer device and a MDPI device.\n\n         10. The patient is able to withhold (as judged by the investigator) his or her regimen of\n             ICS or study drug, and rescue medication for at least 6 hours before the SV and\n             before all treatment visits.\n\n         11. The patient/parent/legal guardian/caregiver is capable of understanding the\n             requirements, risks, and benefits of study participation, and, as judged by the\n             investigator, capable of giving informed consent/assent and being compliant with all\n             study requirements.\n\n         12. SABAs: All patients must be able to replace their current SABA with\n             albuterol/salbutamol HFA MDI inhalation aerosol for the duration of the study.\n\n         13. Female patients may not be pregnant, breastfeeding, or attempting to become pregnant.\n\n               -  other criteria may apply, please contact the investigator for more information\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          1. A history of a life-threatening asthma exacerbation (an asthma episode that required\n             intubation and/or was associated with hypercapnea, respiratory arrest, or hypoxic\n             seizures).\n\n          2. The patient is pregnant or lactating, or plans to become pregnant during the study\n             period or for 30 days after the study..\n\n          3.

The patient has a known hypersensitivity to any corticosteroid, salmeterol, or any of\n             the excipients in the study drug or rescue medication formulation (ie, lactose).\n\n          6. The patient has been treated with any known strong cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4\n             inhibitors (eg, azole antifungals, ritonavir, or clarithromycin) within 30 days\n             before the SV.\n\n          7. The patient has been treated with any of the prohibited medications during the\n             prescribed (per protocol) washout periods before the SV.\n\n          8.

A member of the patient's household is participating in the study at the same time.\n             However, after the enrolled patient completes or discontinues participation in the\n             study, another patient from the same household may be screened.\n\n         19. The patient has a disease/condition that in the medical judgment of the investigator\n             would put the safety of the patient at risk through participation or that could\n             affect the efficacy or safety analysis if the disease/condition worsened during the\n             study.\n\n               -  other criteria may apply, please contact the investigator for more information"
