    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of three ultrasound
      assistance techniques for internal jugular venous cannulation, in terms of cannulation
      success and prevention of complications.

    <time_frame>At the end of the cannulation process (180 seconds, maximum)</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Cannulation will be considered as &quot;successful&quot; once a flexible guidewire has been inserted into the internal jugular vein during the first 180 seconds from the moment the Seldinger needle pierces the skin. If time spent until guidewire insertion is more than 180 seconds, or if guidewire cannot be inserted into the internal jugular vein chosen, cannulation will be considered &quot;unsuccessful&quot;. This outcome measure will be registered at the end of the cannulation process.</description>

    <time_frame>At the end of the cannulation process (180 seconds, maximum)</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Number of cannulation attempts that have taken place before cannulation success. Any withdrawal of the needle followed by an advance will be considered a separated cannulation attempt.This outcome measure will be registered at the end of the cannulation process.</description>

    <measure>First attempt cannulation</measure>
    <time_frame>At the end of the cannulation process (180 seconds, maximum)</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Any cannulation that has been accomplished with a single cannulation attempt will be considered a &quot;first attempt cannulation&quot;. This outcome measure will be registered at the end of the cannulation process.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cannulation time</measure>
    <time_frame>At the end of the cannulation process (180 seconds, maximum)</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Time elapsed (seconds) from the moment the Seldinger needle pierces the skin to the moment the guidewire is inserted inside the vein. This outcome measure will be registered at the end of the cannulation process.</description>

    <measure>Mechanical complications</measure>
    <time_frame>At the end of the cannulation process (180 seconds, maximum)</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>Yes</safety_issue>
    <description>The incidence of the following mechanical complications will be registered: arterial puncture, puncture site bleeding, puncture site haematoma, pneumothorax, catheter tip misplacement. This outcome measure will be registered at the end of the cannulation process, and once a control chest x-Ray has been performed.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Infectious complications</measure>
    <time_frame>Once the central venous catheter is withdrawn (2 months)</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>Yes</safety_issue>
    <description>The incidence of bacterial catheter colonization and catheter-related blood stream infection will be registered once the central venous catheter has been withdrawn. Patients will be followed for the duration of central venous access, an expected average of 8 weeks</description>

    <intervention_name>Ultrasound-guided Internal jugular venous approach</intervention_name>
    <description>The physician will use an ultrasound machine to perform an ultrasound-guided internal jugular venous cannulation: the needle and the vein will be visualized in real time in the ultrasound image to make the cannulation process easier and safer.
In each one of three study arms, however, the ultrasound approach will be different depending on the axis on wich the vein is visualized (longitudinal, transversal or oblique) and the way the needle enters the ultrasound plane (in-plane or out of plane).</description>
