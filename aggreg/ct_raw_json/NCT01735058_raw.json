            "textblock": "Rotator cuff disease in particular is a common cause of shoulder pain and weakness and\n      comprises a significant proportion of the musculoskeletal complaints presenting to primary\n      care doctors. Ultrasound is a readily available and cheap modality for looking more\n      specifically at the rotator cuff and surrounding structures. More recently, ultrasound\n      guidance has become a commonly employed method to perform diagnostic or therapeutic\n      interventions. Despite the long history and the fact that this is a common diagnosis made in\n      clinical practice, the exact cause and best treatment for this condition still are being\n      explored. Although there are a few high-quality studies demonstrating the efficacy of sodium\n      hyaluronate injection for rotator cuff disease, this study will be performed to examine the\n      effect of ultrasound-guided subacromial sodium hyaluronate injection in patients with\n      impingement syndrome without rotator cuff complete tear."
