            "textblock": "Overactive bladder (OAB) is a very common problem that impairs the quality of life of about\n      17% of adult population in USA above the age of 40. The issues becomes more prominent with\n      getting older. OAB was determined by International Continence Society as urgency (immediate\n      desire to urinate that could not be postponed) with or without incontinence usually\n      associated with increased frequency and nocturia (urination at night). In 2012, American\n      Urologic Association published clinical guidelines for the treatment of OAB of non\n      neurogenic origin. Neuromodulation was proposed as the third line of treatment and two\n      treatments were recommended: sacral nerve neuromodulation (SNM) and posterior tibial nerve\n      stimulation (PTNS). Each of above mentioned procedures are invasive. SNM involves lead\n      implantation in operating room using X-ray guidance and anesthesia. PTNS involves needle\n      insertion on the low extremity.\n\n      The investigators would like to examine the efficacy of transcutaneous nerve stimulation\n      (TENS) in refractory to the first two lines of OAB treatment patients."
