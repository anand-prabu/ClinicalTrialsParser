      This is a multi-center, multi-national, randomized, parallel-group, placebo-controlled,
      double-blind study with a 17 week (maximum) treatment period consisting of an initial,
      open-label dose titration (up to 2 weeks), followed by a washout period (up to 3 weeks),
      followed by a 12 week treatment period on a stable dose.
