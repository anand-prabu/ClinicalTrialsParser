            "textblock": "Rationale: Use of narcotics and benzodiazepines is common in the pediatric intensive care\n      unit (PICU) to alleviate pain and anxiety, especially for patients who are mechanically\n      ventilated. Pain control and sedation decrease oxygen consumption, facilitate mechanical\n      ventilation, ensure patient safety and help patients tolerate nursing care. However, these\n      medications can also have negative consequences. Patients receiving greater amounts of\n      pharmacologic sedation in the intensive care unit (ICU) have longer duration of mechanical\n      ventilation and ICU length of stay. In fact, daily interruption of sedation shortens\n      duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU length of stay. Sedatives have also been\n      associated with development of delirium in ICU patients and linked to delusional and\n      disturbing memories and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after recovery from critical\n      illness. Benzodiazepines and opiates are associated with abnormal sleep architecture.\n      Furthermore, patients experience tolerance, physical dependency and withdrawal from these\n      agents. Lastly, there is evidence that sedatives, anesthetics and opiates are associated\n      with neurotoxicity in animal studies leading to growing concern about the potential effects\n      of these agents on the developing brains of children.\n\n      Novel Approach: In light of these negative aspects of pharmacologic sedation, we are looking\n      for alternative ways to provide comfort to critically ill children in the PICU. Acupuncture\n      has been found to be effective in reducing anxiety, acute pain, procedural pain,\n      post-operative pain, chronic pain, headache, infant colic, and has been found to reduce\n      anesthetic requirement during surgery.\n\n      Study Plan: We plan to randomize patients 6 months - 17 yrs old who are receiving mechanical\n      ventilation in the PICU to either acupuncture or sham acupuncture as an adjunct to standard\n      of care pharmacologic sedation as prescribed by the PICU medical team caring for the\n      patients. Our hypothesis is that those patients receiving acupuncture will require less\n      medications to keep them comfortable. Our study is powered (80%) to detect a 33% decrease in\n      pharmacologic sedation/analgesia."

One point is given for each of the following: morphine or midazolam equivalents of 0.1mg/kg, pentobarbital 2mg/kg, chloral hydrate 50mg/kg, any propofol use, any phenobarbitol use. Use of any antihistamines receives a point score of 0.5. When this score was originally developed, dexmedetomidine was not part of the score. However, as use of dexmedetomidine has become much more prevalent, we have modified the sedation score such that 1\u03bcg/kg of dexmedetomidine is equivalent to 0.1mg/kg of lorazepam.",
