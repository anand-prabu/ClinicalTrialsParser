While this is not the primary goal of such treatments it is\n      often seen and described as so called \"Sculptra glow\".\n\n      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of repeated subcutaneous injections of\n      poly-L-lactic acid (Sculptra Aesthetic) on skin quality.\n\n      Participating subjects will be part of the study for about 15 months. There will be an\n      initial treatment period of up to 12 weeks, followed by a 12-month follow-up period. There\n      will be a total of 7 scheduled visits.\n\n      This study is a double-blind, randomized study. \"Double-blind\" means that neither the\n      subjects nor the study doctor will know who is receiving Sculptra Aesthetic or placebo.\n      \"Randomized\" means that the group subjects will be placed in is decided by chance, similar\n      to drawing numbers out of a hat or flipping a coin. Subjects will have a 1 out of 2 chance\n      of receiving the active study drug. After the completion of the study, if subjects are\n      assigned to the control (placebo) group they will receive free injections with Sculptra\n      Aesthetic same as the treatment group."
