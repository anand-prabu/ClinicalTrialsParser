It is not yet known whether paclitaxel and carboplatin is more\n      effective than standard chemotherapy for advanced non-small cell lung cancer.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of paclitaxel and\n      carboplatin chemotherapy with that of standard chemotherapy in treating patients who have\n      stage III or stage IV non-small cell lung cancer that cannot be removed during surgery."

Patients are stratified according to\n      center, stage of disease (IIIA vs IIIB vs IV), or performance status (ECOG O vs 1 vs 2 vs\n      3).\n\n      Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms:\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours, followed by carboplatin IV over 30\n           minutes on day 1.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive mitomycin IV, ifosfamide IV over 3 hours, and cisplatin IV\n           over 1 hour on day 1 OR mitomycin IV, vinblastine IV, and cisplatin IV over 4 hours on\n           day 1.\n\n      Treatment continues every 3 weeks for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression\n      or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Quality of life is assessed before each treatment course.\n\n      Patients are followed for survival.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 300 patients (150 per treatment arm) will be accrued for\n      this study."
