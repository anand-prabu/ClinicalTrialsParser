  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Young men who have sex with men (YMSM) account for almost 70% of HIV diagnoses among all
      young people in the U.S. and are alone in facing an increasing rate of infections. Because
      YMSM are less likely to receive relevant sexual health education in traditional settings
      (e.g. schools, community), the Internet is a unique route of reaching and helping YMSM.

      The purpose of this study is to compare two different versions of an online HIV prevention
      program for YMSM. The study is being conducted by researchers at Northwestern University in
      Chicago, Hunter College in New York City, and Emory University in Atlanta. A total of 750
      YMSM will be enrolled into this study from the clinics of community partners in Chicago, New
      York, and Atlanta.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two versions of the program.  Some topics
      in the program include HIV facts and myths, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and
      condom use. All participants, regardless of the program version they receive, will also take
      at-home urine and rectal tests for the STIs chlamydia and gonorrhea. After completing the
      program, participants will be contacted three more times over the course of a year for
      follow-up sessions and surveys.

      The research team hypothesizes that the YMSM-specific prevention program will lead to a
      significant reduction in the frequency of unprotected anal sex acts and new STI infections
      compared to the HIV knowledge program that is for a general audience. The YMSM-specific
      program will also lead to improvements in secondary knowledge, motivation, and skills
      outcomes.

      In order for the research team to measure the effectiveness of the YMSM-specific prevention
      program and determine if the study hypothesis is correct, participants will be asked
      questions about themselves, including questions about their sexual orientation, sexual
      experiences, health practices, including drug use, health knowledge, and questions about
      their feelings and emotions. Based on this information, the research team hopes to later
      change, improve, or expand the program to better address the needs of YMSM.

    <description>The KIU! intervention is a multi-media online HIV prevention program developed specifically for young (18-24 years old) men who have sex with men (MSM) who recently tested HIV negative. Intervention content includes discussions of community involvement, scenarios on hooking-up online, communication skills in relationships (including negotiating safer sex), condom use, HIV knowledge, and HIV/STI risks.  Information is presented in various formats like games, animation, and videos to address gaps in HIV knowledge, motivate safer behaviors, teach behavioral skills, and instill self-efficacy for preventive behaviors. The intervention is completed across three sessions, done at least 24 hours apart (i.e. at least 3 days), and takes about 2 hours total to complete.</description>

    <description>The control condition reflects HIV information that is currently available on many websites so as to understand how the KIU! intervention improves upon what is currently available online. It is not tailored to YMSM, non-interactive, and focused on HIV/STI knowledge.  The control is completed across three sessions done at least 24 hours apart (i.e. at least 3 days).</description>
