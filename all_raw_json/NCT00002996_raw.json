Following a 7 day stabilization period, flecainide is administered.\n      One capsule of flecainide is given twice a day on days 8-10, two capsules are given twice a\n      day on days 11-14 and three capsules are given twice a day on days 15-21. BPI forms are\n      completed on days 8, 15 and 22 to assess neuropathic pain.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 7-20 patients will be accrued for this study."
