  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The rapid development of agents blocking kinases has established the use of molecularly
      targeted therapy as the preferred treatment approach for patients with metastatic renal cell
      cancer (RCC). Five kinase inhibitors (sunitinib, everolimus, temsirolimus, sorafenib and
      pazopanib) are now approved for clinical use. Response rates differ among these agents,
      importantly depending on line of treatment. In first-line treatment sunitinib results in 47%
      objective response rates, where in second-line after cytokines 34% responds. Thus far, it is
      unclear which patient with advanced renal cell cancer will respond to targeted therapy. In
      order to select patients for targeted therapies, several profiling approaches have been
      explored but to date no adequate and reliable test is available. It is assumed that
      responses to targeted agents depend on specific receptor and protein signalling activities
      in tumor tissues. Therefore, we propose that protein phosphorylation profiling with
      phosphoproteomics may be a potential clinical diagnostic tool to predict for tumor response
      to targeted therapy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with advanced (unresectable and/or metastatic) renal cell cancer.

          -  Patients who will start treatment with sunitinib, pazopanib, sorafenib, axitinib or
             everolimus.

          -  At least one tumor lesion should be accessible for biopsy. Bone metastases are
             excluded as possible biopsy site.

          -  Age &gt;- 18 years.

          -  Patients must have at least one measurable lesion. Lesions must be evaluated by
             CT-scan or MRI according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST).

          -  WHO performance status 0 - 2

          -  Able to provide written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinical findings associated with an unacceptably high tumor biopsy risk, according
             to the judgement of the investigator.

          -  Radiotherapy on target lesions during study or within 4 weeks of the start of drug.

          -  Any condition that is unstable or could jeopardize the safety of the subject and
             their compliance in the study.
