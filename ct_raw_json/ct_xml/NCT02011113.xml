             treatment.  Includes subjects receiving corticosteroids (&gt; 10 mg/day of prednisone or
             equivalent) within 3 weeks prior to enrollment.

             of study treatment:

          -  Radiation therapy

          -  Use of any antimyeloma drug therapy. 18. Subjects who received an allogeneic bone
             marrow or allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplant less than 12 months prior
             to initiation of study treatment and who have not discontinued immunosuppressive
             treatment for at least 4 weeks prior to initiation of study treatment and are
             currently dependent on such treatment.
