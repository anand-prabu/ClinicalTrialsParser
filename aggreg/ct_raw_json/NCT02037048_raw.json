Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as oxaliplatin, leucovorin calcium, fluorouracil,\n      paclitaxel, and carboplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells,\n      either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Radiation therapy uses high\n      energy x rays to kill tumor cells. Giving chemotherapy followed by surgery and response\n      based chemotherapy and radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells."

To assess the ability of response adapted adjuvant chemoradiotherapy to improve the 1\n      year recurrence free survival (RFS) compared to historical data in patients with > 50%\n      remaining viable tumor after induction chemotherapy.\n\n      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. To determine the rates of symptomatic, endoscopic, and pathologic response to induction\n      chemotherapy.\n\n      II. To determine the rate of R0 resection after induction chemotherapy. III. To establish\n      the toxicity profile of this tri-modality regimen. IV. To assess the recurrence free\n      survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) of this trimodality therapy regimen for the entire\n      cohort and in patients who do and do not achieve a pathologic response.\n\n      V. To assess patterns of failure and assess the rates of distant metastatic control (DMC)\n      and locoregional control (LRC) of this tri-modality therapy regimen.\n\n      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. To evaluate for the presence and amount of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in patients\n      with locoregionally advanced (LRA) adenocarcinoma (ACA) of the esophagus, gastroesophageal\n      junction (GEJ), and gastric cardia (GC) at diagnosis and after induction therapy.\n\n      II. To explore the relationship between CTCs at diagnosis and after induction therapy with\n      clinical and pathologic response parameters and survival outcomes.\n\n      III. To evaluate the pattern of Ki-67 expression in patients with LRA esophageal cancer\n      before and after induction chemotherapy.\n\n      IV. To explore the relationship of Ki-67 expression to clinical and pathologic response\n      parameters as well as survival outcomes.\n\n      V. To evaluate the relationship between human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)\n      overexpression (based on immunohistochemistry) and gene amplification (based on fluorescence\n      in situ hybridization) with clinical and pathologic response parameters and survival\n      outcomes.\n\n      OUTLINE:\n\n      INDUCTION CHEMOTHERAPY: Patients receive oxaliplatin intravenously (IV) over 2 hours and\n      leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours on day 1, and fluorouracil IV continuously over 44 hours\n      on days 1-3. Treatment repeats every 14 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease\n      progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      SURGERY: Approximately 4-5 weeks after completion of induction chemotherapy, patients\n      undergo a surgical procedure. The choice of surgical procedure is at the discretion of the\n      operating physician.\n\n      ADJUVANT THERAPY: Within 6-12 weeks after surgery, patients undergo radiation therapy for 28\n      days. Patients with a positive pathological response also receive oxaliplatin, leucovorin\n      calcium, and fluorouracil as in the induction chemotherapy, beginning days 1, 15, and 29\n      concurrent with radiation therapy. Patients with a negative pathological response receive\n      paclitaxel IV over 1 hour and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, and\n      36 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with\n      locoregional disease only after induction therapy but do not undergo surgery may receive\n      chemoradiotherapy with carboplatin and paclitaxel as determined by the primary oncologist.\n\n      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years,\n      every 4-5 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter."
