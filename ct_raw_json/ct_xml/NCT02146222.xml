    <textblock>
      This partially randomized phase I trial studies the side effects and how well sequential
      dosing of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR)/platelet derived growth factor
      receptor (PDGFR) dual kinase inhibitor X-82 and docetaxel works in treating patients with
      solid tumors. VEGFR/PDGFR dual kinase inhibitor X-82 may stop the growth of tumor cells by
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as
      docetaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the
      cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving
      VEGFR/PDGFR dual kinase inhibitor X-82 and docetaxel one at a time instead of concurrently
      may work in treating patients with solid tumors.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of intermittent X-82 (VEGFR/PDGFR dual kinase
      inhibitor X-82) when administered in a 2 week on, 1 week off schedule (Cycle #1).

      II. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of intermittent X-82 administered in combination
      with docetaxel every 3 weeks (Cycle #2).

      III. To determine the change in vascular parameters using 3'Deoxy-3'-fluorothymidine (FLT)
      positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) to X-82 alone (Cycle #1).

      IV. To determine the change in vascular parameters using FLT PET/CT to X-82 in combination
      with docetaxel (Cycle #2).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the objective response using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors
      (RECIST) 1.1 of intermittent X-82 with docetaxel.

      II. To measure the change in plasma vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels with
      changes on FLT PET/CT.

      III. To measure changes in X-82 pharmacokinetics with changes on FLT PET/CT.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of sequential X-82 with docetaxel in disease
      sub-populations. (Dose expansion cohort) II. To evaluate the objective response rate of
      sequential X-82 with docetaxel in these disease sub-populations. (Dose expansion cohort)

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive high dose VEGFR/PDGFR dual kinase inhibitor X-82 orally (PO) once
      daily (QD) on days 2-15. Beginning course 2, patients also receive docetaxel intravenously
      (IV) over 60 minutes on day 1.

      ARM II: Patients receive low dose VEGFR/PDGFR dual kinase inhibitor X-82 PO QD on days 2-15
      and docetaxel IV as in Arm I.

      In both arms, courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      EXPANSION COHORT: Patients receive VEGFR/PDGFR dual kinase inhibitor X-82 as in Arm I and
      docetaxel IV over 60 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
