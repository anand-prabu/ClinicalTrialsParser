  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study for patients that have a condition called Interstitial Cystitis, also known
      as Painful Bladder Syndrome.  Patients would have tried at least two different therapies,
      unsuccessfully,(eg. medications, pelvic floor physical therapy)

      The  purpose of this research project is to study the immunosuppressive drug Cyclosporine in
      patients with Interstitial Cystitis to assess how well it works, what the side effects are
      and what is its mechanism of action.  Cyclosporine is a drug that is FDA-approved to prevent
      organ rejection after kidney, liver, and heart transplant but is not approved by the FDA for
      Interstitial Cystitis.  Several research studies have been published showing that
      Cyclosporine can improve the symptoms of Interstitial Cystitis, that it works better than a
      placebo (&quot;sugar pill&quot; or inert treatment) and that it works more effectively than Pentosan
      Polysulfate (Elmiron), which is an FDA approved therapy.  The dose of Cyclosporine used in
      these studies on Interstitial Cystitis are much lower that the doses used to prevent
      rejection in transplant patients.

      Based on these studies, the American Urological Association has recently published treatment
      guidelines that recommend Cyclosporine therapy for Interstitial Cystitis after the failure
      of other more conservative therapies and medications. Nevertheless, much is not known about
      using Cyclosporine therapy for Interstitial Cystitis including the mechanism of action, the
      ideal dose, how best to monitor for side effects and in particular whether kidney damage can
      occur at the low doses used in these studies. In this study, to examine the mechanism of
      action, blood and urine samples will be collected before, during and after therapy to look
      at &quot;biomarkers&quot;, chemical substances that can be associated with inflammation and tissue
      injury. We will also test effects of therapy on skin sensation and pain perception because
      the molecule which Cyclosporine binds to (calcineurin) is also found in nerves that conduct
      pain signals.

      This study is only being done at the Cleveland Clinic and will involve about 30 patients
      with Interstitial Cystitis.
