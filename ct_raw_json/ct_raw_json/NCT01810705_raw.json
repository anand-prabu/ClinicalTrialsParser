            "textblock": "L-asparaginase (ASNase) holds a key role in chemotherapy for Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia\n      (ALL) in children and young adults. In elderly patients, its efficacy is counterbalanced by\n      its toxicity, which impairs its use. However, a current study with Red Blood Cells (RBC)\n      encapsulating ASNase (GRASPA\u00ae) in elderly ALL (study reference \"GRASPALL-GRAAL SA2 2008\")\n      showed that efficacy/safety profile was positive, paving the way for introducing ASNase\n      benefit into chemotherapy for elderly patients.\n\n      In adults, Capizzi (1988) reported a significant benefit of ASNase associated with high-dose\n      cytarabine treatment (HiDAC) in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). Indeed, there was an overall\n      statistically superior complete remission rate for HiDAC/ASNase (40%) vs HiDAC (24%) and an\n      overall survival benefit for patients treated with HiDAC/ASNase (19.6 weeks vs 15.9 weeks.\n\n      Another study in elderly patients also displayed positive results for ASNase treatment\n      (Petti, 1989), as well as recent single case reports that point out the potential benefit of\n      ASNase in different AML or mixed lineage leukemia (Horikoshi, 2009; Rubnitz, 2009).\n\n      Our preclinical results also showed that an AML cell line and blast cells from the bone\n      marrow of AML patients were sensitive to ASNase in vitro.\n\n      However, up to now, the toxicity of ASNase for elderly had prevented its use in this\n      population that represents the majority of AML patients.\n\n      Aim Considering the promising results of ASNase for AML treatment and the better safety\n      profile offered by RBC encapsulating ASNase (GRASPA\u00ae), a multicenter, randomized, controlled\n      IIb trial is open for recruitment. Efficacy and tolerability of GRASPA\u00ae plus low-dose\n      cytarabine will be evaluated versus low-dose cytarabine alone in treatment of AML patients\n      over 65 year-old, unfit for intensive chemotherapy.\n\n      One hundred and twenty-three patients (65-85 year-old) newly diagnosed for AML are planned\n      for inclusion in the study.\n\n      A 2:1 randomization will be respected (82 patients treated with GRASPA\u00ae plus low-dose\n      cytarabine and 41 patients treated with low-dose cytarabine alone). Each patient will be\n      followed for 24 months.\n\n      Progression-free survival (time elapsed between treatment initiation and disease\n      progression/death) will be evaluated as a primary endpoint. A 75% improvement in the median\n      progression-free survival  is assumed in the experimental group vs control group.\n      Percentages of remission (complete and partial), survival (event-free and overall), patient\n      quality of life, general safety, pharmacodynamic/pharmacokinetic and immunogenicity of\n      GRASPA\u00ae will be also evaluated."
