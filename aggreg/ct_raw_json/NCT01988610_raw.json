It may\n      also indirectly affect the brain by controlling how much insulin the body makes. Insulin is\n      thought to impact cognition by changing the amount of sugar available in certain parts of\n      the brain.\n\n      The investigators are studying this question by giving patients a medication, called\n      Mifepristone, which reduces cortisol's effect on the brain. The investigators will compare\n      results from several groups of people, including differences between men and women, and\n      between those with and without insulin resistance."

To evaluate changes in neuropsychological test performance among patients with a\n           history of depression and who have insulin resistance who are treated with open-label\n           mifepristone and,\n\n        3. To explore interactions between changes in patients' glucose tolerance profiles and\n           changes in verbal memory and attention. An exploratory aim is to explore the\n           interaction of changes in cortisol awakening response and changes in verbal memory  and\n           attention within subjects with and without IGT, as well as the potential mediating\n           effects of gender."
