            "textblock": "Due to constant strain the joints of the hands are frequently affected by osteoarthritis\n      (OA).\n\n      Short-wave diathermy (SWD) is a form of electromagnetic therapy, which causes movement of\n      ions, distortion of molecules, and creation of eddy currents and as a result heat is\n      produced in deep tissue. Its claimed mechanism of action includes inducing an\n      anti-inflammatory response, reducing joint stiffness, stimulating connective tissue repair,\n      and reducing muscle spasm and pain.\n\n      Since the available studies were performed to study the large weight-bearing joints only,\n      there is a lack in scientific evidence for the efficacy of SWD in hand OA.\n\n      The aim of this randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study is to evaluate the effect\n      of SWD on:\n\n      joint function in patients with hand OA. joint pain in patients with hand OA. grip strength\n      in patients with hand OA. quality of live in patients with hand OA."
