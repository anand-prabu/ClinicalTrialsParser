  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The broad, long-term objective of the current research is to improve treatment outcomes for
      individuals with comorbid posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and alcohol abuse and
      dependence (AUD).

      The purpose of which is to evaluate changes in both PTSD symptoms and alcohol use and
      cravings associated with Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) or Relapse Prevention (RP)
      treatment in individuals with PTSD/AUD, along with mediators and moderators of outcomes.

      The study will randomize 235 PTSD/AUD participants recruited from the VA and from the
      community to CPT, RP, or Interactive Voice Response (IVR) assessment only (AO). Those in the
      AO condition will be re-randomized after the treatment phase to either RP or CPT.
      Individuals will be assessed pretreatment, immediately post-treatment, 3-, 6-, 9-, and
      12-months post-treatment and will monitor symptoms daily throughout treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prior research has established that PTSD and AUD are frequently comorbid.

      Although combined treatments have been developed, they are complex and lengthy with mixed
      results as to their efficacy. Excellent treatments exist for PTSD or AUD alone, however, it
      has not been adequately addressed to what extent these treatments are effective in treating
      comorbid symptom presentations. To address this research gap, the investigators will
      evaluate two widely accepted treatments for each respective disorder; Cognitive Processing
      Therapy (CPT) an effective PTSD treatment and Relapse Prevention (RP), a widely used
      effective AUD treatment.

      The investigators will build on our prior work using a daily telephone Interactive Voice
      Response (IVR) system to test models of self-medication and the sequence of symptom change
      for both primary and secondary symptom targets associated with each therapy.

      Creating a more comprehensive model of symptom change in PTSD and alcohol use with widely
      used selective treatments is critical in testing theories of PTSD/AUD, evaluating these
      treatments for use with PTSD/AUD, and implementing these therapies with PTSD/AUD patients in
      standard clinical practice
