Most\n      patients have and arterio-venous fistula which enable the insertion of two large gauge\n      needles. At the end of dialysis the needles are extracted and  continuous pressure is needed\n      to stop the bleeding. Time to hemostasis is different between patients and may be up to 20\n      minutes for each insertion point. Acquired coagulopathy in patients on chronic hemodylasis\n      is a well known entity which have an important impact on time to hemostasis. The\n      coagulopathy is multi-factorial composed including uremic thrombocytopathia, the presence of\n      anemia, the use of anti-platelets and / or  anti-coagulation drugs and the regular use of\n      heparin during the dialysis process.

All of the participants including - patients, physician, nurses and study\n      coordinator will be blinded to the treatments. In ta course of the study each dressing will\n      be applied 10 times in a given patient so in practical  each patient will be his own\n      control.\n\n      Protocol for applying the dressing:\n\n      Following the needle extraction either dressing \"A\" or \"B\" will applied with slight pressure\n      for 2 minutes.
