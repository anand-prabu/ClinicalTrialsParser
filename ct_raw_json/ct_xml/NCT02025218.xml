      To evaluate the effect of re-administration of gefitinib to EGFR-mutated NSCLC patients who
      had been treated with at least one line of TKIs followed by another line of treatment
      (non-TKI)

      Rationale: Gefitinib is a registered first-line treatment for EGFR-mutated NSCLC patients.
      There is a lack of evidence for second and third line therapies in this category of
      patients. Several case reports have described successful re-administration of gefitinib to
      NSCLC patients who achieved objective response with the initial administration of gefitinib
      before eventual progression.

      Objective: The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the disease control rate (DCR;
      confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD)) of
      gefitinib using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) version 1.1 in
      patients with activating sensitising Epidermal Growth Factor mutation positive (EGFR M+)
      NSCLC. The secondary objectives of the study are: objective response rate (ORR) according to
      RECIST, progression free survival (PFS) according to RECIST, overall Survival (OS), EGFR
      Mutational status of tumour tissue both activating and resistance EGFR mutations analysis
      and the association between the Veristrat assay (Biodesix) and both PFS and OS will be
      assessed.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed NSCLC with an activating sensitising EGFR
             TK mutation as determined before starting the first EGFR-TKI treatment by using a
             well-validated and robust methodology

          -  Female or male patients aged 18 years or over with locally advanced or metastatic
             stage IIIB/IV disease, not suitable for therapy of curative intent or stage IV
             (metastatic) disease, eligible for gefitinib re-challenge treatment for NSCLC who
             have already received an EGFR-TKI with a documented complete (CR) or partial response
             (PR) or stable disease (SD) &gt;12 weeks as the best response to their 1st EGFR-TKI
             treatment and who have received any subsequent anti-cancer therapy (excluding
             EGFR-TKIs) treatment, including but not limited to doublet platinum based
             chemotherapy or docetaxel monotherapy or pemetrexed monotherapy, on which they
             progressed.

          -  Measurable disease defined as at least one lesion, not previously irradiated, that
             can be accurately measured at baseline as ≥ 10 mm in the longest diameter (except
             lymph nodes which must have short axis ≥ 15 mm) with spiral CT or MRI and which is
             suitable for accurate repeated measurements.

          -  WHO / ECOG / Zubrod performance status 0-2.

          -  Possibility of obtaining tumour material before the start of the study treatment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known severe hypersensitivity to gefitinib or any of the excipients of the product
             treatment with no persistent radiation toxicity. Previous adjuvant chemotherapy is
             allowed.

          -  Progressive disease or stable disease (SD) &lt;12 weeks as best response to the 1st line
             treatment with an EGFR-TKI

          -  Consideration to require radiotherapy to the lung at the time of study entry or in
             the near future

          -  Past medical history of interstitial lung disease, drug-induced interstitial disease,
             radiation pneumonitis which required steroid treatment or any evidence of clinically
             active interstitial lung disease. Pre-existing idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
             evidenced by CT scan at baseline

          -  Known or suspected brain metastases or spinal cord compression, unless treated with
             surgery and/or radiation.

          -  Any unresolved chronic toxicity greater than CTC grade 2 from previous anticancer
             therapy

          -  Concomitant use of known CYP 3A4 inducers such as phenytoin, carbamazepine,
             rifampicin, barbiturates, or St John's Wort

          -  Pregnancy or breast-feeding

          -  As judged by the investigator, any evidence of severe or uncontrolled systemic
             disease (eg, unstable or uncompensated respiratory, cardiac, hepatic, or renal
             disease)

          -  Evidence of any other significant clinical disorder or laboratory finding that makes
             it undesirable for the patient to participate in the study

          -  Other co-existing malignancies or malignancies diagnosed within the last 2 years with
             the exception of basal cell carcinoma or cervical cancer in situ

          -  Life expectancy of less than 12 weeks

          -  Treatment with a non-approved or investigational drug within 30 days before day 1 of
             study treatment

          -  Involvement in the planning and/or conduct of the study (applies to both NVALT staff
             or staff at the study site)

          -  Previous enrolment or treatment in the present study.
