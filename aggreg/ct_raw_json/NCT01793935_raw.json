Modern scientific data for WSE indicate several bioactive molecules\n      (withanolides, withanosides, indosides, withaferin-A, others) with significant\n      immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory and stress reducing properties.\n\n      This study will examine whether a standardized extract of Withania Somnifera (WSE;\n      Sensoril\u00ae) will improve total, positive, negative symptoms, and stress in patients with\n      schizophrenia.  The study will examine whether WSE reduces PANSS positive and negative\n      symptoms and stress scores in subjects, and whether these improvements are mediated by\n      changes in inflammatory immune indices.  An additional aim will determine if patients\n      receiving WSE will have fewer adjustments to their psychotropic medications that those\n      assigned to placebo. The study will examine whether WSE will re-balance Th1/Th2 ratios\n      (cytokine measures) and mediate a reduction of elevated hs-CRP levels.  It is hypothesized\n      that those subjects whose Th1/Th2 ratios normalize will likely have a greater magnitude of\n      clinical improvement versus those subjects whose immune ratios remain unbalanced.\n\n      The proposal is a 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled RCT of WSE added to\n      antipsychotic medications in 60 patients with schizophrenia with an exacerbation of\n      symptoms.  If efficacy is affirmed, this low cost extract could be studied further, and used\n      quite readily across low, middle and high income countries."
