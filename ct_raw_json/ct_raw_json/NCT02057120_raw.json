Kenzo still claims that the tape is able to reduce\n      pain, swelling, muscle spasms and prevent injury.

The non-dominant lower limb will also be positioned with 100\u00b0 of flexion of hip and will also be attached to the seat with a belt. The volunteers will also be attached to the seat of the dynamometer through two belts across his torso. During the tests the volunteers will be instructed to place his arms across the trunk and the dynamometer axis is positioned parallel to the center of the knee joint.
