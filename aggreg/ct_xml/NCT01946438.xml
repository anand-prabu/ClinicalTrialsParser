      The aim of the study is describe the safety and immunogenicity of Fluzone Quadrivalent and
      Fluzone Intradermal vaccines in adults 18 to &lt; 65 years of age, and to describe the safety
      and immunogenicity of Fluzone Quadrivalent and Fluzone High-Dose vaccines in adults ≥ 65
      years of age.

      Primary Objective:

        -  To describe the safety of the 2013-2014 formulations of Fluzone Quadrivalent and
           Fluzone Intradermal vaccines in adults 18 to &lt; 65 years of age and the safety of the
           2013-2014 formulations of Fluzone Quadrivalent and Fluzone High-Dose vaccines in adults
           ≥ 65 years of age.

      Observational objectives:

        -  To describe the immunogenicity of the 2013-2014 formulations of Fluzone Quadrivalent
           and Fluzone Intradermal vaccines in adults 18 to &lt; 65 years of age and the
           immunogenicity of the 2013-2014 formulations of Fluzone Quadrivalent and Fluzone
           High-Dose vaccines in adults ≥ 65 years of age.

        -  To evaluate the compliance, in terms of immunogenicity, of each study vaccine (Fluzone
           Quadrivalent, Fluzone Intradermal, and Fluzone High-Dose) in the applicable age group
           with the requirements of the Committee for Human Medicinal Products (CHMP) Note for
           Guidance (NfG) CPMP/BWP/214/96.

        -  To submit sera from selected subjects to the Center for Biologics Evaluation and
           Research (CBER) for further analysis by the World Health Organization (WHO), the
           Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the Food and Drug Administration
           (FDA) to support formulation recommendations for subsequent influenza vaccines.

      Participants 18 to &lt; 65 years of age on enrollment will be randomized to receive either
      Fluzone Quadrivalent or Fluzone Intradermal vaccine. Participants ≥ 65 years of age at
      enrollment will be randomized to receive either Fluzone Quadrivalent or Fluzone High-Dose
      vaccine.

      Solicited adverse event (AE) information will be collected for 7 days after each
      vaccination, unsolicited AE and Serious adverse event information will be collected from
      Visit 1 to Visit 2. Total duration of participation in the study is approximately 21 days.

    <description>Seroprotection is defined as a titer ≥ 40 (l/dil) at pre vaccination and at 21days after vaccination.
