The concurrent presence of both diseases worsens the\n      limitations in exercise capacity and quality of life that patients experience with either\n      disease alone. This pilot study will test the feasibility of a yoga program conducted in\n      patients' homes using multi-point interactive videoconferencing (\"Tele- Yoga\") for patients\n      with combined COPD/HF diagnoses. The investigators hypothesize that patients who receive a\n      yoga program at home, compared to an educational control group, will experience fewer\n      physical symptoms and better quality of life."
