Opioid induced hyperalgesia (OIH) is\n      defined as paradoxically lowering the threshold of pain after the exposure of opioid.\n      Remifentanil is a short acting opioid that is commonly used during anesthesia and surgery.\n      However, OIH was reported to occur after surgery when large amount of remifentanil was\n      administered. On the other hand, nefopam is a centrally acting, non-opioid analgesic.\n      Nefopam has been reported to have analgesic and anti-hyperalgesic effect.\n\n      The investigators hypothesized that nefopam administration could prevent OIH or reduce the\n      severity of OIH. Therefore, the objective of the study is to find out the effect of nefopam\n      on remifentanil induced hyperalgesia in patients undergoing laparoscopic abdominal surgery."
