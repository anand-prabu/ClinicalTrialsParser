Despite advances in life style modification and\n      multi-drug therapies, 20-30% of all hypertensive patients remain resistant.\n\n      These individuals exhibit autonomic dysregulation due to elevated sympathetic activity and\n      norepinephrine spillover, and low parasympathetic activity. It is generally accepted that\n      this uncontrolled, resistant HTN is primarily \"neurogenic\" in origin, involving over\n      activity of the sympathetic nervous system that initiates and sustains HTN.  Thus, a\n      mechanism-based breakthrough is imperative to develop novel strategies to prevent and\n      perhaps eventually cure neurogenic hypertension (NH).\n\n      This study is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over design to test the hypothesis\n      that minocycline treatment would produce antihypertensive effects in drug-resistant\n      neurogenic hypertensive individuals."

After providing informed consent,\n      patients will have baseline and followup visits during which a brief physical examination\n      will be performed, medical history, assessment of medication compliance and tolerance, and\n      vital signs will be completed.\n\n      Subjects will undergo blood (lipid panel, high sensitivity-C reactive protein, high\n      sensitivity troponin, glucose, metabolic profile, lipid panel, Cystatin C and albumin) and\n      urine studies at the baseline visit and at 16, 19, 35 and 54 weeks.    Patients will have\n      ambulatory BP monitoring at baseline and at the end of each treatment period.\n\n      Patients will be randomized to drug scheme A or B. One scheme will follow the following\n      order: 16 weeks of minocycline, followed by a 3 week wash out period, then 16 weeks of\n      placebo, then 3 weeks of wash out and a final 16 week period of minocycline. The other\n      scheme will consist of 16 weeks of placebo, followed by 3 week wash out period, followed by\n      16 weeks of minocycline, then 3 week wash out and a final 16 weeks of placebo. Study visits\n      will occur at study entry (baseline/randomization), 16 weeks, 19 weeks, 35 weeks, 38 weeks,\n      and 54 weeks for each group. Patient participation will end after 56 weeks."
