            "textblock": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major burden for the affected patients,\n      who are continuously struggling with the hallmark symptoms breathlessness, cough, and sputum\n      together with high levels of anxiety and depression and impairment of quality of life (QoL).\n      The potential value of complementary interventions in COPD has long been recognised, yet so\n      far, no overall significant effects of psychosocial intervention programs such as cognitive\n      behavioural therapy or supportive/analytical psychotherapy have been found.\n\n      Mindfulness-based interventions have been shown to improve levels of physical symptoms,\n      stress, anxiety, depression, and QoL in other chronic conditions, and could also be relevant\n      in COPD. The present randomized controlled trial will test the efficacy of mindfulness-based\n      cognitive therapy (MBCT) in COPD patients. The investigators hypothesize that compared to\n      treatment-as-usual, the add-on of MBCT will result in improved psychological (anxiety,\n      depression, QoL) and physical outcomes (physical health status, activity level).\n      Furthermore, the investigators will explore the possible moderating role of individual\n      differences in sociodemographic and disease-related characteristics and mediating role of\n      self-efficacy and self-compassion for the hypothesised effect.\n\n      Patients recruited from the Department of Respiratory Medicine, Aarhus University Hospital,\n      will be randomized to participate in either an 8-week MBCT program as an add-on to the\n      already established pulmonary rehabilitation program (intervention group) or pulmonary\n      rehabilitation only (treatment-as-usual). Questionnaires assessing outcomes, mediators and\n      moderators will be completed before, during, and after the intervention as well as at a 3\n      and 6 mo. follow-up.\n\n      This study will be one of the first to test the efficacy of MBCT in COPD, bringing attention\n      to a patient group that is relatively ignored by the public as well as in the health\n      psychological empirical literature."
