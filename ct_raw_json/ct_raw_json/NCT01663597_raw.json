The former can be measured using the commercially available\n      IOL Master (Carl Zeiss Meditec AG, Germany) and have profound influence on visual acuity.\n      Higher-order aberrations do not significantly influence visual acuity but affect the quality\n      of vision and can cause halos, double vision, and night vision disturbances.\n\n      Background Cataract surgery has become a routine procedure in the developed countries.\n      During this surgery, a foldable intraocular lens is usually inserted into the capsular bag.\n      However, these lenses do not account for individual optical biometry data or aberrations.\n      Therefore, it is important to provide data for ametropic and emmetropic eyes as this\n      information might improve future intraocular lens design and lead to individually adapted\n      lenses for yielding optimal visual acuity and quality results.\n\n      The aim of the present study is to clarify the correlation between refractive errors/axial\n      eye length and spherical aberrations of the cornea."
