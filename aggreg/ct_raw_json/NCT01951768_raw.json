            "textblock": "Infected skin ulcers with diabetes can be very debilitating because they are difficult to\n      heal. Diabetic ulcers are responsible for frequent health care visits, and are a major\n      predictor of amputation. Diabetic ulcers can be caused by a patient's inability to sense\n      pain or warmth as well as peripheral vascular disease, which causes diminished blood flow to\n      the foot. Early aggressive treatment is necessary to treat infection and ultimately prevent\n      the need for amputation.\n\n      Gentamicin is an antibiotic that is effective in treating certain kinds of infection.\n      Collagen is a protein that is found in all mammals. The gentamicin sponge being used in this\n      study is commercially available in Switzerland as Garamycin\u00ae Sponge. The Garamycin Sponge is\n      a thin flat sponge made out of collagen that comes from bovine tendons and containing\n      gentamicin. When applied to an open ulcer, the collagen breaks down and the gentamicin is\n      released into the ulcer, but very little is absorbed into the blood stream. The high levels\n      of gentamicin in the open infected ulcer may help treat the infection.\n\n      All subjects will be given the necessary supplies and taught how to take care their foot\n      ulcer. All subjects will also receive oral an antibiotic. Additionally, subjects who are\n      randomly assigned to receive the gentamicin-collagen sponge will place a gentamicin-collagen\n      sponge on their ulcer during daily wound care."
