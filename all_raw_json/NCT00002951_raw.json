Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor\n      cells. Combining radiation therapy with chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of chemotherapy plus radiation therapy in\n      treating patients with head and neck cancer."

Patients who\n      have microscopic or macroscopic residual disease 6 weeks after completion of\n      chemoradiotherapy will receive a surgical salvage procedure.\n\n      The first cycle of chemotherapy will begin with PO doses of hydroxyurea every 12 hours on\n      days 0-5. Fluorouracil is given IV on days 0-4. Radiation therapy BID is given on days 1-6.\n      Cycles repeat every 14 days for a total of 5 cycles.\n\n      The disease will be reevaluated 4-6 weeks after completion of all treatment, every 3 months\n      for 1 year, then yearly.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 40 patients will be accrued for this study."
