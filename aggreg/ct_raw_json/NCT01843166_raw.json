Patients\n      may return to the clinic for subsequent fittings until a successful fit has been achieved.\n      An unsuccessful fitting is defined as discontinued pessary use due to discomfort or\n      expulsion.\n\n      Patients will be assessed for satisfaction and complications 6 wks, 18 wks, 36 wks and 60\n      wks after the successful fitting.\n\n      To determine patient satisfaction and complications, patients will complete a compilation of\n      validated questionnaires assessing urinary symptoms, sexual function and quality of life at\n      each follow-up.\n\n      At each follow-up, a vaginal exam will be done and a vaginal swab and urine sample (for\n      urinalysis and culture and sensitivities) will be taken to assess vaginal bleeding and\n      infections."
