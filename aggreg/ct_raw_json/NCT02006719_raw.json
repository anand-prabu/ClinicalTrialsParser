To be eligible for\n      treatment, a subject must have unilateral idiopathic adhesive capsulitis of the shoulder\n      with restricted range of motion in the affected shoulder for at least 3 months but not more\n      than 12 months. Subjects will be screened for study eligibility within 28 days before\n      injection of study drug.\n\n      Approximately 300 adult women and men are to be enrolled in this study. Following screening\n      and determination of study eligibility, subjects will be randomized 3:1 to receive 0.58 mg\n      of AA4500 or placebo.  Subjects will receive up to 3 injections of study drug.   Each\n      injection will be separated by a minimum of 21 days. Subjects will also be instructed in\n      home shoulder exercises after the first injection."
