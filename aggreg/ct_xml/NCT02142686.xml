      This study is a prospective double blinded randomised controlled trial.  240 women will be
      randomly divided into 3 groups, each containing 70 women. Randomisation will be performed
      using a computer generated random numbers and sealed envelopes.

      Full history will be taken followed by general and local examination. The procedure will be
      done in the lithotomy position. Hysteroscopy will be done using a 5mm outer diameter
      continuous flow hysteroscope with a French working channel and a 30 degrees direction of
      view provided by Techno GmbH and CO. The hysteroscope will be introduced using the
      vaginoscopy technique, in which no speculum will be used. The cervix will be detected and
      the external os will be identified using the hysteroscope. The hysteroscope will be
      introduced in the uterine cavity. Saline will be used as the distension medium and the
      pressure will be set at 80mm Hg until the hysteroscope is introduced in the uterine cavity.
      After the hysteroscope is introduced into the uterine cavity, the filling pressure will
      remain at 80mm Hg in group1, will be reduced to 50mm Hg in group 2 and to 30mmHg in group 3.
      Randomisation will be double blind; neither the operator nor the patient will know the
      pressure during the procedure, a third party will set the pressure according to the computer
      generated random numbers.

      The anterior wall, posterior wall and tubal ostea will be visualised, any polyps, adhesions
      septa, congenital malformations or submucous fibroids will be noted.
