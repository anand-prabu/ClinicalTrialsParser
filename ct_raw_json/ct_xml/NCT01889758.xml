      The study is designed to compare the steady-state pharmacokinetics of Prograf (Brand) and
      the two most disparate generic formulations (Generic Hi and Generic Lo) in a fully
      replicated, 3-way cross-over study in stable kidney (n=36) and liver transplant (n=36)
      subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To identify the most disparate tacrolimus generic drug formulations among those currently
      approved in the United States. We will conduct systematic dissolution testing of the brand
      and all currently approved tacrolimus drug formulations using the FDA-recommended
      dissolution method.  We propose to test and compare the 1mg capsule strength (3 production
      lots/ manufacturer). In addition, we will compare the different formulations in terms of
      potency, purity and other quality attributes. This work will be carried out in the
      GMP-compliant facilities of The University of Iowa Pharmaceuticals and the University of
      Colorado.  Based on these studies the two most disparate generic tacrolimus formulations
      (Generic Hi and Generic Lo) will be selected and compared with the Brand (PrografR,
      Astellas, Deerfield, IL) in the clinical trial.

      This is an open label, prospective, multicenter, randomized, replicate, six-period,
      three-sequence cross-over study to compare the steady state pharmacokinetics of PrografR to
      Generic Hi to Generic Lo in stable kidney and liver transplant subjects. The PK assessor
      will be blinded to the assigned treatment sequence and formulation.  The person analyzing
      the levels and analyzing the results will be blinded to formulation sequence. Each subject
      will be randomized to one of the three sequences where Generic Hi and Generic Lo represent
      the two generics and B the brand, Prograf.  The blood samples will be collected at C0
      (before morning dose) and then 20, 40, 60(1hr), 80, 100, 120(2hr), 140, 160, 180(3hr)
      minutes, 4, 5, 6, 8 and 12 hour after dosing with each formulation. Adherence will be
      monitored by patient diary, pill counts, and MEMS cap.  Safety and efficacy parameters will
      be monitored weekly.

      This study will be carried out in full compliance with the rules of Good Clinical Practice
      (GCP) including development of an electronic database and monitoring plan.

      Resulting pharmacokinetic parameters will be analyzed by a variety of pharmacokinetic tests
      such as narrower acceptance intervals, individual and scaled average bioequivalence was well
      as population pharmacokinetics.
