Consenting participants will be randomized into one of two groups: 1. Internet\n      delivered relapse prevention with therapist support or 2. Face-to-face therapy. Outcomes on\n      alcohol use, depression and quality of life as well as information on user satisfaction\n      will be gathered post treatment. Follow up will be at 3, 6 and 12 months after completion.\n\n      Our hypothesis is that the internet-based program with therapist support and the\n      face-to-face therapy will be equally effective in reducing alcohol use (non-inferiority)."
