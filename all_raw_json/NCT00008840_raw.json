            "textblock": "The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of 2 drugs (AmBisome\n      versus voriconazole) in treating fungal infections. Immunocompromised patients, especially\n      those with persistent fever and neutropenia, are at a high risk of developing deeply\n      invasive, life-threatening fungal infections with Candida, Aspergillus, and other\n      opportunistic fungal pathogens. The risk of fungal infection increases in direct proportion\n      with severity of neutropenia and duration of fever. Antifungal therapy, therefore, is an\n      important step in the amelioration of fungal disease."

At the conclusion of 3 days, the\n      voriconazole patients are then switched to oral voriconazole.  The AmBisome patients\n      continue with IV AmBisome. Both groups continue treatment until blood counts increase and\n      fever subsides."
