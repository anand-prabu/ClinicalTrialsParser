  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background.There is also some evidence that engaging in regular moderate-intensity physical
      activity may help ameliorate some of the treatment-related adverse effects experienced by
      childhood cancer survivors, which eventually improve their quality of life. Nevertheless,
      there is growing concern about declining levels of physical activity in childhood cancer
      survivors.

      Purposes. To examine the effectiveness of an integrated adventure-based training and health
      education programme in promoting the adoption and maintenance of regular physical activity
      among Hong Kong Chinese childhood cancer survivors.

      Design and Subjects. A randomised controlled trial (RCT), two-group pre-test and repeated
      post-test, between subjects design was conducted. Recruitment of subjects was carried out
      through the Sunshine Parents Club, which is a non-profit voluntary organization with the aim
      to provide education and psychological support to parents of Hong Kong Chinese childhood
      cancer survivors.

      Intervention. Participants in the placebo control group received an amount of time and
      attention (leisure activities organized by a community centre) that mimicked that received
      by the experimental group. Participants in the experimental group joined a four-day
      integrated adventure-based training and health education programme, which contained
      education talks, a workshop and adventure-based training activities.

      The aim of this study was to examine the effectiveness of an integrated adventure-based
      training and health education programme in promoting the exercise behavior changes and
      enhancing the physical activity levels, self-efficacy and quality of life of Hong Kong
      Chinese childhood cancer survivors.

      Intervention

      Placebo control group

      Participants received medical follow-up according to the schedule of the oncology units.
      Besides, participants received an amount of time and attention that mimicked that received
      by the experimental group, but which is thought not to have any specific effect on the
      outcome measures. They were invited to attend leisure activities organized by a community
      centre in four different days during the study period. Activities included cartoon film
      shows, handicraft workshops, chess games, health talks on the prevention of influenza and
      healthy diet, day visit to museum and theme park.

      Experimental group

      Besides receiving medical follow-up, participants joined a four-day integrated
      adventure-based training and health education programme, which contains education talks, a
      workshop to work out a feasible individual action plan for regular physical activity and
      adventure-based training activities. Previous research showed that working out individual
      action plan is important, which can increase the possibility for people to turn their
      intentions into health promotion action. The content of the education talks were tailor-made
      for participants in which they did not engage in regular physical activity.

      To ensure the dosage of intervention delivered in terms of the amount, frequency, duration,
      and breadth would be adequate to assess the quality and to manage outcomes, such as physical
      activity levels, self-efficacy, stages of change and quality of life, the following measures
      were taken. An advisory committee was set up with the purpose to develop an appropriate
      integrated programme for Hong Kong Chinese childhood cancer survivors. The committee
      included the researcher, an assistant professor at a local university with considerable
      experience of conducting psychological interventions among children, a paediatric oncologist
      and a oncology nurse specialist with rich experience in taking care of children with cancer,
      two professional adventure-based trainers and one assistant professor of Sports and
      Recreation Management with extensive experience and professional knowledge in conducting
      adventure-based training for children. In addition, the content of the programme that
      related to adventure-based training activities was sent to a professional adventure-based
      training centre for content validation. The programme was implemented on four different days
      within six months in a day camp training centre, such as at 2-week, 2-month, 4-month and
      6-month after the day of recruitment. The programme was implemented in small group with
      maximum 12 participants in one group. Health education talks and workshop were implemented
      in between adventure-based training activities in day camp centre, which were conducted by
      healthcare professionals working in a local university. Adventure-based training activities
      were led by two qualified adventure-based training instructors with extensive experience and
      professional knowledge in conducting such training for children. Additionally, at least two
      healthcare professionals joined the adventure-based training to monitor the physical
      condition of the survivors and their fitness to join the adventure-based training
      activities.

      Data Collection Methods

      Approval for the study was obtained from the hospital ethics committees. To identify
      potential subjects, a leaflet containing details of the study and a demographic sheet were
      mailed to all parents of childhood cancer survivors in the Sunshine Parents Club. If
      children and their parents were interested in the research, they could return the
      demographic sheet by using the enclosed return-envelop to convey their willingness to
      participate in the study. A briefing session would then be conducted in the out-patient
      clinic to those eligible children and parents. Written consent was then obtained from the
      parents after they were told the purposes of the study, although they were of course given
      the option of allowing or refusing the involvement of their child. The children were also
      invited to put their names on a special children's assent form and told that their
      participation was voluntary.

      After obtaining demographic data of participants, they were asked to respond to the Chinese
      version of the PA-SE, CUHK-PARCY, PASCQ and PedsQL. Participants were then randomly assigned
      to the experimental and control groups. All participants received a telephone call inviting
      them to join the interventions according to their group assignment at an appointed time.
      Data collection was conducted again at 3, 6 and 9 months after starting the intervention.
      All participants were informed that there would be home visits for data collection.

      Analysis

      The Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) software, version 19.0 for Windows was
      used to analyze quantitative data.  Intention-to-treat analysis was used and missing data
      was substituted by the last-observation-carried-forward procedure. The comparability of the
      experimental and control groups was assessed by using inferential statistics (independent
      t-test and chi-squared test). Descriptive statistics was used to calculate the mean scores
      and standard deviation of different scales. The interrelationships among the scores of
      physical activity levels, self-efficacy, stages of changes and quality of life at nine
      months after starting the intervention were investigated by means of the Pearson
      product-moment correlation coefficient. Mixed between-within subjects ANOVA (split-plot
      ANOVA) was used to determine whether the integrated adventure-based training and health
      education programme was effective in increasing childhood cancer survivors' levels of
      physical activity and self-efficacy and enhancing their quality of life. In addition,
      Friedman Test was used to determine any changes in exercise behavior of survivors between
      the experimental and control groups.
