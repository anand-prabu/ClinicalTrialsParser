Using radiolabeled glass beads to kill tumor cells may be\n      effective treatment for liver cancer that cannot be removed by surgery.\n\n      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects of hepatic arterial infusion using\n      yttrium-90 microspheres (TheraSphere\u00ae) to see how well it works in treating patients with\n      liver cancer that cannot be removed by surgery."

Patients receive TheraSphere\u00ae via hepatic arterial infusion on day 1. This artery is\n      accessed through the femoral artery in the groin. This procedure is generally completed on\n      an outpatient basis. Patients may receive a single dose to the whole liver, or sequential\n      treatments to each side of the liver approximately 30 to 90 days apart. Patients may be\n      re-treated at a later time.\n\n      Patients are followed every 2 to 4 months for the rest of their lives to access tumor\n      progression, symptom management and quality of life."
