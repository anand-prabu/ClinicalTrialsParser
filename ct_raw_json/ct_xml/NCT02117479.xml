  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 study, in which
      approximately 310 subjects with advanced or metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas who
      have failed, or were intolerant to first-line chemotherapy, will be randomized (1:1) to one
      of the following treatment groups:

        -  Treatment A (N = 155):  Capecitabine 2000 mg/m^2 daily (1000 mg/m^2 twice daily [BID])
           + ruxolitinib 15 mg BID

        -  Treatment B (N = 155):  Capecitabine 2000 mg/m^2 daily (1000 mg/m^2 BID) + placebo
           (administered BID)

      Treatment will consist of repeating 21-day cycles.  Capecitabine will be self-administered
      for the first 14 days of each cycle, and ruxolitinib/placebo will be self-administered
      during the entire cycle. Treatment for all subjects will continue as long as the regimen is
      tolerated, and the subject does not meet discontinuation criteria.  Subjects who discontinue
      treatment will continue to be followed for subsequent anticancer treatments and survival.
