      This Phase II Small Business Technology Transfer(STTR) project will develop and test the
      effectiveness of an interactive web program optimized for use on a Internet connected
      television(TV), titled Moms Exercising or (MomZing) that is designed specifically for women
      with infants 2-8 months old.  Moms will select from a menu of 98, 10-minute exercise videos
      demonstrating yoga, aerobics, and strengthening exercises. They select and sequence together
      exercise videos personalized to their fitness level, form of exercise, and the choice to
      actively exercise with her baby or alone. The primary health goal of the MomZing Program is
      to increase home-based moderate to vigorous physical activity in new mothers and to maintain
      their exercise increases over time as their baby grows.

      The investigators hypothesize that women that use the MomZing Program will have greater
      increases in physical activity and fewer will return to cigarette smoking or alcohol use,
      compared to women who use a standard &quot;mommy and me&quot; exercise DVD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Becoming a mother is a significant transition in a woman's life, and while this is a
      positive experience for many, there can be significant decreases in healthful behaviors such
      as physical activity and increases in unhealthy behaviors including sleep deprivation,
      stress, and depressive symptoms. Increasing postpartum physical activity can have multiple
      health benefits including risk reduction for chronic diseases like diabetes and
      cardiovascular disease, and improvement in psychological health including decreased stress
      and depressive symptoms. Improvements in mental health outcomes can prevent substance use
      since psychological stress is a risk factor for substance use and abuse. The postpartum
      period also represents a critical period to prevent a return to substance use, including
      tobacco and alcohol.

      This Small Business Technology Transfer(STTR)- Phase II project will develop and test an
      interactive web-enabled television program, titled Mothers Exercising or (&quot;MomZing).
      Features include the ability to select one to five 10-minute videos demonstrating yoga,
      aerobics, and strengthening exercises for mothers with infants 2 to 8 months of age. Women
      will select and sequence together videos personalized to their fitness level, preference for
      exercise type, and the choice to actively exercise with her baby or alone. Exercises with a
      baby will be tailored to the infant's weight and include interactions that promote cognitive
      development and mother-child bonding. MomZing is designed for viewing on a television taking
      advantage of new technologies that allow viewers to watch streaming video (including movies)
      from the internet on a television.  The television can also be connected to the internet via
      a web-enabled console such as an internet-connecting device.

      The primary goal of the MomZing web-enabled Program is to increase home-based moderate to
      vigorous physical activity in new mothers. Phase II activities will include: 1) programming
      the MomZing multimedia web enabled Program, a recruitment website, and online survey; 2)
      producing 98,10-minute video segments showing women exercising with or without an infant; 3)
      conducting iterative usability testing of the features and content of the Program; and, 4)
      conducting a randomized trial of the efficacy of the Program with 572 new mothers recruited
      from across the U.S. New mothers will be randomly assigned to receive either the MomZing
      web-enabled TV Program or a standard exercise DVD designed for new mothers. The primary
      outcome will be minutes per week of leisure-time moderate to vigorous physical activity
      measured at baseline, 4 and 12 weeks. Secondary outcomes include changes in fatigue, sleep,
      depressive symptoms, tobacco and alcohol use at 12 weeks.  Process evaluation will also
      determine extent to which the technology is utilized (frequency of use and time per access)
      over 12 weeks in both conditions. We will investigate whether key demographic (i.e., weight
      of infant, number of children) physiological (i.e., body mass index), and lifestyle factors
      (sleep quality, fatigue) act as mediators or moderators of any change in physical activity.

      The MomZing Program will allow Moms to tailor a range of exercise options to meet their
      needs and those of their infant.  As their infant grows and progresses through different
      cognitive and developmental stages the Program can grow with them, allowing the Mom to
      change her preferences unlike any exercise multimedia(DVD or website) currently available on
      the market.
