The\n      study was developed by a collegium at a nursing bachelor education program in a\n      multidisciplinary collaboration with representatives from the university hospital and other\n      experts. Data on nutritional risk and nutritional care practices of elderly patients were\n      collected by 173 second year nursing students at the university college in question who were\n      undergoing their acute and clinical care practice studies on 20 wards at the university\n      hospital. Nine nutritional screening days were conducted in the academic years 2011/2012 and\n      2012/2013. On the screening days the students filled in the questionnaire for each patient,\n      including questions about age, gender, length of hospital stay, normal weight in recent\n      months, weight, height, BMI, nutritional risk and nutritional care practices. The students\n      measured weight and height whenever possible, and screened the patients for nutritional\n      risk. Data were collected by using a stratified sampling technique along with adequate power\n      calculations to improve the representativeness of the sample. The researchers received\n      anonymously completed questionnaires and screening forms from the students and never met the\n      patients."

All\n        somatic wards having nursing students in acute care clinical studies in autumn 2011 were\n        included in the study. The study sample comprised 14 of 16 medical and surgical somatic\n        wards. Additionally, one rehabilitation ward, one specialized short time unit, one\n        emergency medicine ward, and one cardio-monitoring ward were included.\n\n        Eligible patients were selected by the nursing students in cooperation with the ward\n        nursing staff."
