The drug is\n      currently approved in 26 countries outside the USA for the treatment and prevention of\n      chronic stable angina pectoris and other cardiovascular disease related conditions. This\n      pivotal confirmative Phase III clinical trial is to confirm the efficacy and safety of the\n      drug at 150mg and 225mg doses in the prevention and treatment of angina pectoris in patients\n      with Chronic Stable Angina. The contribution of the main herb Danshen to, and the difference\n      of various production batches in, the overall efficacy and safety profiles will also be\n      explored. Patients will take a morning and an evening dose orally (every 12 hours) for 6\n      weeks while stop taking any long-acting nitroglycerin, ranolazine, and/or multiple\n      beta-blockers or beta blocker(s) with calcium channel blocker during the trial. Single\n      beta-blocker and/or on-demand short acting nitroglycerin to relief angina pectoris is\n      allowed during the trial.  After physical exams and if eligible to participation, patients\n      will stop taking other drugs, and undergo two baseline screen Exercise Treadmill Tests (ETT)\n      on Standard Bruce Protocol in the clinic one week before and right before starting the drug\n      treatment. Patients will perform three more ETTs before the morning dose at the end of week\n      2, 4 and 6 after receiving the drug treatment. The primary efficiency endpoint is the change\n      of symptom-limited Total Exercise Duration of the ETT at the end of the 4th week of\n      treatment from the average of the two screening baselines compared with that of placebo\n      treatment."
