  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to conduct a trial in the spirit of providing as much as
      possible the benefit of PG2 treatment to eligible patients and to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of different doses of PG2 treatment for relieving fatigue among advanced cancer
      patients who are under standard palliative care (SPC) at hospice setting and have no further
      curative options available. Patient's fatigue status, to be measured by the Brief Fatigue
      Inventory-Taiwanese Form (BFI-T), will be the primary endpoint. The fatigue improvement
      response rate among patients between two study arms will then be compared as the basis for
      efficacy evaluation at the end of the first treatment cycle, and will be the primary
      endpoint. Other endpoints, the fatigue improvement response rate and the mean fatigue scores
      change from baseline among patients within and between cycles will be included in the
      secondary efficacy endpoints, and will be compared between two study arms. Patients' quality
      of sleep, appetite, pain, fatigue, nausea, vomiting and global quality of life (QoL) will be
      also measured by 11 questions (SS11) from EORTC(European Organization) for Research and
      Treatment of Cancer QLQ-C30 for secondary endpoint evaluation. The other secondary endpoints
      include Karnofsky performance scores, and weight change and its related c-reactive protein
      level of the patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a trial to evaluate use of different doses of PG2 treatment for fatigue improvement
      in advanced cancer patients who are under standard palliative care at hospice setting and
      have no further curative options available. Only patients who give consent to participate in
      this study and meet all other inclusion and exclusion criteria will be eligible to enroll
      into this study. All patients will continue the standard palliative care (SPC) during this
      study.

      The main aim of this trial is to compare improvement of patient's fatigue status between
      patients with different doses of PG2 treatment. Patient's fatigue status will be assessed by
      the Brief Fatigue Inventory-Taiwanese (BFI-T) Form. Each patient's fatigue improvement
      response will be defined as an improvement in the mean fatigue scores by at least 10% from
      baseline. Other quality of life parameters will be measured by the 11 questions (SS11) of
      the EORTC QLQ-C30 and by Karnofsky performance scale. Patient's weight change and its
      related c-reactive protein will be followed. There are two study arms in this trial: 1) the
      PG2 High Dose arm; and 2) the PG2 Low Dose arm.
