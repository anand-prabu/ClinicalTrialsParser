The mechanism of action of conventional BLT in the treatment of SAD is under\n      debate. Recently, transcranial bright light (TBL) via ear canals has been proved to modulate\n      the neural networks of the human brain and improve cognitive performance in healthy\n      subjects. Moreover, TBL has been found to alleviate symptoms of SAD in open trial. In this\n      case the investigators will study the effect of transcranial bright light treatment via ear\n      canals on depressive and anxiety symptoms in patients suffering from SAD in randomized\n      controlled double-blind study design."
