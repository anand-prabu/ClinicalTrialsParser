The\n      reason for this study is to find out how metreleptin can improve non-alcoholic\n      steatohepatitis or nonalcoholic fatty liver disease associated with lipodystrophy, a rare\n      disorder associated with abnormal loss of the body's fat tissue. In this study, metreleptin\n      is considered to be investigational for the treatment of lipodystrophy. Metreleptin will be\n      given via injections under the skin. We plan to continue therapy for a period of one year\n      and evaluate the change in liver disease by a liver biopsy. We will also follow the\n      metabolic parameters (e.g. blood cholesterol, liver function, insulin resistance) and body\n      composition characteristics (e.g. the pattern of fat distribution in the body)."

            "textblock": "The goal is to test the efficacy of restorative leptin therapy on the degree of hepatic\n      steatosis and on amelioration of pathological features of NASH/NAFLD. In addition, the study\n      will evaluate the impact of leptin therapy on total body insulin sensitivity and lipid\n      levels as well as energy expenditure. In order to accomplish this aim, we now propose an\n      efficacy study with recombinant human leptin therapy in patients with all forms of\n      lipodystrophy who also have NASH/NAFLD.\n\n        1. AIM 1: To determine the efficacy of leptin in promoting amelioration of body\n           composition, hepatic steatosis and histopathological scores in patients with all forms\n           of lipodystrophy and NAFLD/NASH. We will conduct a 1 year, open-label study, to assess\n           the metabolic effects of recombinant human leptin (METRELEPTIN, Amylin Pharmaceuticals,\n           San Diego, CA). The primary outcome measure will be NASH scores. We will also explore\n           body weight, insulin sensitivity, glucose and lipid control, body composition, and free\n           fatty acid levels.\n\n        2. AIM 2: To Investigate molecular effects of leptin therapy. In parallel to our\n           preliminary studies, gene expression will be performed on individuals participating in\n           Aim 1 at baseline and following 1 year of leptin. We will combine this with measures of\n           liver metabolite levels to provide novel insights into alterations in metabolism that\n           occur secondary to leptin therapy. We will also measure plasma metabolites at baseline\n           and after 2 (optional), 24 and 48 weeks of therapy to assess the dynamic changes\n           induced by leptin and correlate these changes with phenotypic measures."
