For inoperable patients or residual tumor after surgery, standard of care would be\n      palliative chemotherapy. For a small subset of patients (good performance status, small\n      radiation fields) re-irradiation can be performed. In this study the established concept of\n      re-irradiation with photons will be transferred to proton radiotherapy. Proton therapy has\n      the advantage of a steeper dose gradient to normal tissues, thus-theoretical advantages for\n      lower toxicity."

In-house standard of care for patients\n      (good performance status and with small tumors) with head and neck squamous cell cancer in a\n      previously (> 50 Gy) irradiated field is to irradiate the tumor with a hyperfractionated\n      schedule and concurrent cisplatin up to a dose of 66 Gy. Dose limiting for this schedule is\n      the incidence of acute and late toxicity induced by radiation. The purpose of the study is\n      the evaluation of the safety of a treatment schedule based on the use of protons.\n\n      Proton beam treatments will be delivered in 2 Gy fractions, 5 days per week, to a total dose\n      of 60 Gray equivalent.\n\n      Study visits are performed:\n\n      During proton therapy once per week. Follow-up visits are scheduled every 3 months for the\n      first 24 months after proton therapy.\n\n      Primary endpoint is late toxicity 24 months after proton treatment."
