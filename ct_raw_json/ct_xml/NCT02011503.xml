      The overall objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of dehydrated human
      amnion/ chorion membrane (dHACM) in reducing time to healing in patients with venous leg
      ulcers (VLUs).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Are at least 18 years old.

          2. Have Ankle Brachial Pressure Index (ABI) &gt; 0.75. (Calculations will be made using
             measurements from both posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis arteries as well as both
             arms).

          3. Have venous leg ulcer extending through the full thickness of the skin but not down
             to muscle, tendon or bone. The largest ulcer will be designated the index ulcer and
             the only one included in the study. If other ulcerations are present on the same
             extremity, these must be more than 2 cm apart from the index ulcer.

          4. Have venous insufficiency confirmed by duplex ultrasound examination for valvular or
             venous incompetence.

          5. Have study ulcer (i.e. current episode of ulceration) that has been present for at
             least one month prior to the initial screening visit. Note: The patient is excluded
             if ulcer has undergone 12 months of continuous high strength compression therapy over
             its duration.

          6. Have study ulcer with a minimum of 2 cm2 and a maximum of 25 cm2 at the randomization
             visit.

          7. The target ulcer has been treated with compression therapy for at least 14 days prior
             to randomization.

          8. Ulcer has a clean, granulating base with minimal adherent slough at the randomization
             visit.

          9. Females of childbearing potential must be willing to use acceptable methods of
             contraception (birth control pills, barriers, or abstinence).

         10. Patient understands and is willing to comply with weekly visits and the follow-up
             regimen.

         11. Patient has read and signed the Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved Informed
             Consent Form before screening procedures are undertaken.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Study ulcer(s) deemed by the investigator to be caused by a medical condition other
             than venous insufficiency.

          2. Study ulcer exhibits clinical signs and symptoms of infection.

          3. Study ulcer, in the opinion of the investigator, is suspicious for cancer should
             undergo an ulcer biopsy to rule out a carcinoma.

          4. Patients with a history of more than two weeks treatment with immunosuppressants
             (including systemic corticosteroids), cytotoxic chemotherapy, or application of
             topical steroids to the ulcer surface within 30 days of initial screening, or who
             receive such medications during the screening period, or who are anticipated to
             require such medications during the course of the study.

          5. Patients on any investigational drug(s) or therapeutic device(s) within 30 days
             preceding screening.

          6. History of radiation at the ulcer site.

          7. Known history of having Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) or HIV.

          8. Study ulcer has been previously treated with tissue engineered materials (e.g.
             Apligraf® or Dermagraft®) or other scaffold materials (e.g. Oasis, Meristem) within
             the last 30 days

          9. Study ulcer requiring negative pressure wound therapy or hyperbaric oxygen during the
             course of the trial.

         10. Patients who are unable to understand the aims and objectives of the trial.

         11. Presence of any condition(s) which seriously compromises the subject's ability to
             complete this study, or has a known history of poor adherence with medical treatment.

         12. New York Heard Association (NYHA) Class III and IV congestive heart failure (CHF), as
             defined by the following criteria: Class III: Symptoms with moderate exertion; Class
             IV: Symptoms at rest.

         13. Ulcers on the dorsum of the foot or with more than 50% of the ulcer below the
             malleolus are excluded.

         14. Pregnant or breast feeding.

         15. Currently taking medications which, in the opinion of the treating physician, could
             affect graft incorporation.

         16. Allergic to gentamicin and/or streptomycin

         17. Known allergy to the components of the multi-layer compression bandaging, or who
             cannot tolerate multi-layer compression therapy.

         18. History of drug or alcohol abuse within 6 months of screening.
