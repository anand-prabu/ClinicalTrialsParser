            "textblock": "A cesarean section or delivery (C-section/CD) is the surgical removal of an infant and\n      placenta through the mother's abdominal and uterine wall. This procedure is performed by an\n      obstetrician and is one of the most common types of surgical methods used today. According\n      to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the rate for this method of delivery has\n      risen over the past decade. However, recent research has shown that patients who receive\n      this surgical procedure become more susceptible to adhesions.\n\n      Adhesions are formations (bands) of scar tissue that occur immediately following most\n      surgical procedures.  Adhesions limit the mobility of tissues and organs near the incision\n      site by causing them to stick together.  This limited mobility can generate an increased\n      rate of morbidity (occurrence of other diseases). Morbidities caused by adhesions include\n      but are not limited to abdominal and/or pelvic pain, bowel obstruction (partial or complete\n      blockage of the bowel), subfertility (difficulty getting pregnant) and infertility\n      (inability to get pregnant).\n\n      A study conducted by Dierdre Lyell, MD reported that the incidence of adhesion formation\n      following a primary CD ranges from 46-65%. Another study (Morales et al) reported that for\n      women who had undergone a CD, the incidence rate of adhesions and severe adhesions was\n      greater in women who had had repeat CDs compared with women who only had a primary CD. In\n      addition, this study also states that the percentage of adhesion occurrence increases in\n      women with each subsequent (following) CD.\n\n      Numerous methods have been implemented toward the preventions of adhesions.  Currently,\n      Seprafilm is an approved adhesion prevention method that is used in most surgical\n      procedures. Seprafilm is a clear film that is composed of chemically modified sugars (some\n      of which occur naturally in the human body). Unlike its counterpart Interceed, Seprafilm is\n      unaffected by the presence of blood. After being placed, Seprafilm becomes a gel within\n      24-48 hours and then is slowly absorbed and excreted by the body over the course of 1-4\n      weeks.\n\n      Seprafilm Adhesion Barrier is FDA approved for use in patients undergoing abdominal or\n      pelvis laparotomy as an adjunct intended to reduce the incidence, extent and severity of\n      post-operative adhesions between the abdominal and between the uterus and surrounding\n      structures."
