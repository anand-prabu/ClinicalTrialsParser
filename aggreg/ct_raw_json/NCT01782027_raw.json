Mutations in some of\n      the genes affecting HDL metabolism, may results in changes in RCT. The validation of a\n      method assessing RCT is important for the development of new drugs which affect RCT and may\n      result in useful treatments for atherosclerosis.\n\n      Subjects carrying mutations in genes known to affect HDL metabolism and healthy controls\n      will be enrolled in the study. Changes in the tracer activity in total plasma, lipoproteins\n      fractions and feces will be analyzed following the intravenous administration of\n      radiolabeled particulate cholesterol."
