In contrast, in HIV-positive\n      patients, a fixed treatment duration of 48 weeks is used.\n\n      The aim of this study is to assess efficacy and safety of response-guided triple-therapy\n      with BOC in combination with PEGIFN and RBV in HIV-positive patients. Thus, treatment\n      duration will be individualized based on HCV-RNA negativity at treatment week 8 (W8). All\n      patients will receive 4 weeks of PEGIFN/RBV lead-in. Patients with undetectable HCV-RNA at\n      W8 will be treated with 24 weeks of BOC/PEGIFN/RBV triple-therapy resulting in a total\n      treatment duration of 28 weeks, while patients with detectable HCV-RNA at W8 will receive 44\n      weeks of BOC/PEGIFN/RBV triple-therapy and a total treatment duration of 48 weeks."
