            "textblock": "Background: Current data from studies and registries involving  pediatric Crohn's disease\n      indicate that 50-80% of children will receive an immunomodulator (IMM) as a maintenance\n      therapy within 12 months of diagnosis, and between 60-80% by 18 months. The common use of\n      IMM early in the disease also leads to a high proportion of patients with active disease\n      despite  IMM (IMMfailure).\n\n      Infliximab has become a standard of care in North America, Europe and Israel, and is\n      recommended at present for steroid dependent or refractory patients, fistulizing disease,\n      active disease despite an immunomodulator.\n\n      Infliximab was originally prescribed as an add on therapy to IMM, because of concerns\n      regarding IFX side effects and loss of response due to development of antibodies to\n      infliximab (ATIs). An early study clearly showed an advantage in long term remission with\n      thiopurine co administration.However, subsequent studies in adults with CD showed that with\n      scheduled IFX treatment, AZA could be safely discontinued after the first 6 months of\n      therapy , lowering the risks associated with dual immuno-suppressive therapies, and the\n      risks of co-therapy. Mono-therapy subsequently became the recommended method of treatment\n      with IFX, despite a decrease in trough levels among those who discontinued IMM.\n\n      IFX mono-therapy became the method of choice for treatment in pediatric CD, though this\n      strategy has been called into question due to frequent loss of response to IFX requiring\n      dose escalation of IFX or decreased intervals of IFX. This loss of response has been\n      attributed to development of ATIs and low trough levels of IFX, which can develop after the\n      first infusions. Low trough levels of infliximab at 14 weeks were predictive of LOR. The\n      second reason for questioning IFX mono-therapy is a trial that compared mono-therapy to\n      combined AZA+IFX therapy in adults with moderate to severe thiopurine na\u00efve disease. This\n      study clearly showed improved long term remission rates and mucosal healing in an unselected\n      cohort of patients with combination therapy. Conversely, mono-therapy was associated with\n      low levels of sustained mucosal healing, which is troublesome. Lastly, some excellent\n      results obtained in a pediatric cohort treated with combined therapy, along with the\n      relatively low risk of HTSCL, has left pediatric gastroenterologists at a loss; Should we\n      recommend primary mono-therapy , or use IMM for a limited  period of time before\n      discontinuing therapy ? When should the IMM be discontinued, after the first infusion or\n      after several months? There are no controlled data in pediatric IBD to answer this pressing\n      question.\n\n      There is also a movement towards increased use of methotrexate instead of thiopurines as\n      immunomodulators because of concerns about neoplasia.\n\n      Recent studies have shown that by adding an immunomodulator to a biologic after LOR, trough\n      levels can be improved and ATIs or ADAs decreased, suggesting that IMM may inhibit antibody\n      formation.\n\n      The investigators hypothesize that by continuing  IMM  with IFX for the first 6 months, the\n      investigators will detect a benefit . The investigators hypothesize that early cessation of\n      an  IMM  will increase the risk of LOR (Loss of response), decrease trough levels at 14\n      weeks, and be associated with lower rates of corticosteroid free sustained remission by one\n      year.\n\n      Methods: It is a prospective open label phase 4 RCT in pediatric patients with active CD,\n      defined by the Porto criteria, despite >10  weeks of  prior treatment with an\n      immunomodulator (thiopurines/Methotrexate) ,requiring infliximab,   involving 2 arms, and\n      intention to treat analysis after the  first infusion."
