A sample from the\n      bone marrow biopsy (a small amount of tissue removed from the body for laboratory testing),\n      biopsy of the tumor  and aspirate (a small amount of fluid is removed from the body for\n      laboratory testing) that had been done before the subject entered this study will be\n      provided for research purposes. Based on preliminary data, it is hypothesized that\n      CD27,CXCR4, CD47, sphingolipids, and Pim kinases could be used as prognostic/predictive\n      markers and that Pim kinase inhibitors provide a new agent for the treatment in patients\n      with selected refractory or relapsed hematologic malignancies or solid tumors"
