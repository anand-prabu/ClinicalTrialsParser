Patients will undergo a 30-min crossover\n      trial of noninvasive PSV and NAVA, 15 minutes each. Diaphragm electrical activity (EAdi)and\n      airway pressure (Paw) are recorded to derive neural and mechanical respiratory rate and\n      timing, inspiratory trigger delays time of synchrony between diaphragm contraction and\n      ventilator assistance, and the asynchrony index (AI)."
