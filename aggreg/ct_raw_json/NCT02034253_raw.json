            "textblock": "The early stages of the schizophrenia illness are associated with significant decreases in\n      social and intellectual abilities, with more modest declines seen with chronic disease.\n      Multiple studies have identified a relationship between the longer duration of untreated\n      psychosis (the duration between the onset of positive symptoms and treatment) and worse long\n      term outcomes. However, the neurobiology of this phenomenon and its implications for\n      response to antipsychotic medications remain poorly understood.\n\n      Glutamatergic excess altering brain connectivity might provide an explanation for why those\n      with longer duration of untreated psychosis have worse clinical outcomes. The investigators\n      propose to use neuroimaging to study 67 first episode psychosis subjects before and after\n      sixteen weeks of treatment with risperidone, a commonly prescribed antipsychotic. We will\n      measure indices of (1) glutamate and (2) structural and functional brain connectivity and\n      test the hypotheses that glutamatergic abnormalities are present in first episode patients\n      and that longer duration of untreated psychosis is associated with greater connectivity\n      abnormalities that set the stage for poor response to treatment. 67 demographic-matched\n      healthy controls will also be recruited as a comparison group - healthy controls will not be\n      administered antipsychotic medication.\n\n      The investigator's previous neuroimaging studies have made progress in the understanding of\n      abnormalities in the glutamate system and brain connectivity in unmedicated patients with\n      schizophrenia and modulation of these by antipsychotic medication. Two indices of\n      glutamatergic dysfunction suggestive of glutamate/ glutamine cycle abnormalities have been\n      identified. While antipsychotic medications appear to modulate glutamate, the disturbance in\n      the correlation between metabolites is not restored with treatment. In addition, the\n      investigators found that both structural and functional connectivity abnormalities in\n      unmedicated patients with schizophrenia predict patients' subsequent response to treatment.\n\n      To the investigator's knowledge, no other group has performed a study that uses a\n      combination of complementary neuroimaging techniques that will allow generating a broad\n      characterization of glutamatergic function and brain connectivity in first episode psychosis\n      and their change with treatment. The results of the proposed studies could suggest a\n      mechanism by which the duration of untreated psychosis is associated with poor treatment\n      response which might lead to new interventions to target the illness."
