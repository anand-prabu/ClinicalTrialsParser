  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of the study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile (rate and the
      amount of nicotine absorbed) following a single use of the THS 2.2 Menthol compared to the
      PK profiles from a single use of a menthol conventional cigarette (mCC) and from a single
      use of nicotine nasal spray (NNS).

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Smoking, healthy subject as judged by the Investigator.

          -  Subject smokes at least 10 commercially available menthol CCs per day (with brand
             restrictions) for the last 4 weeks, based on self reporting.

          -  Subject has smoked for at least the last 3 consecutive years.

          -  Subject does not plan to quit smoking in the next 3 months.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  As per Investigator judgment, the subject cannot participate in the study for any
             reason (e.g., medical, psychiatric, and/or social reason).

          -  The subject has received medication within 14 days or within 5 half-lives of a drug
             (whichever is longer) which has an impact on CYP2A6 activity.

          -  For women: subject is pregnant or is breast feeding.

          -  For women: subject does not agree to use an acceptable method of effective
             contraception.
