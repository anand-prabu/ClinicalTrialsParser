The sequence used to perform the ultrafast MRI was a fast gradient- echo plus sequence. Technical parameters included: echo time, 12 msec; repetition time, 2.3 msec; flap angle, 250; matrix, 192 \u00d7 512; section thickness, 7 mm. The imaging time per slice for this sequence was 0.92 sec. A total of 120 consecutive images were obtained as a single section, with a total imaging time of 110.4 seconds. MRI scanning was carried out with the subject first asleep, then whilst awake after 20 minutes in quiet respiration. All images were inputted to the PACS workstation.",
