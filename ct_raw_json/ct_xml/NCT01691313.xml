    <textblock>
      Evaluate the safety and efficacy of a single oral dose of vanoxerine compared to placebo, in
      a dose modification manner, on the conversion of symptomatic atrial fibrillation (a-fib) or
      flutter of recent onset to normal sinus rhythm.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vanoxerine has important antiarrhythmic properties and may prove effective in converting
      AF/AFL to sinus rhythm in subjects with a history of AF.  This is a prospective, randomized,
      double-blinded, placebo-controlled, dose-modifying study in subjects who have been in
      symptomatic AF or AFL for more than 3 hours and less than 7 days as dated by symptoms, who
      have AF/AFL documented on ECG at the time of study drug administration, and who satisfy the
      inclusion and exclusion criteria.  The primary objectives of the trial are to evaluate the
      safety and efficacy of a single oral dose of vanoxerine compared to placebo and to obtain
      pharmacokinetic data for vanoxerine and its metabolite following oral administration.
