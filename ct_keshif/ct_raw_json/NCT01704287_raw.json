Participants will be randomized to receive either low dose pembrolizumab, higher\n      dose pembrolizumab or Investigator-choice chemotherapy. The pembrolizumab dose will be\n      blinded to Investigators and participants. The randomization to either pembrolizumab or\n      Investigator choice chemotherapy will be conducted in open-label fashion. The four standard\n      chemotherapy choices are carboplatin + paclitaxel, paclitaxel alone, dacarbazine, or\n      temozolomide. Participants on standard chemotherapy who experience disease progression may\n      be eligible to cross-over to treatment with pembrolizumab provided they meet\n      protocol-specified requirements for cross-over."
