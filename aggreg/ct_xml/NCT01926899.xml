      The objective of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of bortezomib
      in combination with cyclosporine and methotrexate as acuite graft versus host disease
      (aGVHD) prophylaxis in pediatric patients undergoing allogeniec hematopoietic stem cell
      transplant (alloHSCT)

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Voluntary written informed consent before performance of any study-related procedure
             not part of normal medical care, with the understanding that consent may be withdrawn
             by the subject at any time without prejudice to future medical care.

               -  Female subject of childbearing potential agree to practice 2 effective methods
                  of contraception from the time of signing the informed consent form through 30
                  days after the last dose of bortezomib, or agree to completely abstain from
                  heterosexual intercourse.

               -  Male subjects, even if surgically sterilized (i.e., status postvasectomy) must
                  agree to 1 of the following:  practice effective barrier contraception during
                  the entire study treatment period and through a minimum of 30 days after the
                  last dose of study drug, or completely abstain from heterosexual intercourse.

               -  Subjects must be greater than or equal to 1 years old and less 22 years old.

               -  Subjects must have any malignant or non-malignant condition that requires
                  treatment with alloHSCT

               -  Karnofsky or Lansky performance score greater than 60%

               -  Subjects must have a 9 of 10 (HLA A, B, C, DR, and DQ) or 10 of 10 HLA
                  matched-related or MUD for bone marrow or peripheral blood alloHSCT

               -  Subjects must meet other institutional criteria for alloHSCT

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  â€¢ Patient has greater than 1.5 times upper limit normal (ULN) Total Bilirubin

               -  Patient has greater than or equal to Grade 2 peripheral neuropathy

               -  Patient had myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to enrollment or has New
                  York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III or IV heart failure, uncontrolled
                  angina, severe uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmias, or electrocardiographic
                  evidence of acute ischemia or active conduction system abnormalities.  Prior to
                  study entry, any ECG abnormality at screening must be documented by the
                  investigator as not medically relevant.

               -  Patient has hypersensitivity to bortezomib, boron, or mannitol.

               -  Female subject is pregnant or lactating.  Confirmation that the subject is not
                  pregnant must be established by a negative serum beta-human chorionic
                  gonadotropin (beta hCG) pregnancy test result obtained during screening.
                  Pregnancy testing is not required for postmenopausal or surgically sterilized
                  women.

               -  Female patients who are lactating or have a positive serum pregnancy test during
                  the screening period, or a positive urine pregnancy test on Day 1 before first
                  dose of study drug, if applicable.

               -  Serious medical or psychiatric illness likely to interfere with participation in
                  this clinical study.

               -  Diagnosed or treated for another malignancy within 2 years of enrollment, with
                  the exception of complete resection of basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell
                  carcinoma of the skin, an in situ malignancy, or low-risk prostate cancer after
                  curative therapy.

               -  Participation in clinical trials with other investigational agents not included
                  in this trial, within 14 days of the start of this trial and throughout the
                  duration of this trial.

               -  Radiation therapy within 3 weeks before randomization. Enrollment of subjects
                  who require concurrent radiotherapy (which must be localized in its field size)
                  should be deferred until the radiotherapy is completed and 3 weeks have elapsed
                  since the last date of therapy.

               -  Current active infection per physician determination

               -  HIV positive

               -  Previous myeloablative autoHSCT or alloHSCT in previous 12 months

               -  ALT and AST greater than 5 times ULN for age

               -  Creatinine clearance or glomerular filtration rate (GFR)  less than 60
                  ml/min/1.73

               -  Shortening fraction less than 26% or ejection fraction less than 45%

               -  Diffusing capacity of carbon monoxide (DLCO), volume exhaled at end of first
                  second of forced expiration (FEV1), diffusion capacity less than 50% of
                  predicted (corrected for hemoglobin); if unable to perform lung function tests,
                  oxygen saturation less than 94% on room air
