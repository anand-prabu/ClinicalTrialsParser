  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 3-part dose-finding and preliminary efficacy study of MK-3475 (MK) + dabrafenib
      (D) + trametinib (T) for participants with advanced melanoma. Parts 1 and 2 are open-label
      to find and confirm the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/maximum administered dose (MAD) for
      MK+D+T. The primary hypothesis (Parts 1 and 2) is that MK-3475+D+T is sufficiently
      well-tolerated to permit clinical investigation. Part 3 is a double-blind study of MK+D+T
      versus placebo+D+T. The primary study hypothesis (Part 3 only) is that the MK+D+T improves
      progression-free survival (PFS) compared with placebo+D+T. Parts 1 and 2 of the study will
      also explore the MTD/MAD for open-label MK+T (for  v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene
      homolog B1 [BRAF] mutation-negative participants) concurrently with the MK+D+T arm; MK+D
      (for BRAF mutation-positive participants) may be initiated in Parts 1 and 2.
