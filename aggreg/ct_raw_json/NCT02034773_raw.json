During the course of Part 1, each\n      subject will participate in a screening phase, a baseline phase, a treatment phase and a\n      follow up visit. There will be a total of 4 cohorts, each of which consists of a different\n      dose level and/or dosing duration, with 8 or 9 subjects per cohort. In each cohort, 6\n      subjects will receive a dose of CC-220 and the remaining subjects will receive placebo\n      depending on the randomization schedule. In 2 of the cohorts, study drug will be\n      administered once daily for a total of 14 days. In the other 2 cohorts, study drug will be\n      administered once daily for 28 days. In one of the 28-day dosing cohorts, 2 vaccinations\n      (tetanus toxoid adsorbed and pneumococcal vaccinations) will also be administered on Day 14\n      of the 28-day dosing period to help characterize the effect of CC-220 on antibody responses.\n      Part 2 is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study to explore\n      the effects of an alternative dosing schedule on the pharmacodynamics of CC-220. During the\n      course of Part 2, each subject will participate in a screening phase, a baseline phase, a\n      treatment phase and a follow up visit. There will be a total of 2 cohorts, each of which\n      consists of a different dose level, with 9 subjects per cohort. In each cohort, 6 subjects\n      will receive a dose of CC-220 and 3 subjects will receive placebo depending on the\n      randomization schedule. The dosing frequency will be either once every 3 days for 14 days or\n      once every 7 days for 28 days. Part 3 is a randomized, open-label, two-period, two-way\n      crossover study to evaluate the relative bioavailability of one CC-220 formulated capsule,\n      relative to two reference capsules, following a single oral dose of CC-220. During the\n      course of Part 3, each subject will participate in a screening phase, a baseline phase, a\n      treatment phase consisting of 2 periods, and a follow up visit. There will be one cohort\n      consisting of a total of 12 subjects. In each study period, approximately 6 subjects will\n      receive a single dose of CC-220 as one formulated capsule (test product) and approximately 6\n      subjects will receive a single dose of CC-220 as two reference capsules (reference product)."
