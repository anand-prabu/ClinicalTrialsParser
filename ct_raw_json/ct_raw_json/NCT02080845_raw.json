The main substances in the drinks that\n      are known to influence the brain are caffeine and related chemicals such as theobromine.\n      Caffeine and chemicals related to caffeine are all naturally occurring and all potentially\n      alter brain physiology. This study will evaluate changes in brain blood flow and cognition\n      following the consumption of drinks with various combinations of the Primary Ingredients.\n      The study proposed here will evaluate ingredients in a 4-arm cross-over double-blind design\n      in an attempt to understand the differential effects of these compounds in chocolate drinks."
