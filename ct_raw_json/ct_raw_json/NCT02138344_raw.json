The functionality of the pain pathway in humans as well as its plastic changes\n      following SCI can be assessed in vivo by surface electrophysiological recordings and\n      functional magnetic resonance imaging after noxious heat stimulation of the skin. Aims: a)\n      establishing a clinically applicable assessment of the pain pathway and characterizing its\n      changes as a consequence of SCI in an objective manner, b) characterizing plastic changes in\n      the pain pathway in SCI patients with neuropathic pain and relating them to the development\n      of neuropathic pain syndromes."
