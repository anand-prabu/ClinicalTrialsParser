In\n      the emergency department, physicians frequently misdiagnose adverse drug events leading to\n      treatment delays. Our objective is to evaluate the effect of pharmacist-led medication\n      review in high-risk emergency department patients on prolonged hospital stay.\n\n      This prospective multi-centre, quasi-randomized study is nested within an existing quality\n      improvement program. Triage nurses flag incoming emergency department patients at high-risk\n      for adverse drug events by applying a clinical decision rule consisting of four variables\n      (co-morbid conditions, antibiotic use within 7 days, medication changes within 28 days, and\n      age). Consecutive eligible high-risk patients are enrolled into the medication review study,\n      and systematically allocated to pharmacist-led medication review or usual care. In the\n      intervention group, medication review pharmacists collect best-possible medication\n      histories, review the patient's medications for appropriateness and adverse drug events, and\n      communicate the results of medication review to patients, caregivers and physicians. In the\n      usual care group, physicians refer patients to onsite pharmacists for medication management\n      questions on an as needed basis. Health outcomes are assessed using anonymized data linkage\n      to administrative health databases. The primary outcome is the percent of days spent in\n      hospital during the first 30 days after the index emergency department visit"
