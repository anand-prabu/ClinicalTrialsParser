The current study will help clarify present uncertainty\n      on the effect of ginseng on blood pressure control.\n\n      This systematic review and meta-analysis will follow The Cochrane Handbook for Systematic\n      Reviews of Interventions. MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and The Cochrane Central Register of\n      Controlled Trials will be searched using appropriate search terms. Intervention trials that\n      investigate the effect of ginseng on blood pressure in humans will be included."
