The research\n      method employs a double blind, placebo controlled, and time-series (repeat measures) design\n      with high-sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (HS-CRP) serving as a marker for inflammation -\n      testing for levels of CRP at time points: baseline (pre-test), 8 weeks (60 days) and 12\n      weeks (90 days). The final time point (i.e., 12 weeks) will serve as the post-test. It is\n      expected that baseline CRP levels in healthy participants will decline."
