Obese women have lower pregnancy rate after infertility\n      treatments.They need more doses of hormone during ovarian stimulation, more days for\n      stimulation. During IVF treatment less oocytes are collected and the quality of embryo also\n      harmed.\n\n      The first line treatment for those women with obesity and infertility is weight loss.\n\n      The investigators' hypothesis is that weight reduction improves ovarian reserve and\n      fertility treatment outcome."
