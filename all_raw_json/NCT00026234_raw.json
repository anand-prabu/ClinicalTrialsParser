Determine the 2-year survival rate of patients treated with this regimen. III. Determine\n      the 2-year recurrence rate and time to recurrence in patients treated with this regimen.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.\n\n      Patients receive floxuridine and dexamethasone intra-arterially continuously on days 1-14,\n      oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on day 22, and oral capecitabine twice daily on days 22-35.\n      Treatment repeats every 6 weeks for 4 courses in the absence of disease recurrence or\n      unacceptable toxicity.
