To determine if hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) patients treated with a\n      probiotic (Lactobacillus GG [Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG])-containing diet compared to those\n      not assigned to receive probiotic have a lower incidence of grade 1 upper gastrointestinal\n      (GI) or grade 2-4 lower GI acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (aGVHD) using Center for\n      International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) scoring than those not\n      prescribed a probiotic.\n\n      II. To determine if HSCT patients treated with a probiotic-containing diet compared to those\n      not assigned to receive a probiotic have a: a) lower rate of organ-specific acute aGVHD\n      (intestinal tract, skin, liver); b) lower rate of moderate or severe chronic GVHD (National\n      Institutes of Health [NIH] consensus scoring) at 6 months and 1 year post transplant; c)\n      shorter duration of immunosuppressive therapy (normalized for age and degree of human\n      leukocyte antigen [HLA] match); d) lower rate of bacterial and/or opportunistic infection.\n\n      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. To determine if allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell patients treated with a probiotic\n      compared to those not assigned to receive a probiotic have differences in: a) composition\n      and proportion of the major gut bacterial phylotypes in stool (to be analyzed for changes\n      pre- and post-initiation of probiotics and for association with development of aGVHD); b)\n      measures of inflammation as assessed by cytokine or receptor production (interleukin [IL]-6,\n      IL-8, tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-alpha, TNF-receptor 1, interferon-gamma, IL-2R, IL-10); c)\n      qualitative measures of immune reconstitution as determined by sequential measurements of\n      conventional T cells, regulatory T regulatory, B cells and natural killer (NK) cells; d)\n      antibody class/subclass production; e) biomarkers associated with GVHD-elafin, regenerating\n      islet-derived 3 alpha (Reg3a), suppressor of tumorigenicity-2 (ST2), hepatocyte growth\n      factor (HGF); and/or urinary tryptophan metabolites; f) markers of gut barrier function\n      including blood levels of endotoxin and microbial deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA).\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\n      ARM I: Patients receive Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 1 year.\n\n      ARM II: Patients receive no intervention."
