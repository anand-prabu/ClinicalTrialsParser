  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Men who have sex with men (MSM) bear a disproportionate burden of the Human Immunodeficiency
      Virus (HIV) epidemic in Canada, and HIV incidence appears to be rising among Canadian MSM
      (1). MSM comprised nearly half (44.1%) of new positive HIV tests in 2009 (2). Among MSM in
      Ontario, from 2001 to 2006, HIV diagnoses increased 26% (3). Given the alarmingly high HIV
      prevalence rates among MSM in North American cities, there is a critical need for HIV
      prevention interventions for MSM in Canada. Social anxiety, or anxiety about being evaluated
      in interpersonal situations, is a reliable risk factor for unprotected anal intercourse
      (UAI) among MSM (4 and 5). Social anxiety is highly modifiable via cognitive-behavioural
      therapy, a form of psychotherapy (6). Social anxiety may also increase substance use in
      sexual situations, which is another risk factor for HIV among MSM (7 and 8). As such, an
      empirically-based social anxiety treatment may also reduce HIV risk behaviours among MSM.
      The present study will provide Phase I trial data for a novel and innovative HIV prevention
      intervention for MSM. This is a proposal to test a novel integrated HIV prevention
      intervention that combines empirically supported treatments for social anxiety with HIV risk
      reduction counseling to reduce HIV sexual risk behaviour.

    <description>The study will provide Phase I trial data for a novel and innovative HIV prevention intervention for MSM built upon empirically supported interventions to reduce HIV risk among MSM and cognitive-behavioural therapy to reduce social anxiety. This study will test a novel integrated HIV prevention intervention that combines empirically supported treatments for social anxiety with HIV risk reduction counseling to reduce HIV sexual risk behaviour. Study objectives: 1) to provide data on the acceptability/feasibility of the intervention, 2) to provide data to test the intervention, and 3) to provide data that will allow for a RCT that will test intervention efficacy relative to HIV prevention interventions that do not reduce social anxiety or substance use in sexual situations.</description>
