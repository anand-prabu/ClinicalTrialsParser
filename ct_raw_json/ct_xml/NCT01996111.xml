    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, controlled, randomized, blinded and comparative, single-center
      clinical trial comparing the improvement of patients with recalcitrant plantar fasciitis
      symptoms that have received standard of care versus treatment with differing amounts of
      injectable dehydrated human amnion/chorion membrane micrografts(dHACM).
