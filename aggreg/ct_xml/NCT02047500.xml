      This is a multicenter, open-label, Phase 1, dose escalation trial to evaluate the safety,
      tolerability, and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of TH-302 in combination with gemcitabine
      and nab-paclitaxel in previously untreated subjects with locally advanced unresectable or
      metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
