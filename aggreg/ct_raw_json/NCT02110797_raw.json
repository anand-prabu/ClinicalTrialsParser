Few\n      epidemiological studies have estimated the frequency of osteoporosis in girls with RETT\n      syndrome and showed that they are more exposed then children with other neuro-developmental\n      diseases with a same degree of  neurological handicap. However, the mechanisms that lead to\n      early osteoporosis in RETT syndrome remain unknown. Mutations in the MECP2 gene are found in\n      95% of RETT patients and preliminary experimental studies have shown that this can lead to\n      abnormal expression of the gene that codes for osteoprotegerin, a protein implicated in bone\n      remodelling by interacting with RANK-ligand.\n\n      In order to identify risk factors of osteoporosis in RETT syndrome and to understand  the\n      pathophysiological mechanisms the study protocol includes:\n\n        1. Clinical evaluation of bone health (history of bone fractures, pain, nutritional\n           status, pubertal stage, daily caloric/calcium intake, anti-epileptic drugs, walking\n           ability, vitamin D satus)\n\n        2. evaluation of the mineral density at the lumber spine using DEXA\n\n        3. measuring concentrations of osteoprotegerin and RANK-ligand"
