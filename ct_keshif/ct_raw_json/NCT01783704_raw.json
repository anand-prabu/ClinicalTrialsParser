Over a 16-week period, participants receive 40 visits (on non-consecutive days) from a study PT (3 visits per week for the first eight weeks and2 visits a week during the second eight weeks).

Despite improvements in\n      therapy, hip fracture can still result in decreases in the strength of bone and muscle,\n      making it difficult to walk and perform daily activities.\n\n      Activity and exercise are believed to be of benefit for reducing disability in older adults,\n      yet the majority of older adults do not participate in regular exercise and is not active.\n      This is especially true for older adults following hip fracture after they complete the\n      usual rehabilitation program.\n\n      This study is being done to compare two 16-week supervised multi-part physical therapy\n      programs (interventions) initiated up to 5 months after hip fracture. The investigators want\n      to test whether the interventions lead to improvements in a person's ability to walk on\n      their own in the home and in the local community. With this knowledge the investigators hope\n      to help a greater number of hip fracture patients enjoy a more complete recovery and\n      improved overall health."

            "textblock": "Despite improvements in medical management, significant residual disability remains in older\n      persons after a hip fracture.1-3 The goal of current clinical practice is independent, safe\n      household ambulation two to three months after surgery.4  Hip fracture-acquired dependency\n      in functional activities of daily living persists well beyond three months post-surgery. One\n      year after hip fracture, 20% of patients need help putting on pants, 50% need assistance to\n      walk, and 90% need assistance to climb stairs.2  This residual disability indicates that\n      current standard Medicare-reimbursed post-hip fracture rehabilitation (i.e., usual care)\n      fails to return many patients to pre-fracture levels of function. In contrast to stroke and\n      heart disease, other commonly occurring acute conditions in the older population, there are\n      few intervention trials focused on decreasing disability following hip fracture. None of the\n      trials for hip fracture has examined the effect of early post-fracture intervention on the\n      ability to ambulate at a level required for independent function in the community (i.e.,\n      community ambulation). Thus, there is a paucity of evidence to justify extending medical\n      management beyond usual care in persons following hip fracture to achieve community, rather\n      than merely household, ambulation.\n\n      A randomized controlled trial (RCT) including 300 older adults who have experienced a hip\n      fracture will be carried out at three clinical sites with half of the subjects receiving a\n      specific multi-component intervention (PUSH) and the other half receiving a non-specific\n      multi-component intervention (PULSE).  Randomization of 300 participants meeting eligibility\n      criteria will take place after post-acute rehabilitation ends, approximately 5 months (20\n      weeks) after admission to the hospital for hip fracture. The primary endpoint will be\n      measured using the Six-Minute Walk Test (SMWT) at the end of the 16-week intervention\n      period. The goal is to enable older adults who have experienced a hip fracture to recover\n      sufficiently to become community ambulators."
