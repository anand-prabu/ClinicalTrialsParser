    <textblock>
      This randomized phase 2 trial is studying the effect of adding denosumab to standard
      chemotherapy in the treatment of advanced lung cancer.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an international, phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in
      subjects with Stage IV untreated NSCLC with or without bone metastasis. Subjects eligible
      for this study are to receive 4 to 6 cycles of a standard of care (SOC) platinum-doublet
      chemotherapy regimen. Approximately 216 subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to
      receive denosumab 120 mg or matching placebo subcutaneously (SC) every 3 or 4 weeks plus a
      loading dose on study day 8, with the first investigational product dose coinciding with the
      subject's first cycle of chemotherapy and continuing until the time of the primary analysis,
      death, or until the subject is lost to follow-up.  All subjects are to receive daily dietary
      supplements of at least 500 mg of calcium and at least 400 IU of vitamin D.
