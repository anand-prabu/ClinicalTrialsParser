Patients are stratified according to histological\n      diagnosis (leiomyosarcoma vs other histologies).\n\n      Patients receive exatecan mesylate IV over 30 minutes daily on days 1-5. Courses repeat\n      every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed every 6 weeks until disease progression. After disease progression,\n      patients are followed every 12 weeks for survival.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 32-50 patients (16-25 per stratum) will be accrued for this\n      study."
