Specialized radiation therapy delivers a high dose of radiation\n      directly to the tumor which may kill more tumor cells and cause less damage to normal\n      tissue.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy and\n      specialized high-dose radiation therapy in treating patients who have stage II or stage III\n      non-small cell lung cancer that cannot be removed by surgery."

Patients undergo 3D-CHRT twice daily five days a week for 6-8\n      weeks.\n\n      Cohorts of patients receive escalating doses of 3D-CHRT in 4 dose levels.\n\n      Quality of life is assessed prior to study, weekly during chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and\n      at 3 and 6 months.\n\n      Patients are followed at 6 weeks, every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 2 years and\n      then annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 26-72 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years."
