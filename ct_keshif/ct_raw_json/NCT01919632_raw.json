The primary goal of these programs is the\n      improvement of overall health status (and therefore increase productivity and decrease\n      healthcare costs) of the increasingly older workforce through positive lifestyle behavior\n      change.\n\n      A one- year preventive health behavior-change program for the employees of the company\n      British Petrol (BP) shall be scientifically evaluated. The initial stage of the program\n      consists of a health-behavior seminar and six weeks (twice a week for 90 minutes) of\n      supervised endurance exercise (i.e. jogging, nordic walking, cycling or swimming) in groups.\n      In the second phase of the program, the participants receive a recommendation to continue\n      exercise regularly unsupervised for one year, and receive monthly supervised exercise\n      training sessions. Clinical check-ups are performed at baseline (V1) at three months (V2)\n      and at 12 months (V3)."
