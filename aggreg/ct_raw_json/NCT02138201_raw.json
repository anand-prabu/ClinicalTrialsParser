There are studies in which both the sacral plexus and the lumbar nerve roots have been\n      represented using diffusion tensor imaging. However, there is no study concerning the\n      innervation of the bladder.\n\n      The investigators are therefore using diffusion tensor imaging with magnetic resonance\n      imaging to represent the bladder innervation of individuals with neurogenic lower urinary\n      tract dysfunction and individuals with normal bladder function."
