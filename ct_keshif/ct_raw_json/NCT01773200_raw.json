            "textblock": "Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage is a common and serious disease associated to a high rate\n      of mortality and morbidity. Severe definitive neurological impairment can concern up to 30%\n      of patients in relation with elevated intracranial pressure, hemorrhage recurrence and\n      symptomatic cerebral arterial vasospasm. This latter complication is defined as a reversible\n      reduction of cerebral artery's diameter occurring between the 4th and the 14th day after\n      bleeding. Physiopathology is not well understood, but could involve endothelium, trough\n      endothelial progenitor cells (EPC). Circulating EPC are bone marrow-derived cells with\n      capacity of vasculogenesis and angiogenesis. EPC have been recognized playing a beneficial\n      role in cardiovascular disease and ischemic stroke. EPC have never been studied in\n      aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.\n\n      The primary objective of this study is to compare the number of circulating endothelial\n      progenitor cells between patients with a good neurological outcome (defined as a glasgow\n      outcome scale = 1 or 2) and patients with a poor neurological outcome (glasgow outcome scale\n      = 3, 4 or 5).\n\n      Briefly, the number of circulating EPC will be measured at admission, and at day 3, 6, 10,\n      14, 21 in each consecutive patient suffering aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage and\n      hospitalized in Teaching Hospital of Besan\u00e7on (France). The neurological outcome will be\n      measured one year after subarachnoid hemorrhage."
