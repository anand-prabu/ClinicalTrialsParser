  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To explore whether Free androgen index（FAI）can be regarded as biochemically diagnostic
      indexes of high androgen hormone in blood of patients with Polycentric ovary syndrome（PCOS）.
      Also to explore whether Sex hormone-binding globulin（SHBG） and FAI can be seen as
      therapeutic effect indicatrixes of women with PCOS.

        The investigators collected 534 PCOS patients as the case group, 580 infertile women with
        normally ovulatory cycle as the control groupand.The patients of the case group aged from
        20 to 42 years old, the average age was 27.87 years old, and the standard deviation of
        ages was 3.75 years old. And patients' ovulation in the case group  was normal, as control
        group, aged from 20 to 43 years old, the average age was 28.18 years old; the standard
        deviation of ages was 3.99 years old.Also the investigators also collected 579 patients as
        the treatment group,who aged from 20 to 39 years, the average age was 27.93 years old, the
        standard deviation of ages was 3.70 years old.
