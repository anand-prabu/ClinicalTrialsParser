We will utilize a 3-group randomized design to test study\n      hypotheses. The three study conditions are 1) Integrated Intensive Smoking plus Alcohol\n      intervention using cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), CBT\u2014(IS+A); 2) Intensive Smoking\n      Intervention using CBT\u2014(IS); or 3) Usual Care (brief smoking cessation and brief alcohol\n      counseling both based on the United States Public Health Service's Guidelines)\u2014(UC). All\n      participants will receive 12-week treatment with nicotine patch plus nicotine gum/lozenge.\n      Counseling will follow the protocol used in a recent study of alcohol dependent smokers and\n      will include weekly individual sessions for 3 months followed by monthly booster group\n      sessions for 3 months. As a strategy to integrate proposed project with existing programs at\n      the shelters, all group counseling sessions will be co-facilitated by trained study staff\n      and trained homeless shelter staff.  All 3 study conditions will have equal number of study\n      contacts. Study staff will make retention contacts with participants in the community during\n      weeks that do not have study visits scheduled. Primary smoking outcome is cotinine-verified\n      7-day smoking abstinence at week 52 follow-up while secondary outcome is prolonged smoking\n      abstinence at weeks 12, 24, and 52. Secondary alcohol outcome will be self-reported\n      continuous alcohol abstinence for 90 days at week 52. Recruitment and retention will be\n      enhanced by use of debit cards, bus passes, other non-monetary incentives, attractive\n      intervention materials, collaboration with homeless shelters, and advice from a Community\n      Advisory Board. Participants will be enrolled from homeless shelters and facilities in the\n      7-county greater Minneapolis/St. Paul metro area. Our power calculation indicates that a\n      sample size of 215 per study condition is needed to detect proposed treatment effects."

Having both a usual care and intensive smoking cessation\n      conditions will enable us assess the added benefits of intensive smoking intervention which\n      has been shown in the general population but has never been studied in homeless populations.\n      Adding alcohol treatment to smoking intervention will enable us assess whether addressing\n      alcohol abuse will result in improved smoking abstinence, an important scientific question\n      that has never been studied in homeless populations.\n\n      Study conditions: All three study conditions have identical number of contacts; the duration\n      of counseling time is also identical in IS and IS+A conditions. We considered a design in\n      which the duration of counseling in the UC will be identical to those in IS and IS+A\n      conditions but decided against this because it will create a usual care condition that\n      exceeds standard practice for brief interventions. We understand that testing hypothesis 3\n      confounds contact time with treatment content, and hence we will not be able to determine\n      that observed differences in outcome are due to specific treatment components. However,\n      given the current state of knowledge about treating homeless alcohol abusing smokers, we\n      believe it is sufficient to show that our intervention led to improved outcome in this group\n      without knowing if the finding is due to specific intervention content. Subsequent research\n      will be needed to disentangle various intervention components.\n\n      All participants will receive 12-week treatment with nicotine patch plus nicotine\n      gum/lozenge. Counseling will include weekly individual sessions for 3 months followed by\n      monthly booster group sessions for 3 months. Each participant will be randomly assigned to a\n      condition, which will dictate their treatment. Each participant will be asked to engage in\n      the therapy assigned to their condition, and work to quit smoking and consuming alcohol over\n      a period of one year."
