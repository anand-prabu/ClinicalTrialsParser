Further, all adults will find that exercising becomes much more\n      difficult when compared with exercise at lower altitudes (e.g. sea-level).  The purpose of\n      this investigation is to study the effects of two drugs that may help people adjust to\n      high-altitude quickly, prevent them from becoming ill and improve their exercise\n      performance.  The drugs are Methazolamide and Aminophylline."
