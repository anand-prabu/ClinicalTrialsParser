The purpose of this study was to obtain a predictive\n      model to asses the Risk of Endometrial Malignancy (REM) in women with ultrasound endometrial\n      abnormalities.Women, between 45 and 80 years, diagnosed with ultrasound endometrial\n      abnormalities and scheduled to have surgery were enrolled on a prospective study at\n      Department of Gynaecologic Oncology of Campus Bio-Medico of Rome. Preoperative clinical,\n      ultrasound and laboratory features were taken into account. Logistic regression algorithm\n      was utilized to categorize patients into low and high risk groups for EC."
