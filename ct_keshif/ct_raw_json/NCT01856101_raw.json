The mTOR protein is\n      composed of two complex, mTOR complex 1 (mTOR C1) and mTOR complex 2 (mTOR C2).\n\n      In regards of mTOR pathway dysregulations observed in TCC development, there is a rational\n      to test BEZ23 in advanced TCC. BEZ235 is a pan-class I PI3K inhibitor that, in addition,\n      binds to the catalytic site of mTOR, inhibiting mTOR C1 and mTOR C2."

Archival paraffin-embedded tumor tissue (block or at least 20 unstained slides) of\n             the primary tumor and/or metastases. The most recent archival tissue is mandatory.\n             Recidive of the disease should lead to perform if possible novel biopsies, as major\n             oncogenic differences are found between primary tumor and secondary lesions.\n\n          5. At least one measurable lesion by MRI or CT-scan\n\n          6. ECOG performance status 0-1, in stable medical condition\n\n          7.

Patients must be over 18 years old and able to give written informed consent.\n\n          9. Signed informed consent prior to beginning protocol specific procedure\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          1. Non- TCC bladder cancer\n\n          2. More than 2 prior chemotherapy regimens given for palliation.\n\n          3. Concurrent malignancy or previous malignancy in the last 3 years prior to start the\n             study treatment (with the exception of a history of adequately treated cervical\n             carcinoma in situ or non-melanoma skin cancer)\n\n          4. Patient with active uncontrolled or symptomatic central nervous system (CNS\n             metastases).\n\n          5. Significant active cardiac disease including uncontrolled high blood pressure,\n             unstable angina, congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction within the previous\n             6 months, or serious cardiac arrhythmias.\n\n          6. Other uncontrolled medical condition (active infections requiring antibiotics,\n             bleeding disorders, uncontrolled diabetes \u2026)\n\n          7.
