Autologous\n                peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) are harvested and selected for CD34+ cells on\n                days 5 and 6 (and day 7 if needed).\n\n             -  Regimen B: Patients who are currently on the MSKCC standard dose salvage therapy\n                protocol with ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide (ICE) for recurrent or\n                refractory IGL receive additional mobilization with G-CSF after completion of the\n                last course of ICE. Patients with recurrent or refractory IGL, immunoblastic\n                lymphoma, or LGL who have not previously received ifosfamide and are not currently\n                on the MSKCC standard dose salvage protocol with ICE receive ifosfamide IV and\n                carboplatin on day 2 and etoposide IV on days 1-3 (standard-dose ICE) followed by\n                G-CSF SC. When blood counts recover, autologous PBSC are harvested and selected\n                for CD34+ cells.\n\n             -  Regimens A and B: If additional hematopoietic growth factors (HGFs) become\n                available, they may be administered concurrently with G-CSF. If inadequate CD34+\n                cells are collected, then autologous bone marrow is harvested.\n\n        -  Conditioning: Patients who are under age 60 and have not received dose-limiting\n           radiotherapy are treated on regimen C. Patients who are age 60 and over and patients\n           who are under age 60 and have received dose-limiting radiotherapy are treated on\n           regimen D.\n\n             -  Regimen C: Patients undergo hyperfractionated total body irradiation twice a day\n                on days -10 to -7 and ifosfamide IV over 1 hour followed by etoposide IV over 23\n                hours on days -6 to -2.\n\n             -  Regimen D: Patients receive ifosfamide IV over 1 hour, followed by etoposide IV\n                over 11 hours, followed by carboplatin IV over 1 hour, followed by etoposide IV\n                over 11 hours on days -7 to -3 (high-dose ICE).\n\n             -  Regimens C and D: Patients with residual or relapsed disease may undergo boost\n                radiotherapy twice a day, 5 days a week, for 1-2 weeks before conditioning or\n                after transplantation.\n\n        -  Transplantation: PBSC or bone marrow is reinfused on day 0. Patients receive G-CSF SC\n           every 12 hours beginning on day 1 and continuing until blood counts recover. If\n           additional HGFs become available, they may be administered concurrently with G-CSF.\n\n      Quality of life is assessed at baseline and then at 6, 12, and 24 months after\n      transplantation.\n\n      Patients are followed at 1 and 3 months, every 3 months through year 2, every 4 months\n      through year 5, and then every 6 months thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 80 patients (20 for regimen A and 60 for regimen B) will be\n      accrued for this study."
