Thus, there is a need to improve adherence and\n      glycemic control in mid to older teens with type 1 diabetes by strengthening the teens'\n      self-efficacy for daily diabetes self-management to help prepare them for the transition\n      between pediatric and adult care. This 18-month, multi-center RCT is designed to increase\n      frequency of blood glucose monitoring and improve glycemic control in teens with type 1\n      diabetes through a behavioral intervention called Teenwork with or without text message\n      reminders to check blood glucose levels.\n\n      We will implement and evaluate the Teenwork intervention and text message reminders to check\n      blood glucose levels in a 2x2 factorial design in which 300 participants, across two sites,\n      will be randomized to 1 of 4 groups: Teenwork, Text Message, Teenwork/Text Message, or Usual\n      Care.\n\n      Participants in the Teenwork Group will meet with a research assistant during each study\n      visit to review strategies for improving self-care, including self-management and\n      self-advocacy, focusing on two areas: blood glucose monitoring and insulin administration.\n      Participants in the Text Message Group will be instructed in the use of the text messaging\n      system. They will receive 2-way text message reminders to check blood glucose levels at\n      self-selected times and to reply by text message with blood glucose results. Participants in\n      the Teenwork/Text Message Group will receive both the Teenwork intervention and the text\n      message reminders (as described above). Participants in the Usual Care Group will receive\n      the same intervention as the Teenwork/Text Message Group, but not until after 1 year."
