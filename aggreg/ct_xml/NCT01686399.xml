  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this protocol is to use a multidisciplinary approach to convey nutrition and
      activity messages to randomly selected Hadassah Medical Center employees. The intervention
      will be for one academic year and include frontal talks, email and internet focus group
      interactions, public demonstrations and a focused intervention within the hospital kitchen.

      The outcomes are specific parameters of dietary modifications, degree of physical activity
      and health related perspectives. Outcomes will be recorded at baseline and by the end of the
      intervention ( one year).

      The participants will be selected randomly from the campus employees. They will be exposed
      to multiple levels of health promotion at the work place as well as via multiple media
      tools. Analysis will be performed at baseline by using multiple nutrition and health
      perception questionnaires. A second group from the employees will be selected for assessment
      of the same outcomes at the end of the year.
