    <textblock>
      This project aims at investigating the duration of human fecal carriage of bacteria
      harboring plasmid-borne resistance genes expressing Extended Spectrum beta-lactamases
      (ESBL), risk factors for infections with such bacteria and persistence, mobility and spread
      of ESBL in the environment and within households. It also aims to compare different methods
      of detecting ESBL carriage and treat patients with urinary tract infection caused by these
      bacteria.

        Patients living in Eastern Norway who have an urine submitted for culturing to the
        Department of Medical Microbiology, Vestre Viken Hospital Trust, which covers an area of
        about 450.000 inhabitants.

        All patients with an bacteria producing ESBL were eligible while patients without ESBL
        producing bacteria were randomly sampled.
