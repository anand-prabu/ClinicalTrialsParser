Also, of more\n      immediate importance for these women; obesity is associated with increased risks of\n      sub-fertility. The overall aim of the current project is to expand the knowledge about\n      effective interventions to prevent the increasing prevalence of obesity-associated\n      sub-fertility in population.\n\n      One cause of the increased referral rate for in-vitro fertilization is the growing\n      prevalence of overweight and obesity. Currently, about 700 couples are annually referred for\n      in-vitro fertilization at St.Olav's Hospital. In this interdisciplinary trial, involving\n      physiotherapists, exercise physiologists, gynecologists, and basic researchers, the effects\n      of regular high intensity exercise training on fertility in sub-fertile overweight and obese\n      women will be investigated."
