                "textblock": "Neurotrophins (NTs) constitute a family of growth factors, which regulated differentiation,\n      proliferation, and survival of both neuronal cells and astrocytes. In recent years, several\n      studies have provided evidences that the cellular effects of NGF \" Nerve Growth Factor \",\n      BDNF \" Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor \" and NT-3 are not limited to the nervous system.\n      Indeed, neurotrophins and their receptors are widely expressed on non neuronal cells. Data\n      concerning the implication of NTs and their receptors in the immune system maturation and in\n      the regulation of normal and pathological immune responses are numerous and suggest the\n      existence of a specific \"neuro-immunomodulation\" through these neuropeptides.\n\n      The aim of the study is to compare Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome systemic activity to seric,\n      lymphocytic and conjunctival levels of NTs (i.e NGF, BDNF and NT-3). A preliminary study has\n      previously pointed out the link between high BDNF seric levels and Sj\u00f6gren's systemic\n      activity. The increased levels of BDNF were correlated to T cell activation. A similar\n      correlation between high NGF level and hypergammaglobulinemia was also pointed out."
