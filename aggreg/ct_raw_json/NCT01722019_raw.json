            "textblock": "Endovenous ablation of the greater saphenous vein has nowadays the same outcome as open\n      crossectomy and stripping. The two most performed techniques for endovenous ablation are the\n      endovenous laser ablation and the radiofrequency ablation. According to the trial of\n      Rasmussen, they are equivalent for occlusion but the lower laser wave lengths resulted in\n      more pain and paresthesia. The newer wave length of 1470 nm showed lesser side effects in\n      observational studies. The aim of this study is to compare radiofrequency ablation with the\n      VNUS closure fast \u00ae with laser ablation with a 1470 nm wave length in combination with a new\n      fiber, the Tulip fiber \u00ae. This fiber has the shape of a tulip at his tip which avoids point\n      necroses of the vessel wall and on consequence results in lesser side effects from wall\n      perforations such as pain, haematoma,\u2026"
