The\n      investigators major hypothesis is that the morphology of carotid plaques is associated with\n      objectifiable sonographic parameters, in particular with the greyscale median. Second, the\n      investigators hypothesize that sonographic and histological plaque morphology are associated\n      with certain biomarkers of cardiovascular risk. Identification of 'vulnerable plaques' on\n      the basis of a peripheral blood draw and a sonographic investigation may enable the treating\n      physician to focus resources on patients who will benefit most form therapeutic\n      interventions for primary prevention of ischemic stroke."

Recent evidence suggests that the risk of\n      embolization from an atherosclerotic plaque may be associated with plaque density as\n      assessed sonographically by determination of the greyscale median. Also, an association of\n      serum proteins vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) and\n      pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF), matrix metalloproteinases 2, 8 and 9 with unstable\n      plaques has been reported.\n\n      The VUCAP study will include patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy for symptomatic or\n      asymptomatic carotid artery disease. Sonographic and serological markers of plaque\n      vulnerability will be compared with histological features of the plaque and clinical\n      presentation (symptomatic vs. asymptomatic). Preoperatively, the greyscale median of the\n      plaque is assessed. Histomorphological investigation of the carotid plaques will be\n      performed. Serological investigations will include markers of inflammation,\n      thrombo-modulatory factors, lipid fractions and other parameters that have been associated\n      with unstable plaques.\n\n      The aim of the present study is to assess the ability of pigment epithelium-derived factor\n      (PEDF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), hypoxia-induced factor 1 alpha (HIF 1-\u03b1),\n      matrix metalloproteinases 2, 8 and 9 to differentiate between vulnerable and stable carotid\n      artery plaques.

Endarterectomy is the removal of material on the inside (end-) of an artery.An incision is made on the midline side of the Sternocleidomastoid muscle. The incision is between 5 and 10 cm in length. Then the patients get 5000 IU heparin by the anesthesia. The internal, common and external carotid arteries are carefully identified, controlled with vessel loops, and clamped. The lumen of the internal carotid artery is opened, and the atheromatous plaque removed. The artery is closed using suture. The procedure is performed under local anesthesia. Local anesthesia, opposite to general, allows for direct monitoring of neurological status by intra-operative verbal contact and testing of grip strength.",
