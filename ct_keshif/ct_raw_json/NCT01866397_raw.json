Its potency in inhibiting HCMV has been shown in conventional in vitro\n      studies. It is approved for the systemic treatment of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) retinitis\n      in patients with AIDS and as a second line therapy for HCMV infections not responding to\n      ganciclovir or foscarnet.\n\n      In intensive care patients continuous venovenous haemofiltration (CVVH) is a\n      well-established extracorporal renal replacement therapy with a high clearance rate.\n\n      Pharmacokinetic studies of antifungal agents in critically ill patients treated with CVVH\n      are rare. Elimination of any given drug by renal replacement therapy is determined by\n      several major factors which are membrane specific, due to physico-chemical properties of the\n      drug and characteristics of the renal replacement technique used.\n\n      Study objective The trial is conducted to investigate the pharmacokinetics of cidofovir\n      during CVVH in critically ill patients. It is suspected that Hemofiltration will influence\n      cidofovir plasma levels."
