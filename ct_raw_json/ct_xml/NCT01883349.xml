      The purpose of this study is to understand cognitive impairment in end stage renal disease
      before and after a kidney transplant.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive impairment is very common in patients with End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD). It
      exact mechanisms are not clear, but patients with ESRD have more cerebral white matter
      changes seen in brain imaging. Several studies have shown that cognitive function improves
      post-transplant, indicating that there may be some reversibility in the process. This study
      will examine the correlation between cognitive impairment and structural brain changes
      before and after renal transplantation. We will also study the correlation of cognitive
      function with serum inflammatory markers before and after transplant.

        The study population will include patients from the renal transplant waiting list at
        University of Kansas Medical Center. They will be tested before renal transplant and 3
        months after renal transplantation.
