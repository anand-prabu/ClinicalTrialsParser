The latter carry over the label when they become fat cells through differentiation. Enzymatic digestion of the fat tissue isolates the individual cells constituting the fat tissue. Centrifugation of the cell suspension allows the separation of fat cells into a floating layer and a pellet comprised of stromo-vascular cells including the fat cell precursor cells and small fat cells. As the fat cell precursor cells and small adipocytes have the property to attach quickly to plastic surfaces of culture dishes, a brief culturing of the stromo-vascular cells sorts these cells from the remaining cells. Thus, measuring the deuterium-enrichment of DNA from plastic-adherent stromo-vascular cells indicates the rate of in vivo formation of new fat cells and preadipocytes, a process collectively termed adipogenesis.",
