  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a devastating form of acute lung inflammation,
      that may be caused by a variety of insults with pulmonary and systemic infectious disease
      being the most common predisposing factor. Sepsis, on the other hand, represents the
      systemic inflammatory response to an invading pathogen, which may inflict damage upon the
      host through organ dysfunction. ARDS and sepsis are heterogenous clinical conditions that
      have a high mortality, and both diseases involve a complex interplay of different
      inflammatory mediators and cell types. It has been suggested that locally released
      inflammatory mediators pass from the lungs into the bloodstream following ARDS, triggering
      systemic inflammation. Conversely, it is possible that severe systemic inflammation may lead
      to ARDS by an influx of inflammatory mediators from the bloodstream to the lungs. However,
      the time course and the possible pathways for this transmission of disease have yet to be
      established.

      Investigators hypothesize that:

        1. Primary systemic inflammation is followed by a secondary pulmonary inflammatory
           response

        2. Primary pulmonary inflammation is followed by a secondary systemic inflammatory
           response

        3. Both primary and secondary inflammatory responses are characterized by the appearance
           of pro-inflammatory cytokines, inflammatory cells and production of collagen-like
           proteins (termed 'lectins')

        4. The inflammatory response is most pronounced in the primary afflicted compartment.
