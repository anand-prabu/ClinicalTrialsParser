      This phase II trial studies the side effects and how well giving paclitaxel and
      cyclophosphamide with or without trastuzumab before surgery works in treating patients with
      previously untreated stage I-III breast cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as
      paclitaxel and cyclophosphamide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells,
      either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Monoclonal antibodies, such
      as trastuzumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor
      cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing
      substances to them. Giving combination chemotherapy with or without trastuzumab before
      surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be
      removed

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the toxicities and tolerability of a neoadjuvant dose-dense regimen
      cyclophosphamide and paclitaxel with or without trastuzumab/radiation therapy (as clinically
      indicated) in patients with newly diagnosed stage T1cN0 and II-III breast cancer; followed
      by maintenance trastuzumab in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) positive OR
      Adriamycin (doxorubicin hydrochloride) followed by radiation therapy (RT) in stage II-III
      triple negative HER2 (-), estrogen receptor (ER) (-), progesterone receptor (PR) (-) stage
      T1cN0 and II-III breast cancer patients.

      II. To determine the pathological complete response rate (pCR) of this treatment regimen.

      III. To identify possible gene expression profile signatures from whole genome array
      analysis that correlate with clinical response/resistance to chemotherapy as measured by
      pathologic complete response rate (pCR).

      OUTLINE:

      NEOADJUVANT THERAPY: Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 3 hours and
      cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on day 1. Patients with HER2-positive cancer also receive
      trastuzumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 14 days for up to 6 courses
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients without metastasis
      undergo mastectomy or breast conserving surgery 4-8 weeks later.

      POST-SURGERY/SYSTEMIC THERAPY:

      HER2-POSITIVE PATIENTS: Patients receive standard radiation therapy. Patients also receive
      trastuzumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 13
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ER/PR POSITIVE PATIENTS: Patients receive standard adjuvant hormonal or endocrine therapy.

      STAGE T1cN0 TRIPLE NEGATIVE PATIENTS: Patients receive standard radiation therapy.

      STAGE II-III TRIPLE NEGATIVE PATIENTS: Patients receive doxorubicin hydrochloride IV over 15
      minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 14 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive standard radiation
      therapy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years.
