Determine the safety and toxicity of this regimen in these patients. III. Evaluate the\n      concentration of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of these\n      patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to disease type (acute lymphoblastic leukemia vs.\n      other leukemia/lymphoma vs medulloblastoma vs other solid tumors). (Recurrent CNS acute\n      lymphoblastic leukemia stratum only open to accrual as of 11/30/04)\n\n      INDUCTION: Patients receive topotecan hydrochloride intrathecally (IT) over 5 minutes twice\n      weekly for 6 weeks.\n\n      CONSOLIDATION: Beginning 1 week after completion of induction, patients receive topotecan\n      hydrochloride IT over 5 minutes weekly for 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or\n      unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      MAINTENANCE: Beginning 2 weeks after completion of consolidation, patients receive topotecan\n      hydrochloride IT over 5 minutes twice monthly for 4 months and then monthly through year 1.\n\n      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up monthly for 3 months, every 3\n      months for 1 year, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-77 patients will be accrued for this study."
