            "textblock": "HFE-related hereditary hemochromatosis  has a highly variable penetrance : 1% of homozygous\n      women and 30% of homozygous men would develop a clinically expressed disease. No predictive\n      phenotypic or genetic markers are available.\n\n      The Iron Reabsorption Index (IRI), recently described by our group, correspond to the daily\n      amount of reabsorbed iron for a subject whose iron stock is less than 50 \u00b5g / L and\n      stabilized with maintenance phlebotomy.\n\n      For one patient, the IRI is constant over time, probably related to  the functional deficit\n      underlying. Unfortunately, IRI is a retrospective marker requiring at least one year of\n      treatment, which limits its practical interest and directs its use for research activity.\n\n      We're looking for a more simple phenotypic marker readily available in clinical practice,\n      which would predict at the time of diagnosis the evolution of the disease and therefore\n      would better define the therapeutic options.\n\n      The pathophysiology of hemochromatosis is a dysregulation of hepcidin synthesis. We assume\n      that hepcidin / ferritin ratio could be a phenotypic marker like the IRI, stage disease\n      independent and constant over time. Indeed H/F ratio may reflect the adaptability of\n      hepcidin production regulation for a level of iron stock No data are available on the\n      validated values of this ratio. The aim of the project is to determine the intra-individual\n      variations of the H / F ratio over time during maintenance therapy  and to assess the\n      correlation with the IRI.\n\n      The study involve 30  C282Y homozygous men, followed in a reference center with phlebotomy\n      maintenance therapy and stabilized at a low level of ferritin (<50 \u00b5g / L) for at least 1\n      year.\n\n      The intra-individual variation of H/F ration will be determine by 5 samples every 14 days\n      for 8 weeks. The correlation with IRI will be validated externally by the iron load observed\n      at diagnosis. We will take into account other known variation factors like liver damages\n      associated with hemochromatosis at diagnosis."
