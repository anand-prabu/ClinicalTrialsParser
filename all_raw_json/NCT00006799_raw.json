Patients\n      are stratified according to type of treatment (radiotherapy alone vs radiotherapy plus\n      platinum-based chemotherapy vs radiotherapy plus non-platinum-based chemotherapy) and type\n      of radiotherapy (primary vs postoperative). Patients are randomized to one of two treatment\n      arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral megestrol daily beginning within the first three days of\n           radiotherapy and continuing during 5-7 weeks of radiotherapy and for 12 weeks after\n           completion of radiotherapy.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo daily according to the schedule for megestrol in\n           arm I.\n\n      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, at completion of radiotherapy, and then at 4, 8,\n      12, and 16 weeks after completion of radiotherapy.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 48-144 patients (24-72 per arm) will be accrued for this study\n      within 14 months."
