Lipiodol-based transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) has been an accepted\n      standard of care procedure for unresectable liver lesions for several decades. Lipiodol is\n      used as a carrier for chemotherapy agents and also as an occlusion agent. In TACE\n      procedures, Lipiodol is mixed with the chemotherapy agent(s) and delivered to the tumor via\n      the hepatic artery, causing necrosis of the targeted tumor(s). Response to therapy will be\n      evaluated every 1, 3 and 6 months by clinic visits, MRI/ CT scans and blood tests (to\n      include assessment of liver function and tumor markers). After the 6th month, patients will\n      be followed every 2-3 months for a period of up to 4 years."
