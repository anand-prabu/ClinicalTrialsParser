  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of crystalloid and colloid, which are
      used for pump priming solution, on the microcirculatory alterations during cardiac surgery.

    <description>Recovery slope is a marker of microcirculation. The tissue oxygen saturation (StO2) using InspectraTM StO2 (Hutchinson Technology Inc.,USA) will be recorded continuously. The InspectraTM StO2 probe will be placed on the skin of the thenar eminence and the blood pressure cuff will be wrapped around the arm. After performing vascular occlusion test, the recovery slope will be calculated by the software.</description>
