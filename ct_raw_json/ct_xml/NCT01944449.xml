  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are to examine the effects of chronic, (12 weeks)
      administration of Whey protein on Anthropometric variables, blood pressure, on fasting
      circulating levels of HbA1c, lipids, hsCRP, angiotensin II (AngII) andangiotensin 1-7
      (Ang1-7) and on postprandial responses of glucose, insulin, C-peptide, triglycerides (TG)
      and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) serum levels

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes is associated with elevated blood pressure, atherogenic dyslipidemia,
      exacerbated postprandial lipid responses, all of which are contributory factors for
      developing increased cardiovascular risk and complications in patients with type 2 diabetes.
      Milk and Whey consumption has been associated with lower risk of developing metabolic
      disorders, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.

      Whey protein that accounts for 20% of whole milk protein seems to induce insulinotropic
      /β-cell-stimulating and glucose lowering effects via bioactive peptides generated during its
      gastrointestinal digestion. These bioactive peptides stimulate the release of GLP-1, serve
      as endogenous inhibitors of DPP-4 and cause  inhibitory activity against α-glucosidase
      activity, which might be an additional mechanism accounting for the glucose lowering effects
      of Whey.

      It  was shown that acute supplementation with Whey protein causes an postprandial
      insulinotropic and glucose lowering effects in healthy adults (9-13) and in type 2 diabetic
      subjects. This was associated with increased postprandial response of the t-GLP-1 and of
      a-GLP-1, suggesting that the peptides generated from Whey protein may have dual beneficial
      effects (increasing incretin production and decreasing incretin degradation by DPP-4) on
      glycemia regulation in subjects with type 2 diabetes.

      Addition of Whey protein to the meal, significantly decreased postprandial lipemia in
      healthy and in type 2 diabetic subjects and there are also clinical evidence in
      non-diabetics individuals, that acute and chronic administration of Whey protein has
      antihypertensive activity. It has been reported that Whey protein via bioactive peptides,
      exerts ACE inhibitory actions, nevertheless it is not clear if  this putative ACE inhibitory
      effect of Whey, beside of reducing AngII, also increases its conversion to Ang 1-7, a novel
      vasodilator and  blood pressure lowering peptide.

      The effect of chronic administration of Whey protein on HbA1c, BP, AngII, Ang 1-7 and on
      postprandial lipids, glucose, insulin and incretin responses, have not been examined
      previously in type 2 diabetics.
