            "textblock": "Perineural injection of local anesthesic is currently the reference method for the treatment\n      of post operative pain in a patient undergoing major orthopedic surgery. Postoperative pain\n      is a dynamic phenomena in every patient. It is classified as intense during the first\n      postoperative hours after surgery, and decreases in a non-linear manner over the days\n      following the procedure. PCA (patient control analgesia) infusion of local anesthesic allows\n      an adaptation of the local analgesia doses to the evaluated pain scores, as well as permit a\n      decrease in adverse events related to the continuous infusion technique (motor or sensory\n      blockade, paresthesia, etc.). The physician can also modify the pump settings according to\n      the postoperative rehabilitation plan.The use of new communication techniques such as\n      \"telemedecine\" may be of interest in reducing treatment onset time and optimizing pain\n      management. The remote control consists to change the settings of the pump after if the\n      anesthesiologist was informed in real time (via a smartphone or a tablet) on patient pain\n      level, sensory and motor blockades. The physician goes to a dedicated website (Micrel\n      CareTM). and  makes the necessary changes by remote control via a GPRS (General Packet Radio\n      Service) connexion. The aim of this prospective, comparative, multicentric trial is to\n      compare the effectiveness of patient management through two communication modalities: remote\n      control versus bedside care."
