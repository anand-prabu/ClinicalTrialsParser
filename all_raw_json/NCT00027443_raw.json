This treatment may prolong patient survival until transplantation or\n      ventricular assist device placement is possible."

To prevent bias,\n      randomization will be stratified by recency of symptom onset to ensure that both the\n      treatment and control groups are balanced with respect to it. Within each of these 2 strata,\n      permuted-block randomization will be done to keep the number of treatment and control\n      patients balanced. Due to the necessary monitoring of the patients randomized to receive\n      immunosuppression therapy, treatment cannot be blinded. Approximately 1 year after the last\n      patient has been randomized, the observed times from randomization to the composite endpoint\n      (death, transplantation, or LVD placement) will be compared in the treatment and control\n      groups."
