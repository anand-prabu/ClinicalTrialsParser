    <textblock>
      This study will explore whether supplementation with thyroid hormones in the set-up of
      asthma exacerbation could improve the clinical outcomes.

      The study will include adults admitted to Rambam health care campus for moderate to severe
      Asthma exacerbation.

      The study is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trial.
      Patients will be randomized on admission to receive treatment with intra-venous thyroxine
      (100mcg once on admission and additional 100mcg after 12 hours) or placebo. The study
      treatment will be given only after the initial bronchodilator therapy, oxygen and informed
      consent are given. The primary endpoint is the time to return of the peak expiratory flow
      (PEF) rate to normal values or personal base line.
