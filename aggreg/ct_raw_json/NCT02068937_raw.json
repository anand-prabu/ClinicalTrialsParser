The identification of early signs\n      and symptoms interrupts progressive exacerbation of the condition, with a direct impact on\n      reduced costs, hospitalizations and mortality. One of the strategies that has already been\n      proven to prevent exacerbation is intensive and systematic monitoring through telephone and\n      home visits. In light of this, the Diuretic Treatment Algorithm (DTA) was developed for\n      adjustment of diuretics conducted by telephone by North-American nurses, with a focus on\n      non-pharmacological and pharmacological evaluation and home management of patients with HF.\n      In Brazil DTA proved applicable in clinical practice after adaption and appears to result in\n      better congestion management in patients with heart failure. This study aims to evaluate the\n      Effectiveness of the algorithm diuretic in clinical stability and readmissions in heart\n      failure patients.\n\n      The hypothesis is that patients randomized to the intervention group (IG) - management by\n      DTA followed with four 30-day telephone contacts reduce the signs and symptoms of\n      congestion, body weight, submit improvement in functional class and fewer emergency room\n      visits or readmissions when compared to the Control Group (CG) which will fit diuretic as\n      medical management (no protocol) and no telephone contact followed during the same period.\n      In 90 days everyone will receive a telephone call to assess hospitalizations at the end of\n      the period."
