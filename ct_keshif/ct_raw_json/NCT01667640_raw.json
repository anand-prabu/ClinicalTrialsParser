            "textblock": "Microneurosurgical resection of intracerebral metastases leads to prolonged survival and\n      relief of symptoms in selected patients. Traditionally whole-brain irradiation is the\n      treatment of choice following surgical resection. Whole brain irradiation has been the\n      standard approach to minimize the risk of intracranial recurrence following resection of\n      brain metastases. Almost 2 decades ago, Patchell et al. established the superiority of\n      resection of solitary metastases followed by whole brain irradiation compared with whole\n      brain irradiation alone with regard to survival, local control, and length of functional\n      independence. A following study by the same group failed to show a survival advantage for\n      the addition of whole brain irradiation compared to surgical resection alone in patients\n      with a solitary intracranial metastasis, although the likelihood of local and distant\n      recurrence and death from neurological causes were significantly reduced by whole brain\n      irradiation. Due to potential delayed neurocognitive effects associated with whole brain\n      irradiation, investigators have evaluated the use of partial brain irradiation in the form\n      of stereotactic radiosurgery instead of whole brain irradiation after resection of brain\n      metastases. They showed that despite whole brain irradiation means superior control of brain\n      recurrence in sites other than the resection bed, stereotactic radiosurgery after resection\n      resulted in equivalent survival times and neurological preservation. In a retrospective\n      series of 52 patients Karlovits et al. could show that stereotactic radiosurgery following\n      surgical resection leads to equal local control compared to standard whole brain\n      irradiation.\n\n      Study objective\n\n      The aim of this study is to investigate whether adjuvant \"sector\" -irradiation following\n      microsurgical resection is equal to adjuvant whole brain irradiation in terms of local\n      control and superior to in terms of quality of life and neurocognitive deficits in a\n      prospective randomized trial.\n\n      Hypothesis\n\n        1. Sector irradiation is equal to whole-brain irradiation in local tumor control after 3,\n           6, 12  and 36 months and\n\n        2. Sector irradiation\" is superior to whole-brain irradiation in terms of quality of life\n           and neurocognitive function\n\n      Patients and Methods\n\n      Patients with a single brain metastasis amenable to surgical resection fulfilling the\n      inclusion criteria will be consecutively enrolled in this study. After microsurgical\n      complete resection documented by early postoperative MRI within 72 hours and histological\n      proven  brain metastasis patients will be randomized in arm A or B. Radiotherapy will start\n      after 14th postoperative day within 3 weeks postoperatively. Study arm A means postoperative\n      sector irradiation (30Gy), study arm B includes standard whole brain radiotherapy (40Gy).\n      Follow up MRI will be every 3 months. Neurocognitive evaluation will be performed before\n      radiotherapy and 6 and 12 months postoperatively. In case of local recurrence or developing\n      further metastases a cross over to whole brain radiotherapy or focal irradiation is\n      possible."
