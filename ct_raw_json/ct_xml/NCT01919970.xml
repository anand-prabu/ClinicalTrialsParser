  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Autism spectrum disorders affect as many as 1 out of 88 children and are related to
      significant impairment in social, adaptive, and school functioning. Co-occurring conditions,
      such as anxiety, are common and may cause substantial distress and impairment beyond that
      caused by the autism diagnosis. Accordingly, we are proposing a randomized controlled trial
      to examine the effectiveness of a form of cognitive-behavioral therapy relative to treatment
      as usual (TAU) in 50 youth ages 6-12 with autism spectrum disorders and comorbid anxiety.

      Autism spectrum disorders affect as many as 1 out of 88 children and are related to
      significant impairment in social, adaptive, and school functioning. Co-occurring conditions,
      such as anxiety, are common and may cause substantial distress and impairment beyond that
      caused by the autism diagnosis. Many children with anxiety disorders, especially those on
      the autism spectrum, do not receive evidence based treatment, which has fueled the
      development and evaluation of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). Accordingly, we are
      proposing a randomized controlled trial to examine the efficacy of exposure based CBT that
      heavily incorporates parents (EF-CBT) relative to a TAU condition (TAU) in 50 youth ages
      6-12 years with ASD and comorbid anxiety disorder(s).

    <description>This arm is the experimental condition; it consists of 12 weekly CBT sessions. The therapy protocol will begin with an introductory education session which will include development of a fear hierarchy, followed by 11 sessions of in vivo exposures to feared triggers.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>This arm acts as the comparison condition. Participants randomized to this arm will be instructed to continue receiving their prior interventions as recommended by their providers (e.g., psychotherapy, social skills training, behavioral interventions, family participation in family therapy or a parenting class, or pharmacological interventions). Treatment changes (e.g., medication increase, starting psychotherapy in the community) are not prohibited and will be monitored. Thus, treatment will continue as it would in standard practice; and will be monitored through periodic study assessment.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Outpatient children with an autism spectrum disorder between the ages 6-12 years.

          -  Meets criteria for a diagnosis of one of the following anxiety disorders: generalized
             anxiety disorder, separation anxiety disorder, social phobia, specific phobia, panic
             disorder or obsessive-compulsive disorder.

          -  Minimum score of 12 on the Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale - Severity Scale.

          -  Child has a Full Scale and Verbal Comprehension IQ &gt; 80.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Current clinically significant suicidality or engagement in suicidal behaviors within
             the last 6 months.

          -  Presence of any clinical features requiring a higher level of care (inpatient or
             partial hospital treatment).

          -  Any lifetime diagnosis (meeting DSM-IV criteria) of bipolar disorder, schizophrenia
             or schizoaffective disorder; or Substance abuse in the past 6 months.

          -  Initiation of an antidepressant medication within 10 weeks before study enrollment or
             an antipsychotic medication 6 weeks before study enrollment or the child has changed
             the dose of an established medication within 6 weeks before study enrollment (4 weeks
             for antipsychotic) or during psychotherapy (unless the dose is lowered because of
             side effects). If the child is on a medication, she or he can remain on it at its
             current dose. While in their treatment arm, children randomized to the EF-CBT
             condition will not be able to continue or initiate psychosocial interventions
             targeting anxiety(psychotherapy, certain types of social skills training, applied
             behavior analysis targeting anxiety). Those in the TAU arm will be able to seek out
             psychiatric/psychological services at their discretion.
