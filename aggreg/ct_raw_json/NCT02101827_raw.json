The aim of this\n      study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of manual syringe-infusion method in\n      hysteroscopic procedures.\n\n      The medical records of all women who received hysteroscopic procedures by manual\n      fluid-infusion method or convention pump fluid infusion method between June 2010 and\n      November 2013 will be reviewed. In order to reveal the superiority/inferiority of clinical\n      outcome of women receiving manual fluid infusion method, perioperative outcomes will be\n      compared."
