Determine the objective tumor response rate in patients with advanced\n      adenocarcinoma of the lower esophagus, esophagogastric junction, and gastric cardia treated\n      with docetaxel and irinotecan. II. Determine time to progression and overall survival of\n      patients treated treated with this regimen. III. Determine the toxic effects of this regimen\n      in these patients. IV. Assess treatment response in these patients by determining the\n      prevalence of dysphagia, anorexia, and swallowing ability at diagnosis and during treatment\n      with this regimen.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients receive irinotecan IV over 90 minutes followed by docetaxel IV over 1 hour\n      on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease\n      progression. Patients achieving a complete response (CR) receive 2 additional courses after\n      CR. Patients experiencing disease progression after a CR and 2 additional courses may be\n      retreated with irinotecan and docetaxel. Dysphagia, anorexia, and swallowing ability are\n      assessed before the first course of treatment and then at each tumor assessment. Patients\n      are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 4 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-26\n      months."
