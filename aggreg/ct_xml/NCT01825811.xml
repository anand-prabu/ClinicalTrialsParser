  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether TissueGene-C, allogeneic human
      chondrocytes expressing TGF-b1, mixed with fibrin-glue is effective and safe  in patients
      with degenerative arthritis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      TissueGene-C is a biological new drug which consists of non-transduced chondrocytes and
      transduced chondrocytes that express TGF-b1 to regenerate the damaged cartilage.

      During the clinical trial Phase 2, the investigators compare  low dose or high dose
      TissueGene-C in 12 - months trial with 18 outpatients who have degenerative arthritis.  The
      patients are randomized to two dose levels of TissueGene-C by 1:1 ratio, and they are
      monitored and recorded for  alleviating symptoms, sports activities, function of the knee,
      and the presence of adverse events.
