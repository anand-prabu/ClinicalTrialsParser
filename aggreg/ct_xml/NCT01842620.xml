  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-center, randomized, 2-way crossover study to evaluate the
      bioequivalence of OXEMET™ 1000 mg coated tablets, relative to 1000 mg of the reference
      product administered as two 500 mg tablets, under fasting conditions, in 24 healthy adult
      subjects. Each subject will receive two treatments (Treatment A and Treatment B). In Period
      1, subjects will be dosed with either one OXEMET™ 1000 mg tablet (Treatment A, Test) or two
      500 mg tablets of reference product (GLAFORNIL™ 500 mg) (Treatment B, Reference). Following
      a washout of at least 7 days, subjects will be crossed over in Period 2 to receive the
      treatment that they did not receive in Period 1.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  ALT, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin &gt; 1.5xULN (isolated bilirubin &gt; 1.5xULN is
             acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin &lt; 35%).

          -  Single QTc &lt; 450 msec.

          -  Healthy as determined by a responsible and experienced physician, based on a medical
             evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and
             cardiac monitoring. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters
             outside the reference range for the population being studied may be included only if
             the Investigator and the GSK Medical Monitor agree that the finding is unlikely to
             introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures.

          -  Male or female between 21 and 55 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the
             informed consent.

          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of non-childbearing potential
             defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy;
             or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea.

          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of child-bearing potential and
             is abstinent  or agrees to use one of the contraception methods listed in Section 8.1
             for an appropriate period of time (as determined by the product label or
             investigator) prior to the start of dosing to sufficiently minimize the risk of
             pregnancy at that point. Female subjects must agree to use contraception until 7 days
             post-last dose.

          -  Body weight &gt; 50 kg and BMI within the range 19 - 27 kg/m2 (inclusive).

          -  Capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the
             requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  A positive pre-study Hepatitis B surface antigen or positive Hepatitis C antibody
             result within 3 months of screening.

          -  Current or chronic history of liver disease, or known hepatic or biliary
             abnormalities (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones).

          -  A positive pre-study drug/alcohol screen. A minimum list of drugs that will be
             screened for include amphetamines, barbiturates, cocaine, opiates, cannabinoids and
             benzodiazepines.

          -  A positive test for HIV antibody.

          -  History of regular alcohol consumption within 6 months of the study defined as an
             average weekly intake of &gt; 14 drinks for males or &gt; 7 drinks for females. One drink
             is equivalent to 12 g of alcohol: 360 mL of beer, 150 mL of wine or 45 mL of 40% abv
             distilled spirits.

          -  The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational
             product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current
             study: 30 days, 5 half-lives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the
             investigational product (whichever is longer).

          -  Exposure to more than four new chemical entities within 12 months prior to the first
             dosing day.

          -  Unable to refrain from the use of prescription or non-prescription drugs, including
             vitamins, herbal and dietary supplements (including St John's Wort) within 7 days (or
             14 days if the drug is a potential enzyme inducer) or 5 half-lives (whichever is
             longer) prior to the first dose of study medication, unless in the opinion of the
             Investigator and GSK Medical Monitor the medication will not interfere with the study
             procedures or compromise subject safety.

          -  History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof or a
             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or GSK
             Medical Monitor, contraindicates their participation.

          -  Where participation in the study would result in donation of blood or blood products
             in excess of 500 mL within a 56 day period.

          -  Subjects whose sitting blood pressure is less than 110/60 mmHg at screening or prior
             to dosing, or greater than 140/90 mmHg at screening.

          -  Subjects whose pulse is lower than 50 beats per minute or higher than 99 beats per
             minute at screening or prior to dosing.

          -  Subjects whose ECG PR interval is &gt; 220 msec at screening or prior to dosing.

             or nicotine-containing products within 6 months prior to screening.

          -  Consumption of red wine, seville oranges, grapefruit or grapefruit juice from 7 days
