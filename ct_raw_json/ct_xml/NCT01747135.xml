      Background:

      - Hydroxypropyl beta cyclodextrin (HPBCD) is being tested for a disease called Niemann-Pick
      disease type C1 (NPC1). NPC1 is a genetic disorder that results in gradual loss of nervous
      system function. Cholesterol and other fats have trouble moving out of the brain cells,
      which makes the cells work poorly and leads to symptoms. There is no treatment currently
      approved in the US for NPC1. Researchers want to test if it is safe to use HPBCD for NPC1.
      They want to see if it can help brain cells process cholesterol better.

      Objectives:

      - To test the safety and effectiveness of HPBCD for NPC1.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals between 2 and 25 years of age who have been diagnosed with NPC1.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. They will
           provide blood and urine samples for screening.  They will also have neurological tests,
           including tests of hearing, speech and movement.

        -  Participants will have an Ommaya reservoir placed under the scalp to allow the drug to
           be given into a cavity of the brain for treatment. This will require surgery. A brain
           scan will be performed to help place the equipment.

        -  Participants will receive doses of HPBCD through the Ommaya reservoir. They will
           receive one dose of HPBCD once a month.  The length of the trial will be determined by
           the safety and efficacy information we obtain.

        -  Treatment will be monitored with frequent blood and urine tests, Cerebral Spinal Fluid
           tests, and neurological exams.

    <textblock>
      Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC) is a lethal, autosomal recessive, lysosomal storage
      disorder characterized by neurodegeneration in early childhood and death in adolescence. The
      causative genes NPC1 (about 95% of cases) and NPC2 (about 5% of cases) are involved in the
      intracellular trafficking of lipids and cholesterol. Mutations on either of these genes lead
      to progressive accumulation of unesterified cholesterol and other lipids in the central
      nervous system (CNS). The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Therapeutics for Rare and
      Neglected Diseases (TRND) program is developing 2-hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin
      (HP-beta-CD) for the treatment of patients with Niemann-Pick disease type C1 (NPC1) to slow
      progression of symptoms of the disease. In this Phase 1, non-randomized, open-label,
      single-center, study, we propose to administer HP-beta-CD intracerebroventricularly via an
      Ommaya reservoir to 3 cohorts of 3 patients at doses of 50 mg escalated to 100, 200, and 400
      mg, in Cohorts 1,2, &amp;  3 respectively. The objectives of this study are to assess the
      safety, tolerability, feasibility, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of intracerebroventricular
      (ICV) administered HP-beta-CD to NPC1 patients, to determine an active dose of HP-beta-CD as
      measured by changes in plasma 24-(S) hydroxycholesterol (24-HC) levels, and to evaluate the
      use of biomarkers and potential clinical outcomes of NPC1. All patients in the cohort will
      receive HP-beta-CD (n = 3) once monthly for at least 2 doses, and the decision to
      dose-escalate will be based on safety and on biochemical data. Safety will be assessed by
      adverse events (AEs), audiologic evaluation, clinical laboratory tests, vital signs,
      physical examinations, chest X-rays and electrocardiograms (ECGs). Biochemical efficacy will
      be measured by change from baseline in plasma 24-HC. PK will be assessed for both
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma HP-beta-CD.
