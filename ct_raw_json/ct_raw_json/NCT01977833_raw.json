            "textblock": "The endogenous circadian (24-h) timing system, synchronized by light/dark cycle in the\n      master circadian clock in the suprachiasmatic nuclei and by meal  timing in the peripheral\n      clock genes; plays a significant role in regulating sleep/wake and feeding behavior, body\n      weight as well as glucose and lipid metabolism.\n\n      Circadian misalignment, involving sleep/wake and meal timing schedules 12\u2009h out of phase\n      from their habitual times resulted in elevated blood pressure and increased postprandial\n      glucose and insulin levels.  Animal models of circadian misalignment specially breakfast\n      skipping are associated with alteration in the expression pattern of clock genes such as\n      Clock, Bmal1, Cry1, and Per2 in the liver and fat cells. These changes resulted in a\n      predisposition to obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D). This may also explain why evening or\n      night eating is often associated with weight gain and obesity.\n\n      Breakfast skipping has been consistently associated with increased, visceral adiposity,\n      higher BMI and waist circumference, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia  and with T2D despite\n      having less total daily caloric intake.\n\n      A recent population-based studies have found that participants with an evening preferences\n      (late chronotype) that involves breakfast skipping, have 2.5 times risk of developing T2D,\n      even after adjustment for body mass index (BMI) (12).\n\n      Breakfast skipping  and greater percentage of their daily caloric intake at dinner was\n      associated with higher fasting plasma glucose levels, and poorer glycemic control compared\n      with earlier chronotypes even after adjusting for BMI (11,20,21). Recently  was documented\n      that in T2D patients, breakfast skipping was associated was associated  with a 10.8%\n      increase in HbA1C of its original value, even after adjusting for age, sex, race, BMI,\n      number of diabetes complications, insulin use, depressive symptoms, perceived sleep debt,\n      and percentage of daily caloric intake at dinner. This significant  difference in HbA1C\n      levels between breakfast skippers and breakfast eaters in patients with T2D, highlights the\n      potential impact of the meal timing on the course of the disease.\n\n      More  recently  the investigators documented that compared  to a conventional diet, a  high\n      caloric intake in the breakfast and reduced dinner resulted in significant reduction of\n      HbA1c in T2D individuals.\n\n      The existence of diurnal variation in glucose tolerance in healthy  and  in subjects with\n      T2D has been suspected for decades, with reports showing that  glucose tolerance decreases\n      progressively throughout the day with insulin sensitivity reaching a nadir in the evening.\n      The reduction of  glucose  tolerance  in the evening, seems  to be  a results from a\n      combination of reduced glucose utilization, decreased insulin sensitivity, and\n      inappropriately low insulin secretion and action, which highlights the importance of meal\n      timing in glucose metabolism.\n\n      It is  known that insulin response to meal ingestion is more rapid in the morning than in\n      the afternoon and specifically the early (30 or 45 min) insulin secretion after oral glucose\n      or meal ingestion is significantly higher in the morning than in the evening. A possible\n      explanation for the more rapid glucose clearance from the circulation in the morning is\n      because the early insulin response is important for rapid reduction in hepatic glucose\n      output after meal ingestion.\n\n      Recently  was shown that the enhanced early (30-min) insulin secretion after morning  meal\n      vs. afternoon, was accompanied by a correspondingly faster incretin total GLP-1 and intact\n      GLP-1 hormone response in the morning specially during the first 30 min  after  ingestion.\n      The association was consistent and also supports  the prediction that higher GLP-1 levels\n      after morning meal would result in a higher potentiation of \u03b2-cell function.\n\n      This diurnal pattern of enhanced insulin and GLP-1 response after morning  meal versus in\n      the  evening, might be underlying explanation of the  beneficial effect of eating  breakfast\n      with reduced dinner vs skipping  breakfast on glycemic control and HbA1c in T2D patients.\n\n      To test  this  hypothesis  the investigators will  compare in random order and  in two\n      separate days: the glucose, insulin and GLP-1 postprandial  responses after  breakfast,\n      lunch and dinner with 2 isocaloric meal plans or test diets, that differ only in meal timing\n       distribution\n\n        1. High caloric   breakfast, average  lunch and  reduced dinner (BTdiet) and\n\n        2. High caloric dinner, similar lunch and    reduced  breakfast (DTdiet)"
