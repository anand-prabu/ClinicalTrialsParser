This was a prospective randomized controlled trial comprised of 69 patients with\n      multiple myomas undergoing myomectomy. Patients randomly allocated to either an\n      intra-vaginal single dose of 400 microgram Misoprostol 1 hour pre-operatively (group A, 34\n      cases) or 2 doses, 3 and 1 hours, prior surgery (group B, 35 cases). Operation time, intra\n      and post-operative blood loss, hemoglobin concentration, blood pressure and body's\n      temperature were estimated and compared in both groups."
