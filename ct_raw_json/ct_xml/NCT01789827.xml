      This pilot clinical trial studies aldesleukin imaging in viewing tumor growth in patients
      with stage IV melanoma receiving ipilimumab therapy. New diagnostic procedures, such as
      single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT/CT), may be a less invasive way to check
      for stage IV melanoma. Radioactive drugs, such as technetium Tc 99
      hydrazinonicotinamide-tricine-linked interleukin-2, may carry radiation directly to cancer
      cells and not harm normal cells. Giving 99mTc-HYNIC-IL2 with SPECT/CT may help find tumor
      growth in patients with stage IV melanoma

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Feasibility/biodistribution of 99mTc-HYNIC-IL2 (technetium Tc 99
      hydrazinonicotinamide-tricine-linked interleukin 2) scintigraphy in patients with metastatic
      melanoma undergoing ipilimumab (IPI) therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Correlation of tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) invasion (scintigraphy/histology) with
      tumor diameter (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST]); description of
      survival end points(progression free survival [PFS]/overall survival [OS] and 2 year
      survival rate); and description of any clinical side effects associated with imaging.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Correlation of TIL invasion assessed by 99mTc-HYNIC-IL2 scintigraphy vs histology (total
      and subsets of TIL), as well as screen for peripheral blood correlates.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo technetium Tc 99 hydrazinonicotinamide-tricine-linked interleukin-2
      scintigraphy prior to receiving ipilimumab therapy and at 12 weeks.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for up to 2
      years.
