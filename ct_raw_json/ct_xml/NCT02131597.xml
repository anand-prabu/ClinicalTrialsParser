      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if SGI-110 can help to control MDS. The
      safety of this drug will also be studied.

      Study Drug Administration:

      If participant is found to be eligible to take part in this study, they will receive
      injections of SGI-110 under the skin 5 days every study cycle.  Each study cycle is 4-8
      weeks depending on how participant tolerates the drug and how the disease responds to it.
      The study staff will tell participant how often they should receive the drug.

      Participant will need to stay in Houston to receive the study drug, but they may return home
      after they have finished their dose for each cycle.  When participant has study visits where
      they are not receiving study drug (described below), the tests performed at these visits can
      be performed by their local doctor.  If participant's MD Anderson leukemia doctor approves,
      their study drug can be administered outside MD Anderson by their local doctor.

      Study Visits:

      On Day 1 of every cycle, participant will have a physical exam.

      Every week during the first cycle, and then every 2-8 weeks after that, blood (about 1/2
      teaspoon) will be drawn for routine tests.  The study doctor will tell participant how often
      they need to have these tests performed.

      At the end of Cycle 1 and/or 2, participant will have a bone marrow aspirate to check the
      status of the disease.  If the disease does not appear to have gotten better by the end of
      Cycle 2, participant's next bone marrow aspirate will depend on the results of their blood
      tests.  These samples will also be used for cytogenetic testing.  Cytogenetic testing looks
      at how changes to cell DNA (genetic material) may affect how the disease may react to the
      study drug.

      Length of Study:

      Participant will be on study for up to 24 cycles (about 2-4 years).  Participant will no
      longer be able to receive the study drug if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side
      effects occur, or if they are unable to follow study directions.

      Patient's participation on the study will be over after the follow-up visits.

      Follow-up Visits:

      After participant's last dose of study drug, they will have follow-up visits. Participant
      will only have these visits if the disease appears to have responded to the study drug.

        -  Every month, blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn routine tests.  This can be done
           in or near participant's hometown through their local cancer doctor.

        -  Every 6 months, participant will return to Houston for a physical exam and blood (about
           1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests.

      This is an investigational study.  SGI-100 is not FDA approved or commercially available.
      It is currently being used for research purposes only.

      The study doctor can explain how the study drug are designed to work.

      Up to 100 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

    <description>Primary endpoint is complete response (CR) in patients with higher risk MDS treated with SGI-110. CR first evaluated at the end of week 12 from the start of treatment (after 3 cycle), then repeated every 3 cycles thereafter as long as the patient continues treatment.
Complete Remission: Normalization peripheral blood and bone marrow with &lt;/= 5% bone marrow blasts, without evidence of dysplasia; a peripheral blood granulocyte count &gt;/= 1.0 x 109/L, and a platelet count &gt;/= 100 x 109/L. Hgb &gt;/= 11 g/dL, maintained for at least 4 weeks.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with higher risk MDS (IPSS int-2 or high; or &gt;/= 10% blasts as defined by
             WHO). - No prior intensive chemotherapy or high-dose cytarabine (&gt;/= 1 g/m2). - Prior
             biologic therapies (&lt;/= 1 cycle of prior decitabine or azacitidine), targeted
