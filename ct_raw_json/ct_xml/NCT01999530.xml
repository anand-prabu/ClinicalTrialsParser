  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out whether short term treatment with a
      antihypertensive medication prazosin, can influence the levels of a dopamine in the brain.
      We will examine the levels of dopamine in the the brain using Positron Emission Tomography
      (PET) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). We hypothesize that there will be no significant
      changes in dopamine levels in healthy individuals taking prazosin.

      The purpose of this study is to find out whether short term treatment with a
      antihypertensive medication prazosin, can influence the levels of dopamine in the brain. We
      will examine the levels of dopamine in the the brain using Positron Emission Tomography
      (PET) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). The study will involve three PET scans and one
      MRI. One PET scan will be performed before the participants take prazosin for approximately
      three weeks, and the last two PET scans will be performed after the prazosin medication
      phase. We hypothesize that there will be no significant changes in dopamine levels in
      healthy individuals taking prazosin.

          -  Baseline systolic blood pressure  outside the normal range

          -  Current use of medications that could interact with prazosin (e.g. beta blockers,
             phosphodiesterasetype 5 inhibitors, indomethacin, verapamil, modafinil, clonidine)

          -  Current use or use during the previous month of medication that may affect the CNS at
             the time of scanning (e.g. neuroleptics, bupropion)

          -  Any significant abnormalities in baseline blood results (e.g. CBC, renal and hepatic
             indicators) or ECG readings that would preclude the use of prazosin

          -  Pregnancy, trying to become pregnant or breastfeeding

          -  Presence of metal objects in the body (e.g. some artificial joints, bone pins,
             surgical clips, skull plate, certain part of dental braces) or implanted electronic
             devices (e.g. cardiac pacemaker, neurostimulator), that preclude safe MR scanning

          -  Claustrophobia

          -  Participation in any nuclear medicine procedures that, including the dose received
             during participation in this study, will bring the total radiation dose over the
             currently approved guideline of 20mSv in a 12-month period

          -  Cardiovascular or cerebrovascular diseases
