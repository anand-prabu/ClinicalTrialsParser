Contrary to other\n      treatment approaches, this intervention aims at the individual treatment of problem\n      maintaining and moderating factors of aggressive behaviour. Depending on the individual\n      problem maintaining factors the treatment aims to modify social cognitive information\n      processing, social problem solving and behavioral social skills.\n\n      Methods: The efficacy will be tested in a randomized control group design with n=140\n      children. N=70 children will be treated in the first treatment phase (pre- to\n      post1-assessment) of 16 weekly child-focused sessions with the treatment modules of ScouT.\n      In the second treatment phase (post1- to post2- assessment) those children with sustained\n      severe peer related aggressive behavior receive the comprehensive Treatment Program for\n      Children with Aggressive Behaviour (Therapieprogramm f\u00fcr Kinder mit aggressivem Verhalten,\n      THAV) which is a social competence training which combines patient- and parent-/teacher and\n      peer-focused interventions with 16 child sessions and 6 parent-/teacher sessions. Those\n      children with no severe peer related aggressive behavior receive 2 booster sessions of ScouT\n      within a 16 week period.\n\n      The control group of n=70 children will receive in the first treatment phase (pre- to\n      post1-assessment) an alternative child-focused intervention with a supportive Treatment\n      Programm including techniques to activate resources of the child (Supportive Therapie zur\n      Aktivierung von Ressourcen bei Kindern, STARK) with 16 weekly sessions. In the second\n      treatment phase (post1- to post2- assessment) those children with sustained severe peer\n      related aggressive behavior receive 16 weekly child-focused sessions with the treatment\n      modules of ScouT . Those children with no severe peer related aggressive behavior receive 2\n      booster sessions of STARK within a 16 week period.\n\n      A follow-up assessment is conducted 12 months after post2-assessment. Outcome parameters are\n      aggressive behaviour und comorbid symptoms as well as problem maintaining factors,\n      psychosocial functioning, family burden, self-esteem and treatment satisfaction as rated by\n      clinicians, parents, or teachers. Additionally problem solving is assessed by a newly\n      developed problem-solving test. Moreover, variables of the treatment process are assessed.\n      Additionally treatment process parameters are assessed."
