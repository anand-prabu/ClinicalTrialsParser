Proposed benefits of early, large volume irrigation\n      include removal and softening of crusts, resulting in improved mucociliary clearance.  The\n      potential benefit of early large volume saline irrigation on post-operative day three to\n      ease or reduce the need for early post-operative debridement has not been studied."
