  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is that an adductor canal nerve block (putting numbing medicine
      near the nerve) has been shown to produce excellent pain relief with less pain medication
      use after knee replacement surgery.The investigators will be comparing the amount of pain
      relief following knee replacement surgery when you have a nerve block in place. There will
      be approximately 66 subjects participating in this study. After surgery subjects will
      receive numbing medication every 6 hours for 48 hours. Subjects will also receive a morphine
      PCA (patient  controlled analgesia) after surgery and pain medication by mouth every 4 hours
      around the clock with the option to receive more pain medication if needed. Subjects will
      participate in the study up to 3 days.

    <time_frame>The total amount of opiate pain medication will be recorded at 6 hour intervals for 48 hours after surgery.</time_frame>

    <description>At the end of the 48 hours period the total opiate pain medication taken will be collected and used for comparison as our primary outcome</description>

    <description>Secondary outcome measures will include demographic characteristics, pain scores, medication administration,patient satisfaction with pain control and any complications that may have arisen. We will also record the location of the adductor canal catheter on the final bolus dose.</description>
