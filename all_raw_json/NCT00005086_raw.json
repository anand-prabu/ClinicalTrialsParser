A week later (day 8), both methotrexate and docetaxel will be given the same way, but this will take about 1 hour. The first course of treatment consists of receiving treatment on day 1 and day 8 every 21 days for 9 weeks.  X-rays or scans will then be performed to determine if your tumor is shrinking.  You will then start treatment with gemcitabine and cisplatin.  On the first day (day 1), you will receive both cisplatin and gemcitabine into your vein.  A week later (day 8), you will receive only gemcitabine as an infusion into your vein over 100 minutes and no additional intravenous fluid will be required on that day.  This second course of treatment consists of receiving treatment on day 1 and day 8 every 21 days for 9 weeks."

Patients then receive cisplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1\n      and gemcitabine IV over 100 minutes on days 1 and 8 every 3 weeks for 9 weeks. This 18 week\n      sequential regimen constitutes 1 full course. Treatment continues in the absence of\n      unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.\n\n      Patients are followed until death or until 2 years after study entry, whichever comes first.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-46 patients will be accrued for this study within 9-24\n      months."
