The heparanase enzyme is a promising target for development of new anticancer\n      drugs. HS and the structurally related heparin are present in most animal species. As an\n      analogue of the natural substrate of heparanase HS, heparin is considered to be a potent\n      inhibitor of heparanase. SST0001 is a polymer with a heparin-like structure. It is a\n      reduced oxidized N-acetyl heparin, these modifications  cause the reduction of anticoagulant\n      activity and are strictly related to the anti-heparanase activity. In preclinical murine\n      models SST0001 showed a significant anti myeloma effect in multiple myeloma mice xenograft\n      models, with a significant reduction of subcutaneous growth of different multiple myeloma\n      cell lines, when SST0001 was administered either alone or in combination with dexamethasone.\n      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of escalating doses of\n      SST0001 in the treatment of advanced refractory multiple myeloma."
