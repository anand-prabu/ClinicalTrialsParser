            "textblock": "Nearly all of the 3 million unintended pregnancies in the United States each year result\n      from inconsistent or non-use of contraception. Increasing use of the most effective methods\n      of contraception will reduce unintended pregnancies and their social, medical and economic\n      consequences. The contraceptive etonogestrel implant (ENG implant) is 20 times more\n      effective at pregnancy prevention than oral contraceptive pills, but it has bleeding side\n      effects that make it unappealing for many women. Tamoxifen, a selective estrogen receptor\n      modulator (SERM) used most commonly for adjuvant treatment of breast cancer, has previously\n      been shown to dramatically reduce bleeding in users of an older levonorgestrel-based\n      contraceptive implant (Norplant tm).  It has not been studied in newer progestin-based\n      methods such as the ENG implant.  If tamoxifen could stop bleeding in users of the ENG\n      implant, it would give patients and physicians a valuable option for management of\n      progestin-induced irregular bleeding. This research project will test the effectiveness of\n      tamoxifen taken on an as-needed basis to treat abnormal bleeding in ENG implant users. If\n      tamoxifen can be established as an effective treatment for frequent or prolonged bleeding,\n      it will increase the acceptability of the ENG implant, increase its use and reduce\n      unintended pregnancies. This is the first project to evaluate tamoxifen for treatment of\n      unfavorable bleeding in users of the ENG contraceptive implant."
