The purpose of this research\n      study is to determine the safety and effectiveness of Folfirinox and radiation therapy as\n      treatment for adenocarcinoma (cancer) of the pancreas before surgery. Screening tests will\n      be done to determine if subjects are eligible for participation in this study. If subjects\n      are eligible to participate and agree to participate they will begin chemotherapy. After 3\n      cycles of chemotherapy, subjects will begin chemoradiation. Within 4 to 8 weeks of\n      completing radiation therapy, subjects will have surgery. There will also be post-treatment\n      and follow-up evaluations. Subjects will be followed for every 3 months for 3 years after\n      their initial registration."
