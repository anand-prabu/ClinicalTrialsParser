Another purpose of this study is to\n      determine how the addition of a physical exercise program in individuals with early memory\n      problems may affect memory function or brain imaging and blood-based markers associated with\n      Alzheimer's disease."

The goal of the current study is\n      to determine whether dietary supplementation with a novel formulation of curcumin (a\n      component of the curry spice turmeric), which is better absorbed and more efficiently\n      transported into the brain, can alter biological and clinical markers associated with AD\n      risk, and to determine whether the potential beneficial effects of curcumin supplementation\n      are synergistic with aerobic exercise.  We will recruit 80 elderly participants meeting\n      criteria for MCI.     Over the second 6 months of the study, the curcumin and placebo groups\n      will be further divided into groups receiving training in either aerobic or non-aerobic yoga\n      to determine the synergism between curcumin supplementation and aerobic exercise.  The\n      effectiveness of these interventions will be measured using plasma samples (for expression\n      of Alzheimer-related biomarkers), and neuropsychological, functional, and behavioral\n      assessments (i.e. clinical measures) collected at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months after\n      initiation of treatments, with a subset of participants receiving brain imaging at baseline\n      and 6 months.  A modification was submitted to  titer the study dosage  two weeks prior to\n      study start  (1 capsule BID, first five days, then 2 capsules BID for five days, then 6\n      capsules BID for five days, then 8 capsules BID- study dosage). Over the first 6 months of\n      the study, participants will be randomized into equal groups receiving dietary\n      supplementation with either curcumin or placebo. Over the second 6 months of the study,\n      participants will be further randomized into equal groups receiving dietary supplementation\n      with either curcumin or placebo."
