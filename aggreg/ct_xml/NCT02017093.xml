    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study was to explore the impact of enhancement of the velocity
      component error in the course of reaching movements of the impaired/hemiparetic limb in an
      acute stroke subject. We hypothesized that the method would shift velocity profiles toward
      the optimal, resulting in a reduction in error. A prototype robot. This robotic device
      system has a two-dimensional motor, basic measurement capacities, and a robotic arm which is
      engaged to the subject's upper-limb in a sitting position.

      The enhancement of the velocity component error would shift velocity profiles toward the
      optimal, resulting in a reduction in error.

    <textblock>
      The wrist of the subject is connected to the robotic arm by a strip which supports the arm
      but allows free movements of the wrist. This configuration allows subjects with impaired
      grasping ability to use the system. A bio-feedback system enables the subject to perform
      various functional motor tasks that are presented on the screen in front of him. The
      system's sensors detect motor errors or deviations from an optimal/proper movement
      trajectory or velocity profile. Any deviation in direction, velocity, acceleration or
      necessary force from the optimal trajectory results in applied robotic forces that enhance
      such errors/deviations. The sensors and the applied forces all work and compute in real
      time, so that the force measurements and the applied force are updated to the executed
      movement.

    <description>In order to calculate the error enhancement, it is necessary to establish the optimal velocity profile. To do so we constructed optimal velocity profiles based on the average reports of six healthy people (aged 40-68) who had been directed to repeatedly perform the task. Ee selected three optimal profiles, which were ultimately plotted as 'Velocity vs. Time' and 'Velocity vs. Distance' diagrams.</description>

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Determine the error enhancement functions around the average value of the error. These functions fall into three ranges. The first is the free band range, the segment of error which starts at zero and ends at a value that determines the extent of the error. For anything below that value, no force should be applied on the subject.</description>

    <description>Error Enhancement of the Velocity Component: The subjects were seated on comfortable chairs, individually adjusted, and connected to a manipulandum of deXtreme's prototype robot. We situated the chair so that the computer monitor could be clearly observed by the subject. Each subject's affected extremity was harnessed to a handle connected to a robotic arm accompanying the movement. All subjects performed the reaching task with their affected arm.</description>
