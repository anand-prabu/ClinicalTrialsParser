Patients are randomized to receive either placebo or recombinant human growth\n      hormone subcutaneously every other day for 6 months. At the end of this 6 month period,\n      patients undergo a 4 week washout period. After the washout period, patients are\n      crossed-over to the alternate regimen for an additional 6 months followed by another 4 week\n      washout period."
