In addition to that, an\n      18F-EF5 PET/CT scan will be performed on a separate day. The patients receive intravenous\n      injection of 250-350 MBq of [18F]EF5. After that, a venous blood sample will be obtained for\n      measurement of plasma radioactivity. A low-dose CT (helical) will be performed for\n      attenuation correction and anatomical reference. After that, a PET scan will be performed\n      (starting at 3 h after injection). The second 18F-EF5 scan will be performed in a similar\n      way 4-7 days after the first scan. A representative histologic sample of primary tumor is\n      pre-condition for study and an effort is made to store part of fresh histologic material in\n      liquid nitrogen for later use in immunohistochemical analysis.\n\n      Patients are scheduled to undergo preoperative or definitive chemoradiotherapy using current\n      clinical standards after completion of the current protocol. Follow-up information\n      (event-free survival and overall survival) will be gathered."
