Stem Alive\u00ae include ingredients like green tea, ashwagandha, etc which are\n      known to be used as traditional medicine.  They are also tested qualitatively in academic\n      and nutritional science research centers throughout the world and which substantially\n      according to those studies stimulate the augmented availability of circulating hematopoietic\n      cells. This study is projected to investigate the mobilization of stem cells on healthy\n      human volunteers."
