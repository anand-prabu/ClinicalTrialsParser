For the control group invvestigators enrolled ten\n      healthy  age- and sex-matched volunteers (healthy knee group, HKG, n=19 ).The study\n      parameters, Bisect Offset (BSO), Lateral Patellar Displacement (LPD), Patellar Tilt Angle\n      (PTA), Sulcus Angle and Insall-Salvati ratio at 0, 10, 20 and 30 degrees of\n      flexion-extension, were measured for the AKG patients (n=29), and UAKG patients (n=26) and\n      the HKG  subjects (n=19). Results:  In a comparison between the AKG patients and the HKG\n      subjects there was a significant difference in the BSO-ratio, LPD-test and PTA-test. In\n      these parameters the difference between the AKG patients and the HKG subjects progressively\n      increased towards the full extension of the knee. In the AKG and UAKG patients BSO-ratio at\n      0 degree ranged between 0.5 and 1.2 in both groups, whereas the BSO-ratio in the HKG\n      subjects ranged between 0.33 and 0.75 (P < .001). At the zero degree the LPD-test ranged\n      between 0 and 10 mm in the AKG patients and between 0 and 35 mm in the UAKG patients,\n      whereas the lateral displacement-test ranged between 0 and 5 mm in the HKG subjects (P =\n      .003). Patellar tilt angle-test ranged between -30 and 20 degrees in the AKG patients and\n      between -30 and 24 degrees in the UAKG patients and  in the HKG subjects the PTA-test ranged\n      between 10 and 24 degrees (P < .001).Conclusion: The KINE-MRI could be a feasible method for\n      the evaluation of patellar tracking in adolescents."
