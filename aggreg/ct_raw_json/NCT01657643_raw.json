HRQL is a subjective measure, defined as the aspects of\n      quality of life (i.e., one's satisfaction with their life) that related specifically to a\n      person's health (for example, ability to carry out normal daily activities). The\n      investigators hypothesize that HRQL during URIs will be significantly higher in the\n      probiotic groups compared to the placebo group.  The proposed study will also seek to\n      address the following secondary objectives: missed school and work days due to a upper\n      respiratory infection."
