  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a multicenter, open-label, uncontrolled, multiple ascending dose (MAD) study
      to evaluate mainly the safety and tolerability of 12-week repeated intravenous
      administration of E6011. A total of 18 subjects will be randomized into three cohorts (2, 5,
      and 10 mg/kg). Six subjects per cohort will receive repeated intravenous administration of
      E6011.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study consists of Screening Phase, Observation Phase, Treatment Phase, Extension Phase,
      and Follow-up Phase. Screening assessments will be performed between 42 to 2 days before
      study drug administration. Observation Phase assessments will be performed a day before or
      on a day of the initial administration to confirm the eligibility of subjects. The eligible
      subjects will receive the repeated intravenous administration of E6011.  E6011 will be
      dissolved in physiological saline (nearly 100 mL) for approximately 30-minute infusion. A
      total of 7 intravenous infusions will be implemented from Weeks 0, 1, 2 and every 2 weeks up
      to Week 10 in the Treatment Phase. Under no safety concerns, a decline from the Observation
      Phase in Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) is greater than or equal to 70 and a subject
      intends to continue administrations, the subject will receive a total of 20 subsequent
      biweekly administrations (40 weeks) at stable dose (Extension Phase).  Subjects will be
      hospitalized for 24 hours after the initial and second administrations for postdose
      monitoring and will have out-patient monitoring until 12 weeks after the initial
      administration. Subjects who roll over onto the Extension Phase will have continued
      monitoring until 52 weeks after the initial administration. When the subjects complete (Week
      12 or Week 52) or discontinue the study, they will undergo an on-site follow-up 28 days
      after the study completion or discontinuation and an off-site follow-up or telephone
      interview 70 days after the final administration.   The investigator will conduct full
      assessments of subjects' safety next day of the second administration (24 hours after the
      second administration) to confirm presence of absence of study-related manifestations which
      may affect the study drug administration of next cohort. When the sponsor is informed of
      investigator's judgment on the sixth subject in each cohort, the appropriateness of next
      cohort will be judged based on the safety data available including the judgment of
      individual investigator on the next day of the second administration.
