Subjects will be candidates for definitive\n      therapy.\n\n      Subjects will receive up to four (4) TRUS-guided intratumoral treatments with\n      Ad5-SGE-REIC/Dkk-3 into the prostate approximately 6-weeks apart.  Each treatment cycle will\n      be performed using three track injections through the prostrate using 1 mL each injection (3\n      mL total) with focus on the most dense areas of cancer based on biopsy mapping.\n\n      Subjects will be considered a success if they experience a 50% drop in PSA or a 1 point drop\n      in the Gleason score after 24 weeks. Subjects who are progressing at any time after the\n      second injection of Ad5-SGE-REIC/Dkk-3 will be discontinued and will be treated according to\n      standard medical practice."

Subjects should have adequate bone marrow function defined as an absolute peripheral\n             granulocyte count \u2265 1,500 and platelet count of \u2265 100,000, adequate hepatic function\n             with a bilirubin \u2264 1.5 mg/dl and SGPT < 4x the upper limits of normal, adequate renal\n             function defined as serum creatinine \u2264 2.0 mg/dl\n\n          6. Subjects must have a coagulation profile (PT, PTT) not more than 2-times the upper\n             limit of normal and no history of substantial non-iatrogenic bleeding diatheses. Use\n             of anticoagulants is limited to local use only (for control of central line patency).\n\n          7. Subject is willing to refrain from sexual activity or agrees to use a barrier\n             contraceptive device (e.g. condom) for 8-weeks after treatment with\n             Ad5-SGE-REIC/Dkk-3.\n\n          8. Subjects must sign an informed consent indicating that they are aware of the\n             investigational nature of the study.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n        Subjects meeting any of the following criteria will be excluded:\n\n          1. Hormonal treatment, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, immunotherapy or other\n             investigational study drug within the past 4 weeks.\n\n          2. Unable to tolerate transrectal ultrasound.\n\n          3. Subjects with uncontrolled cardiac, hepatic, renal or neurologic/psychiatric\n             disorders, that in the opinion of the investigator put the subject at significant\n             risk, are not eligible.\n\n          4.
