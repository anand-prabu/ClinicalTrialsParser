DLBS1033 possesses 8 major\n      proteins with molecular weight below 100 kDa, so its named as Lumbricus Low Molecular weight\n      Proteins (LLP). This enzyme can be transported to the bloodstream via intestinal epitel. As\n      a drug that consists of serin protease enzyme, suspected that the mechanism of action of\n      lumbrokinase, especially as fibrinolytic and antithrombotic. One study of DLBS1033 concluded\n      that plasmin-antiplasmin (PAP) complex is a sensitive parameter for evaluating fibrinolytic\n      effect of this drug. But, until now there is no clinical study that evaluate pharmacokinetic\n      of this drug. As a pilot study, the aim of this study is to evaluate biological half life of\n      DLBS1033."
