These results will be compared to patients who underwent the same procedure\n      during the study period and received the same standardized pain control regimen excluding\n      gabapentin. Effects on pain level, opioid use, satisfaction and narcotic use after discharge\n      from the hospital will be measured. Opioid side effects including nausea, sedation and\n      urinary retention (inability to empty one's bladder) will also be recorded.The null\n      hypotheses are as follows:\n\n        1. There is no significant difference in pain control when adding gabapentin to a\n           multimodal pain management protocol in pediatric post-operative posterior spinal fusion\n           patients.\n\n        2. There is no significant difference in the amount of opiate medication required for pain\n           control in pediatric post-operative posterior spinal fusion patients."
