      In order to minimize mechanical stress the investigators propose to implement EVLP procedure
      with a ventilation monitoring guided by the analysis of the Paw-t shape.

      Increase of interest about technique of Ex-Vivo Lung Perfusion (EVLP) has highlighted the
      need of new approaches to respiratory mechanics monitoring to prevent lung stress in
      atypical physiological settings.

      Airway pressure/time curve (Paw-t) shape analysis at constant flow ventilation (Stress
      Index, SI) is thought to be predictor of lung stress; so the SI coefficient may therefore
      identify and quantify mechanical stress during ventilation. (1) In experimental studies, the
      threshold values for SI that best discriminated lungs with signs of Ventilator Induced Lung
      Injury ranged between 0.9 and 1.1. (2) During EVLP, the isolated lungs are free from the
      effect of chest wall impairment and represent the effective response of lung parenchyma to
      ventilatory setting.

      Use of SI monitoring in isolated and perfuse lung reconditioning, may be an useful tool to
      prevent hyperinflation and opening-closing conditions by titrating optimal protective
      ventilation As previously reported by our group, in the first trial of lung reconditioning,
      signs of mechanical stress were detected with Paw-t curve. (3) Therefore we implemented EVLP
      procedure with continuous stress index analysis to detect and quantify the occurrence of
      hyperinflation or opening closing condition.

    <description>Stress index is the exponential coefficient of the equation describing the shape of the airway opening pressure vs time (Paw-t) curve during constant flow. This approach is based on the observation that, at constant flow the rate of change of the Paw-t curve corresponds to the rate of change of the compliance of the respiratory system during tidal inflation. A progressive increase in slope (i.e. a downward concavity of the curve) indicates that compliance is progressively increasing with tidal inflation (tidal recruitment). A progressive decrease in slope (i.e. a upward convexity of the curve) indicates that compliance is decreasing with tidal inflation (tidal hyperinflation). Clinical and experimental data show that presence of Stress Index values indicating mechanical stress are associated to morphological, histological and inflammatory evidence of ventilator induce lung injury.</description>
