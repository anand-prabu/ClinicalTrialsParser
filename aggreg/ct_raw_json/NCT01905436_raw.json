            "textblock": "Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is a deforming and disabling infectious disease that causes\n      elephantiasis and genital deformity (especially hydroceles). The infection affects some 120\n      million people in 81 countries in tropical and subtropical regions with well over 1 billion\n      people at risk of acquiring the disease [1]. LF is caused by Wuchereria bancrofti and Brugia\n      spp. (B. malayi and B.timori), nematode parasites that are transmitted by mosquitoes. This\n      study is based on the assumption that currently used MDA regimens and schedules are not\n      optimal for achieving elimination of LF. These regimens (either annual Albendazole (Alb) 400\n      mg plus diethylcarbamazine 6 mg/kg or Alb 400 mg plus Ivermectin (Iver) 200 \u00b5g/kg for LF)\n      were introduced more than 10 years ago.\n\n      Onchocerciasis (\"Oncho\") is similar in some ways to LF in that it is a vector-borne nematode\n      parasitic disease that causes severe disability. In contrast to LF, this disease causes\n      blindness and severe skin disease rather than elephantiasis, and it is spread by black flies\n      instead of mosquitoes. O. volvulus adult worms live in subcutaneous nodules while the adult\n      worms of the LF parasites live in lymphatic vessels. O. volvulus adult worms are larger and\n      less sensitive to available drug treatments than those of the species that cause LF and have\n      a longer lifespan (approximately 14 years rather than the estimated 7 years for LF\n      parasites). More effective drugs or dosing schedules for MDA against Oncho could shorten the\n      number of years needed to interrupt Oncho transmission in areas that previously had high\n      disease rates.\n\n      Drugs used for LF MDA are also active against soil transmitted helminth infections (STH,\n      e.g., Ascaris, Hookworm, and Trichuris). De-worming campaigns using anthelmintics usually\n      target special groups of the population, such as schoolchildren, and have limited impact on\n      transmission. Treatment of the total population and semiannual treatments may reduce\n      re-infection considerably and will most likely lead to reduced infection densities and\n      infection prevalence rates. Suppression of STH is an important ancillary benefit of MDA\n      programs for filarial infections. Increasingly control programs for filariasis and STH are\n      being integrated with programs for other parasitic diseases such as schistosomiasis. For\n      this reason, participants will also be tested for schistosomiasis.\n\n      Purpose: The study aims to compare the effectiveness once yearly (1X) versus twice yearly\n      (2X) mass drug administration (MDA) for the elimination of lymphatic filariasis,\n      onchocerciasis and for control of soil-transmitted helminth infections (intestinal\n      parasites) in large populations. Mass drug administration will be provided by the Liberian\n      Ministry of Health. This project will assess the impact of the government's public health\n      program.\n\n      Procedures: Study procedures include collection of finger prick blood that will be tested\n      for microfilariae by microscopy and for serology testing (antigenemia and antibody testing).\n      Skin snips will be collected and examined by microscopy for the presence of Onchocerca\n      microfilariae. Stool samples will be collected for detection of parasitic worm eggs by\n      microscopy. All assays will be performed in Liberia (filarial serology tests, microfilaria\n      testing, stool examinations).\n\n      Washington University researchers developed the protocol, will provide training and guidance\n      to Liberian researchers, and work with them to analyze the data. Liberian researchers will\n      consent the participants, obtain blood, skin and stool specimens, perform laboratory tests\n      on the specimens, and enter data on participants and lab results."
