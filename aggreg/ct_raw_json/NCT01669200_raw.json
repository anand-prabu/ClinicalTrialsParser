In addition, subjects will\n      complete a medical history questionnaire, and receive group instruction on incorporation of\n      the study products into the diet from a registered dietitian. Study products will be\n      dispensed at each visit in excess of requirements, and re-issued at every visit after\n      measurement of the remaining product that subjects will be instructed to bring to every\n      visit. The post-baseline study visits will include body weight and vital sign measurements,\n      concomitant medications, dispensation of study products, group instruction by a registered\n      dietitian, and an assessment for adverse events.\n\n      Between study visits the subjects will receive a telephone call from the study coordinator\n      to encourage compliance with the diet, and to ask about any adverse events. The study visits\n      will conclude at week 24.  The psychological tests conducted by clinicians at screening will\n      be repeated during the cognitive testing visit."
