Blood will be taken\n      the day of vaccination and 4 weeks after.\n\n      PBMC isolation The PBMCs will bere isolated from heparinized venous blood by density\n      gradient centrifugation on Lymphoprep (Axis-Shield, Oslo, Norway) immediately after blood\n      was drawn. The cells will be counted and suspended in RPMI 1640 supplemented with\n      heat-inactivated 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin 100U/ml, streptomycin 0.1 mg/ml, and 2 mM\n      L-glutamine (Biological Industries, Israel).\n\n      IFN-gamma secretion from PBMCs IFN-gamma secretion levels will be measured by ELISA in the\n      supernatants of PBMCs that will be stimulated with either an influenza antigen mixture or\n      with SEB, or left untreated.\n\n      Granzyme B activity assay The PBMCs will be  cultured at 0.5 ml/well in 48-well plates\n      (1.8X106 cells/well) and stimulated with an influenza antigen mix and SEB as described\n      above. The cells will be lysed in lysis buffer (150mM NaCl, 15mM Tris, 1% Triton x100), then\n      stored at\n\n      -760C. Granzyme B activity will be measured according to the protocol described by Gijzen et\n      al. [13]. Briefly, frozen cell lysates will be subjected to three freeze/thaw cycles to\n      enable the release of Granzyme B. Recombinant Granzyme B standards (Enzo Life Sciences\n      International, Inc., PA) and cell lysates will be  added in duplicate to a 96-well plate (20\n      \u00b5l/well). The reaction will start upon the addition of 80 \u03bcl of substrate solution\n      containing 400 \u03bcM of Ac-IEPD-pNA substrate (Calbiochem, Darmstadt, Germany) in assay buffer\n      (100mM HEPES pH 7.5, 10% (w/v), sucrose, 0.1% (w/v) CHAPS, and 10 mM DTT (Sigma Aldrich,\n      Rehovot, Israel). The plate will be sealed, covered and incubated in a dark humidified\n      chamber at 370C for 20 h. After incubation, the plate will be read at 405 nm. Granzyme B\n      units will be calculated using a 4th order polynominal curve with a log (concentration)\u2212log\n      (absorbance) plot, and corrected for protein concentrations by the BCA protein assay (Thermo\n      Scientific, IL).\n\n      The humoral response The antibody response will be measured by the HI test according to a\n      standard WHO procedure as previously described [14]. The titer of an antiserum not showing\n      any inhibition will be recorded as 1/10. Humoral response is defined as either a fourfold or\n      greater rise in the titer of HI antibodies, or a rise from a non-protective baseline level\n      (<1/40) to 1/40). Geometric mean titers of antibodies wull be calculated to assess the\n      immunity of the whole group."
