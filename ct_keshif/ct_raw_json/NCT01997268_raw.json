SC401B capsules also contain certain\n      surfactants that may aid in the absorption of EPA and DHA.  Based on the results of\n      pharmacokinetic studies of healthy human subjects, unlike Lovaza\u00ae, EPA and DHA in SC401B are\n      bioavailable in both the fasted and fed states.\n\n      The protocol specified primary endpoint is the difference from the placebo group in the\n      percent change in TG concentration from baseline to week 12 for groups receiving 2, 4, or 6\n      capsules of SC401B per day.  The protocol specified secondary endpoints include percent\n      changes from baseline to week 12 for total cholesterol (TC), LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C),\n      HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C), and non-HDL-cholesterol (non-HDL-C).  Additional exploratory\n      variables include VLDL-cholesterol (VLDL-C), LDL-cholesterol particle size, apolipoprotein\n      (Apo) A1, Apo B, Apo C-III, and lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2).\n\n      An additional objective is to determine the tolerability and safety of SC401B 2, 4 and 6\n      capsules per day for 12 weeks. Adverse events for SC401B and placebo including burping,\n      fishy taste, upset stomach, loose stools, stools with fishy smell or any other self-reported\n      observations will be evaluated.  Additional safety measures will include changes in liver\n      enzymes (AST/ALT) occurring from baseline to week 12 for groups receiving 2, 4, and 6\n      capsules of SC401B and placebo."
