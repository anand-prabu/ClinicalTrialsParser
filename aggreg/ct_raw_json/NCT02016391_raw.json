            "textblock": "Although radiofrequency ablation (RF) is accepted as the best therapeutic choice for\n      patients with early stage hepatocellular carcinoma when liver transplantation or surgical\n      resection are not suitable options, it is still performed only in a few hospitals and\n      experience is so far limited (Goldberg & Ahmed, 2002; Shiina et al., 2005). In addition, RF\n      ablation is emerging as a viable alternative to surgery for inoperable patients with limited\n      hepatic metastatic disease, especially from colorectal cancer. Although radiofrequency\n      ablation has been accepted as a safe and effective treatment for liver and kidney tumours,\n      there are few studies addressing periprocedural pain.\n\n      Thus, the optimal anaesthetic procedure is still to be determined. Currently at our\n      institution RF is performed as monitored sedation procedure using remifentanil infusion\n      supplemented with midazolam boluses, when considered necessary. However, when using\n      remifentanil and midazolam combination it is quite difficult to avoid too deep respiratory\n      depression.\n\n      Dexmedetomidine is an \u03b12-adrenoreceptor agonist with sedative, analgesic and anxiolytic\n      effects, and it has more selective \u03b12-adrenergic effect than clonidine. Dexmedetomidine has\n      a great deal of potential in this arena given its analgesic and anxiolytic properties while\n      preserving respiratory drive (Bergese SD et al., 2010).\n\n      All patients will receive dexmedetomidine 0.4 \u00b5g/kg/hr infusion from the start of procedure.\n      The infusion will be continued during the whole RF procedure.\n\n      At the same time all patients will receive remifentanil infusion according to TCI (target\n      controlled infusion) protocol. Plasma concentration target will be set from 0.5 ng/ml and,\n      if necessary, will be increased to achieve a comfortable state of patient (Ramsey Sedation\n      Scale: 2-3)."
