            "textblock": "Cough is a defensive behavior that involves three stages.  A large inspiratory phase, a\n      compression phase where the vocal folds close and subglottal pressure is developed, and an\n      expiratory phase.  Cough serves to protect the upper and lower airways from material such as\n      liquids, solids, or saliva, that have been aspirated.  There are two types of cough:\n      voluntary and reflex cough.  Voluntary cough involves a cough to command.  Reflex cough is a\n      cough that is generated secondary to a stimulus in or near the airway.  There has been some\n      research regarding the differences between voluntary and reflex cough.  However, no research\n      has described the differences in airflow or movement pattern (kinematics) between the two\n      types of cough.  This study seeks to determine the respiratory kinematics and airflow\n      differences between voluntary and reflex cough in healthy participants."

Then, tests of your\n      breathing made from pulmonary function testing will be completed.\n\n      Investigators will then have you complete a maximum inspiration followed by a maximum\n      expiration three times.\n\n      Investigators will ask you to produce a voluntary cough three times into a facemask which is\n      attached to a computer.\n\n      Then the investigators will provide you with nebulized water (FOG) through the facemask for\n      up to a minute three times.  You will have a minute break in between each presentation.\n\n      Finally, the investigators will provide you with a nebulized dose of Capsaicin, which is\n      derived from hot peppers, through the same facemask used in all of the above tasks.
