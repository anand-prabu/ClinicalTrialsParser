In the phase II, 42 patients will be enrolled.\n\n      Vemurafenib 960 mg b.i.d. + Peg-interferon 1/2/3 micrograms/Kg one time per week (until MTD\n      reached) Interferon treatment should start after 15 days of Vemurafenib only. In the Phase I\n      groups of 3 patients will be entered at each dose level (vemurafenib 960 mg b.i.d. +\n      Peg-interferon 1/2/3 micrograms/Kg). If all 3 patients treated at a dose level have been\n      observed for 2 courses of therapy without DLT, then the dose will be escalated.\n\n      If at least 2/3 patients have DLT, then the previous dose level will be considered as the\n      MTD. If 1/3 patients have DLT, then 3 more patients will be treated at this dose level. If\n      none of these patients has DLT, then the dose will be escalated. If at least one of the 3\n      additional patients has DLT, then the previous dose will be considered as MTD.\n\n      This phase II is aimed:\n\n      - to verify if the combination Vemurafenib plus PEG-interferon in advanced melanoma patients\n      harboring the V600BRAF mutation is more active than the standard therapy (Vemurafenib) as\n      reported in literature.\n\n      Therefore, the lowest response probability of interest at 32 weeks is set to .40, and the\n      combination treatment will be developed further only if the response at that time is at\n      least .60.\n\n      - to verify the upregulation of IFNAR1 expression in patients treated with the combination\n      Vemurafenib plus PEG-interferon Therefore, the lowest expression probability of interest at\n      7 days is set to .10, and the combination treatment will be developed further only if the\n      expression is at least .90.\n\n      Taking in account a 10% drop-out rate, a total of 48 patients will be enrolled to ensure a\n      minimum of 42 evaluable patients."
