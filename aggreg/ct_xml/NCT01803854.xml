      The project will integrate epidemiological, survey, clinical, and environmental exposure
      data of the Gulf War era cohort.  Blood specimens will be used to establish the
      biorepository. The goal is to enable the availability of blood specimens and the research
      database for a wide range of future genomic and genetic studies, biologic and immunologic
      research, and epidemiological, clinical, and health services research. This pilot project
      represents the initial implementation of the cohort and biorepository. During the pilot, the
      recruitment response rate and other operational and logistical aspects will be assessed to
      provide support for the full-scale study.

    <textblock>
      In the 20 years since the Gulf War (1990-1991) began, there have been reports of Gulf War
      veterans' illnesses (GWVI). These illnesses are characterized by persistent symptoms such as
      chronic headache, chronic widespread pain, cognitive difficulties, unexplained debilitating
      fatigue, gastrointestinal problems, respiratory symptoms, subtle neuropsychological
      symptoms, and other abnormalities that are not explained by familiar medical or psychiatric
      diagnoses. To date, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), the Department of Defense
      (DoD), and the Department of Health and Human Services have funded over 360 research
      projects pertaining to the health consequences of military service in the 1990-1991 Gulf
      War. This past research represents a tremendous investment into understanding the medical
      conditions of these veterans. However, many important questions remain to be answered as to
      why Gulf War veterans are ill and suffer adverse effects on their daily lives. In addition,
      the Gulf War veteran population is entering the age range at which the incidence of chronic
      diseases increases rapidly, and other questions regarding the health and medical care of
      this important cohort will be raised in the next few years. For these reasons, we plan to
      create a cohort of Gulf War era veterans and a biorepository to be made available for future
      research studies.

      The large-scale longitudinal research database will integrate epidemiological, survey,
      clinical, and environmental exposure data of the Gulf War era cohort.  Blood specimens will
      be used to establish the biorepository. Our goal is to enable the availability of blood
      specimens and the research database for a wide range of future genomic and genetic studies,
      biologic and immunologic research, and epidemiological, clinical, and health services
      research. This pilot project represents the initial implementation of the cohort and
      biorepository. During the pilot, the recruitment response rate and other operational and
      logistical aspects will be assessed to provide support for the full-scale project.  In our
      pilot project, we will contact 10,000 Veterans for enrollment. These will include those who
      receive health care in the VA and those who receive their health care outside of the VA
      system.

      Veterans of the Gulf War era will be identified largely through existing VA and Department
      of Defense registries and databases. A veteran will be eligible if s/he served in the
      military in 1990-91 without regard to actual deployment.  Initially, the Gulf War Era
      Research Database will be populated with data collected from the Gulf War Era Veterans'
      Survey.  This survey is specific to those who served during the Gulf War Era. The survey
      will be supplemented by data collected from national VA and non-VA resources and from other
      studies of Gulf War era veterans.

      The longitudinal cohort database and biorepository will be used to enhance ongoing research,
      facilitate new research on GWVI, and study other chronic diseases that now or will affect
      veterans of the Gulf War Era. This combined resource will provide valuable tools to examine
      the prevalence and correlates of GWVI and other chronic diseases, and to target programs to
      meet the health care needs of Gulf War era veterans.

      Specific Aims - This is a minimal risk observational pilot project to test the processes
      needed to establish a research cohort and biorepository of Gulf War era veterans to be used
      for future research studies.  There are no research questions or hypotheses.  The pilot
      project has two specific aims:

        1. assess the feasibility and efficacy of the planned recruitment, consenting, and blood
           drawing and shipping processes, and of modifications to the processes (if necessary);
           and

        2. develop, test, and implement the database structures required for subject enrollment
           tracking, blood sample tracking, and data storage.

      Importance -There has been substantial research into the health care needs of Gulf War era
      veterans, but the incidence of chronic diseases that should be expected as this population
      ages is uncertain. The etiology and treatment of Gulf War Veterans' illnesses, affecting
      approximately one-fourth of those deployed to the Gulf War, remains unknown. Furthermore,
      the relationships between exposures, genetic susceptibility, and these illnesses have not
      been explored comprehensively in a large cohort. Data from the cohort described in this
      protocol includes both survey and blood-based biomarkers, such as genetic markers,  which
      will provide valuable resources for identifying risk factors and potential treatment
      pathways for Gulf War related illnesses as well as other chronic and aging related diseases.
      These data can then be used to identify the current and future health care needs of Gulf War
      era veterans to more effectively target programs towards them.

      The intended users of the Gulf War Era Research Database and blood specimens are researchers
      who are specifically interested in illnesses affecting Gulf War era veterans, and
      researchers interested in the physical and mental health concerns that affect a population
      of this age group. The availability of a research cohort with the particular demographics
      and the documented experiences of Gulf War era service will enable more detailed analyses
      regarding diagnosis and treatment of conditions affecting an aging population than is
      possible with administrative databases alone. With insights that analyses of data and blood
      specimens will provide, the VA will be better able to focus interventions that will improve
      diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes of care.
