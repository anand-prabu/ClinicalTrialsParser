            "textblock": "This is a clinical trial for subjects with hematologic malignancies ( acute myelogenous\n      leukemia, acute lymphocytic leukemia, Hodgkin's or Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, or\n      myelodysplastic syndrome) who are in need of a donor stem cell transplant, and for whom an\n      umbilical cord blood transplant is thought to be the best option. For allogeneic transplant\n      donors, we  typically try to use related family members, such as brothers or sisters, or\n      volunteer donors  who are 'HLA matched', i.e. share similar proteins on their cells. This\n      study is for subjects for whom such a matched sibling donor or a matched unrelated donor is\n      not available.\n\n      This study tests a new method of bone marrow transplantation called combined haplo-identical\n      cord (haplo-cord) transplantation. In this procedure, cells from a related donor who shares\n      half of the HLA proteins ( haplo-identical)are collected from the blood, as well as cells\n      from an umbilical cord, and then both are transplanted. It is hoped that by using cells from\n      a haplo-identical relative, subjects will have a faster recovery and require fewer\n      transfusions. Over time the haplo-identical cells from the relative are replaced by the\n      cells from the cord blood. The combined transplantation of haplo-identical stem cells and\n      cord blood has previously been used in approximately 60 subjects with very encouraging\n      results.\n\n      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of haplo-cord transplant (\n      \"investigational\" arm) with the more commonly used procedure in which only the cells\n      contained in one or two umbilical cords are infused (\"standard\" arm). Subjects will be\n      randomly assigned into either the haplo-cord group or the umbilical cord group.\n\n      If randomized to the haplo-cord group, a family member will undergo a stem cell collection.\n      In both arms, subjects will receive a \"conditioning regimen\" prior to transplantation. The\n      conditioning regimen consists of chemotherapy, which is meant to destroy the cancer cells\n      and suppress the immune system to allow the transplanted cells to grow. Subjects will remain\n      in the hospital until the stem cells are fully recovered, which is usually 4 to 6 weeks\n      after the transplant. Subjects will have bone marrow aspiration and biopsy at 3 weeks, 4\n      weeks, 2 months, 6 months and 1 year after the transplant and then yearly thereafter.\n      Participation in the study will continue for up to 5 years after transplantation."
