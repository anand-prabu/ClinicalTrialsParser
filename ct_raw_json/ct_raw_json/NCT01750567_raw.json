More recently metformin has been shown to act against carcinomas by two\n      mechanisms: 1) an indirect, insulin\u2010dependent mechanism which sensitizes tissues to insulin,\n      inhibits hepatic gluconeogenesis, and stimulates uptake of glucose in muscle, thereby\n      reducing fasting blood glucose and circulating levels of insulin, lowering the pro survival\n      activity of the insulin/INSR axis, and 2) a direct, insulin\u2010independent mechanism which\n      activates the AMP\u2010activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway and leads to inhibition of the\n      mTOR pathway. Given the investigators preliminary published data on insulin and mTOR\n      inhibition[1] metformin is an attractive candidate for a pilot clinical trial in CLL\n      patients."
