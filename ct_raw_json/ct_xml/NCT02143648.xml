    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of the study to evaluate the effects of two doses of nalbuphine HCl
      ER tablets on the change from baseline in the worst itch Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) in
      hemodialysis patients with moderate to severe uremic pruritus and to evaluate the safety and
      tolerability in the study population.
