  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We propose a prospective multicenter study, whose originality lies in the inclusion of the
      naive child and adolescent population. Its purpose is to evaluate the incidence of adverse
      events related to the use of l antipsychotic drugs in children and adolescents with no
      history of taking such drugs.

      The inclusion criteria will be: (1) male or female inpatients, (2) aged from 13 to 18 years,
      (3) requiring antipsychotic treatment, (4) receiving antipsychotic drug for less than 15
      days without taking antipsychotic before or with a history of antipsychotic over a maximum
      period of three consecutive months and discontinued for at least 6 months.

      Therapeutic monitoring during the 12 month study period will include clinical assessments
      and laboratory testing. These assessments will be performed before treatment (at inclusion),
      and at 1, 3, 6, 9, 12 months after the introduction of the antipsychotic drug.

    <description>Clinical Assessment A: General assessment of adverse events by the Pediatric Adverse Event Rating Scale (PAERS-Clinician) (March et al, 2007). Performed at each visit.
B: Somatic parameters to be monitored: weight, size, body mass index (BMI), abdominal perimeter, blood pressure, temperature. Performed at each visit.
C: Electrocardiographic assessment of QT interval D: Neuromuscular adverse events: Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) (Guy, 1976a), Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS) (Barnes, 1989),  Simpson Angus Scale (SAS) (Simpson and Angus, 1970), Bush Francis Catatonia Rating Scale (BFCRS) (Bush and al, 1996),
Laboratory assessments. The following laboratory tests will be obtained on each visit: complete blood count, liver enzymes, creatine phosphokinase, glycemia, cholesterol (total, light, and heavy), triglycerides, CRPus, prolactin, insulin, HOMA, HbA1C, vitamin D.</description>

    <description>Tanner score of puberty at inclusion: population will be divided into three groups: prepubertal (stage ≤ 1); currently in puberty (stages 2 to 4) and puberty adult (stage 5).
Drug history: age at initiation of treatment, the first-line atypical antipsychotic drug, other treatment(s), age of onset of disorder for which the prescription of an atypical antipsychotic drug was indicated.
The diagnosis is made using the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School Age Children (Kiddie-SADS) (Kaufman and al, 1997).</description>

    <description>Study:
We propose a prospective, interventional multicenter study.
Method:
Both in and out patients may be included in the study Patients will be recruited over a period of 24 months. They will be followed up for 12 months. Each patient will receive one year of therapeutic monitoring after the introduction of the  antipsychotic drug.
The therapeutic monitoring will include clinical, electrocardiographical, and laboratory assessments. These assessments are performed at baseline (before prescribing treatment) and at 1 month (M1), at 3 months (M3), 6 months (M6), 9 months (M9), and at 12 months (M12) after the first prescription of the antipsychotic drug.</description>
