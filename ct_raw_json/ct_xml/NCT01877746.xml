    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to compare the effect of combined immunosuppressive therapy given
      on the top standard medical therapy of chronic heart failure according to current guidelines
      with standard medical therapy of chronic heart failure alone in patients with infammatory
      cardiomyopathy (ICM).

      Suitable subjects are characterized by EMB established presence of myocardial inflammation /
      negative polymerase chain reaction assay (PCR) findings of cardiotropic infectious agents
      and with varying duration of heart failure symptoms and left ventricular (LV) systolic
      dysfunction (phase A).

      Further, to compare the effect of two regimens of combined immunosuppressive therapy in
      these patients with ICM (phase B).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Males and females aged 18 to 65 years at the time of signing the informed consent

          2. Signing of the informed consent.

          3. LV systolic dysfunction defined by ejection fraction less than/or equal 40% as
             assessed by echocardiography and symptoms of  heart failure (minimum NYHA class II)
             lasting for at least 2 weeks at the time of randomization. This criterion also
             determines the inclusion of the study subjects in one of two substudies (CZECH-ICIT 1
             or CZECH-ICIT 2).

               -  LV systolic dysfunction (defined by ejection fraction less than/or equal 40%)
                  and symptoms of  heart failure (minimum NYHA class II) lasting 2 weeks to 6
                  months, with standard medical therapy of chronic heart failure given for at
                  least 2 weeks - the subject fulfills criterion for inclusion in CZECH-ICIT 1
                  substudy

               -  LV systolic dysfunction (defined by ejection fraction less than/or equal 40%)
                  and symptoms of  heart failure (minimum NYHA class II) lasting more than 6
                  months, with standard medical therapy of chronic heart failure given for at
                  least 2 weeks - the subject fulfills criterion for inclusion in CZECH-ICIT 2
                  substudy

          4. Positive immunohistochemistry finding of myocardial inflammation in endomyocardial
             biopsy (EMB). EMB must have been be performed no more than 6 weeks prior to the
             inclusion in the study. Positive immunohistochemistry EMB finding demonstrating
             myocardial inflammation is defined by the presence of at least 7/mm2 cluster of
             differentiation 3 (CD3) positive lymphocytes and/or at least 14 infiltrating
             leucocytes (LCA+ cells)/mm2 in the specimen.

          5. The absence of infectious agent in EMB is defined by negative results of PCR testing
             of EMB specimens. PCR testing will be aimed to exclude the presence of enteroviruses
             (ECHO, coxsackie), adenoviruses, herpes viruses (herpes simplex virus (HSV-1),
             Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), human herpes virus (HHV-6)),
             Borrelia burgdorferi and parvovirus B19. In the case of parvovirus B19, a negative
             PCR result will be considered when less than 500 viral copies/ug genomic DNA are
             detected. EMB must have been performed no more than 6 weeks prior to the inclusion in
             the study.

          7. Usage of the effective method of contraception (hormonal or 2 barrier method of
             contraception)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. The presence of coronary artery disease, defined by angiographic findings of one or
             more coronary artery stenosis &gt; 50%, history of previous myocardial infarction and/or
             percutaneous or surgical myocardial revascularization. Coronary angiography must not
             have been performed more than 2 years before randomization into the study.

          2. Permanent pacemaker including cardiac resynchronization therapy.

             &gt; 180mmHg (for systolic pressure) and/or 110mmHg (for diastolic pressure) lasting
             more than 3 months.

             duodenal ulcer, uncontrolled arterial hypertension, history of malignant disease with
             oncological treatment finished less than 5 years, proven immunodeficiency, renal of
             hepatic insufficiency (serum creatinine &gt; 200 µmol/l; alanine aminotransferase (ALT)
             and/or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activity greater than three times the
             standard), leukocytopenia (leucocytes less than 4 x 10 9/l), thrombocytopenia
             (platelets less than 100 x 10 9/l), anemia (hemoglobin concentration  less than 100
