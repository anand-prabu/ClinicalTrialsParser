Characterize the pharmacokinetic profile of this\n      drug in these patients. III. Determine the pharmacodynamic relationship between plasma\n      concentrations and clinical activity or toxicity of this drug in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to the number of prior treatment regimens (1-2 vs\n      3 or more). Patients receive irofulven IV over 5 minutes on days 1-5. Courses repeat every 4\n      weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed\n      every 4 weeks until death.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 74 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years."
