            "textblock": "Cataract surgery is one of the most frequently performed surgeries worldwide and\n      complications are rare. However, there are factors that increase the risk of complications,\n      such as poor pupil dilation and intra-operative floppy iris syndrome (IFIS). Reasons for a\n      small pupil size are pseudoexfoliation syndrome (PXF) syndrome, uveitis or synechia and the\n      use of pilocarpin drops. IFIS is a syndrome usually caused by systemic alpha1-blockers\n      (foremost tamsulosin) used to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia.1,2 As described by Chang\n      and Campbell3 IFIS is characterized by billowing of a flaccid iris stroma, a propensity for\n      iris prolapse towards the phacoemulsification tip as well as towards the incisions and\n      progressive intra-operative pupil constriction.\n\n      Stopping tamsulosin pre-operatively did not show to effectively prevent IFIS.4,5 However, it\n      is of high importance to identify patients prior to surgery, who are treated with\n      alpha1-blockers, or patients with a small pupil size and poor pharmacological pupil\n      dilation. Some methods, such as intracameral injection of phenylephrine is only sufficient\n      in a few cases 6, and a disadvantage is the risk of a hypertensive episode.7 Another\n      pharmacological method is the use of atropine drops pre-operatively, but this method did not\n      show to sufficiently reduce IFIS.4\n\n      Different methods were shown to reduce intra-operative problems due to IFIS/small pupil\n      size:\n\n      The use of highly cohesive ophthalmic viscosurgical devices (OVD), also called\n      viscoadaptives, such as sodium hyaluronate (e.g. AMO Healon5 or Croma Eyefill H.D.) help to\n      viscodilate the pupil and by resting on the iris during the entire phacoemulsification\n      procedure reduce the risk of iris prolapsing towards the incisions. This method is more\n      dependent on a central phacoemulsification technique and low fluidic parameters to allow the\n      OVD to stay on the iris during the entire procedure.8 In case of a small pupil, pupil\n      stretching with 2 instruments can be used additively.\n\n      Another option to stabilize the pupil size is the use of mechanical pupil expansion devices,\n      such as\n\n        1. Iris retractors - these devices are routinely used to dilate the pupil\n           intra-operatively. Typically, 4 or 5 iris retractors, also called iris hooks, are\n           inserted through 4-5 incisions. Usually, the IFIS pupil is very elastic and the risk of\n           overstretching is small.8\n\n        2. Pupil expansion rings, such as the Malyugin ring. This ring is placed on the pupil\n           margin with an injector through the main incision. It eliminates the need of additional\n           incisions and saves time.9\n\n      Rationale To compare different methods to manage IFIS and poor pupil dilation in cataract\n      surgery:  a pupil expansion ring (Malyugin Ring), iris retractors (iris hooks) and a\n      viscoadaptive OVD."
