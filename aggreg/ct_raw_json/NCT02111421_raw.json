            "textblock": "Currently, spinal anesthesia is most commonly used for cesarean.But spinal anesthesia can\n      not block the visceral vagus nerve, and the patient is prone to nausea, vomiting, chest\n      tightness or other discomfort when the uterus is stretched .For the puerperae who have poor\n      uterine contractions and are bleeding larger, obstetricians often use oxytocin to strengthen\n      the contraction of the uterine,which also would increase the puerperae'\n      discomfort.Anesthesiologists often intravenous sedative hypnotics (eg.propofol or midazolam)\n      to alleviate the fear of the puerperae after the baby is delivered.One of the side effects\n      of propofol or midazolam is that they would lead to the respiratory depression.For the poor\n      respiratory reserve of the puerperae, functional residual capacity(FRC) of this group could\n      be reduced by up to 20%, and the oxygen consumption was also increased.The SPO2 could\n      decline quickly intraoperatively.Dexmedetomidine(DEX) is a novel , highly selective \u03b12\n      adrenergic receptor agonists , and its selectivity for \u03b12 receptor is 1600 times higher than\n      \u03b11.It also could provide dose-dependent sedation , analgesia , anti-anxiety and inhibition\n      of sympathetic nerves and other effects.Because of its minimal impact on the respiratory ,\n      it could safely and effectively used to sedate patients undergoing cesarean.But the change\n      of endocrine system and hemodynamic of the puerperae may affect the pharmacokinetics and\n      pharmacodynamics of some anesthetic drugs.Currently studies have demonstrated the increased\n      sensitivity of some anesthetic drug in puerperae, such as lidocaine and isoflurane.The study\n      is aim to explore the right DEX dose to produce suitable sedation in puerperae."
