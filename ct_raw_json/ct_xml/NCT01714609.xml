  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sorafenib is approved by the US FDA for the treatment of unresectable (can not operate)
      liver cancer and for renal cell carcinoma. Sorafenib is a drug that inhibits the growth of
      cancer cells and prevents the formation of new blood vessels that would otherwise help the
      cancer spread.

      Studies in experimental animals have shown that sorafenib may also lower portal vein
      pressure (the pressure of the blood passing from the intestine through the liver.) This
      study seeks to determine if sorafenib lowers the blood pressure in liver blood vessels
      (portal vein pressure) in patients with cirrhosis who have high portal vein pressure. The
      study will also obtain information whether sorafenib is safe in this patient population.

      Half of the patients will be given sorafenib and half will be given a placebo (a pill
      without any medicine in it.) This allows a comparison of the reactions of people who take
      sorafenib to those who do not.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot proof-of-concept study that investigates the effect of sorafenib on portal
      pressure, as determined by the hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG), in patients with
      liver cirrhosis, portal hypertension and unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) that
      has successfully responded to radiofrequency ablation and/or transarterial
      chemoembolization, and have obtained a complete response.

      The primary end-point of the study is the change in HVPG observed from baseline to three
      months after starting treatment with sorafenib. Secondary end-point is safety of sorafenib.

      The trial is structured as a randomized double blind placebo controlled study. After a
      three-month period of therapy with sorafenib or placebo (double-blind phase), patients will
      be given open-label sorafenib for an additional 3-month period (open-label phase).  A total
      of 44 patients will be randomized (in the initial phase) on a 1:1 ratio to sorafenib or
      placebo.  Patients will be followed monthly and HCC follow-up will be according to standards
      of care. The study will be sponsored by Onyx, who will also provide the treatment medication
      (sorafenib and placebo)

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        -  Age 20-75 years

          -  Cirrhosis diagnosed by liver biopsy or by imaging studies showing a nodular liver,
             splenomegaly and/or collaterals

          -  HCC proven histologically or diagnosed following the AASLD criteria if biopsy not
             feasible or refused by the patient

          -  HCC must be unresectable and within UCSF criteria (single tumor ≤ 6.5 cm diameter,
             or, if multiple lesions, maximum diameter of the largest lesion  ≤ 4.5 and total
             tumor diameter  ≤ 8 cm (23))

          -  CPT score &lt;9 (that is all Child A and Child B with a score of 7 or 8)

          -  Complete response to treatment with RFA (including that performed laparoscopically)
             or TACE or a combination of the above as defined by radiologic criteria (hepatoma
             protocol MRI or CT scan performed 4-6 weeks after the procedure).

          -  No more than two ablative procedures prior to enrollment

          -  Presence of portal hypertension, as defined by HVPG of &gt;5 mmHg

          -  EGD for variceal screening performed within 6 months of entry into the study unless
             the patient is already on a stable dose of a non selective beta-blocker (adjusted to
             obtain a heart rate of 55-60 bpm) or treated with variceal band ligation.

          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test performed
             within 7 days prior to  the start of treatment

          -  Women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception
             (barrier method of birth control) prior to study entry and for the duration of study
             participation.  Men should use adequate birth control for at least three months after
             the last administration of sorafenib.
