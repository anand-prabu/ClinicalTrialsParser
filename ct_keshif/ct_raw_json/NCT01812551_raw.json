The current aggressive therapies have ensured a much longer survival of CF\n      patients but this has led to a higher frequency of osteoporosis and bone fractures, a\n      serious problem which not only affects quality of life, but also hinders further therapeutic\n      measures.\n\n      The aim of this study, conducted on a large group of children, adolescents and young adults\n      with CF, has been the evaluation of bone mass changes after 1 year of a simple treatment\n      with RDA-adjusted dietary calcium plus 25-OH vitamin D supplementation, and the feasibility\n      and efficacy of alendronate treatment (for another year) in patients not responding to\n      calcium + 25-OH vitamin D alone."
