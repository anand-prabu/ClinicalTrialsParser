  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In conjunction with investigators at the Cecil G. Sheps Center for Health Services Research,
      University of North Carolina (UNC) at Chapel Hill, we propose to develop and evaluate a
      low-cost, minimally obtrusive device that delivers individualized light therapy to adults
      with early-awakening insomnia - the most common sleep disturbance in older adults, and a
      significant problem because of its relationship to daytime sleepiness, use of potentially
      hazardous sleep medication, and reduced quality of life. The proposed device will measure
      light/dark exposure data over 24 hours, estimate optimum timing for light delivery, and
      deliver an individualized light dosage while subjects are asleep. Light applied through
      closed eyelids in the early part of the night will delay the dim light melatonin onset, a
      marker of the circadian clock, and help those with early sleep onset to fall asleep later

    <description>Participants will wear an actigraph for 2 weeks prior to coming to the lab for phase assessment. Participants will provide saliva samples for dim light melatonin onset (DLMO). The DLMO data from this baseline week, in conjunction with the Dimesimeter data will determine the time of light administration during weeks 6 and 9. There will be 2 weeks &quot;off&quot; between experimental sessions. During weeks 6 and 9 participants will be wearing the light measuring and delivery system, which is composed of the Dimesimeter, a computer, and the light mask. The light mask (red or blue) will be automatically programmed to be turned on for 120 min at the appropriate time for that evening, based on the feedback from the Dimesimeter data.</description>

    <description>On week 6, half of the subjects will be given light masks that deliver blue light before the estimated CBTmin and the other half will be exposed to red light under identical conditions - placebo control. On week 9, the ones who experienced blue light on week 6 will experience the red light, while the ones who experienced the red light on week 6 will experience the blue light on week 9. If subjects awaken while the mask is on, they will be instructed to try to fall asleep again or to stay in bed with their eyes closed. The light mask will always be turned on 120 min before estimated core body temperature minimum (CBTmin); it is expected that blue light exposure will delay the timing of the CBTmin.</description>
