The primary\n      outcome measure is prevalence of parasitaemia and anaemia in children aged 0.5-10 years,\n      measured in cross sectional surveys. Secondary outcomes include relative population density\n      for each mosquito vector species, malaria transmission as measured by entomological\n      inoculation rates (EIR) by mosquito vector species, monitoring of resistance markers\n      including kdr, and user acceptability of LLINs compared with IRS.\n\n      Findings from this study are expected to inform decision making so that resource utilization\n      can be optimised."
