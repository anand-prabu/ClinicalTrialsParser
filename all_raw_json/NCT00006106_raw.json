Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor\n      cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining ONYX-015 with chemotherapy may\n      kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of ONYX-015 combined with cisplatin and\n      fluorouracil in treating patients who have advanced head and neck cancer."

Determine the feasibility and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of intraarterial ONYX-015 in\n      patients with advanced squamous cell cancer of the head and neck.\n\n      II. Determine the feasibility and tolerability of intraarterial ONYX-015 at the MTD OR\n      maximum theraputic dose, whichever is lower, in combination with intravenous cisplatin and\n      fluorouracil in these patients.\n\n      III. Determine the qualitative distribution of ONYX-015 within a limited tumor biopsy and a\n      normal mucosal biopsy at different dose levels.\n\n      IV. Determine the response of these patients to intraarterial ONYX-015. V. Determine the\n      response of these patients to cisplatin and fluorouracil following intraarterial ONYX-015.\n\n      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive intraarterial infusions\n      of ONYX-015.  Treatment repeats once in 3-4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or\n      unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-8 patients receive escalating doses of ONYX-015 until the maximum tolerated\n      dose (MTD) is determined.  The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 5\n      patients experience dose limiting toxicity.\n\n      Patients in cohorts 1-4 are followed for 5 days after infusion, weekly for 3 weeks, at week\n      6, and monthly thereafter for 4 months.\n\n      A fifth or final cohort of 10 patients will receive ONYX-015 at the MTD.  If the MTD was not\n      determined in cohorts 1-4, patients receive the highest dose administered to cohort 4.\n      Beginning 1-2 days after ONYX-015 infusion, patients receive cisplatin IV over 30-60 minutes\n      once and fluorouracil IV continuously over 4 days.  Treatment repeats in 4 weeks in the\n      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.  Cisplatin and fluorouracil IV\n      treatment continues every 3-4 weeks at the discretion of the treating oncologist.\n\n      Patients in cohort 5 are followed for 5 days after initial infusion, weekly for 4 weeks, at\n      week 8, and monthly thereafter for 4 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL:\n\n      A total of 23-28 patients will be accrued for this study."
