The ratio considered\n      from VO to parenteral route (BP) is 2:1. Academic literature assumes the ratio from BP to VO\n      to be 1:2. In our unit, we use MTD in the context of ROP and not as the last opioid. If face\n      with a situation where there is a good control of pain with MTD BP, usually we move to VO.\n      We have observed that the traditional ratio tend to produce certain toxicity problems.\n      Because of this, we have proposed a new ratio of conversion from PAR MTD to oral MTD, i.e.\n      1:1.2"

The patients will be randomly split into two groups: (Group A = ratio 1:1.2 and Group\n      B=ratio 1:2). Patients will be evaluated during the three days before the switch is applied,\n      the day of the change and during the 3 days post-ROP. The patients who display significant\n      toxicity and/or bad analgesic control within the first 72 hours post-ROP will be considered\n      negative cases. The size of the sample required will include 46 patients distributed in\n      balanced groups in order to obtain a size effect of 30% and a statistical power of 80%. The\n      significance level will be 0.05 for two tails.\n\n      STATISTIC ANALYSIS: By means of Chi-squared to compare the proportion of Opioid Rotation\n      (OR) failure in both groups of study."
