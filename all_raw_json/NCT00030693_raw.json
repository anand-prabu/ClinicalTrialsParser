To determine and compare the feasibility and clinical toxicity of administering rF-B7.1\n      and rF-TRICOM vaccines to patients with accessible cutaneous, subcutaneous, or lymph node\n      metastatic tumors.\n\n      II. To determine and compare the feasibility and clinical toxicity of administering rF-B7.1\n      and rF-TRICOM vaccines to patients with accessible visceral metastatic tumors.\n\n      III. To determine the optimal dose of rF-B7.1 and rF-TRICOM vaccine delivered by\n      intra-tumoral injection.\n\n      IV. To compare the clinical responses and safety profile of patients with cutaneous tumors\n      and visceral tumors who receive rF-B7.1 vaccine to similar patients receiving rF-TRICOM\n      vaccine.\n\n      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. To establish evidence of host anti-tumor immune reactivity following intra-lesional\n      vaccine administration and compare any differences between rF-B7.1 and rF-TRICOM in patients\n      with cutaneous tumors and visceral tumors.\n\n      II. To evaluate the quality of life during vaccine administration.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study with dose-escalation component. Patients are stratified\n      according to tumor location (cutaneous, subcutaneous, or lymph node metastases vs visceral\n      metastases). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\n      ARM I: Patients receive rF-B7.1 vaccine intratumorally on day 1.\n\n      ARM II: Patients receive fowlpox-TRICOM vaccine intratumorally on day 1.\n\n      Treatment in both arms repeats every 4 weeks for 3 courses in the absence of disease\n      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with stable or responding disease may receive\n      additional courses.\n\n      Three patients from the cutaneous disease (CD) stratum are treated at low-dose in each\n      treatment arm. If no more than 1 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), then\n      6 additional CD patients are randomized to high-dose treatment. If no more than 1 of these 6\n      patients experience DLT, then 12 patients from the visceral disease (VD) stratum are\n      randomized to low-dose treatment. If no more than 2 of 12 VD patients experience DLT, then\n      the next cohort of 12 VD patients is randomized to high-dose treatment. If 3 of the original\n      12 VD patients experience DLT, then 6 additional VD patients receive low-dose treatment. If\n      no more than 3 of 18 patients experience DLT, then 12 VD patients receive high-dose\n      treatment.\n\n      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, monthly during therapy, and then at the end of\n      therapy.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months."
