  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study sets out to compare the effectiveness of a parent pain management coaching video
      that is 5-minutes in length.  The investigators will be comparing an active-video to a
      placebo-video of equal length (and identical formatting). Participants will be 6 or 18 month
      infants undergoing routine immunization. The investigators hypothesize the active video will
      result in a lowering of infant pain expressed post-immunization (3 minutes) and the increase
      in the parental use of distraction, physical comfort, and rocking.

    <description>Infant pain regulation was operationalized using The Modified Behaviour Pain Scale (MBPS), modified by Taddio et al. (1995) for use with infants during office procedures. The measure rates the severity of distress reflected in three types of infant pain behaviours: (1) facial expressions; (2) cry; and (3) body movements during 15-second epochs post-immunization (for 3 minutes). Infants are assigned a score from 0 to 3 (or 0 to 4 on the cry scale), with larger values indicating a more intense behavioural response (Total Range 0-10)</description>

    <description>The MAISD (Measure of Adult and Infant Soothing and Distress; Cohen et al., 2005) is a behavior observation scale that was developed to examine the discrete behaviors exhibited by parents during children's invasive medical procedures. Rather than attempting to examine all behaviors, only those that were viewed as being potentially impacted by the treatment video will be included.  Thus, distraction, rocking, physical comfort were selected.  Each behaviour is coded every 5 seconds for either presence or absence (0 or 1).  Three separate scores will be derived for each behaviour (distraction, rocking, physical comfort).</description>
