The investigators plan to continue\n      therapy for a period of 12 weeks followed by a follow-up 4 weeks after therapy ends. The\n      investigators will evaluate the changes in metabolic parameters (e.g. blood cholesterol,\n      liver function, insulin resistance) and body composition characteristics (e.g. the pattern\n      of fat distribution in the body). Seven eligible subjects in this study will also be\n      evaluated for a change in liver disease by a liver biopsy."
