In each of these phases (near) accidents may occur. A severe transfusion\n      incident refers to the transfusion of a wrong blood product, whereas a near miss is detected\n      before transfusion.\n\n      In 2010 the University Hospitals Leuven introduced a new electronic patient incident report\n      system for transfusion events.\n\n      In this study the investigators will analyze the reported blood transfusion events to detect\n      the most common causes of blood transfusion events and the weakest link in the blood\n      transfusion chain."
