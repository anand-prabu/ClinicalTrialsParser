  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study tests whether a single session of exposure therapy may be enhanced by the
      addition of anti-phobic actions beyond the mere fading of safety behaviors.  A total of 100
      acrophobic participants will be randomly assigned to receive standard exposure therapy,
      exposure therapy with safety behavior fading, exposure with safety behavior fading and
      anti-phobic actions, or to a wait-list control group.

    <textblock>
      This study tests whether a single session of exposure therapy may be enhanced by the
      addition of one of two augmentation strategies, including engagement in anti-phobic actions
      and fading of safety behaviors.  Because utilization of safety behaviors is functionally
      precluded by anti-phobic action, the present study design will both replicate and extend
      prior research by addressing whether anti-phobic actions enhance exposure therapy beyond the
      mere fading of safety behaviors.  A total of 100 individuals between the ages of 18 and 65
      meeting DSM-IV criteria for acrophobia (fear of heights) will be randomly assigned to one of
      four conditions including (1) standard exposure therapy, (2) exposure therapy with safety
      behavior fading, (3) exposure therapy with safety behavior fading and anti-phobic actions,
      and (4) a wait-list control condition.  All participants will complete an online prescreen
      and face-to-face screening assessment to determine eligibility and pre-treatment symptom
      severity.  Participants will also complete assessments at post-treatment and 1-month
      follow-up assessments.  Subjective fear during two behavioral approach tests (in the
      treatment and generalization context, respectively) conducted at pre-treatment,
      post-treatment, and 1-month follow-up assessments will serve as the primary measure of
      treatment outcome.  Additionally, a battery of self-report questionnaires will be completed
      at pre-treatment, during treatment, at post-treatment, and at a 1-month follow-up
      assessment.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age 18 to 65.

          2. Fluent in English (written and spoken). This is required because assessment
             instruments are validated only in English.

          3. Meet DSM-IV criteria for specific phobia, natural environment type, with acrophobic
             concerns, based on the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI-Auto; World
             Health Organization, 1997).

          4. Report moderate fear or avoidance (i.e., a score of 30 or higher) on a modified
             version of the Acrophobia Questionnaire (AQ; Cohen, 1977).

          5. Exhibit at least moderate fear (i.e., a fear score of 50 or higher, where 0 = no fear
             and 100 = extreme fear) during two behavioral approach tests (BATs) consisting of
             ascending two moderately challenging flights of stairs.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        1. Medical condition(s) which may prevent safely climbing or descending stairs or walking
        for more than 15 minutes at a time (It will be necessary to walk to different sites for
        the behavioral approach tests).
