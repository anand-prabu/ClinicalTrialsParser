      The trial will evaluate the extended bactericidal activity of 14 consecutive days of oral
      administration of TMC207 plus PA-824 plus Pyrazinamide plus Clofazimine, TMC207 plus PA-824
      plus Pyrazinamide, TMC207 plus PA-824 plus Clofazimine alone, TMC207 plus Pyrazinamide plus
      Clofazimine, Pyrazinamide alone, Clofazimine alone, and standard first line TB treatment as
      per South African TB Guidelines (Rifafour e-275) as determined by the rate of change of log
      CFU per ml sputum over the time period Day 0-14 in participants with smear positive
      pulmonary tuberculosis (TB). A control group will receive standard treatment.
