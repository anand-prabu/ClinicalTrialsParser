  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      N-Acetyl cysteine (NAC) is an amino acid with strong antioxidant, mucolytic and
      antibacterial properties, and is produced within the human body.Its effect in biofilms has
      been tested in several bacteria. Biofilms have recently been observed in 90% of subjects
      with bacterial vaginosis (BV) with Gardnerella vaginalis being the predominant species.
      Although a wide range of antimicrobial agents are currently available, treatment options for
      controlling BV are still limited. Furthermore, the number of relapses are increasing and
      require alternative treatments.  This study is aiming to evaluate the role of NAC in
      treatment of BV and prevention of recurrence.

    <textblock>
      Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the most frequent diagnosis made in women with lower genital
      tract symptoms. It has recently been observed that 90% of subjects with BV show the growth
      of bacteria in the form of biofilms,and that Gardnerella vaginalis was the predominant
      species. The propensity of G. vaginalis to form biofilm is clinically relevant because this
      form of growth allows it to tolerate higher concentrations of certain antibiotics, thus
      increasing the possibility of recurrent BV even after apparently curative therapy. So new
      treatment strategies must be used to insure complete cure and prevent recurrence. NAC is an
      amino acid with strong antioxidant, mucolytic and antibacterial properties, and is produced
      within the human body.Its effect in biofilms has been tested in several bacteria.

      This study aims to test the efficacy of NAC in treatment of BV either alone or in
      combination with the traditionally used metronidazole. Also the effect of using NAC in
      prevention of recurrence of BV will be monitored.

    <description>N-Acetyl cysteine is a pharmaceutical drug and nutritional supplement,it is a derivative of the natural amino acid cysteine, from which it differs by virtue of the introduction of an acetyl group on the nitrogen atom of the amino terminal.It is used mainly as a mucolytic and in management of paracetamol overdose. It has been observed that N-acetyl cysteine has shown good properties in terms of combating bacterial infections. In particular, it has been observed that NAC presents good activity in terms of inhibiting bacterial adhesion and in dissolving the biofilm matrix.</description>
