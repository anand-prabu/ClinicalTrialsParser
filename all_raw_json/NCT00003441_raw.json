Evaluate the qualitative and quantitative toxicities of MGI-114 given on this\n      schedule in this patient population.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients receive 6-hydroxymethylacylfulvene (MGI-114) IV over 5 minutes daily for 5\n      consecutive days. Courses are repeated every 28 days. The minimum treatment period is 2\n      courses. Treatment continues indefinitely in the absence of unacceptable toxic effects or\n      disease progression. Patients are followed at the end of every other course while on the\n      study, and then every 3 months thereafter until death.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-35 patients will be accrued for this study within 6-10\n      months."
