            "textblock": "Background:\n\n      - Serious illnesses like cancer can cause high levels of stress in a family. When a child is\n      diagnosed with cancer, parents face numerous stressors, each of which can strain\n      relationships. Many parents struggle to effectively cope with the changes in parenting roles\n      that often accompany treatment of childhood cancer. How parents cope with this stress can\n      influence whether the relationship is strengthened or weakened. Stress levels can also\n      affect the care of the child who has cancer. Researchers want to better understand the\n      critical time points and events during the child   s treatment when the relationship becomes\n      most stressed and/or strengthened.\n\n      Objectives:\n\n      - To study how stress affects the relationship between parents who have a child with cancer.\n\n      Eligibility:\n\n        -  Parents of a child (between 1 and 24 years of age) who has been diagnosed with cancer.\n\n        -  Participants must have been in a partnership at the time the child was diagnosed with\n           cancer. At least one of the parents must be a biological or legal parent of the child.\n\n      Design:\n\n        -  Participants will fill out a questionnaire either online or by paper and pencil. It\n           will take about 20 minutes to complete. The questions ask about the experience of\n           dealing with a child   s cancer diagnosis and how it affects participants\n           relationship with their spouse/partner.\n\n        -  Some participants will also have an in-depth interview. It will last about an hour. It\n           will ask further questions about the cancer diagnosis and treatment and its effect on\n           the relationship.\n\n        -  Treatment will not be provided as part of this study."

            "textblock": "BACKGROUND:\n\n        -  Parents face numerous stressors when their child is diagnosed with cancer, each of\n           which can strain a marriage/partnership.\n\n        -  Marital/partner relationship dynamics are often not assessed or addressed when\n           providing health care for children with cancer. Many parents struggle to effectively\n           cope with the changes in parenting roles that frequently accompany treatment of\n           childhood cancer.\n\n        -  How parents cope with these stressors can strengthen or weaken the relationship, and\n           can impact the entire family, including the care to the child undergoing cancer\n           treatments.\n\n        -  Limited studies have examined relationship stress or satisfaction during a child   s\n           treatment for cancer or the critical time points and events during the child   s\n           treatment when the relationship becomes most stressed and/or strengthened.\n\n      OBJECTIVES:\n\n        -  To explore whether the stress associated with having a child with cancer is perceived\n           to impact the communication between partners.\n\n        -  To explore whether positive dyadic coping (joint decision making, joint problem\n           solving, sharing responsibilities) is perceived to have strengthened the marital\n           relationship/partnership following the child   s diagnosis with cancer.\n\n        -  To describe the time points and events during the child   s treatment when the parents\n             relationship becomes most stressed and/or strengthened.\n\n        -  To compare the perceptions of various subgroups in the sample, (e.g. parents who score\n           either high or low on a marital stress scale, mothers versus fathers) statistically or\n           qualitatively as the distribution of the characteristics of the sample allow.\n\n      ELIGIBILITY:\n\n        -  Participants must have been in a partnership at the time the child was diagnosed with\n           cancer. At least one of the participating parents must be a biological or legal parent\n           of the child. If a divorce/separation occurred with a previous partner during/after the\n           child   s cancer treatment, the other partner will be invited to participate.\n\n        -  The participant   s child must be between 1-24 years of age.\n\n        -  There are 2 groups of participants being recruited: 1) those who have a child who has\n           been diagnosed with cancer at least 3 months prior to enrolling on this study and are\n           currently undergoing cancer treatment and 2) those who have completed treatment at age\n           21 or younger (without evidence of disease) within the previous 3 years.\n\n        -  Participants must be fluent in the English language.\n\n        -  The participant   s child must have been diagnosed with cancer at least 3 months prior\n           to enrollment on this study.\n\n        -  Participants must verbalize willingness to discuss the impact of their child   s cancer\n           diagnosis on their relationship.\n\n      DESIGN:\n\n        -  Cross-sectional, multi-center, exploratory study utilizing a convenience sample to\n           explore the parents    perception of how the child   s cancer diagnosis, treatment,\n           decision-making and other aspects of care are addressed and impact the martial\n           relationship/partnership.\n\n        -  Subjects will complete a self-administered measure that addresses potential stresses\n           experienced in the partnership since the child   s diagnosis and how each are either\n           resolved or create a divide in the relationship.\n\n        -  Subjects who experience a    high    or    low    degree of relationship stress on a\n           standardized marital stress form (a score greater than one standard deviation from the\n           norm) will be invited to participate in a qualitative interview, that further explores\n           which components of parenting a child with cancer is most challenging on the\n           relationship.\n\n        -  Up to 240 participants will be enrolled onto the study (up to 120 couples), and we aim\n           for qualitative interviews with approximately 26% of the sample.  Subjects will be\n           offered a gift card ($20 Target gift card at NIH) upon completion of the questionnaire\n           for their time and inconvenience, where available."
