      The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of two surgical techniques on the outcome
      of the knee replacement surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      How stable a total knee replacement is depends on the correct and precise rotation of the
      femoral component. Abnormal femoral component rotation has been associated with numerous
      adverse conditions including knee instability, knee pain, scar tissue, and abnormal knee
      motion. Controversy exists, however, regarding the most favorable surgical technique to
      determine accurate femoral component rotation. Some doctors prefer a measured resection
      technique in which landmarks on the femur bone are used to determine where to place the
      femoral component. Others recommend a gap-balancing technique in which the femoral component
      is positioned by balancing the ligaments of the knee and placing it in the position where
      each ligament is equally strained.

      The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of the measured resection and
      gap-balancing surgical technique on how the total knee replacement moves and patient knee
      outcome scores.  Knee outcome scores are assessed from the responses given by patients to
      questions about outcomes associated with total knee replacement related to pain, symptoms,
      activities of daily living, sport and recreational function, and knee-related quality of
      life.
