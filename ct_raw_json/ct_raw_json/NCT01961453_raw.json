Once it develops, heart failure is a very serious condition and\n      thus it is important to find ways to prevent it from happening. The investigators have\n      reasons to believe that dilating the blood vessels with this specific medication will\n      improve the thickening of the heart, which increases the risk of heart failure."

Women who become pregnant\n             during the study will be discontinued from the trial.\n\n          -  Contraindications to a cardiac MRI: (i) Central nervous system aneurysm clips; (ii)\n             Implanted neural stimulators; (iii) Implanted cardiac pacemaker or defibrillator;\n             (iv) Cochlear implant; (v) Ocular foreign body (e.g. metal shavings); (vi) Other\n             implanted medical devices: (e.g. drug infusion ports); (vii) Insulin pump; (viii)\n             Metal shrapnel or bullet; (ix) Claustrophobia; (x) Extreme obesity rendering the\n             patient unable to fit into narrow-bore scanners; (xi) Unwillingness of the patient to\n             undergo a cardiac MRI.
