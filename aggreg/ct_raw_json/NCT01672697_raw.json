To be able\n      to study this, the investigators need to know how well the muscles of a woman's pelvic floor\n      function after a vaginal delivery and this requires measuring their strength during a pelvic\n      exam. At present, there are no studies that have looked at whether the intervention of PT/BT\n      improves a woman's anal incontinence quality of life after sustaining genital trauma during\n      vaginal deliveries"

The secondary outcome\n      measure is physiologic and reflects a change in anal sphincter resting tone from baseline to\n      study completion.\n\n      After the screening questionnaires to determine eligibility in the study, each study subject\n      will be consented for participation then undergo a baseline physical exam (including pelvic\n      exam and rectal exam) at a range of 2- to 4- weeks after delivery date. In addition, after\n      this initial exam, all women will be randomized immediately to receive (1) no further\n      treatments, or (2) physical and behavioral therapy.\n\n      The investigators will study these two groups of women for 24 total weeks after the date of\n      delivery. The intervention group will include patients randomized to receiving PT/BT for 4\n      weekly sessions after their vaginal delivery and laceration (episiotomy) repair. The control\n      group (no intervention) will include patients randomized to receiving the standard of care\n      (no physical or behavioral therapy) after their vaginal delivery and laceration (episiotomy)\n      repair.\n\n      Each group will undergo the baseline testing: a pelvic exam (to measure the strength of your\n      muscles) and anal-rectal manometry (i.e. rectal exam with insertion of a small sensor to\n      measure the strength of your sphincter); and be asked to complete a series of brief\n      questionnaires. These questionnaires will be administered again to both groups at 6-weeks,\n      12-weeks, and 24-weeks after their delivery date. Study completion physical exams including\n      a repeat pelvic exam and repeat anal-rectal manometry will be conducted at 12-weeks after\n      delivery date."
