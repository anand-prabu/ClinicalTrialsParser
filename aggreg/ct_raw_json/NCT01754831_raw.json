We want to study how much fluoride appears in the urine after the painting\n      procedure to improve our knowledge of how the varnish works and its safety. The fluoride\n      varnish is being used for research purposes for this study by permission of FDA (IND\n      #110869).\n\n      Premier Dental Product Company's Enamel Pro Varnish will be used.  Up to six children aged\n      12-15 months will be enrolled in this study.  The participants will have two study visits,\n      Arm 1 (fluoride varnish topical application) and Arm 2 (control, no intervention).  For both\n      Arms of the study, 5 hours of urine collection will occur."
