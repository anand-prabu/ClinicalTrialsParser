            "textblock": "\u2022 Study design : This is an open prospective, cross-over cohort study, including patients\n      ventilated in one medical intensive care unit. Two procedures will be compared in two\n      distinct, randomly decided cross-over consecutive periods\n\n      \u2022 Detailed description : Standard cares include tracheal suctions several times a day. They\n      can induce a cough reflex in non paralysed patients leading to the mobilisation of the\n      endotracheal tube and a consecutive raise in the risk of tracheal microaspiration. Thus\n      drainage of subglottic secretion before tracheal suction is expected to reduce\n      microaspiration. Subglottic secretion drainage could decrease the risk of Ventilator\n      Associated Pneumonia even if it remains to be confirmed. However, no study assessed its\n      efficiency in reducing tracheal microaspiration.\n\n      An optimization of the oropharyngeal suction procedure will include the use of a subglottic\n      drainage in a specified order to realize a so called \"optimized oral care\". A comparison\n      will be done with a routine oral care.\n\n      We will conduct a crossover study in which the patient's follow-up will last 2 days. Length\n      of suction procedure and mouth care, volume of oral, subglottic and tracheal secretions and\n      their qualitative appearance will be collected. The amylase enzymatic activity will be\n      assessed in oropharyngeal, subglottic and tracheal samples.\n\n      \u2022 Registry procedure : All requested information will be recorded on case report forms and\n      explanation will be reported for any missing data. False data will be clearly corrected, and\n      signed by investigator or authorised person. For biochemical data (amylase enzymatic\n      activity), results will be transmitted through excel software via a key and data will be\n      integrated to the principal excel file on  professional computer of the investigator.\n\n      Monitoring will be realised by the co-investigator in association with the clinical research\n      associate.\n\n        -  Quality factors. This clinical research associates will regularly check data to compare\n           data entered into the registry against predefined rules for range or consistency with\n           other data fields in the registry and a report will be report after each checking.\n\n        -  Sample size assessment: Number of subjects : 24 patients. Six months should be\n           necessary to include these patients.\n\n        -  Statistical analysis : The sample size estimate assumed a median ratio of 8% and an\n           estimated reduction from 8 to 2% with the optimized oral care. We determined that 12\n           patients per group would provide a power of 80%, with an \u03b1 level of 5%.\n\n      Results will be expressed as means \u00b1 Standard Deviation. Continuous variables will be\n      compared using the Student's t-test for matched paired series and categorical variables\n      using the Chi 2 test. All p values and confidence intervals will be two-tailed. p<0.05 will\n      be considered to be statistically significant."
