      This pilot, non-interventional, company-sponsored, multi-center study documents
      observational data on patients under routine treatment of Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension
      (PAH) with inhaled iloprost (using I-Neb device for the inhalation).

      The planned study recruitment time is 18 months. The maximum follow up period in this study
      will be 12 months.

      The data will be collected from patients who have initiated the treatment mentioned above
      (inhaled iloprost using I-Neb device) since February 1st, 2013.

      Frequency of visits and procedures will be performed under routine conditions. The primary
      objective of this study is to assess the compliance of patients with WHO/NYHA (World Health
      Organization/New York Heart Association) functional Class III Pulmonary Arterial
      Hypertension treated with Inhaled Iloprost in clinical practice, using the I-neb Insight
      tool.

    <description>The compliance will be assessed by the mean daily number of Inhalations and mean daily dose of Ventavis at around months 6 and 12 for each patient (Data will be collected via the I-neb Insight). For this observational study, a patient is considered compliant if the mean daily number of inhalations and mean daily dose are within 80 to 120% of prescribed. Otherwise, the patient will be considered as non-compliant.</description>
