We also aim to identify factors associated with feasibility of\n      e-screening.Compared to usual screening:1) e-screening is as feasible; 2) e-screening yields\n      similar rates of prenatal and postpartum depression and anxiety; 3) the mean score for risk\n      of disclosure is significantly lower and benefit of disclosure is significantly higher in\n      the e-screening group; 4) e-screening is as or more cost effective in detecting prenatal and\n      postpartum depression and anxiety; 5) features of e-screening are significantly associated\n      with feasibility and acceptability, whereas demographic factors are not; and 6) reliability\n      and validity indices of ALPHA and EPDS are strongly correlated for both administration\n      modes."
