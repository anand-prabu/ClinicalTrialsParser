This study will be offered to patients with cervical cancer\n      undergoing a combination of chemotherapy and radiation.  This treatment may lower your red\n      blood cells.  The use of NESP may stimulate the body to produce more red blood cells.  Our\n      hypothesis is that higher red blood cells will be beneficial to the patient during treatment\n      for cervical cancer."
