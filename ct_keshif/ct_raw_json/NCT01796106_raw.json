Lesion depth will be performed through standard-of care methods, i.e. radiographs\n      and visual exams, plus a novel optical device based on scanning fiber endoscope (SFE)\n      technology for laser light imaging for early caries detection in pediatric populations.  The\n      investigators will utilize SFE laser optical device prototypes developed by the University\n      of Washington's Human Photonics Lab (HPL), a device already in human use for other\n      applications, including imaging and cancer screening.\n\n      Clinical Significance:  This controlled trial will assess the positive effects of white spot\n      infiltration  by ICON and may open a new therapeutic strategy in paediatric dentistry.\n      Additionally, this study would be one of the first in vivo dental applications of the SFE\n      optical device, and would add a novel early caries visualization technique to the\n      armamentarium for detecting caries progression."

Additionally, these optical imaging devices are cumbersome, and often lead to inaccuracy due to user failure. Ultimately, these approaches result in caries lesions diagnoses overlooked at the earliest stages when less invasive measures, including remineralization techniques such as Icon, may be effective. Clinical caries detection sensitive to early lesions would bring about innovations in treatment modalities through medicinal therapeutic and preventive approaches, including chemotherapeutic approaches such as Icon.  An imaging system such as the SFE optical device, specifically designed for dentistry, would be the ideal approach.",
