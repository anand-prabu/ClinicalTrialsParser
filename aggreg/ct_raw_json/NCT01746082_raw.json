Subjects may receive licensed seasonal influenza vaccine\n      prior to (2 weeks if given the inactivated vaccine or 4 weeks if given the live, attenuated\n      vaccine) the first H3N2v vaccination.  Alternatively, subjects may receive licensed seasonal\n      influenza vaccine at any time after completion of the Day 42 visit or following an early\n      termination visit. Safety will be measured by the occurrence of solicited injection site and\n      systemic reactogenicity on the day of each H3N2v vaccination through 7 days after each H3N2v\n      vaccination, adverse events through 42 days after the first H3N2v vaccination, and serious\n      adverse events (SAEs) and new-onset chronic medical conditions through 7 months after the\n      first H3N2v vaccination. Immunogenicity testing will include performing hemagglutination\n      inhibition (HAI) and neutralizing (Neut) antibody assays on serum obtained on the day of and\n      prior to each H3N2v vaccination (Days 0 and 21), approximately 8 days after each H3N2v\n      vaccination (Days 8 and 29), and approximately 21 days after the second H3N2v vaccination\n      (Day 42).\n\n      From a subset of healthy adult subjects (up to 30 volunteers 18-64 years old enrolled at the\n      Emory VTEU site who consent to blood donation for the immunology exploratory assays), an\n      additional volume of venous blood will be drawn on Days 0, 8, 21, 29 and 42 to determine the\n      specificity/cross reactivity of antibodies from H3N2v-reactive B cells with other influenza\n      subtypes (e.g., 2009 H1N1 pandemic HA) and most recent H3 seasonal HA to define the\n      molecular profile of antibody repertoire changes in circulating B cells after H3N2v\n      vaccination, and to characterize the antibody-secreting cell (ASC), monoclonal antibody\n      (mAb), and CD4+ T cell responses to H3N2v vaccination. The duration of the study for each\n      subject will be approximately 7 months. Parent protocol to sub-study 12-0089 and 12-0015."
