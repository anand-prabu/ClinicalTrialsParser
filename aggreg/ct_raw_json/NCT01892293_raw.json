Eligibility screening will be performed in two steps.  First, patients\n      will undergo prescreening to determine if they have the correct HLA type in order to respond\n      to the engineered T cell therapy, and to test for presence of the target antigen, NY-ESO-1\n      and LAGE-1, in their tumor cells. Patients, who are HLA-A201 positive and test positive for\n      expression of NY-ESO-1 and/or LAGE-1 in their myeloma tumor will move on to complete all\n      screening procedures to determine eligibility for the study.\n\n      Patients will initially undergo a steady-state mononuclear cell apheresis for T cell\n      collection. About 3-4 weeks later (to allow expansion/engineering/releasing the engineered T\n      cells), patients will receive a short course of cytoreductive chemotherapy prior to\n      receiving the engineered T cell infusion, comprised of 1.5 gm/m2 of cyclophosphamide,  mesna\n      will be given if in accordance with institutional standards.\n\n      At day 0, patients will receive a dose of \u22650.1-1 x 1010 anti-CD3/anti-CD28-costimulated\n      autologous T cells which have been genetically modified to express affinity-enhanced\n      NY-ESO-1 T cell receptors (TCRs). A minimum dose of 0.1\u2264x<1 x 109 will be permitted.\n      Patients receiving this low dose level will be evaluated separately for safety and efficacy.\n\n      Patients will undergo myeloma restaging approximately 1 week prior to the T cell infusion,\n      and post infusion at days +28, +42 (week 6), +100 and 6 months post infusion and then every\n      3 months until relapse/progression or until 1 year, whenever comes first. At this point,\n      patients will be followed semi-annually for up to 5 years and then annually for long term\n      follow-up for monitoring for delayed adverse events until 15 years after receiving the\n      genetically modified T cells, in accordance with FDA Guidelines."

Patients must have a diagnosis of myeloma (see Appendix A for diagnostic\n             criteria).\n\n             3. Patients must have progressive or active disease following  prior therapy for\n             their myeloma which:\n\n               1. includes an IMiD and proteasome inhibitor as separate lines or a combined line\n                  of therapy\n\n               2. May include prior auto-SCT but not prior allo-SCT\n\n                  Patients who have failed second or third line therapy and beyond, such as DPACE,\n                  and who are experiencing a partial response rather than progressive disease are\n                  also eligible.\n\n                  4. Patients must have measurable disease on study entry.  Measurable disease may\n                  include quantifiable or detectable levels of serum or urine paraprotein.  For\n                  patients with minimally secretory disease on study entry, serum free kappa or\n                  lambda light chain levels, or the serum free light chain ratio may be measured\n                  and used for disease monitoring if abnormal.\n\n                  5.

HIV or HTLV-1/2 seropositivity 3. Known history of\n             myelodysplasia 4. Known history of chronic active hepatitis or liver cirrhosis (if\n             suspected by laboratory studies, should be confirmed by liver biopsy).\n\n             5. Active Infection with HBV or HCV\n\n               -  Active hepatitis B infection as determined by test for hepatitis B surface\n                  antigen.\n\n               -  Active hepatitis C. Patients will be screened for HCV antibody. If the HCV\n                  antibody is positive, a screening HCV RNA by any RT PCR or bDNA assay must be\n                  performed at screening by a local laboratory with a CLIA certification or its\n                  equivalent. Eligibility will be determined based on a negative screening value.\n                  The test is not required if documentation of a negative result of a HCV RNA test\n                  performed within 60 days prior to screening is provided.\n\n                  6. Prior allogeneic transplant 7. History of severe autoimmune disease requiring\n                  steroids or other immunosuppressive treatments.\n\n                  8. Active immune-mediated diseases including:  connective tissue diseases,\n                  uveitis, sarcoidosis, inflammatory bowel disease, multiple sclerosis.\n\n                  9. Evidence or history of other significant cardiac, hepatic, renal,\n                  ophthalmologic, psychiatric, or gastrointestinal disease which would likely\n                  increase the risks of participating in the study.  The specific type of stress\n                  test will be selected at the PI's discretion.\n\n                  10. Active bacterial or systemic viral or fungal infections."
