            "textblock": "Background:\n\n      - Cabozantinib is a cancer treatment drug that blocks the growth of new blood vessels in\n      tumors. It can also block a chemical on tumor cells that allows the cells to grow. A similar\n      drug, pazopanib, is used to treat types of cancer known as sarcomas. Researchers want to see\n      if cabozantinib can be an effective treatment for types of soft tissue sarcoma that have not\n      responded to earlier treatments.\n\n      Objectives:\n\n      - To test the effectiveness of cabozantinib for soft tissue sarcomas that have not responded\n      to standard treatments.\n\n      Eligibility:\n\n      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have soft tissue sarcomas that have not responded\n      to standard treatments.\n\n      Design:\n\n        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood samples\n           will be collected. Imaging studies and other tests will be used to study the tumor\n           before the start of treatment.\n\n        -  Participants will take cabozantinib tablets daily for 28-day cycles of treatment. The\n           tablets should be taken whole on an empty stomach.\n\n        -  Treatment will be monitored with frequent blood tests and imaging studies. -\n           Participants will continue to take cabozantinib for as long as the tumor does not\n           become worse and the side effects are not too severe."

Patients will be stratified based on prior\n             VEGFR-TKI therapy.\n\n          -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are\n             currently available on the use of cabozantinib in patients < 18 years of age,\n             children are excluded from this study.\n\n          -  ECOG performance status less than or equal to 1 (Karnofsky > 70%).\n\n          -  Life expectancy >  3 months.\n\n          -  Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:\n\n               -  leukocytes greater than or equal to 3,000/mcL\n\n               -  absolute neutrophil count greater than or equal to 1,500/mcL\n\n               -  platelets greater than or equal to 100,000/mcL\n\n               -  total bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 times ULN\n\n               -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) less than or equal to 2.5 times institutional upper limit of\n                  normal creatinine within normal institutional limits\n\n        OR\n\n          -  creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) for patients with\n             creatinine levels above institutional normal.\n\n          -  hemoglobin greater than or equal to 9 g/dL\n\n          -  serum albumin greater than or equal to 2.8g/dL\n\n          -  lipase < 2.0 times ULN and no radiologic or clinical evidence of pancreatitis\n\n          -  urine protein/creatinine ratio (UPCR) less than or equal to 1\n\n          -  serum phosphorus calcium, magnesium and potassium greater than or equal to LLN\n\n          -  (PT)/ International Normalized Ratio (INR) or partial thromboplastin time\n\n          -  (PTT) test < 1.3 times the laboratory ULN\n\n               -  Subjects must have blood pressure (BP) no greater than 140 mmHg (systolic) and\n                  90 mmHg (diastolic) for eligibility.

Tablets must not be crushed or\n                  chewed.\n\n               -  The effects of cabozantinib on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this\n                  reason and because receptor tyrosine kinases are known to be teratogenic, women\n                  of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception. All\n                  subjects of reproductive potential must agree to use both a barrier method and a\n                  second method of birth control during the course of the study and for 4 months\n                  after the last dose of study drug(s).\n\n        Sexually active subjects (men and women) must agree to use medically accepted barrier\n        methods of contraception (e.g., male or female condom) during the course of the study and\n        for 4 months after the last dose of study drug(s), even if oral contraceptives are also\n        used.\n\n        -Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.\n\n        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:\n\n          -  Patients who have had anticancer therapy, including kinase inhibitors, within 4 weeks\n             (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who\n             have not recovered to baseline from adverse events (except alopecia and other\n             non-clinically significant AEs) due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.\n             Prior VEGFR therapy should have been completed at least 3 months prior to enrollment.\n             Patients who have received prior cabozantinib or inhibitors of c-MET or HGF are\n             ineligible.\n\n          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents within 28 days before the\n             first dose of the study treatment.\n\n          -  The subject has received radionuclide treatment within 6 weeks of the first dose of\n             study treatment\n\n          -  The subject has received radiation therapy:\n\n               -  to the thoracic cavity, abdomen, or pelvis within 3 months before the first dose\n                  of study treatment, or has ongoing complications, or is without complete\n                  recovery and healing from prior radiation therapy.\n\n               -  to bone or brain metastasis within 14 days before the first dose of study\n                  treatment\n\n               -  to any other site(s) within 28 days before the first dose of study treatment.\n\n          -  Patients with active brain metastases or carcinomatous meningitis or epidural disease\n             are excluded from this clinical trial. Subjects with brain metastases previously\n             treated with whole brain radiation or radiosurgery or subjects with epidural disease\n             previously treated with radiation who are asymptomatic and have remained stable for 4\n             weeks and do not require steroid treatment for at least 2 weeks before starting study\n             treatment are eligible. Neurosurgical resection of brain metastases or brain biopsy\n             is permitted if completed at least 3 months before starting study treatment. Baseline\n             brain imaging with contrast-enhanced CT or MRI scans for subjects with known brain\n             metastases is required to confirm eligibility.\n\n          -  Eligibility of subjects receiving any medications or substances known to affect or\n             with the potential to affect the activity of cabozantinib will be determined\n             following review of their cases by the Principal Investigator. Patients who are\n             taking enzyme-inducing anticonvulsant agents are not eligible.\n\n          -  Patients with refractory nausea and vomiting, chronic gastrointestinal diseases\n             (e.g., inflammatory bowel disease), or significant bowel resection that could\n             interfere with absorption.\n\n          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to symptomatic\n             congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or\n             psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study\n             requirements.\n\n          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because cabozantinib has the potential\n             for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential\n             risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with\n             cabozantinib, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with\n             cabozantinib.\n\n          -  Strong inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A4 can affect levels of cabozantinib and should\n             be avoided whenever possible or switched to alternatives. Subjects requiring chronic\n             concomitant treatment of strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., dexamethasone, phenytoin,\n             carbamazepine, rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentin, phenobarbital, and St. John   s Wort)\n             are not eligible for this study. Because the lists of these agents are constantly\n             changing, it is important to regularly consult a frequently-updated list such as\n             http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/; medical reference texts such as the\n             Physicians    Desk Reference may also provide this information. As part of the\n             enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of\n             interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be\n             prescribed or if the patient is considering a new overthe-counter medicine or herbal\n             product.\n\n          -  HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of\n             the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with cabozantinib. Appropriate studies\n             will be undertaken in patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when\n             indicated.\n\n          -  The subject has PT/INR or PTT test greater than or equal to 1.3 times the laboratory\n             ULN within 7 days before the first dose of study treatment.\n\n          -  The subject requires concomitant treatment, in therapeutic doses, with anticoagulants\n             such as warfarin or warfarin-related agents, heparin, thrombin or Factor Xa\n             inhibitors, or antiplatelet agents (e.g., clopidogrel). Low dose aspirin (less than\n             or equal to 81 mg/day), low-dose warfarin (less than or equal to 1 mg/day), and\n             prophylactic low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) are permitted.\n\n          -  The subject has experienced any of the following\n\n               -  clinically-significant gastrointestinal bleeding within 6 months before the\n                  first dose of study treatment\n\n               -  hemoptysis of greater than or equal to 0.5 teaspoon (2.5 mL) of red blood within\n                  3 months before the first dose of study treatment\n\n               -  any other signs indicative of pulmonary hemorrhage within 3 months before the\n                  first dose of study treatment\n\n          -  The subject has radiographic evidence of cavitating pulmonary lesion(s).\n\n          -  The subject has tumor in contact with, invading, or encasing any major blood vessels\n\n          -  The subject has evidence of tumor invading the GI tract (esophagus, stomach, small or\n             large bowel, rectum or anus), or any evidence of endotracheal or endobronchial tumor\n             within 28 days before the first dose of cabozantinib\n\n          -  The subject has uncontrolled, significant intercurrent or recent illness including,\n             but not limited to, the following conditions:\n\n               1.
