        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects with chronic HIV‐1 infection, as documented by ELISA and confirmed by
             Western blot at any time prior to study entry. HIV‐1 culture, HIV‐1 antigen, plasma
             HIV‐1 RNA, or a second antibody test by a method other than ELISA is acceptable as an
             alternative confirmatory test.

          2. Antiretroviral medication

               -  Cohort 1: Subjects on HAART (no changes to treatment within 4 weeks of study
                  entry) for at least 3 months.

               -  Cohort 2: Subjects off any anti‐retroviral therapy for at least 12 weeks. These
                  subjects can be treatment naïve or patients who interrupted ART for various
                  reasons for at least 12 weeks before the screening visit.

          3. Plasma HIV viremia

               -  Cohort 1: HIV‐1‐positive men and women &gt;18 years of age with HIV‐1‐RNA levels
                  undetectable by ultrasensitive HIV PCR Abbott assay at screening. Also eligible
                  are subjects with HIV‐1 RNA &lt; 400 copies/mL; however, the HIV‐1 RNA must be &lt; 50
                  copies/mL within 60 days prior to study entry based on the Abbott assay.
                  Subjects with intermittent isolated episodes of detectable low level viremia (&gt;
                  50 but &lt;1,000 copies RNA/mL; blips) will be eligible. There should be at least 2
                  documented HIV‐1 RNA assays, one drawn &gt;3 months before study entry, one drawn
                  &lt;3 months before study entry.

               -  Cohort 2: HIV‐1‐positive men and women &gt;18 years of age with detectable viremia
                  (1,000‐10,000 copies/ml) and who are off HAART for at least 3 months.

          4. CD4 counts

               -  Cohort 1: Subjects with CD4 counts &gt;200 cells/mm3.

               -  Cohort 2: Subjects with CD4 counts of at least 500 cells/mm3 at screening. CD4+
                  T cell counts should have been obtained within 60 days prior to study entry.

          5. Adequate venous access and no other contraindications for leukapheresis.

          6. Laboratory values obtained within 60 days prior to entry.

               -  Hemoglobin: ≥ 10.0 (males); ≥ 9.5 (females) g/dL

               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC): ≥ 1000/mm3

               -  Platelet count: ≥ 75,000/mm3

               -  Serum creatinine: ≤ 1.5 mg/dL (133μ mol/L)

               -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT): ≤ 2.5 times
                  the upper limit of normal (ULN).

          7. Subjects must be willing to comply with study‐mandated evaluations. Rectal biopsy
             procedures are optional.

          8. Be male or female, 18 years of age and older.

          9. Ability and willingness of subject to provide informed consent.

         10. Have a Karnofsky Performance Score of 70 or higher.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Current or prior AIDS diagnosis.

          2. Concomitant acute or chronic hepatitis B (surface antigen positive) or hepatitis C
             infection. If HCV antibody test is positive, an HCV RNA test will be performed. If
             both HCV tests (antibody and RNA) are positive, the subjects will be excluded from
             study. If HCV antibody test is positive, but HCV RNA test is negative, subject can
             enroll.

          3. History of cancer or malignancy, with the exception of successfully treated basal
             cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.

          4. History or any features on physical examination indicative of active or unstable
             cardiac disease or hemodynamic instability. NOTE: subjects with a history of cardiac
             disease may participate with a physician's approval.

          5. History or any features on physical examination indicative of a bleeding diathesis.

          6. Have been previously treated with any HIV experimental vaccine within 6 months prior
             to screening, or any previous gene therapy using an integrating vector.

          7. Use of chronic corticosteroids, hydroxyurea, or immunomodulating agents (e.g.,
             interleukin‐2, interferon‐alpha or ‐gamma, granulocyte colony stimulating factors,
             etc.) within 30 days prior to study entry.

             NOTE: Recent or current use of inhaled steroids is not exclusionary. If subjects are
             prescribed a brief course of oral corticosteroids, the use should be limited to less
             than 7 days.

          8. Use of steroids before apheresis and immune assessment blood draws should be
             discouraged as it will affect white blood cell function.

          9. Breast‐feeding, pregnant, or unwilling to use acceptable methods of birth control.

         10. Use of aspirin, dipyrdamole, warfarin or any other medication that is likely to
             affect platelet function or other aspects of blood coagulation during the 2‐week
             period prior to leukapheresis.

         11. Active drug or alcohol use or dependence that, in the opinion of the site
             investigator, would interfere with adherence to study requirements.

         12. Serious illness requiring systemic treatment and/or hospitalization within 30 days
             prior to study entry.

         13. Asymptomatic baseline serum chemistry elevations in total or indirect bilirubin in
             subjects receiving atazanavir or indinavir is not exclusionary. Asymptomatic baseline
             serum chemistry elevations in LFTs, lipase and creatinine due to HAART medication are
             not exclusionary, when in the opinion of the investigator, the abnormalities are not
             attributable to intrinsic hepatorenal disease. Such elevations must be due to HAART.

         14. Receipt of a vaccination within 30 days prior to study entry. NOTE: It is recommended
             that subjects enrolling into this study should have completed their routine
             vaccinations (hepatitis A, hepatitis B, pneumococcus, and tetanus diphtheria booster)
             at least 30 days prior to screening for the study.

         15. Have an allergy or hypersensitivity to study product excipients (human serum albumin,
             DMSO and Dextran 40).
