  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this prospective study is twofold: 1) to establish oral tolerance to selected
      tree nuts and to examine potential predictors of oral tolerance and 2) to determine the
      usefulness of mixed tree nut allergen food challenges in more efficiently defining tree nut
      allergy and oral tolerance.

      To evaluate the absence of tree nuts (TN) allergy, referred patients from one of the
      Arkansas Children's Hospital (ACH) Allergy Clinic physicians with current serum
      immunoglobulin E (IgE) to TNs that meet eligibility criteria will be invited to undergo a
      series of open mixed TN food challenges.

      A questionnaire pertaining to their TN allergy will be administered

      A brief physical exam will be performed.

      Skin prick tests using selected nut allergen extracts along with a positive (histamine) and
      a negative (salt-water) control will be performed at the first oral food challenge visit.

      Each food challenges will be performed to 1 to 3 TNs.

    <description>We postulate that by grouping TN that are mixed into one food challenge based on the individual's TN serum IgE will be more efficient in defining TN allergy and tolerance. One to three TNs will be in one food challenge based on TN IgE testing.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Any patient between 3-21 years of age followed by the Allergy and Immunology
             Department at Arkansas Children's Hospital on tree nut avoidance diet.

          -  Has current serum IgE test within the past 12 months to major nuts in question. All
             TN serum IgE are &lt;10

          -  Children must have a stable baseline examination prior to undergoing challenge
             without significant symptoms of atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinoconjunctivitis,
             current urticaria or other allergic symptoms deemed important by the physician.

          -  Children must have stable asthma and no wheezing or repetitive cough prior to
             challenge, nor have been treated with oral steroids for a significant asthma
             exacerbation within 1 month of challenge.  Asthmatics that undergo lung function
             testing.

          -  Children must have no current illness (e.g., fever or viral illness) at time of
             challenge.

          -  The subject will be asked to restrict the use of antihistamines (short acting, 72
             hours: long acting, 5-7 days), (B-agonists (12 hours), theophylline (12 hours), and
             cromolyn (12 hours) prior to the first mixed TN food challenge.  Other medications
             may be continued.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any TN serum IgE â‰¥10.

          -  Life-threatening reaction (respiratory involvement requiring medications, or shock,
             or gastrointestinal reaction requiring intravenous fluids) to any TN.

          -  History of a reaction in the past year or severe reaction in the past 2 years or a
             history of a severe reaction anytime with a TN serum IgE &gt;5

          -  Unstable asthma, gastrointestinal disease, cardiovascular disease, chronic lung
             disease, beta-blocker use.
