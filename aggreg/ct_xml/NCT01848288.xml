  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if intra-operative phacoemulsification machine
      metrics are lower after phacoemulsification with the CENTURION vision system compared with
      the INFINITI vision system.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Eligible to undergo cataract extraction via phacoemulsification with primary ACRYSOF
             Intraocular Lens (IOL) implantation;

          -  Free of severe disease(s)/condition(s) listed in the &quot;Warnings&quot; and &quot;Precautions&quot;
             section of implanted ACRYSOF IOL;

          -  Willing to undergo second eye surgery within 14 days of first eye surgery;

          -  Willing and able to understand/sign a written Informed Consent Document;

          -  Willing and able to return for scheduled follow-up examinations;

          -  Other protocol-defined inclusion criteria may apply.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Planned multiple procedures at the time of surgery or during the course of the study
             (eg, LASIK, LRI, etc.);

          -  Previous intraocular or corneal surgery of any kind;

          -  Poorly dilating pupil;

          -  Severe retinal disorders (eg, macular degeneration, proliferative diabetic
             retinopathy);

          -  Corneal disease (eg, herpes simplex, herpes zoster, etc) or retinal detachment;

          -  Severe conditions that per Investigator's clinical judgment would increase the
             operative risk or confound the result of this investigation;

          -  Female patients who are pregnant, lactating, or planning to be pregnant during the
             course of the study;

          -  Currently participating in another drug or device clinical trial, or participated in
             another drug or device clinical trial within 30 days of enrollment into this trial;

          -  Other protocol-defined exclusion criteria may apply.
