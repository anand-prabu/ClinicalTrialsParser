Patients are stratified\n      according to participating center. Patients are randomized to one of three treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive an oral placebo weekly.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive low-dose oral oltipraz weekly.\n\n        -  Arm III: Patients receive high-dose oral oltipraz weekly. Treatment continues for 12\n           weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed at 4 weeks.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 66 patients (22 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this\n      study within 21 months."
