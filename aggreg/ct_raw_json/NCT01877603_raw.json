            "textblock": "Irisin  is  a  signaling  protein  that  is  released  into  the  blood from  skeletal\n      muscle  after  proteolysis  of  the  membrane protein  FNDC5 .  FNDC5,  encoded  by  the\n      Fndc5  gene. Irisin activity  on  subcutaneous  white  adipose  tissue,  both  in  culture\n      and  in  vivo,  stimulated  UCP1  expression  and  induction  of brown  adipocytes  in\n      white  adipose  tissue  depots,  a  process known  as  white  fat  ''browning''.  Irisin\n      increases  total energy  expenditure  in  animal  models,  and  irisin  expression  in mice\n      fed  a  high  fat  diet  resulted  in  a  significant  improvement in  glucose  tolerance\n      and  a  reduction  in  fasting  insulin  levels.  Collectively,  these  data  suggest  that\n      decreased  serum irisin  levels  may  be  associated  with  the  development  of  insulin\n      resistance  and  Type 2 diabetes. Indeed,  some studies showed that  irisin  levels  were\n      decreased  in  newly  diagnosed  Type 2 diabetes.\n\n      Endothelial dysfunction is an early physiological event in atherosclerosis. However, to\n      date, no data are available on the relationship between circulating irisin and endothelial\n      dysfunction in diabetes. Therefore, the investigators hypothesized that circulating irisin\n      level is associated with endothelial dysfunction."
