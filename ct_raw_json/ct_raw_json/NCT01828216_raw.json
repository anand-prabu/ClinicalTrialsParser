This study aims to assess the role of an ambulatory approach with\n      home diagnostic sleep study. We hypothesize that the ambulatory approach is as good as the\n      conventional approach in managing OSA in terms of improvement of clinical outcome but the\n      former approach will lead to substantial cost savings."
