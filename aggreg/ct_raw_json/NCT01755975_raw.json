These drugs are\n      romidepsin and lenalidomide. Both these drugs by themselves have been used to treat lymphoma\n      or multiple myeloma. However, while these drugs are routinely used alone, this is the first\n      time they will be tested together. The mechanism of action of both drugs is not well\n      understood but both have been shown to to be effective by themselves in lymphoma and\n      multiple myeloma."
