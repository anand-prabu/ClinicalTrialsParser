Patient specific instrumentation is an\n      individualised system for total knee replacement surgery.  The system has been marketed and\n      is already in use in some centres. The process is similar to traditional knee replacement\n      surgery but approximately 6 weeks prior to the operation patients will undergo an MRI scan\n      of their knee, hip and ankle.  From this data the dimensions and rotation of the knee can be\n      accurately measured, and a custom made jig can be made specific to that patients anatomy.\n      The jig is used intra-operatively to make accurate bone cuts according to this pre-operative\n      plan, the type of implant used remains the same but the sizing of the components, and\n      alignment of the implant is expected to improve.  This study assesses any improvement in\n      implant alignment in using the patient specific instrumentation, any improved\n      intra-operative outcomes and any long term  clinical outcome improvements for patients."
