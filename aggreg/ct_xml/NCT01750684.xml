        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female between 18 and 65 years of age, inclusive

          -  Acute traumatic SCI, at a neurological level between C4 and T11

          -  No evidence of penetrating or transection injury (e.g. caused by projectile or stab
             wound)

          -  Neurological ASIA Impairment Scale A, B or C

          -  Patient is able to provide written or verbal witnessed consent. If unable to provide
             either, consent may be provided by legally authorized representative (LAR)

          -  Patient is able to initiate treatment within time window of injury

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known allergy or hypersensitivity to polyethylene glycol

          -  Mental impairment or other conditions that would preclude a reliable ASIA exam or
             adequate consent

          -  Positive urine pregnancy test result

          -  Serum creatinine level â‰¥ 2 mg/dL

          -  History or active renal failure or dialysis

          -  Mean arterial blood pressure &lt; 60 mmHg despite vasopressor treatment

          -  On a current regimen of digoxin

          -  Chronic use of magnesium salts prior to the SCI (within 1week of presentation) and/or
             the use of magnesium salts in the acute care setting prior to the administration of
             investigational product

          -  Any other medical condition that, in the judgment of the investigator, would preclude
             provision of informed consent, make participation in the study unsafe, or
             unreasonably complicate follow-up or the interpretation of study outcome data or may
             otherwise interfere with achieving the study objectives

          -  In the judgment of the Investigator, cannot adequately provide informed consent, is
             likely to be non-compliant, or may be unable to cooperate with study requirements
