      The purpose of this study is to collect data to describe the real-world use and safety and
      effectiveness of MelaFind® in a post-approval clinical setting.

      The primary objective of this study to test the hypothesis that, among eligible and
      evaluable lesions with central histological reference standard status melanoma or high-grade
      lesion, the relative sensitivity ρ comparing enrolling dermatologists after MelaFind use
      with enrolling dermatologists if MelaFind were not available is greater than 110%. This
      represents a clinically meaningful increase in sensitivity.

      The secondary objectives of this study are to evaluate real-world use and safety and
      effectiveness of MelaFind in a clinical setting.

        All patients of any age, race, ethnicity, or gender, presenting with pigmented skin
        lesions that that meet the Indications for Use and Lesion Inclusion and Exclusion
        Criteria, including signing the Informed Consent Form, are eligible to participate in this
        study. This single-arm study has one study group consisting of eligible lesions on
        eligible patients.

        Up to six clinical sites in the US will participate in this study, one in each of the
        first six states in which MelaFind is commercially available. Three of the sites will be
        located in urban settings, and three will be located in a suburban or rural setting. At
        least 50% of the sites will new, i.e., they did not participate in the MelaFind pivotal
        study. Some sites will be academic centers and some private practices.
