Purpose To compare MiraLAX versus placebo for preventing constipation in the immediate\n      postoperative period following pelvic reconstructive surgery in women taking routine\n      docusate sodium.\n\n      B. Objectives\n\n        1. Specific Aims Specific Aim 1:  To compare time to first bowel movement (BM) between\n           MiraLAX versus placebo in women receiving routine docusate sodium after pelvic\n           reconstructive surgery.\n\n           Specific Aim 2: To compare patient reported outcomes of BM quality and associated\n           gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms between MiraLAX versus placebo using the Bristol stool\n           scale and the validated Patient Assessment of Constipation Symptom Questionnaire\n           (PAC-SYM) in women receiving routine docusate sodium after pelvic reconstructive\n           surgery.\n\n           Specific Aim 3: To evaluate GI-related quality of life between MiraLAX versus placebo\n           utilizing the validated Patient Assessment of Constipation Quality-of-Life\n           Questionnaire (PAC-QOL) in women receiving routine docusate sodium after pelvic\n           reconstructive surgery.\n\n        2. Hypotheses The investigators hypothesize that MiraLAX will optimally prevent\n           constipation following pelvic reconstructive surgery by decreasing time to first BM,\n           decreasing GI symptoms associated with constipation, and increasing measures of\n           GI-related quality of life, while minimizing the bothersome side effects associated\n           with stimulant laxatives."
