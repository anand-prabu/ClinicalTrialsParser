            "textblock": "Erectile dysfunction (ED) is the inability to develop and maintain an erection for\n      satisfactory sexual intercourse or activity. ED is a highly prevalent medical condition\n      often associated with multiple causes. It is estimated that more than 50 million American\n      men suffer from mild/moderate to severe erectile dysfunction. Roughly 50% of men in their\n      50's, 60% of men in their 60's, and 70% of men in their 70's suffer from ED. The economic\n      impact of ED is in the billions of dollars. More than 5 billion dollars a year are spent on\n      the three pro-erectile medications currently in the market.\n\n      Penile vibratory stimulation mimics rapid and repetitive manual/hand stimulation of the\n      penis, which is a natural aspect of human sexual behavior. For more than a century, tens of\n      millions of women use vibratory devices on daily/regular basis for purpose of sexual\n      pleasure/orgasm. Vibratory stimulation of genitalia is considered safe by the medical\n      community with important benefits, such as treatment of orgasmic dysfunction, stress urinary\n      incontinence, ejaculation, and erection. No significant physical or emotional side-effects\n      have been reported in the medical literature, or the popular media. A recent epidemiological\n      study of the use of vibrators by American women and men has shown no complaints, and\n      generally high satisfaction and improvement in sexual response.\n\n      Penile erection is controlled by spinal autonomic centers, the activity of which is\n      dependent on input from supraspinal centers and genitalia. From a neurophysiological\n      viewpoint, scientists believe that penile erection is a culmination of multiple successful\n      nerve reflexes that initiate a vascular event. Simultaneous vibratory stimulation of both\n      surfaces of the penis at high frequency (70-110 Hz) for 7-10 minutes can lead to\n      reflexogenic gradual filling of the penis (minutes) with arterial blood by activating the\n      pudendo-cavernosal reflex. Additional physiological effects include progressive rhythmic\n      contraction of the perineal muscles via activation of bulbocavernosus reflex, which helps in\n      strengthening rigidity of erection. This will prepare the user for successful sexual\n      intercourse. Subsequent orgasm and ejaculation can be very strong and amplified due to\n      stronger contraction of the bulbospongiosus muscle and activation of higher ejaculatory\n      centers.\n\n      The purpose of this multicenter study is to assess daily or on-demand ease of use, safety,\n      satisfaction, and efficacy of the home use of the Viberect device  (FDA cleared)  by men\n      with mild to moderate and no erectile dysfunction."
