      This research is being conducted to determine whether use of an arch-supporting insole
      during pregnancy prevents alterations in foot structure and lower limb rotational movements.
      The investigators hypothesize that the arch collapse during pregnancy will be significantly
      reduced in women randomized to use the supportive insole compared with women randomized to
      the control group.

      Musculoskeletal impairments are a significant cause of functional limitations and disability
      in women. Women are at higher risk for osteoarthritis in comparison with men [1] and
      functional limitations due to arthritis are also more common in women. [2, 3] In addition,
      women are disproportionately affected (risk compared with men) by knee osteoarthritis
      (1.8x),[4] greater trochanteric pain syndrome (3.3x),[5] incident hip osteoarthritis[6] and
      chronic joint pain (1.3x),[7] including foot pain[8] knee pain[9] hip pain[9-12] and low
      back pain (1.2x).[7, 13] Preventing even a portion of these could avoid functional
      limitations and disability, enhance quality of life and result in considerable savings.[2]
      However, the etiology for the increased risk for these musculoskeletal diseases and
      impairments has not been elucidated.[1] Acute Changes in Foot Structure Are Reported with
      Pregnancy The disproportionate risk for these musculoskeletal problems may, in part, relate
      to biochemical and biomechanical changes that occur in a woman's body during pregnancy. For
      example, hallux valgus deformity, lateral deviation of the great toe often in conjunction
      with a bunion deformity, occurs in women at nine times the rate of men.[14] Both of these
      have been linked to reduction in arch height.[15] Body mass increases by an average of 9-13
      kg during pregnancy.[16] There is also a seven to ten-fold increase in the relaxin level
      during pregnancy,[17-19] a peptide hormone produced by the corpus luteum which increases the
      flexibility and remodeling of collagen in central and peripheral joints in pregnant
      women.[17, 18, 20-26] Bearing increased weight on joints with increased laxity during
      pregnancy could potentially lead to permanent changes in the feet.[19, 26-28] Increases in
      foot length, width, and volume have been reported during pregnancy.[29, 30, 31] In addition
      to the anatomic changes in the foot, there are also changes in gait pattern during
      pregnancy.[32-35] Nyska found that the center of pressure on the foot during pregnancy
      shifts posteriorly to compensate for the increased anterior abdominal mass.[36] The
      combination of ligamentous laxity in the arch, increased body mass with pregnancy and the
      shift in the center of pressure towards the posterior part of the foot may potentially
      contribute to stretching of the ligaments supporting the arch, leading to loss of arch
      height.

      More important than the foot changes that have been reported during pregnancy is the issue
      that these changes persist following completion of pregnancy. In a self-report study, we
      found a dose-response relationship between the number of pregnancies and the frequency of a
      report of a permanent change in foot size in women age 18-45.[37] We then conducted a
      longitudinal study to determine whether arch height loss both occurs and persists
      postpartum. Sixty women in their first trimester of pregnancy were enrolled and arch height
      and function were measured at baseline and approximately 19 weeks postpartum. There was a
      significant decrease in arch height and arch rigidity index at follow-up, with concomitant
      increases in foot length and arch drop. This study revealed that, not only was pregnancy
      associated with a permanent loss of arch height, but also the first pregnancy appeared to be
      the most significant with a reduction in arch rigidity (p&lt;0.0001) and increases in foot
      length (p&lt;0.0001), arch drop (p=0.0019) and center of pressure excursion during gait
      (p=0.0019). These changes in the feet could contribute to the increased risk for subsequent
      musculoskeletal disorders.

      Arch Height Loss Leads to Adverse Biomechanical Changes at Other Joints Consideration of the
      effect of foot structure on forces and torques at other joints in the lower limb and spine
      as well as the need for energy generation and absorption by associated soft-tissue
      structures illustrates the importance of these potential changes. With each step, a series
      of events occurs that elicits biomechanical effects and compensations throughout the lower
      limb kinetic chain, in which movement at each joint influences movement at other joints in
      the chain.[38] Disruption of the complex interactions between skeletal, musculotendinous and
      ligamentous structures through loss of arch height may predispose to painful musculoskeletal
      conditions.[39-43] As the initial link in body loading during stance and movement, the feet
      are &quot;where the rubber hits the road.&quot; The arch dynamically deforms to distribute the force,
      thereby absorbing the rapid impulse of loading. Changes in foot biomechanics that occur with
      changes in the foot structure alter the normal control of forces propagating from the foot
      to more proximal lower limb joints and the spine,[44] and contribute to pain in the feet,
      knees, hips,[41-43] and low back.

      Possibly the most common cause of such changes in biomechanics is the loss of arch height.
      Excessive pronation strains the supporting structures of the foot and tendons that cross the
      ankle, leads to impaired balance,[45] can strain passive stabilizers such as the Achilles
      tendon, iliotibial band,[46] and anterior cruciate ligament,[47] and can contribute to
      permanent impairments in the soft tissue structures in the lower limbs.[47, 48] Thus,
      excessive pronation has been implicated in numerous musculoskeletal complaints, through
      pathologically re-distributing the ground reaction force over the foot,[49] changing
      patellar tracking in the femoral trochlea,[50] changing the angle of pull of muscular
      stabilizers in the lower limbs, and inducing a functional leg length inequality that alters
      hip and spine loading.[1] Therefore, there is a need to address this gap in knowledge to
      inform preventive interventions if there are musculoskeletal sequellae.

      Biomechanical Changes Contribute to Musculoskeletal Disease Risk As mentioned previously,
      the permanent loss of arch height that occurs in about 40% of women with pregnancy leads to
      excessive pronation of the foot. This foot posture causes increased rotation of the
      tibia[51] and is communicated across the knee. These torques, in turn, may increase
      compressive and shear stress on the medial tibiofemoral and lateral patellofemoral
      compartments of the knee. This is important in light of previous work demonstrating that
      elevated contact stress is predictive of development of incident symptomatic knee
      osteoarthritis,[52] and the relative risk for knee replacement surgery increases with the
      number of pregnancies carried.[53] Closing Knowledge Gaps May Attenuate Musculoskeletal
      Disease Risk in Women In consideration of the evidence to date that pregnancy leads to a
      drop in the arch and that loss of the arch may contribute to musculoskeletal disease and
      disablement, there is a compelling rationale to characterize whether use of arch supports
      during pregnancy can prevent these adverse changes in foot structure during pregnancy. The
      proposed study will randomize women to either an arch-supportive insole or a control
      group(that does not wear insoles) and will measure static and dynamic arch structure in the
      early part of the first trimester and then again 8 weeks postpartum. Successful completion
      will inform the extent to which loss of arch height with pregnancy can be ameliorated using
      a conservative physical medicine intervention. This line of research holds great potential
      to inform preventive interventions to reduce the disproportionate risk for musculoskeletal
      disease and disability borne by women.
