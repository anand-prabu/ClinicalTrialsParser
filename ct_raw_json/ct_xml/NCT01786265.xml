    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if treatment with hormone therapy in
      combination with abiraterone acetate and prednisone for 8 months controls the disease better
      than treatment with standard hormone therapy alone.

      Abiraterone acetate is designed to decrease the production of testosterone (male sex
      hormones), which plays a role in causing prostate cancer to grow.

      Prednisone is commonly used to treat prostate cancer and is given along with abiraterone
      acetate treatment to help lower or prevent some side effects.

      Study Groups and Study Drug Administration:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be randomly assigned
      (like the flip of a coin) to 1 of 2 groups.  You will have an equal chance of being assigned
      to each group.

      If you are in Group 1, you will receive standard of care hormonal therapy. The study doctor
      will decide what hormone therapy you will receive and will explain when and how you should
      take the hormone therapy and any risks.

      If you are in Group 2, you will also receive standard of car hormone therapy.  In addition,
      you will take 4 abiraterone acetate tablets by mouth each day at least 1 hour before a meal
      and 2 hours after a meal. You will also take prednisone every day.

      About every 28-days is considered a &quot;cycle.&quot;  You should return all unused study drug and/or
      empty pill bottles at the end of each cycle.

      Study Visits:

      Every 2 weeks (for the first 12 weeks), if you are in Group 2, blood (about 1-2 tablespoons)
      will be drawn to test your liver function. These tests may be done at a local facility and
      results faxed to MD Anderson.

      On Day 1 of Even Cycles (2, 4, 6, and so on):

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs.

        -  Your performance status will be recorded.

        -  You will be asked about any side effects you may have had and any drugs or treatments
           you may be receiving.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, to check your liver
           function, and for PSA testing.

      On Day 1 of Odd Cycles (1, 3, 5, and so on):

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs.

        -  You will be asked about any side effects you may have had and any drugs or treatments
           you may be receiving.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, to check your liver
           function, and for PSA and testosterone testing.

        -  You will have a bone scan to check the status of the disease

        -  You will have a chest x-ray and CT scans to check the status of the disease. If you are
           unable to return to MD Anderson, follow-up scans may be done at a local facility. The
           scans should be sent to MD Anderson for review.

      Length of Study:

      You may receive the study drugs for up to 8 cycles.  You will no longer be able to take the
      study drug if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are
      unable to follow study directions.

      Your participation on the study will be over after the follow-up visits.

      End of Treatment Visit:

      When you are no longer taking the study drugs:

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs.

        -  Your performance status will be recorded.

        -  You will be asked about any side effects you may have had and any drugs or treatments
           you may be receiving.

        -  Blood (about 3-4 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, to check your liver
           function, and to check your PSA and your testosterone level.

        -  You will have a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy performed to check the status of your
           disease.

      Long-Term Follow-Up:

      Every 3 months, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn to test your PSA level. This may be
      done at your local physician's office and the results faxed to MD Anderson.

      Every 6 months:

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs.

        -  Your performance status will be recorded.

        -  You will be asked about any side effects you may have had and any drugs or treatments
           you may be receiving.

        -  Blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, to check your liver
           function, your PSA level and your testosterone level.

      The follow-up visits will continue as long as the disease is stable.

      Extension Crossover Study Phase:

      If the disease gets worse while you are on study, you will be eligible for the extension
      phase. If you received hormone therapy alone, you will be treated with the combination of
      hormones and abiraterone acetate plus prednisone for 8 months. If you received the
      combination therapy, you will receive hormone therapy alone.

      If you crossover to the other treatment group on this study, you will have a bone marrow
      aspirate and biopsy collected to check the status of your disease.  The schedule for visits
      in the extension study will be identical to the schedule described above.  When you have
      completed the additional 8 months of treatment, and an additional follow-up period (lasting
      as long as the disease is stable), you will have another bone marrow aspirate and biopsy
      performed.

      This is an investigational study.  Abiraterone acetate is FDA approved in combination with
      prednisone for the treatment of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate
      cancer who have received prior chemotherapy containing docetaxel.   Prednisone is FDA
      approved and commercially available as a corticosteroid. The use of hormone therapy in
      combination with abiraterone and prednisone in patients with prostate cancer is
      investigational.

      Up to 200 patients will be take part in this study.  All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.
