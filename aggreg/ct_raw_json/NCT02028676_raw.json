The first strategy compares clinically driven monitoring\n      (CDM) with laboratory plus clinical monitoring (LCM). In both groups, tests for toxicity\n      (standard haematology and biochemistry panels) and efficacy (lymphocyte subsets including\n      CD4 count) will be done every 12 weeks. In LCM, all results will be returned for patient\n      management. In CDM, physicians may request results from routine haematology/biochemistry\n      panels if needed for clinical management, but results will not be returned routinely, and\n      lymphocyte subsets will never be returned. Extra laboratory tests may be requested outside\n      of the scheduled visits at any time in either group (except for lymphocyte subsets in CDM).\n      The second strategy compares a continuous WHO-recommended first-line ART three-drug\n      two-class regimen, comprising two Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NRTIs) plus\n      one Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor (NNRTI), with induction with four drugs\n      (two classes) for 36 weeks followed by maintenance with three drugs. After at least 36 and\n      96 weeks on ART respectively, two further randomisations will assess simplification\n      strategies which could improve long-term ART adherence (i) once versus twice daily\n      lamivudine+abacavir NRTI drugs (ii) stopping versus continuing daily cotrimoxazole\n      prophylaxis."
