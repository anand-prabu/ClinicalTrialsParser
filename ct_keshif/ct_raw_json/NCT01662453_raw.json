If the death has occurred within the past\n      24 hours, and the family is willing to consider donating tissue to the study, the subject\n      will be transferred to the Autism Tissue Program, and the remainder of the phone interview\n      will be conducted at a later time.\n\n      In addition to the phone interview, the family will be asked to provide access to the\n      deceased's medical records. Any costs involved in obtaining medical records will be covered\n      by the study, and all medical information will remain completely confidential."

SUDEP is not a cause of death so\n      much as it is a descriptive term for a category of unexplained deaths in people with\n      epilepsy or epilepsy-related conditions.  Little is known about SUDEP and its mechanisms and\n      risk factors.\n\n      One of the main objectives of this study is to investigate the role of various risk factors\n      in the development of sudden unexplained death in patients with epilepsy, with a particular\n      focus on the role of antiepileptic medications.  In addition, we want to elucidate the\n      pathophysiologic mechanisms leading to SUDEP."
