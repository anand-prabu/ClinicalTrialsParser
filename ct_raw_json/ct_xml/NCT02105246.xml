  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We are evaluate the effectiveness of a new telephone-based home cardiac rehabilitation on
      patient participation in rehab, exercise capacity, quality of life, cardiovascular events,
      and mortality.

      Eligible patients who are hospitalized for myocardial infarction, percutaneous coronary
      intervention, cardiac surgery, or heart failure will be invited to participate in the
      telephone-based home cardiac rehabilitation program. If patients do not want to participate
      in the home program, they will be offered referral to a facility-based cardiac
      rehabilitation (usual care). Facility-based and home-based cardiac rehabilitation programs
      are equally effective.

      Our new home-based program is based on a cardiac rehabilitation program endorsed by the
      American Heart Association (AHA) using the workbook and DVD, &quot;An Active Partnership for the
      Health of Your Heart&quot;. Patients will receive worksheets for recording exercise and food
      intake, written instructions for equipment, and other materials to supplement the Active
      Partnership book. After hospitalization, patients will be instructed on use of the study
      equipment (portable exercise peddler, pedometer, heart rate monitor, and blood pressure
      cuff) and given an individualized exercise prescription by an exercise physiologist.
