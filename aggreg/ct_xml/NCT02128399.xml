  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Antimicrobial exposure is known to reduce the selection for various drug-resistant
      organisms. Numerous studies have demonstrated the association between antimicrobial use and
      MDR bacteria detection. However, to the investigators knowledge, there is few data to
      support the concept that reducing antibiotic use actually leads to improvements in
      antibiotic susceptibilities. Moreover, antimicrobial stewardship was demonstrated to reduce
      MDRO and was strongly recommended in clinics. As the investigators know, antimicrobial
      overuse, which occurs commonly in China, induces a severe antibacterial resistance. China's
      Ministry of Health (MOH) has established a policy about the antimicrobial stewardship. To
      date, the investigators do not have published documentation the effects of this policy on
      multidrug-resistant organism (MDRO) in critically ill patients.
