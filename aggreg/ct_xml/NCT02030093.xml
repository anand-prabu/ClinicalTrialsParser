  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alcohol dependency is the second most common psychiatric disorder and a major public health
      concern. As addictive disorders and now thought to be chronic disorders for many patients
      there is a need for the development of expanded treatment approaches. Because relapse is
      more often the rule than the exception the importance of continuing care after an initial
      phase of treatment is evident. Studies investigating telephone-based continuing care for
      patients with alcohol dependence have shown to be an effective form of step-down treatment
      after a previous stabilisation treatment program and provide extended recovery support.
      Therefore, the investigators hypothesize that alcohol abstinent patients who received
      high-frequency telephone-based or sms-based continuing care show significantly less relapses
      respectively more abstinent days six and twelve months after in-patient treatment compared
      to patients who receive low-frequency or no telephone-based continuing care.

      Background

      Alcohol dependence is a major public health problem. Because of its relapsing nature of the
      disorder, alcohol and also drug dependence are now thought to be chronic disorders for many
      patients.Therefore, continuing care has become an important element in the treatment of
      alcohol dependence. Continuing care is referred to as ongoing care after an initial phase of
      intensive care and can be provided in different modalities and formats such as group
      counseling, telephone-based counseling, individual therapy and more. However, many
      substance-dependence patients do not attend any continuing care or abandon attending care to
      early. To approach this problem more flexible continuing care protocols that abstain from
      the traditional face-to-face counseling sessions have been developed to promote better
      adherence an improve disease management over time.  Studies on continuing care revealed
      mixed results that depend on the duration of the intervention and the method of delivery
      services. Longer planned intervention and active approaches that bring the intervention to
      the patients seem to be more effective than traditional approaches in the management of
      addiction. For instance studies investigating telephone-based continuing care for patients
      with alcohol dependence have shown to be an effective form of step-dow treatment after a
      previous stabilisation treatment program and provide extended recovery support. Results
      revealed that telephone-based continuing care produced higher rates of abstinence than
      face-to-face standard continuing care, especially patient with low to moderate risk scores
      benefited therefrom. Furthermore, it is a feasible instrument to implement a low-budget
      follow-up system in routine outcome monitoring.

      Objective

      In this study, the investigators want to evaluate the effectiveness of a high- versus
      low-frequency telephone-based and a short message-based continuing care provided for
      patients who have achieved a 12 week in-patient treatment for alcohol dependence. The
      investigators hypothesize that telephone-based continuing care should help the patients to
      bridge the gap of an intensive in-patient treatment to out-patient environment and working
      life.

      Methods

      320 patients will be recruited through the Clinic S端dhang (Bern) and the Forel Clinic
      (Z端rich), both specialized clinics for treatment of alcohol dependency. Patients, age 18-65,
      will have attended a 12-week in-patient treatment program for alcohol dependency.
      Participants are divided in 4 groups (high-frequency-, low-frequency-, sms- and control-
      group) by randomization. Patients of the high-frequency and sms group will be contacted 9
      times during the first 6 months while the low-frequency group will be called 2 times and the
      control group will not be contacted. All 4 groups are contacted after 6 months and 12
      months. The telephone continuing care consists of several cognitive-behavioral therapy
      components and includes monitoring of substance use status and progress towards identified
      goals, identification of current and anticipated high risk situations as well as development
      and rehearsal of improved coping behaviors. Each call lasts approximately 15 minutes.
