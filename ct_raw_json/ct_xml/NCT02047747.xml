      The purpose of this study is to determine the disease response, survival, and side effects
      of an experimental drug called dacomitinib in progressive brain metastases.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the use of the irreversible pan-ErB kinase
      inhibitor dacomitinib in the treatment of brain metastases, as measured by radiographic
      objective response rate.

      The rationale of this study is three-fold.  First, the use of dacomitinib, an irreversible
      pan-ErB kinase inhibitor, is to improve the duration of response seen by reversible, EGFR
      only inhibitors. Inhibition of the multiple ErB kinases may interfere with receptor
      cross-talk as a method of developing resistance; indeed, patients who have failed erlotinib
      treatment for systemic disease have seen responses to dacomitinib. The second rationale is
      to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of the penetration of dacomitinib into the CSF to determine
      if adequate drug levels reach the CNS, and determine if the current dosing regimen is
      appropriate. The third rationale is to determine if specific molecular phenotypes
      preferentially respond to dacomitinib. As part of this study, serum and cerebrospinal fluid
      will be collected and analyzed both for drug levels and for molecular markers to key
      elements of the ErB signaling cascade. The objective of the marker analysis to identify a
      distinct molecular phenotype that may preferentially respond to targeted drug therapy in the
      future.

    <description>To describe the safety of dacomitinib in terms of toxicity, adverse events, and the need for dose reductions.
After the first three subjects have been enrolled, accrual of additional subjects will be held for safety run-in analysis. Safety and toxicity data encountered through Day 28 of treatment Cycle 1 will be tabulated for the first three subjects, 28 days after the third of the first three patients is enrolled (about 3-4 months from the start of the study). If 1 of the 3 subjects experiences a dose-limiting toxicity by the end of cycle 1, an additional three subjects will be enrolled. If none of these additional subjects experiences a serious adverse event, then study enrollment will be reopened. If 2 subjects experience a dose-limiting toxicity, an additional three subjects will be enrolled at Dose Level -1, 30mg a day of Dacomitinib and the safety analysis for the next 3 patients will be repeated.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Pathologically (histologically or cytologically) documented extracranial diagnosis of
             primary lung cancer, melanoma, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2
             (HER2)-amplified breast cancer, or HER2-amplified gastric cancer, with brain
             metastasis detected by contrast enhanced MRI or CT is required. Patients with
             concurrent leptomeningeal diseases are eligible.

          -  Has progression and measureable brain disease in the brain by magnetic resonance
             imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT).

          -  Has stable, or no evidence of, extracranial disease and not receiving systemic
             therapy for extracranial disease.

        Note: Patients with stable disease must have already received standard therapy or are
        intolerant to standard therapy.
