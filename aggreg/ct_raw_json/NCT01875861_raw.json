            "textblock": "Treatment of psychotic disorders consists primarily of antipsychotic medications, which are\n      associated with metabolic side effects such as overweight/obesity, diabetes, and\n      dyslipidemia.  Expert consensus and evidence-based recommendations have been developed for\n      assessment and management of these conditions; however, research studies show deficits and\n      delays in metabolic monitoring for patients prescribed antipsychotics.  This purpose of this\n      study is to test a quality improvement intervention to enhance implementation of\n      recommendations for assessing and managing metabolic side effects in patients prescribed\n      antipsychotic medications.\n\n      Study Objectives are:\n\n        -  Objective 1:  To test the effect of an Evidence-Based Quality Improvement/Facilitation\n           (EBQI/F) intervention as an augmentation to a national implementation initiative on\n           rates of monitoring for metabolic side effects of antipsychotics in sites likely to\n           encounter greater challenges to implementation.\n\n        -  Objective 2:  To test the effect of the EBQI/F intervention as an augmentation to the\n           national implementation initiative on management of metabolic side effects of\n           antipsychotics in sites likely to encounter greater challenges to implementation.\n\n        -  Objective 3:  To assess the direct costs of the EBQI/F intervention, and explore\n           potential variations in costs of the EBQI/F intervention in sites with lower versus\n           higher organizational challenges.\n\n      Methods This study employs a cluster randomized design with eligible study sites including\n      VA Medical Centers with  300 patients receiving a new antipsychotic prescription in the\n      first six months of FY08.   Twelve sites have been recruited and matched according to level\n      of organizational readiness-to-change. Randomization to intervention or control group was\n      conducted within each of the six site-pairs. Study participants include VA employees\n      involved in the monitoring and management of patients treated with antipsychotics at\n      participating sites.  The intervention involves researchers partnering with clinical\n      stakeholders, offering tailoring in local implementation strategies to address barriers to\n      metabolic side-effect monitoring and management.  External facilitation to support,\n      problem-solve and refine implementation will be provided for a six-month implementation\n      phase.  The effectiveness of the EBQI/F intervention combined with the ongoing national\n      quality improvement initiative at six sites (intervention sites) will be compared to six\n      matched comparison sites exposed to the national quality improvement initiative alone\n      (control sites)."
