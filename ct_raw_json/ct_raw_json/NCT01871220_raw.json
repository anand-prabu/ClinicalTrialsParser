After implant placement,\n      but before final impressions are obtained (8 weeks post-placement), subjects will be\n      randomized to either a \"divergent\" or a \"concave\" transmucosal abutment design. For\n      fabrication of the experimental abutment, Atlantis\u2122 engineers will initially design a\n      control \"divergent\" prototype that will be modified with a concavity on the facial and\n      proximal transition zones to obtain an abutment that will otherwise retain all the features\n      of the control abutment. Engineers will measure the linear topographical changes (\u0394L=Lc-Ld)\n      of the transition zone, as well as the volumetric change (x) on the mid-facial aspect of the\n      abutment induced by the formation of a submucosal concavity. The primary outcome of the\n      study will be the apico-coronal change of the peri-implant mucosal zenith from prosthesis\n      delivery to one year."
