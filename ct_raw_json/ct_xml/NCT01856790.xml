  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      &quot;Closed loop artificial pancreas&quot; systems have been under development for the control of
      blood sugars in those living with diabetes.  These systems consist of a continuous glucose
      sensor, which sends a signal to a computer program that automatically determines how much
      insulin to give.  The computer program then tells an insulin pump to deliver the insulin.
      While such systems have been tested under a number of conditions, post-meal blood sugars are
      difficult to control.  This study is designed to see if liraglutide, a glucagon like peptide
      receptor agonist, can help minimize the post meal blood sugar spikes in subjects with type 1
      diabetes while they are on a closed loop system.

      Open-label, crossover study comparing the peak post-prandial glucose levels and the
      incremental post-prandial glucose AUC during CL control alone and during CL control with
      liraglutide in an inpatient research setting.  Data generated during outpatient baseline
      evaluation and liraglutide dose titration phases of the study will be compared to assess the
      short-term efficacy of this agent during open-loop CSII pump treatment.
