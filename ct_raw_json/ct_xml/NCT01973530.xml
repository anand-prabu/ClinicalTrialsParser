      We hypothesize continuous adductor canal block with single shot tibial nerve block would
      offer better anaglesics with rehabilitation ability for postoperative patients receiving
      total knee arthroplasty.

      Method:

      A total of 60 patients who will undergo total knee arthroplasty will be randomized into two
      groups:

      Treatment groups Treatment details Group A Continuous adductor canal block and single shot
      posterior tibial nerve block (bolus: 0.5% Ropivacaine 20ml ; infusion of 0.2% Ropivacaine at
      6ml/h) with single shot posterior tibial nerve block (8-10ml 0.5% ropivacaine) Group B
      periarticular infiltration with ropivacaine, ketorolac and epinenephrine (total 50ml 0.2%
      ropivacaine with 20mg ketorolac and epinephrine 5mcg/ml for anterior and posterior
      structures infiltrations; 25ml 0.2% ropivacaine with ketorolac 10mg for subcutaneous
      infiltration) .

      Two groups will receive the same preemptive and postoperative multimodal regime for
      perioperative analgesia. All groups will receive standardized method of spinal anaesthesia
      for surgery.
