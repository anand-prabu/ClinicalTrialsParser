Based on several studies, p-glycoprotein (P-gp) has an important role in\n      neurologic diseases, especially in drug resistant epilepsy. But there is no surrogate marker\n      that can quantify the expression of P-gp because of the difficulty in measuring substances\n      in the neurologic system and the lack of clinical trials. Here, the investigators use a\n      novel non-invasive [11C] -verapamil Brain PET and SPAM analytic method as a surrogate marker\n      for quantifying the expression of p-glycoprotein."
