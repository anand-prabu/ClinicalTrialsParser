    <description>Clearance of a drug is a measure of the rate at which a drug is metabolized or eliminated by normal biological processes.  Clearance obtained after oral dose (apparent oral clearance) is influenced by the fraction of the dose absorbed. Clearance was estimated from population pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling.  Drug clearance is a quantitative measure of the rate at which a drug substance is removed from the blood.</description>

    <description>Volume of distribution is defined as the theoretical volume in which the total amount of drug would need to be uniformly distributed to produce the desired plasma concentration of a drug. Apparent volume of distribution after oral dose (Vz/F) is influenced by the fraction absorbed.</description>
