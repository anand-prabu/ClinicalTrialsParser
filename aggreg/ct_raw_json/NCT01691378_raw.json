The study will be one of the first five\n      randomized clinical trials (RCTs) internationally to evaluate a psychological treatment for\n      affective distress after TBI and the first conducted in the United States (U.S.) to\n      specifically address suicide risk as an outcome.\n\n      The current project aims to adapt WtoH for U.S. military personnel/Veterans (expert\n      Consensus Conference, participant total up to 15), implement the intervention in a VAMC\n      (Pilot Groups 1-4, participant total up to 12), and replicate the results from the original\n      trial in this novel context with a larger sample size (n=70 completed protocols [up to 90\n      recruited]. Deliverables are expected to include an intervention suitable for both\n      dissemination and larger Phase III trials."

Brenner, Matarazzo, Signoracci) to modify WtoH manual semantics and graphics to\n      meet the needs of the U.S. Veteran population. Dr. Brenner has a long history of working\n      within the VHA and is a Diplomate in Rehabilitation Psychology. An expert committee (up to\n      15 participants) will also be convened for a meeting focused on the cross-cultural\n      adaptation of WtoH. All efforts will be made to include experts in treating TBI and\n      stakeholders (e.g., Veterans with or without TBI and/or family members/support persons) on\n      the committee. Members of the research team will contact potential committee members by\n      phone, email, mail or in person. Presentations may also be made to Veterans/family\n      members/support persons receiving care, participating in patient advocacy activities, or\n      providing peer support. Prior to reviewing the content, the expert committee will be\n      provided background on the current state of knowledge about suicidality and hopelessness\n      after TBI, available treatment options, and information regarding the underlying theoretical\n      basis and key features of the WtoH program. The committee will then review the ten sessions\n      to identify potential changes required to the therapeutic content, exercises, language and\n      graphics to ensure that it is culturally appropriate for the VAMC context. Modifications\n      will be made employing a consensus approach among the expert committee.\n\n      The adapted program will then be trialed across four pilot groups. Once the pilot groups\n      have been completed (see below) the expert committee will be reconvened for a final review\n      of the program. Data collected on acceptability and feasibility will be presented to the\n      committee and test therapists. Any necessary final modifications to assessment procedures\n      and/or the intervention to ensure that the program is appropriate for the Veterans'\n      condition will be made employing a consensus approach.\n\n      The revised version of the manual will be used to conduct the RCT. Up to 90 Veterans will\n      participate."
