In addition, Q10 has also been reported to benefit\n      other symptoms including headaches, sleep disturbances, and breathing problems. This\n      provides a strong rationale for testing whether Q10 will have similar benefit to these\n      symptoms in an aging population.\n\n      Method: 44 aging subjects will participate. The design is a 9 month, randomized,\n      double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study. Each subject will be \"crossed over\"\n      between high dose Q10 (300mg), low dose Q10 (100mg), and placebo, receiving each agent for 3\n      month periods. Neither subjects nor investigators will know which substance each subject is\n      receiving in which phase. Subjects will be randomly assigned to one of six arms.\n\n      Assessments: Assessments will include feasibility of study, subjective quality of life,\n      energy, and metabolic and lipid panels. Analyses will show whether Q10 led to improvements\n      when compared to placebo; whether higher Q10 doses improved outcomes more than lower doses;\n      and whether people with certain symptoms or characteristics get more benefit than people\n      with other symptoms or characteristics."

Additionally Q10 defends against mechanisms that may play a role in\n      health problems in aging populations. For these reasons, a study evaluating benefits by Q10\n      to symptoms and quality of life in an aging population is merited.\n\n      Subjects: 44 subjects ages 55 and older.\n\n      Design: 9 month, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind crossover study.\n\n      Analyses: Nonparametric and secondarily parametric analyses will compare effects of Q10 vs\n      placebo; and of higher dose vs lower dose Q10 on primary and secondary endpoints. Possible\n      effect modification (differential benefit) based on factors such as oxidative state and Q10\n      serum concentration will be explored through regression analysis."
