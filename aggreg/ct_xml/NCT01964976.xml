    <textblock>
      To examine the safety and efficacy of long-term combination therapy with alogliptin (Nesina)
      and biguanides in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who responded inadequately to
      treatment with biguanides in addition to diet therapy and exercise therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a special drug use surveillance on long-term use of alogliptin  with a 1-year
      (12-month) observational period, designed to investigate the safety and efficacy of
      long-term combination therapy with alogliptin and biguanides in patients with type 2
      diabetes mellitus in the routine clinical setting.

      Participants will be patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who responded inadequately to
      treatment with biguanides in addition to diet therapy and exercise therapy. The planned
      sample size is 1,000.

      The usual adult dosage for oral use is 1 alogliptin tablet (25 mg) once daily.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who did not adequately respond to the following treatment â€¢ Treatment with
             biguanides in addition to diet therapy and exercise therapy

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients contraindicated for Nesina

               1. Patients with severe ketosis, diabetic coma or precoma, or type 1 diabetes
                  mellitus [these patients require prompt adjustment of hyperglycemia by fluid
                  infusion and insulin, and hence use of Nesina is not appropriate.]

               2. Patients with severe infection, pre- or post-operative patients, or patients
                  with serious traumatic injury [blood glucose control by insulin injection is
                  desirable for these patients, and hence use of Nesina is not appropriate.]

               3. Patients with a history of hypersensitivity to any ingredient of Nesina
