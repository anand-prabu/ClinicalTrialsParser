After each non invasive measurement the\n      sensor will be removed. Each measurement takes approximately 85 seconds and involves the\n      finger cuff inflating (to over systolic pressure) and deflating several times in quick\n      successions in order to measure and calculate the Hb values. The two non invasive\n      measurements will be performed using the same finger. After the NBM system testing is\n      complete and recorded, the subject will have a venous (venipuncture) blood sample collected\n      in order to provide two blood tests performed on two different models of routine automated\n      complete blood count or Hb blood analyzers."
