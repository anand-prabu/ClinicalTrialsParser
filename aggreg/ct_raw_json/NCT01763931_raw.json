Your body normally\n      controls the amount of oxygen in cells with what is known as HIF-1, hypoxia inducible factor\n      1.   HIF-1 helps cancer cells grow in low oxygen environments; therefore, if are able to\n      block its function, it may make it harder for breast cancer cells to grow.  Digoxin is a\n      drug that has been shown to block HIF-1 in lab studies.  We want to learn if it blocks HIF-1\n      in human breast cancer tissue. We will do this by comparing the tumor tissue from your\n      original diagnostic biopsy to tissue that is taken at the time of surgery.  We will also be\n      comparing tumor tissue of patients who are not randomized to take digoxin."
