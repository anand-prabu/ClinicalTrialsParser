  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A small number of chiropractors, who align only the atlas C-1, or &quot;top&quot; vertebra in the
      spine, practice the National Upper Cervical Chiropractic Association (NUCCA) atlas
      correction procedure.  This procedure uses a precise, non-invasive, gentle touch technique
      to correct misalignment of the atlas.  Although NUCCA practitioners have long used this
      procedure in the treatment of headache, it has not been formally studied using clinical
      trials.  There is some data indicating that NUCCA correction can increase intracranial
      compliance.  This intracranial compliance can be measured by a magnetic resonance imaging
      (MRI) study before and then after a NUCCA procedure.  In this study, the investigators hope
      to show that the correction of an atlas misalignment will increase intracranial compliance
      in subjects with migraine.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must be 18-65 years of age.

          -  Be naive to Upper Cervical Chiropractic care.  Other forms of chiropractic care in
             the past are permitted.

          -  Have migraine with or without aura.

          -  Have between 10-26 headache days per month over the last 4 months.

          -  Have at least 4 separate headache episodes per month, with episodes separated by at
             least 4 hours of painfree time.

          -  Have at least 8 days per month with pain of levels greater than or equal to 4/10 for
             part of the day, or have attacks successfully treated with migraine specific
             medication.

          -  Be candidates suitable for NUCCA therapeutic intervention because of atlas
             displacement as assessed by NUCCA investigator.

          -  Subjects on acceptable pharmacological prophylaxis must either remain on a stable
             dose throughout the study, or stop the prophylactic medication one month before
             entering the baseline period.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any medical or psychiatric condition which in the opinion of the investigator would
             make the subject unsuitable for enrolment, because of inability to comply with study
             requirements or possible confounding of the results.

          -  Headache on more than 26 days per month.

          -  Acute medication overuse as defined by the International Classification of Headache
             Disorders.

          -  Pregnancy or lactation

          -  Severe cervical spine degeneration as assessed by cervical spine x-ray.

          -  Claustrophobia or any condition that contraindicates an MRI scan

          -  A history of cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, brain surgery, or other
             central nervous system disorder.

          -  Other chronic pain disorder which might interfere with headache assessment or study
             procedures.

          -  A history of significant hypo- or hypertension as determined by the investigator.

          -  Subject on a beta-blocker, calcium channel blocker, or other medication which the
             investigator considers might alter cerebral vascular regulation.  Triptans are
             allowed, but must not be taken within 24 hours (48 hours for frovatriptan) before an
             MRI study.

          -  A history of substance abuse or dependence within 1 year.

          -  Current participation in a research study or within the last 30 days.

          -  Any spinal chiropractic care outside of the study protocol is prohibited during the
             baseline and treatment period.

          -  Use of botulinum A within 4 months of study entry.

          -  A history of significant head or neck trauma (as judged by the investigator) within
             the year prior to study entry.
