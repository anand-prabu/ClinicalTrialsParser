In the first group will proceed to infiltrate the painful area with\n      medication, in the second GPST (Group Problem Solving Technique) and the third group both\n      techniques. GPST will  want to identify problems that people associate with fibromyalgia, as\n      well as proposed solutions and it they have been carried out successfully or not. Will be\n      essential to identifying and solving problems and using techniques to increase\n      assertiveness, self-esteem and eliminating negative thoughts. Observing if after performing\n      any of these techniques (infiltration, GPST or both) there is a better quality of life,\n      reduce thoughts of suicide, pain and improves sleep quality. We also analyzed the\n      satisfaction or not with therapies received and perceived usefulness."
