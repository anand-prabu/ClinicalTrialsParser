      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of pioglitazone 30 mg as compared with
      pioglitazone 15 mg on glycemic control as when used in patients with inadequately controlled
      type 2 diabetes mellitus treated with fixed combinations of metformin and sulfonylurea.

      The drug being tested in this study is called pioglitazone. Pioglitazone is being tested to
      treat glycemic control in adults with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus. This
      study will look at glycemic control in people who take triple oral therapy of metformin,
      sulfonylurea, and pioglitazone 15 mg.

      The study will enroll approximately 310 patients. Participants will be randomly assigned (by
      chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the two treatment groups—which will remain
      undisclosed to the patient and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent
      medical need):

        -  Pioglitazone 15 mg + Metformin and sulfonylurea

        -  Pioglitazone 30 mg + Metformin and sulfonylurea

      All participants will be asked to take one pioglitazone tablet at the same time each day
      throughout the study as well as continuing their previous dose of metformin and
      sulfonylurea..

      This multi-centre trial will be conducted in Korea. The overall time to participate in this
      study is up to 25 weeks. Participants will make 4 visits to the hospital or
      endocrinologist's office, and will be contacted by telephone 7 days after last dose of study
      drug for a follow-up assessment.
