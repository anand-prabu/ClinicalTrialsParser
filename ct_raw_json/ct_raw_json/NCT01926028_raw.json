The study size for comparing safety and\n      immunogenicity (N=15 per group) is based on the dose comparison design used in study\n      NDV3-001 (clinical trials.gov Identifier NCT01273922).\n\n      The primary purpose of the Phase 2a portion of this study is to further evaluate safety,\n      tolerability, and immunogenicity of the NDV-3A vaccine compared to placebo in a patient\n      population of interest (women with RVVC).  The secondary purpose is to determine whether the\n      NDV-3A vaccine decreases the recurrence rate of VVC in 18-50 year old women with RVVC when\n      compared to placebo. The study size for evaluating efficacy (N=87 per group) is based on\n      assuming a 50% rate of VVC recurrences over the 6 month post-vaccination period in the\n      placebo group and a 50% vaccine efficacy."
