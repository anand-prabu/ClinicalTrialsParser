Because exercises should not be too vigorous,\n      whole body vibration could potentially be an effective alternative.\n\n      The objective of this randomized controlled trial is to assess the impact of 3-month\n      training by whole body vibration on the risk of falls among nursing home residents.\n\n      Patients were randomized into two groups: the whole body vibration group which received 3\n      training sessions every week composed of 5 series of only 15 seconds of vibrations at 30 Hz\n      intensity and a control group with normal daily life for the whole study period.\n\n      The impact of this training on the risk of falls was assessed blindly by three tests: the\n      Tinetti Test, the Timed Up and Go test and a quantitative evaluation of a 10-second walk\n      performed with a tri-axial accelerometer."
