It\n      is not yet known if ribavirin is more effective with or without monoclonal antibody therapy\n      in treating patients who develop RSV pneumonia following peripheral stem cell\n      transplantation.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of ribavirin with or\n      without monoclonal antibody in treating patients who develop RSV pneumonia following\n      peripheral stem cell transplantation."

Compare the efficacy, in terms of all-cause mortality reduction, of ribavirin\n      with or without palivizumab in patients with respiratory syncytial virus pneumonia following\n      stem cell transplantation. II. Determine the safety of these treatments in this patient\n      population.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. Patients\n      are stratified according to prior ribavirin exposure for this infection (24 hours or more vs\n      less than 24 hours) and requirement for ventilator support (yes vs no). Patients are\n      randomized to one of two treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive aerosolized ribavirin via\n      face mask or oxygen tent over 2 hours 3 times daily or over 16-18 hours on days 1-10 and\n      palivizumab IV 2 hours before ribavirin administration on day 1. Arm II: Patients receive\n      aerosolized ribavirin as in arm I and placebo IV 2 hours before ribavirin administration on\n      day 1. Patients are followed at 14, 21, and 28 days.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 140 patients (70 per arm) will be accrued for this study\n      within 2 years."
