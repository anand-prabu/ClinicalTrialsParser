This study will be carried out in two phases: 1) formative research and 2) adaptation. For this application we will continue the formative research (phase 1) by conducting 20 to 30 indepth interviews with Chinese immigrants with advanced cancer to inform the adaptation of the intervention. Results of the patient in-depth interviews will inform how to adapt the IMCP process and session themes to reflect the needs of the community. In the adaptation phase (phase 2) the Breitbart IMCP research team (including Drs. Breitbart, Lichtenthal, and Applebaum), Drs. Leng, Gany, and Ms. Huang will discuss a priori adaptations to the intervention. Potential changes to the process and content will be discussed. Adaptations will be incorporated in a modified IMCP-Ch treatment manual, therapist checklist/outline and Treatment Integrity Coding Manual."

Many cancer patients\n      use counseling or other resources to help cope with the emotional burden of their illnesses.\n      Counseling often helps them cope with cancer by giving them a place to express their\n      feelings. \"Meaning-Centered\" counseling aims to teach cancer patients how to maintain or\n      even increase a sense of meaning and purpose in their lives, despite cancer."
