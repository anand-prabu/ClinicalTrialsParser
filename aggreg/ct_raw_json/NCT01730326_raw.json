            "textblock": "Patients with acute migraine attack make up the majority of patients consulting the\n      emergency services due to headache. The aim of treatment in the emergency service is to\n      achieve a minimum level of undesirable side effects and to quickly relieve the pain which\n      will not repeat after discharge from the emergency service. Ideal drug treatment\n      contraindication should be at a minimum level and not trigger migraine. Paracetamol and\n      Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are often used in the treatment of migraine headache.\n\n      Although narcotic analgesics provide effective and rapid analgesia, they have such side\n      effects as hypotension, nausea and vomiting, drowsiness. In recent years, with the\n      production of parenteral forms of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory painkillers, the analgesic\n      efficacy of these drugs has been one of the topics of interest to researchers. Especially\n      intravenous form of paracetamol is new yet compared to other Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory\n      drugs, and it is a drug with a wide safety margin and less incidence of side effects. The\n      effectiveness of the Intravenous form of paracetamol and whether it can be an alternative to\n      other analgesics is one of the major research topics today, and more study is needed on this\n      subject.\n\n      Both drugs are often used in emergency services to treat headache caused by acute migraine\n      attack. Our aim is to compare the effectiveness of intravenous dexketoprofen with\n      paracetamol in the treatment of the headache caused by acute migraine attack."

Our research is an equivalence study.\n      Provided that the difference between the groups is 50 %, \u03b1: 99 %, and 1-\u03b2: 80 %, it has been\n      determined that each group should include at least 94 subjects, and the number of voluntary\n      subjects has been determined as 200, each group containing 100 subjects.\n\n      First of all, in the measurement of the frequency of headaches, the standard 11-point\n      Numeric Rating Scale (NRS), whose reliability is proven, and 100-mm visual analog scale\n      (VAS) will be used. For NRS, patients will be asked to score their pain on a scale ranging\n      from 0 to 10, scoring 0 (zero) in the absence of pain, and 10 in the case of most severe\n      pain; whereas, for VAS, they will be asked to score their pain on a scale ranging from 0 to\n      100, scoring 0 in the absence of pain, and 100 in the case of most severe pain. Verbal\n      rating scale (VRS) with 4 standard points will be used as another measurement tool. In this\n      measurement, patients will be asked to express their pain as severe, moderate, mild and no\n      pain.\n\n      The patients will be divided to two groups.\n\n      Groups and drug doses to be given;\n\n        1. group: Dexketoprofen Trometamol (50 mg)\n\n        2. group: Paracetamol (1000 mg)\n\n      The drug which will be given after randomization will be diluted in 150 ml serum physiologic\n      and will be given as intravenous rapid infusion.\n\n      The pains of the patients will be assessed in 0., 15. and 30. minutes by NRS, VAS and VRS,\n      and they will be monitored for vital signs and possible side effects.\n\n      In 30. minute, the study will be ended, and If the pain continues, fentanyl 1 mcg / kg will\n      be given.\n\n      When a patient eligible for the study consults, after obtaining the patient's written\n      consent, the patient will be assigned to one of the study groups based on the next study\n      number. Randomization of study numbers will be prepared by someone other than a person\n      working in the emergency service with the help of a computer, and until the completion of\n      the study, which number is assigned to which drug will be known only by that person. One of\n      the nurses working in the emergency department will be responsible for preparing the study\n      drug, while the other nurse blindly will be responsible for giving the study drug. The\n      numbers belong to the previously enumerated study groups will be stored in envelopes which\n      do not show the inside (allocation concealment), and the study drug will be prepared after\n      the next envelope is opened by the study nurse. Patients eligible for the study will be\n      taken to the unit called 'observation with monitor' in the emergency department, monitored\n      and IV vascular access will be established. The study drugs will be prepared by the\n      emergency nurse responsible for the study and will be given by the other nurse. Medicines\n      prepared for each group are transparent and same."
