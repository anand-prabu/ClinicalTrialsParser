This\n      information can be shared with the client, something that may enhance the client involvement\n      in evaluating and planning of the therapy. The same data can be used for research purpose.\n      This randomized controlled multicenter study within Norwegian couple and family contexts\n      will explore the effects of feedback in natural settings, and it collaborates closely with a\n      similar American study in Chicago/Evanston, Ill."

            "textblock": "The improvement rate in psychotherapy is generally regarded as 50%, while 10% of clients\n      deteriorate after therapy. This indicates a potential for improvement. Research shows that\n      in therapies with the lack of progress, the clients rarely express dissatisfaction about\n      progress to their therapists, and parallel, these therapists consider the therapies to\n      proceed in the right direction. There is therefore a need for more knowledge about (a) how\n      to obtain reliable information about the therapy progress and process monitored frequently\n      during the course of therapy, and (b) that this information is fed back to the therapist and\n      the client so that they (c) jointly can evaluate and adjust the aims and means for improving\n      the therapy, something that may (d) enable them to test more appropriate approaches. This\n      clinical practice should also enhance the client collaboration and empowerment in therapy,\n      hopefully leading to higher recovery rate, shorter treatments, and reduced drop-out. To\n      date, there is limited research on whether and how the use of feedback can contribute to\n      improved outcomes. Such research is especially lacking in couple and family therapy. In a\n      3-year Norwegian pilot project at the Center for Family and relationships, Modum Bad,\n      Department of Child and Adolescent Mental Health, S\u00f8rlandet Sykehus, and at \u00c5lesund family\n      counseling office, the online-based feedback system STIC (Systemic Therapy Inventory of\n      Change) has been implemented and tested. The clinical experience is positive, and the system\n      is considered suitable. This project has evolved parallel to a similar project at the Family\n      Institute at Northwestern University, Evanston, Ill., supervised by the founder of the STIC\n      system, professor William M. Pinsof. The project now enters a new phase by conducting a\n      randomized, controlled trial (RCT) at three Norwegian couple- and family therapy sites in\n      collaboration with five American psychotherapy sites to investigate whether the use of\n      ongoing feedback is associated to more effective therapy compared with therapy without use\n      of feedback."
