            "textblock": "There is substantial evidence from animal model and healthy control data, that oxytocin is\n      involved in the modulation of social cognition.  In addition, recent genetics and plasma\n      level studies suggest a possible role for oxytocin in the pathophysiology of Autism Spectrum\n      Disorders (ASD). As a large number of children with ASD are transitioning into adulthood and\n      will likely require treatment, the lack of data to make meaningful treatment recommendations\n      to facilitate adult living is an urgent issue. This study will examine the effect of\n      intranasal oxytocin (IN-OXT) on social function in adults with ASD. It is hypothesized that\n      IN-OXT will be superior to placebo in improving social function by the end of study\n      treatment."
