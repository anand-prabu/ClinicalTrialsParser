There is evidence that acute dyspnea is\n      associated with a mortality rate of 10%, however acute dyspnea is not perceived as a\n      life-threatening condition, both in public and in health care providers. Our aim is to\n      describe the patient collective concerning their demographics, baseline characteristics,\n      type of referral and disposition, medical care processes and prognosis. Secondly, we want to\n      evaluate if the subjective risk assessment of emergency department personnel matches with\n      objective risk stratification tools and the actual outcome of the studied patients."

To\n      be included into the registry the patient has to express acute dyspnea. Minor patients are\n      not included. The admission documents of the studied patients are accompanied by a\n      questionnaire that has to be completed by the triage nurse and the attending physician. The\n      questionnaire includes items like professional experience and subjective assessment of\n      patient's prognosis. In addition the attending physician has to state if the evaluation of\n      medical history was difficult, if previous medication is known and how likely the presence\n      of heart failure as underlying condition is.  Data of the questionnaire, the patient record\n      and the follow up contacts are entered in a SPSS database. Finally, we measure the\n      OPTIMIZE-HF score (Abraham et al. 2008) and the PRIDE mortality score (Baggish et al. 2007)\n      in a retrospective manner in order to compare the subjective assessments with objective\n      criteria."
