    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of dHACM (Dehydrated Human Amnion
      Chorion Membrane) for reducing time to healing when used in post-laser recovery  following
      ActiveFX™ and DeepFx™ fractionated ablative CO2 laser resurfacing of the face.

             face

          4. Subject of either Fitzpatrick Skin Types I, II or III

               -  For female subjects of childbearing potential, they must have had a regular
