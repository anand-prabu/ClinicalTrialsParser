            "textblock": "Autonomic nervous system (ANS) is able to change both heart beat-to-beat interval and\n      peripheral muscle vascular tone in response to different stimuli. Unfortunately the direct\n      measure of the sympathetic and vagal activity appears not feasible in a clinical setting.\n      ANS modulation is studied non-invasively by means of heart rate variability (HRV) and\n      baroreflex sensitivity. Decreased HRV has been found in critical ill patients with multiple\n      organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and sepsis, thus it has been supposed being a sign of\n      autonomic dysfunction. Frequently, in mechanically ventilated critical ill patients the HRV\n      does not show any oscillatory pattern, as well as it appears in the early months after heart\n      transplantation. Under these circumstances the heart seems to lack the neuro-modulatory\n      control by ANS and it seems to respond exclusively to the preload and afterload laws. This\n      could have implications for outcome because autonomic dysfunction is associated with\n      increasing severity of illness and mortality. Since the ANS modulation is a dynamic process\n      that implies a central integration of a complex variety of afferent stimuli (from carotid\n      sinus, cardiopulmonary receptors, pain,\u2026) and efferences through sympathetic and vagal\n      branches, up to the present it is unclear if in critically ill a reduced HRV at rest\n      reflects a state of low requirement of ANS modulation or truly a failure of the ANS. To\n      provide new insights into this important topic we study the changes of ANS modulation in\n      response to a orthostatic sympathetic stimulus daily from the day of ICU admission until\n      day 28, or the day of discharge from ICU if it occurs before the day 28.\n\n      Measurements. Beat-to-beat intervals are computed detecting the QRS complex on the\n      electrocardiogram and locating the R-apex using parabolic interpolation. The maximum\n      arterial pressure within each R-to-R interval is taken as systolic arterial pressure (SAP).\n      Sequences of 300 values are randomly selected inside each experimental condition. The power\n      spectrum is estimated according to a univariate parametric approach fitting the series to an\n      autoregressive model. Autoregressive spectral density is factorized into components each of\n      them characterized by a central frequency. A spectral component is labeled as low frequency\n      (LF) if its central frequency is between 0.04 and 0.15 Hz, while it is classified as high\n      frequency (HF) if its central frequency is between 0.15 and 0.4 Hz. The HF power of R-to-R\n      series is utilized as a marker of vagal modulation directed to the heart , while the LF\n      power of SAP series is utilized as a marker of sympathetic modulation directed to vessels.\n      The ratio of the LF power to the HF power assessed from R-to-R series is taken as an\n      indicator sympatho-vagal balance directed to the heart. Baroreflex control in the low\n      frequencies is computed as the square root of the ratio of LF(RR) to LF(SAP). In the same\n      way baroreflex control in the high frequencies is defined as the square root of the ratio of\n      HF(RR) to HF(SAP).\n\n      The experimental condition is a sequence of three time point each lasting 10 min: (i) rest,\n      with patient in supine position at zero degree; (ii) modified tilt; (iii) recovery, with the\n      patient supine."
