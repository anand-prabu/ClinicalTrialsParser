Although thrombocytopenia has been reported as a risk factor\n      for patent ductus arterioses, there is lack of data on the function of platelets in ductal\n      closure.\n\n      The investigators aim to investigate the relation between thrombocytopenia and platelet\n      functions in pathogenesis of spontaneous ductal closure.
