             time of randomization.

          4. At least one lesion (measurable and/or non-measurable) that can be accurately
             assessed at baseline by computerised tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging
             (MRI) or plain X-ray and is suitable for repeated assessment.

        4. Receipt of live attenuated vaccination within 28 days of starting tremelimumab
        treatment 5. Active, untreated central nervous system (CNS) metastasis (subjects with
