            "textblock": "This study is designed to evaluate the use of a collection of tests that measure the eye\n      response, balance, oculomotor and reaction time tests to aid in the diagnosis of mTBI. The\n      tests use highly precise measurement tools to assess various neurologic functions.  (For\n      example, high-speed cameras to record eye movement, high-end motors to precisely spin and\n      move the subject, comprehensive analysis to stitch together the stimulus and the response.)\n\n      Hypotheses:\n\n        1. A battery of oculomotor, vestibular and reaction time tests will generate variables\n           that when properly weighted and run through a given multi-variant analysis, will\n           separate the subjects into one of two groups, mTBI or not-mTBI.\n\n        2. A battery of neurologic assessment tests including reaction time, vestibular and\n           oculomotor tests taxing a range of neurologic functions and executed using one or more\n           of the I-Portal\u00ae family of devices, will generate responses that, when used by a\n           trained physician, can aid in the diagnosis of an mTBI."
