Evaluate the toxicity of allogeneic cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) when\n      repeatedly instilled directly into the brain to treat recurrent primary brain tumors. II.\n      Evaluate the response produced by allogeneic CTL and interleukin-2. III. Correlate CTL\n      surface phenotype and degree of patient/donor HLA mismatch to response and toxicity.\n\n      OUTLINE: Surgery plus Biological Response Modifier Therapy. Tumor resection; plus\n      intracavitary cytotoxic T lymphocytes, CTL; intracavitary Interleukin-2 (Chiron), IL-2,\n      NSC-373364. CTL are generated in vitro by mixing irradiated patient lymphocytes (cultured\n      with IL-2 and Monoclonal Antibody OKT 3, MOAB OKT 3, NSC-618843) with allogeneic lymphocytes\n      and culturing the mixture with IL-2.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 10 patients will be treated. If severe toxicity occurs in the first 5\n      patients, the study will close."
