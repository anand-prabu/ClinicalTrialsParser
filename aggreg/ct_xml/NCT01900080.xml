  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if same-day HIV testing and antiretroviral therapy
      (ART) initiation improves retention in care (as measured by the proportion of participants
      who are alive and in-care with an undetectable viral load 12 months after HIV testing),
      compared with standard of care (three visits prior to ART initiation).  Secondary outcomes
      include comparisons of 6-month adherence and cost-effectiveness between the two groups.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a randomized trial to establish the effectiveness of same-day ART
      initiation for patients who present for HIV testing with early HIV clinical disease (World
      Health Organization [WHO] stage 1 or 2) who qualify for ART by immunologic criteria (CD4
      cell count ≤350 cells/mm3) with rapid CD4 cell testing at the GHESKIO Center in
      Port-au-Prince, Haiti.  All patients in the intervention group will receive rapid HIV
      antibody testing, CD4 cell testing, clinically relevant testing for opportunistic
      infections, WHO staging, comprehensive counseling and social support, and ART initiation on
      the day of presentation. The standard group will receive the same services as the same-day
      ART group (including CD4 cell testing) except that instead of same-day ART, they will
      receive the standard GHESKIO protocol of three sequential visits for ART readiness
      counseling and testing for opportunistic infections prior to ART initiation.   For the
      same-day ART group, these activities will take place on the day of ART initiation and during
      the subsequent two weeks.  Three specific aims are proposed.  The first aim is to compare
      the proportion of patients in the standard and same-day ART groups that are alive and
      in-care with an undetectable HIV viral load at 12 months after HIV testing.  The second aim
      is to compare six-month ART adherence between the two groups using pharmacy refill records.
      The third aim is to compare the cost and cost-effectiveness of standard and same-day ART,
      where cost is measured by the mean treatment cost and effectiveness is measured by being
      alive and in care with an undetectable viral load at 12 months after HIV testing.
