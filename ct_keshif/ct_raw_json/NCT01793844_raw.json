Treatment duration\n           was defined as days from the first day of drug administration to the last regulated\n           rest day of the final cycle.,Primary objective is disease free survival. Secondary\n           objectives are response rate, safety and 5-year overall survival.\n\n      Response rate is estimated using the binomial probability and exact 95% confidence intervals\n      (CIs) were provided. disease free survival and overall survival curves are estimated using\n      Kaplan-Meier methodology.\n\n      Adverse events and laboratory tests graded according to the NCI-CTC AE(Version 3.0).Adverse\n      events will be assigned preferred terms and categorized into body systems according to the\n      MEDDRA classification of the WHO terminology."
