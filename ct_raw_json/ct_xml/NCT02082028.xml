  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To demonstrate the superiority of a chronic care model (SINERGIA model) supported by the
      Self Monitoring of Blood Glucose with BGStar over usual care in improving glycemic control
      at 12 months in patients with type 2 diabetes not treated with insulin.

      The planned study duration is 36 months (9 quarters). The estimated duration of
      screening/enrollment will be 12 months, followed by the 12-month experimental phase, plus
      the 12-month follow-up in the observational phase.
