            "textblock": "RATIONALE : Acute coronary syndrome is the first cause of mortality in cardiology.\n      Development of stent and dual antiplatelet therapy have led to important declines in\n      morbi-mortality. Despite this, the risk of recurrent events and mortality after stent\n      implantation remains substantial, especially  within the first six months. Non-adherence to\n      antiplatelet therapy is the major modifiable risk factor that expose to adverse outcomes\n      following stent implantation and has been identified as the major risk factor of stent\n      thrombosis. Prior interventions to improve medication adherence in cardiovascular\n      populations have produced mixed results and have not specifically assessed compliance to\n      antiplatelet therapy in patients treated by stent implantation after acute coronary\n      syndrome.\n\n      It is currently unknown if interventions to improve antiplatelet therapy compliance in the\n      six month after stenting discharge will improve medication adherence and clinical outcomes\n      or will be cost-effective\n\n      OBJECTIVES: investigators propose to assess the effectiveness of a multi-faceted\n      patient-centered adherence intervention among patients following stent implantation to\n      improve adherence to antiplatelet therapy (primary aim).\n\n      Secondary aims will assess whether the intervention improve :\n\n        1. Cardiovascular events : ACS, stent thrombosis, re -  hospitalization and coronary\n           angiography, new revascularization, all-cause mortality\n\n        2. Cost-effectiveness.\n\n      METHOD : Investigators propose a six month, mono-site patient-level randomized controlled\n      trial to evaluate, relative to usual care, a multi-faceted patient-centered intervention to\n      improve adherence to antiplatelet treatment among stented patients following ACS. The study\n      will enroll 800 patients to intervention versus usual care for 6 months in one university\n      hospital (CHU Timone, Marseille, France). The proposed intervention will be based on several\n      conceptual frameworks (Chronic Care Model and Medication Adherence Model) and adapt elements\n      of prior successfully adherence interventions, including: collaborative care, patient\n      education, tailoring of medication regimens, and daily mobile phone short message service\n      (SMS). The primary analyses will be a comparison of adherence to antiplatelet therapy using\n      specific laboratory testing of drug effect. Secondary analyses will compare incidence of\n      clinical endpoints in both groups, cost-effectiveness analysis will be performed. All\n      analyses will be intention to treat"
