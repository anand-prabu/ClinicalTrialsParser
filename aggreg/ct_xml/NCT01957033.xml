  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot project is to determine the feasibility of a study design to
      investigate how many sessions of manual therapy and exercise produce the best results for
      people with whiplash injuries. Also, this study will help us determine the best way to
      measure the effect of treatment. Finally, the investigators will study how closely the
      physiotherapists follow the treatment instruction provided in the study protocol and
      training. In order to achieve these objectives, 12 people will receive manual therapy and
      exercise at one of twelve different doses. the investigators will have each of these people
      fill out questionnaires, measure sensation changes, and measure changes in the way people
      move their necks while walking. This study will help us determine if the study protocol can
      be carried out as planned. This includes: the training of all people involved in carrying
      out the assessments and treatments, the willingness and ability of participants to take part
      in all of the treatment and measures involved. This will provide us with important
      information to help us plan a larger study with 226 people with whiplash injuries.

          -  new episode of neck pain

          -  whiplash mechanism of injury

          -  symptom duration of ≤ 90 days.

          -  main complaint must be neck pain, but we expect some patients will also report
             symptoms that radiate to the shoulder and arm regions or have an associated headache.

          -  pain intensity must be ≥ 12/40 on the 4-item pain scale (P4).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  non-mechanical sources of neck pain or over-riding comorbidity listed below:

          -  rheumatoid arthritis

          -  neurological diseases

          -  fractures

          -  dislocation

          -  rheumatoid arthritis

          -  upper motor neuron dysfunction or malignancy

          -  pregnant women

          -  closed head injury

          -  on steroid-based medications within the past 6 months.
