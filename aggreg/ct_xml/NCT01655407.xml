    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to test how well the investigational treatment,
      Engineered Skin Substitutes (ESS-W), works for covering and treating burn wounds.

      The areas of the body that are treated with ESS-W will be compared to similar areas treated
      with the patient's own skin (split-thickness skin autograft (AG)). A skin autograft (AG)
      will be performed by taking healthy skin from one area of the body and placing it on the
      burned area.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Has deep partial or full-thickness thermal burns ≥50% of the TBSA and fulfills the
             total grafting area requirement ranging from 288 cm2 up to 5,600 cm2, divided between
             two (or more) recipient sites.

          -  Is expected to require multiple skin grafting procedures.

          -  Is ≥18 years and ≤40 years of age at the time of enrollment.

          -  Females of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test prior to
             enrollment and agree to use appropriate birth control methods during the pre-grafting
             period and for three months following the last Grafting Day.

          -  Subject (or a legally authorized representative (LAR)) has provided written informed
             consent for study participation and procedures to be performed.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Has a current diagnosis of septic shock or Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome, which
             in the opinion of the Investigator would put the potential subject at risk of serious
             morbidity or death by participating in the study.

          -  Has a current diagnosis of an invasive burn wound infection in unexcised burn wound.

          -  Is pregnant.

          -  Is a prisoner at the time of obtaining written informed consent.

          -  Has a documented history of allergy or sensitivity to any of the antimicrobials or
             reagents used in preparation and application of ESS-W including the irrigation
             solution used before and after grafting. These include aminoglycosides, polymyxin B,
             mupirocin, ciprofloxacin, amphotericin B, hydrocortisone, and insulin.

          -  Has a documented history of allergy or sensitivity to any of the animal products used
             in preparation of ESS-W. These products include bovine blood, bovine collagen, bovine
             collagenase, and porcine trypsin-versene.

          -  Has a documented history of allergy or sensitivity to glycosaminoglycan, the polymer
             component of ESS-W.

          -  Has a documented ongoing condition which could delay wound healing such as
             insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, Cushing syndrome or disease, scurvy, chronic
             hypothyroidism, congenital or acquired immunosuppressive condition, chronic renal
             failure, or chronic hepatic dysfunction (Child-Pugh class B or C).

          -  Has a severe malnutrition or other concomitant illness which, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, has the potential to significantly delay wound healing.
