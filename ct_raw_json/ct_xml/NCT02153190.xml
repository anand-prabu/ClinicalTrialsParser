      During this study, we propose to assess an Artificial Pancreas in a group of Type 1 diabetic
      patients who will participate in two study periods of two-month duration with an insulin
      pump and a Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) device. During one of these periods, called
      HYBRID Period, the patient will use the AP model when at home, from dinner to wake-up time
      whereas the patient will self manage glucose control with insulin pump and CGM for the rest
      of the day. During the control period called OPEN Period, patient self management of
      diabetes by insulin pump and CGM will be done at all times. Overall, an increase of time
      spent in range when using artificial pancreas in the hybrid period should be observed with a
      reduction of both hypo and hyperglycemia episodes.
