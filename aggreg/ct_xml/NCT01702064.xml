  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if treating Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) with a
      combination of medications (one being therapy participants are already taking [nilotinib],
      along with a study drug [ruxolitinib]) can improve treatment of CML. The first step of the
      study is to learn the dose of ruxolitinib that is tolerable (bearable). It has already been
      studied in a number of patients with different bone marrow diseases and is approved for
      treatment of a disease called Myelofibrosis; however, it is not approved for treatment of
      CML or in combination with nilotinib. It is given orally (by mouth). Most people tolerate it
      well. Investigators hope to find out how well patients tolerate it when it is given along
      with nilotinib (Tasigna) for CML. Nilotinib is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
      Association for the treatment of CML. Investigators will be testing different doses to
      determine how much of the medication people can tolerate (bear) before they develop side
      effects.

    <description>In the phase I component of this study, patients will remain on the same dose of nilotinib they have been receiving prior to enrollment on the trial. This will range from 300 mg PO BID to 400 mg PO BID.
Dose modifications will not occur, as the purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose of ruxolitinib, based on the number of dose limiting toxicities seen at a specific dose in combination with standard dose nilotinib.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  PHASE I: Patients must have chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). They must
             also be under treatment with nilotinib as either first or second-line therapy.

          -  PHASE II EXPANSION: Patients must have chronic phase CML and be undergoing treatment
             with first-line nilotinib for 6-18 months.

          -  Patients must have at least a complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) to be eligible for
             Phase I. Patients must have a complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) OR must have been
             on nilotinib for a minimum of six months in order to be eligible for Phase II of this
             study.

          -  18 years of age or older and must be able to speak and read English or Spanish

          -  Must not have undergone treatment for any other form of cancer (aside from
             non-melanoma skin cancer) in the past 5 years

          -  Must be able to provide informed consent

          -  For the phase I component, prior therapy with a Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (TKI) other
             than nilotinib is allowable, however, nilotinib must be the current therapy. There
             are no restrictions as to how long patients received the alternate therapy, the dose
             of alternate therapy, or how long they have been receiving nilotinib, assuming they
             have achieved a CCyR. If patients have not achieved a CCyR, they must have been on
             nilotinib for a minimum of 6 months. All patients enrolled in this phase must be
             under the care of a Moffitt Cancer Center physician, and enrollment for this phase is
             expected to be complete within 6 months. The dose of nilotinib for patients receiving
             the drug in the second line setting due to failure of a first line TKI is generally
             400 mg PO BID. In addition, if a patient is unable to tolerate second line nilotinib
             at 400 mg PO BID their dose may be decreased to 300 mg PO BID. In both instances they
             will be eligible for phase I.

          -  For the phase II expansion, patients must not have received any TKI prior to
             nilotinib, and must have been under treatment with nilotinib for 6-18 months.
             Patients must have a complete cytogenetic response at the time of enrollment.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤2 (Karnofsky ≥60%

          -  Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:

               -  leukocytes ≥3,000/mL

               -  absolute neutrophil count ≥1,500/mL

               -  platelets ≥100,000/mL

               -  total bilirubin within normal institutional limits

               -  aspartic transaminase/alanine transaminase (AST/ALT) ≤2.5 X institutional upper
                  limit of normal (ULN)

               -  creatinine within normal institutional limits - OR -

               -  creatinine clearance ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m^2 for patients with creatinine levels
                  above institutional normal

          -  Women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and
             for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect
             she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should
             inform her treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol
             must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of
             study participation, and 4 months after completion of Ruxolitinib and nilotinib
             administration. Women of child-bearing age will be required to have a negative
             pregnancy test within 14 days of enrolling in this study.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document

          -  Beta human chorionic gonadotrophin (B-HCG) will be performed on all women of
             child-bearing potential as screening prior to enrollment on this trial. STAT3 levels
             in the bone marrow will also be measured prior to enrollment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who are in accelerated phase or blast phase CML

          -  May not be receiving any other investigational agents

             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study. Women who are breast feeding their
             infants should discontinue this practice if the mother is treated with ruxolitinib.

             the study.

          -  Patients receiving nilotinib 200 mg PO BID are not eligible for phase I however they
             will be eligible for phase II.
