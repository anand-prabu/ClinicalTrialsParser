The novel device offers patients a more effective\n      therapy than conventional RFA and for patients with large tumours fewer number of treatments\n      and  needle insertion sites. The clinical treatment volumes (or sites of focal tumours) will\n      be determined by a combination of biopsy and contrast enhanced CT imaging.\n\n      The study will assess if novel device can produce lesions in the liver or kidney in a\n      controlled and predictable manner and with sufficient size to effectively manage disease\n      progression in the organ. The extent of lesion size at a delivered power setting and\n      treatment time will be measured with post-treatment CT or MRI and biopsy as measures of\n      tissue response"
