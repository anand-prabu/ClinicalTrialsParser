This is a concern, as not only the staff's\n      well-being is important to the individual welfare, but it is also vital to the quality and\n      safety of the care their patients receive. The investigators believe that by focusing on\n      physicians and nursing staffs nutrition the investigators will see a positive effect on\n      staff performance and well-being - and thus ultimately possibly on patient safety.\n\n      Hypothesis: The provision of healthy lunch and snack meal during working hours for a period\n      of 4 weeks will improve reaction time and well-being compared to habitual diet in\n      physicians, nurses and nursing assistants."

A\n      healthy lunch and snack meal meeting the current danish diet recommendations will be\n      delivered daily during all working days in the intervention period. During the control\n      period, the participants are requested to maintain their habitual dietary intake at work.\n      Reaction time will be assessed by reaction time test Go/No-Go, a subtest of Test-battery for\n      Attention Performance. Changes in mood will be measured by the Profile of Mood State\n      questionnaire. In addition, dietary intake, level of physical activity and palatability of\n      the intervention diet will be registered."
