In this study, male couples will be enrolled and randomly\n      assigned to be tested together in the same room, or separately.  At the time of testing,\n      investigators will ask questions about how they felt about the service they received.  Three\n      months later, investigators will survey the men again, and determine whether they had any\n      problems after the testing, like violence in the relationship or the relationship breaking\n      up. The main outcomes are being satisfied with the testing service, and safety (lack of\n      intimate partner violence or relationship termination).  Although the study is not designed\n      to determine if the service reduces risk behaviors for HIV transmission, investigators will\n      examine data on risks just to explore that topic.  The main hypotheses are: (1) men will be\n      at least as satisfied with couples testing as they are with individual testing; and (2) men\n      tested as couples will not experience higher rates of intimate partner violence or\n      relationship dissolution, relative to men tested separately."
