Particularly severe\n      risks are not anticipated based on the prior investigational experience with this drug. This\n      trial will be used to generate experience and data to support the design of a larger,\n      crossover, comparator trial investigating the efficacy of antipyrine- benzocaine in reducing\n      the need for rescue inhalers and hospital admissions in moderate to severe asthmatic adults."
