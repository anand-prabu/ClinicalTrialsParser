Thyroid hormone has unique\n      actions which make it a novel and potentially useful agent for treatment of CHF.

DITPA has been shown to improve diastolic function in both\n      animal models and a recently completed double-blind placebo controlled trial in 19 humans.\n\n      The goal of the proposed Phase II study is to define the dose of DITPA needed to achieve\n      hemodynamic improvement in patients with CHF. This study is a prerequisite for a larger\n      Phase III trial which would determine whether mortality is improved with DITPA.
