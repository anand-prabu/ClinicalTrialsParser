            "textblock": "The primary purpose of this study is to investigate whether administration of xenon reduces\n      symptoms of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD). Xenon is a naturally occurring gas that has\n      been used in clinical settings both as a general anesthetic agent and as a contrast agent\n      for computed tomography (CT) scans. Investigators believe that xenon may be effective in\n      reducing symptoms of OCD due to its ability to reduce the activity of a specific brain\n      chemical called glutamate, which has been shown to be abnormal in the brains of people with\n      OCD.\n\n      It is important to understand that this study uses a placebo, or inactive, treatment. In\n      this study, the placebo treatment is inhalation of room air (instead of xenon). All\n      participants will receive both xenon and placebo treatments at some point over the course of\n      the study. However, neither the participants nor the study investigators will know which\n      treatment you are receiving."
