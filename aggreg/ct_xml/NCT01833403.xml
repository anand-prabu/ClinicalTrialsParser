  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study to show that it is possible to identify the specific types of fats in
      blood, adipose tissue, and liver tissue. The study doctors hope to use the analysis of these
      fats to learn more about nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NFLD). Nonalcoholic fatty liver
      disease is the accumulation of fat in the liver of people who have minimal alcohol exposure.
      Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease is associated with obesity and insulin resistance, and
      predicts development of Type 2 Diabetes. The study doctors are interested in looking at the
      relationship between liver fat and insulin resistance.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects eligible to participate in the study will be:

          1. Adults over age 18;

          2. Patients enrolled in the bariatric surgery clinic who are planning to undergo and
             have insurance approval for bariatric surgery;

          3. Insulin sensitive (based on HOMA-IR calculated from screening labs) OR insulin
             resistant (based on HOMA-IR and or personal history of diet controlled diabetes)

          4. Able and willing to give informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria

        The following will exclude subjects from study participation:

          1. Clinically significant medical issues outside of diabetes (eg, pregnancy,
             cardiovascular disease, uncontrolled pulmonary disease). If female and of child
             bearing potential, a pregnancy test will be performed and confirmed negative prior to
             participation in the study and prior to the scheduled glucose clamp procedure.

          2. A history of hematologic (platelets &lt;100 x107/L), hepatic (liver function tests
             [LFTs] &gt;2X upper limit of normal), renal (Creatinine &gt;1.5 mg/dL), pulmonary/ cardiac
             abnormalities (ie, abnormal electrocardiogram [EKG]).

          3. Use of anti-diabetes medication, anticoagulants, or medication that might alter
             lipids. If the subject has a history of diabetes, it should be controlled by diet
             alone.

          4. Inflammatory or celiac intestinal disease;

          5. Untreated thyroid disease;

          6. Excessive alcohol use, illicit drug use, or active untreated psychiatric disease.
