  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim of this study is to adopt an integrative rehabilitation approach for helping
      patients adopt self-management skills for managing chronic pain, limiting use of opioid
      medications, and identifying exacerbating factors amenable to treatment (e.g., depression,
      sleep problems) that is feasible and sustainable within the primary care setting.

    <textblock>
      Pain is a common and very costly public health problem. Common chronic pain conditions are
      expensive and pervasive, affecting at least 116 million American adults at an annual cost of
      $560 billion in direct medical treatment costs and lost productivity, and disproportionally
      affect vulnerable populations. Pain is the primary reason patients seek medical care and, as
      the first point of contact, primary care providers (PCPs) deliver the majority of that care.
      Unfortunately, PCPs face many challenges in managing these patients' care and often have
      little specific training in pain medicine. Yet with proper system support, PCPs are in the
      best position to coordinate pain management longitudinally. While pharmacotherapy is the
      predominant treatment approach for many PCPs, this limits the patient's role to taking
      medication, and he or she can become a passive recipient of care—leading to poor outcomes,
      potential overmedication, and possible disillusionment with the medical system. Further,
      increases in opiate prescribing for pain treatment—amidst increasing awareness of adverse
      outcomes, including addiction—and limited efficacy suggest the importance of broader
      treatment approaches that focus on patients' improvement of functioning. Although opiates
      may reduce pain symptoms while prescribed, patients are unlikely to experience significant
      and sustained improvements without the use of other nonpharmacologic pain management
      approaches. Medical management of patients with persistent pain and complex problems is
      often fragmented, which leads patients to seek a wide variety of primary and specialty care
      services in an effort to manage their pain and related conditions. Such fragmented care
      leads to poorer outcomes and significantly increases health care costs as patients often
      receive unneeded diagnostic and medical procedures. While research has identified
      evidence-based multidisciplinary behavioral treatment approaches that are effective for such
      patients and can even prevent the disability associated with persistent pain when offered
      earlier in the course of care, these interventions are rarely available in everyday practice
      settings and will require data from pragmatic clinical trials to change the care paradigm.

      To address these issues, we are conducting a large-scale, mixed-methods, cluster-randomized
      pragmatic clinical trial throughout three regions of Kaiser Permanente - Northwest, Georgia,
      and Hawaii. This trial will evaluate the integration of multidisciplinary services within
      the primary care environment as compared to usual care in these settings. This project
      embeds an intervention into everyday clinical practice flow utilizing assessment measures
      and intervention staff directly from the clinical care system rather than utilizing a
      research-developed and administered structure. The intervention is an integrated,
      interdisciplinary program that guides all pain-related care for intervention patients. This
      study compares this primary care-based intervention to usual care using systematic,
      clinic-based assessments. The trial will include 1,200-plus patients and 500 primary care
      providers  (half of each receiving active treatment) with intervention care being delivered
      by behavioral specialists, nurses, physical therapists, pharmacists, and  other affiliated
      staff. Patients include those selected by their primary care providers who have
      non-malignant chronic pain (pain persisting for ≥ 3 months) and who are on long-term opiate
      therapy for the treatment of their condition. This intervention brings together elements
      often available in health plans but organized in a less integrated fashion, and it will
      ensure flexibility in implementation to best fit individual clinic environments and the
      needs of chronic pain patients on long-term opiate therapy.
