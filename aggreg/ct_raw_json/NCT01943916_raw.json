The technology is non-invasive and does not require any contrast\n      agent or radio-isotope, which is required for other modalities such as MRI or PET.\n\n      This is a prospective, single arm, controlled, multi-center, observational study that will\n      compare Imagio versus conventional diagnostic ultrasound (CDU) for the visualization of\n      suspicious masses."
