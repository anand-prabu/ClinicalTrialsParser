  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients hospitalized with Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) on non-Intensive Care Unit medical
      services will be screened using the STOP-BANG Scoring Model.  (STOP-BANG stands for Snoring,
      Tiredness, Observed Apnea, Blood Pressure, Body Mass Index, Age, Neck Circumference,
      Gender.)  Patients with high risk of Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) will be referred for
      evaluation and treatment of Sleep Apnea.  They will be followed to determine if treatment of
      Sleep Apnea improves their quality of life and decreases their utilization of the Hospital
      and Emergency Department.

      Patients hospitalized with Congestive Heart Failure on non-Intensive Care Unit Medical
      Services will be screened using the STOP-BANG Scoring Model.  Patients with high risk of
      Obstructive Sleep Apnea will have Polysomnogram performed at the Sleep Center, then be
      referred to the Sleep Center physicians for evaluation and treatment. Patients will be
      followed for up to one year to determine if the screening and treatment for Sleep Apnea
      improves their Quality of Life and decreases Hospital and Emergency Department utilization.
