  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hope to learn whether perfusion CT is a useful way to assess primary
      cervical tumor microenvironment and whether there is a relationship between pretreatment
      perfusion CT measurements and primary cervical tumor size, lymph node involvement (as
      assessed by standard of care pretreatment fludeoxyglucose Positron emission tomography/CT
      (FDG-PET/CT)), and treatment response (as assessed by standard of care 3-month post-therapy
      FDG-PET/CT).
