Patients will receive an infusion (given by\n      vein) of autologous tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) which will first be taken from the\n      patient, then be stimulated with certain substances called autologous dendritic cells (DCs)\n      and OKT3 (anti-CD3 antibody), and then given back to the patient as an infusion. This is\n      believed to make the TILs work better. TILs are a type of white blood cells that recognizes\n      tumor cells and enter them which causes the tumor cells to break down. After infusion of\n      TILs, low-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2) therapy will be given."
