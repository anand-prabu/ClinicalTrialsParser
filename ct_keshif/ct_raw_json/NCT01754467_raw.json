            "textblock": "Sedentary behavior is associated with an increased risk of mortality and many health\n      conditions including type 2 diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular disease, and metabolic\n      syndrome, independent of the time spent in moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity\n      (MVPA). Furthermore, independent of total sedentary time and MVPA, Healy et al. observed\n      that individuals who had more breaks in sedentary time had lower 2-h plasma glucose. Recent\n      experimental findings also suggests that breaking up prolonged bouts of sedentary behavior\n      (\u2265 20 minutes) with either light or moderate intensity activity for 2 minutes reduces\n      postprandial glucose and insulin responses.10 Replacing sedentary time with light-intensity\n      activity or nonexercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT) may help to reduce the health\n      consequences of sedentary behavior. The purpose of this study is to develop a smartphone\n      application (NEAT!) to encourage sedentary adults with diabetes to increase breaks in\n      prolonged bouts of sedentary behavior objectively measured by an accelerometer. NEAT! will\n      be refined by modifying technology created for the ENGAGED trial (RC1DK087126) and will work\n      in conjunction with a Bluetooth enabled accelerometer that can detect bouts of sedentary\n      behavior.  When a sedentary bout (\u2265 20 minutes) is detected, the smartphone application will\n      trigger a reminder prompt to the user encouraging him/her to participate in NEAT for at\n      least 2 minutes. Following the development, testing, and refining of the application, a\n      sample of 10 sedentary adults with type 2 diabetes will be recruited to participate in a one\n      month trial to examine the feasibility and acceptability of NEAT!. To our knowledge, this is\n      the first study to design and examine the acceptability of a smartphone application that\n      will target interrupting sedentary behavior with NEAT using objectively measured sedentary\n      time in a diabetic population."
