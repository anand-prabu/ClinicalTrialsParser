            "textblock": "FOLFIRINOX regimen was recently presented at an international oncology meeting and\n      represents a new standard in the treatment of metastatic pancreatic cancer for selected\n      patients. With improved overall survival (OS) and response rates (RR) in the metastatic\n      setting, we hypothesize that in patients with less tumor burden, this regimen will be safe\n      and well tolerated, improve OS, progression free survival (PFS), and RR, and improve\n      resectability rates, as compared to historical data from standard single agent gemcitabine\n      therapy for unresectable locally advanced  (ULA) patients and standard radiation with\n      concurrent 5 flourouracil (5FU) chemotherapy for borderline resectable (BR) patients. While\n      both ULA and BR patients will be eligible for the present study, our primary objective\n      concerns ULA patients, and we plan to enroll 45 patients in this group.\n\n      Patients meeting eligibility criteria will be consented and treated with FOLFIRINOX every 2\n      weeks (1 cycle = 4 weeks = 2 treatments). Patients will undergo repeat imaging (CT or MRI)\n      every 2 cycles and reassessed for resectability of the tumor. All patients that are not able\n      to undergo surgical resection, due to insufficient down-staging or patient preference, will\n      continue on protocol-based therapy until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, study\n      withdrawal, or death."
