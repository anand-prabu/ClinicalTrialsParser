      To examine whether application of lidocaine spray in cervical preparation for second
      trimester dilatation and evacuation alleviates pain and  is superior to current protocol of
      preparation without analgesia and superior to placebo.

      Methods A prospective randomized placebo controlled trial consisting of three groups

        1. Lidocaine spray group (group 1)

        2. Placebo group (saline spray) (group 2)

        3. No intervention group (as currently in our protocol) (group 3)

             -  Women undergoing dilatation and Evacuation in the second trimester and are about
                to go cervical dilation with osmotic dilators(laminaria) will be invited to
                participate in the randomized placebo  control trial comparing lidocaine spray,
                placebo (saline) or no application (as current protocol).

             -  Informed consent will be obtained from each participant

             -  After enrollment patient will be randomized into one of the three study arms by a
                computer program

             -  The patient will be placed in the lithotomy position and the cervix will be
                exposed using a sterile bivalve speculum.

             -  Pain will be assessed in 3 places using a visual analog pain scale 10(no pain) to
                100 (worst possible pain).

                0     after removal    15

             -  Group1 :after speculum insertion 4 puffs (40mg) of spray will be applied to the
                cervix and after  a 2 minute wait laminaria will be  inserted.

             -  Clinical data will be collected including age, parity, general health, Obstetric
                and gynecologic history.

             -  Primary outcome : difference in pain score immediately after speculum removal and
                10 minutes after speculum removal

             -  The protocol will not be repeated if a participant is to return for further
                laminaria insertion.

      Sample size A sample size was calculated assuming a target difference of 10 (smallest effect
      of clinical importance) between the baseline and post laminaria pain score at 15 minutes.
      Standard deviation was assumed to be 18 based on similar power. Assuming 80% power and a P
      value of 0.05 sample size of each group was calculated to be 51(5) and hence sample size of
      55 was determined .
