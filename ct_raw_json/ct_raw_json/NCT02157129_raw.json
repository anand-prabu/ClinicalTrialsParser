            "textblock": "Patients after tracheostomy represent a substantial part in the ear nose throat clinic. In\n      addition, long-term intubated patients in intensive care units profit from tracheostomy due\n      to an improved respiratory toilet. However, after tracheostomy patients demonstrate shunt\n      ventilation bypassing the sinonasal and the pharyngeal system. The physiological moistening,\n      cleaning and warming of the breathing air fail resulting in a local respiratory\n      inflammation. Beside a variety of supportive medical devices with different mechanisms of\n      action no general recommendation exists at present.  Recently, we demonstrated the\n      beneficial application of local phospholipids in Sjoegren's syndrome and antineutrophil\n      cytoplasmatic antibody associated sinonasal vasculitis.\n\n      In the current monocentric, two-armed, double-blinded, randomized parallel group study we\n      would like to evaluate the beneficial application of LipoAerosol\u00a9 when compared with\n      standard physiologic saline inhalation. LipoAerosol\u00a9 is a licensed, tradable medical device\n      and will be applied as part of its intended use. Liposomal inhalation solution provides\n      moistening, cleaning and warming of the upper and lower respiratory tract and supports the\n      natural moistening film in airway irritations and diseases.\n\n      Blood parameter (leucocytes and c reactive protein) and tracheobronchial secretion\n      (Lymphocyte subpopulation, c reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, granulocyte macrophage\n      colony stimulating factor, interferon \u03b3, interleukins 10, 12 (p70), 13, 1\u03b2, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7,\n      8, tumor necrosis factor \u03b1) will be collected 1, 3, and 10 days after tracheostomy. In\n      addition, medical examination records the number of suction maneuver (0 points: none; 1\n      point: 5-10x/d; 2 points: 10-20x/d; 3 points: >20x/d), flexible-optical assessment of\n      tracheo-bronchial redness (0 point: none; 1 point: peristomal; 2 points: tracheal; 3 points:\n      tracheo-bronchial) and flexible-optical assessment of mucous congestion (0 point: none; 1\n      point: fluent; 2 points: tenacious; 3 points: barky).\n\n      Subjective estimation of the respiratory impairment will be analyzed via visual analogue\n      scale (Subjective overall impairment, coughing frequency, breathlessness, mucous congestion,\n      color of sputum, consistency of sputum). The study is designed without any additional\n      invasive or incriminating clinical examination.\n\n      Aim of the study is the effective symptom reduction after tracheostomy using LipoAerosol\u00a9\n      resulting in a general therapeutic recommendation."
