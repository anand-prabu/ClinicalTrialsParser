The subjects for these\n      studies will be self-identified male and female homosexual probands and their relatives from\n      families in which there are at least two individuals with homosexual orientation.  All\n      subjects will be adults, and will be referred through NIH physicians, private practitioners,\n      and gay and lesbian organizations.  Subjects will undergo a sexual orientation and behaviors\n      interview, a psychiatric interview, and phlebotomy for HIV testing, HLA determination,\n      endocrine measurements, and preparation of DNA from cultured lymphocytes.  The DNA samples\n      will be analyzed for a series of genetic markers that span the human genome and for\n      candidate loci chosen for function."
