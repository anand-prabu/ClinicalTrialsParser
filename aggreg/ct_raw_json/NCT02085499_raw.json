            "textblock": "The use of non-invasive methods of respiratory support to reduce complications of prolonged\n      invasive mechanical ventilation in preterm infants has increased.\n\n      The most common mode is nasal intermittent mandatory ventilation (NIMV). In NIMV, the\n      interval between mechanical breaths is fixed and is determined by the frequency dialed by\n      the clinician. Asynchrony between the infant's spontaneous breathing may exist since\n      mechanical breaths delivered at fixed intervals can occur at different times over the\n      inspiratory or expiratory phases of the infant's spontaneous breathing. Synchronized-NIMV is\n      a mode similar to NIMV where the ventilator cycle is delivered in synchrony with the\n      infant's spontaneous inspiration. This has been achieved by using techniques to detect the\n      infant's spontaneous inspiration.\n\n      The advantages or disadvantages of synchronized compared to non-synchronized NIMV remain to\n      be determined.\n\n      This study seeks to evaluate the effect of synchronized NIMV versus non-synchronized NIMV on\n      ventilation and gas exchange in premature infants who require supplemental oxygen.\n\n      The hypothesis is that the use of flow synchronized nasal intermittent mandatory ventilation\n      (S-NIMV) in comparison to non-synchronized NIMV will improve ventilation and gas exchange\n      and reduce breathing effort.\n\n      The objective of the study is to compare the effect of flow synchronized-NIMV to\n      non-synchronized-NIMV on tidal volume (VT), minute ventilation (VE), gas exchange, breathing\n      effort, apnea and chest wall distortion in preterm neonates with lung disease."
