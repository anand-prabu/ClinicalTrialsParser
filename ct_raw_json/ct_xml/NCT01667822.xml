  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Studies show that about 1 out of 3 patients in Primary Care suffer primarily
      from mental health disorders, such as anxiety disorders and depression. Cognitive behavior
      therapy (CBT) has been shown to be an effective treatment of these disorders. Despite the
      strong evidence for CBT there is a lack of evidence-based psychological treatment in primary
      care. For various reasons, the progress of research has not affected clinical practice. For
      successful implementation of CBT in primary care cost-effective therapies, access to
      therapists with proper training and supervision, evidence-based manuals and management that
      support the implementation is needed.

      Aim: The aim of this trial is to evaluate a stepped care model with CBT in primary care. All
      patients are first treated with self-help CBT (N = 400). Patients that do not improve after
      treatment (9 weeks) are randomized  to individual CBT or continued self-help treatment.
      Based on published studies  2/3 is expected to be improved after self-help and therefore do
      not undergo randomization. 1/3 (n = 133) who didn´t respond to treatment is randomized to
      individual CBT (N = 67) or continued self-help treatment (N = 67).
