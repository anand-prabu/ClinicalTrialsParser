The study included 100 eyes with cataract and greater than 0.75 diopter of\n      corneal astigmatism, and the subjects were divided into WTR and ATR group. Keratometric\n      value was measured using autokeratometry, IOLMaster partial coherence interferometry (PCI),\n      iTrace incorporating corneal topography and ray-tracing aberrometry. Based on measured\n      values, toric IOL power calculations were performed using AcrySof, TECNIS and iTrace toric\n      calculators."
