            "textblock": "The investigators' prior research has focused on defining the changes in expression of\n      nuclear encoded mitochondrial genes that predict changes in insulin sensitivity in skeletal\n      muscle, with the goal of defining the molecular mechanisms underlying the connection between\n      mitochondrial dysfunction and insulin resistance in skeletal muscle.\n\n      The purpose of this study is to determine whether experimental lipid oversupply decreases\n      mitochondrial respiratory function.  We will use mitochondrial respiration studies in vitro\n      and mass spectrometry and proteomics analysis to test the hypothesis that experimental lipid\n      oversupply:\n\n        1. Decreases mitochondrial respiration in response to lipid fuels.\n\n        2. Reduces abundance of mitochondrial proteins.\n\n        3. Alters phosphorylation of proteins in the electron transport chain.\n\n      Three groups of subjects will be studied: lean, healthy control subjects (n=12), obese\n      non-diabetic subjects (n=12) and patients with type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (n=12) for a total\n      of 36 subjects.  Twenty subjects have completed the study at Arizona State University; the\n      remaining 16 subjects will be accrued at the Mayo Clinic in Arizona.\n\n      Subjects will come to the Mayo Clinic 2 times.  On study Day 1 subjects will be screened\n      with a medical history and physical exam, and a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test, measure\n      body fat percentage, and an electrocardiogram (EKG).  On Study Day 2, subjects will report\n      to the clinic after an overnight fast.  Female subjects will take a urine pregnancy test. A\n      muscle biopsy will be performed to take a small sample from one thigh. A lipid infusion will\n      be performed for 5 hours (60 ml/hr), with blood samples taken at 8 intervals during the\n      infusion.  At the end of the 5 hour period, a second muscle biopsy will be taken from the\n      other thigh.  The fat infusion will stop, subjects will be given lunch and allowed to leave\n      the clinic."
