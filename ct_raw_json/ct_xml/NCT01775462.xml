  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 2 first-in-neonate EDI200 study will enroll treatment-naïve, XLHED-affected male
      newborns in the first two weeks of life. All subjects will meet entry criteria including
      documentation of an Ectodysplasin (EDA) mutation associated with XLHED. Following Baseline
      evaluations, EDI200 dosing will be initiated between day-of-life 2 and 14, with each study
      subject receiving 2 doses/week for a total of 5 doses. The study will enroll subjects in two
      cohorts with subjects in cohort 1 dosed at 3 mg/kg/dose, associated with partial efficacy,
      and cohort 2 dosed at 10 mg/kg/dose where enhanced efficacy was demonstrated in the most
      relevant preclinical model. Given the challenge of identifying families where the subject is
      yet to be born, it is expected that cohort size and time for recruitment will be variable.

      This Phase 2 first-in-neonate EDI200 study will enroll treatment-naïve, XLHED-affected male
      newborns in the first two weeks of life. All subjects will meet entry criteria including
      documentation of an EDA mutation associated with XLHED. Following Baseline evaluations,
      EDI200 dosing will be initiated between day-of-life 2 and 14, with each study subject
      receiving 2 doses/week for a total of 5 doses. This dosing regimen mirrors that used to
      enhance efficacy in the dog XLHED model, considered to be most relevant to the clinical
      study design.  The study will enroll subjects in two cohorts with subjects in cohort 1 dosed
      at 3 mg/kg/dose, associated with partial efficacy, and cohort 2 dosed at 10 mg/kg/dose where
      enhanced efficacy was demonstrated in the most relevant preclinical model. Given the
      challenge of identifying families where the subject is yet to be born, it is expected that
      cohort size and time for recruitment will be variable.  The sponsor anticipates enrollment
      and dosing of 6-10 subjects over a 12-18 month period, 3-5 subjects per cohort.

          4. Written informed consent of both parents (if reasonably available) must be obtained
             for treatment of their XLHED-affected male infant.

          5. Neither mother nor the XLHED-affected male infant known to have received an

             study.

          6. No major medical issues that the PI considers a contraindication to participation.

        Siblings of subjects receiving study drug must meet all of the following criteria to be
        enrolled in the natural history sub-study (no age limit involved):

          1. Provide written informed consent/assent.

          2. A full or half-sibling of a study subject where the study subject has received at
             least one dose of study drug in the Phase 2 XLHED Neonate Study and has not yet
             completed the study.

          3. No major medical issues that the investigator considers contraindications to
             participation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects for study drug administration who meet any of the following criteria cannot be
        enrolled in this study:

        1. Medically significant postnatal complications or congenital anomalies outside of those
        considered to be associated with the diagnosis of XLHED.
