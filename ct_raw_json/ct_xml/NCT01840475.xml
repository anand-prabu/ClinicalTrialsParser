  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Botulinum toxin A (BoNT-A) is effective and safe in alleviating post-stroke spasticity and
      reducing the burden of associated symptoms.

      The hypothesis for this non-interventional study in arm spasticity (AS-NIS early BIRD) is no
      significant difference between naïve and pre-treated patients. The patients will be divided
      in sub-groups according to the time interval between occurrence of stroke and start of
      treatment (early, medium and late start of treatment according to the first and third
      quartiles time distribution). It is hypothesized that the &quot;early&quot; start of treatment group
      will have a reduced modified Ashworth scale (MAS) on the elbow and wrist flexors when
      compared to the &quot;late&quot; start of treatment group.
