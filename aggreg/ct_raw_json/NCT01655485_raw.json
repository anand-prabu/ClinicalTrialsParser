A secondary purpose is to test the effect of this intervention on the\n      anxiety levels of the parents of ASD children undergoing medical imaging procedures.\n\n      Hypotheses:\n\n      H1: Children with ASD who are exposed to a story book \"Here the investigators go to medical\n      imaging (x-ray)\" to prepare for medical imaging compared with children with ASD exposed to\n      treatment as usual (TAU) will have:\n\n        1. Lower anxiety as measured by heart rate respiratory rate, and blood pressure (baseline\n           compared to up to two hours later).\n\n        2. Exhibit fewer challenging behaviors as measured by a behavior observation scale\n           (developed for the study (up to 2 hours after baseline)\n\n        3. Higher procedure completion rate.\n\n        4. Shorter time to complete a procedure.\n\n        5. Less child injuries.\n\n           H2: Compared to parents of ASD children exposed to treatment as usual (TAU), parents of\n           children with ASD who are exposed to a story book \"Here the investigators go to medical\n           imaging (x-ray)\" to prepare for medical imaging will have:\n\n        6.
