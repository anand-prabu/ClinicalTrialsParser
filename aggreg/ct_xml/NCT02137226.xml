      The primary objective of this trial is to assess statistical equivalence of efficacy between
      BI 695501 and US-sourced Humira® in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) based on
      the change in Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS28) (erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR]) at 24
      weeks compared to Baseline and the proportion of patients meeting American College of
      Rheumatology 20% (ACR20) response rate at Week 24.

      The secondary objectives of this trial are to compare the efficacy, safety and
      immunogenicity of BI 695501 and US-sourced Humira® in patients with active RA throughout the
      trial for all patients, including those undergoing the transition from US-sourced Humira® to
      BI 695501 after 24 weeks.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria:

          -  All patients must sign and date an Informed Consent Form consistent with
             International Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice (ICH GCP) guidelines
             and local legislation prior to participation in the trial (i.e. prior to any trial
             procedures, which include medication washout and restrictions) and be willing to
             follow the protocol.

          -  Male or female participants, between 18 and 80 years of age, who have a diagnosis of
             moderately to severely active RA for at least 6 months as defined by at least six
             swollen joints (66 joint count) and at least six tender joints (68 joint count) at
             Screening and Baseline (Day 1), and either an ESR of &gt;28 mm/hour OR a C-reactive
             protein (CRP) level &gt;1.0 mg/dL (normal: &lt;0.4 mg/dL) at Screening. Patients must
             currently be receiving methotrexate (MTX) therapy.

          -  Current treatment for RA on an outpatient basis:

               1. Must be receiving and tolerating oral or parenteral MTX therapy at a dose of 15
                  to 25 mg per week (dose may be as low as 10 mg per week if the patient is unable
                  to tolerate a higher dose) for at least 12 weeks immediately prior to Day 1. The
                  dose and administration route should remain stable for at least 4 weeks prior to
                  Day 1 until Week 24. After Week 24 the administration route can be changed at
                  the investigator's discretion. Patients receiving a lower dose of MTX (10 to 14
                  mg/week) should be doing so as a result of a documented history of intolerance
                  to higher doses of MTX.

               2. Patients must be willing to receive oral folic acid (at least 5 mg/week or as
                  per local practice) or folinic acid (at least 1 mg/week or as per local
                  practice) or equivalent during the entire trial (mandatory comedication for MTX
                  treatment).

               3. Disease modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) use will be restricted according to
                  guidelines listed in the trial protocol.

               4. If receiving current treatment with oral corticosteroids (other than
                  intra-articular or parenteral), the dose must not exceed 10 mg/day prednisolone
                  or equivalent. During the 4 weeks prior to Baseline (Day 1) the dose must remain
                  stable.

               5. Any concomitant non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) must be stable
                  for at least 2 weeks prior to Day 1.

               6. Patients may be taking oral hydroxychloroquine provided that the dose is not
                  greater than 400 mg/day or chloroquine provided that the dose is not greater
                  than 250 mg/day. These doses must have been stable for a minimum of 12 weeks
                  prior to Day 1. The hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine treatment will need to be
                  continued at a stable dose with the same formulation until the end of the trial.

          -  For participants of reproductive potential (males and females), a reliable means of
             contraception (acceptable methods of birth control are intrauterine devices [IUDs],
             surgical sterilization, double barrier, or vasectomized partner) has to be used
             throughout trial participation. Females of child-bearing potential must also agree to
             use an acceptable method of contraception for 5 months following completion or
             discontinuation from the trial.
