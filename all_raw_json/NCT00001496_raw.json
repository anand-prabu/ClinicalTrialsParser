Eligible women will undergo biopsy of the breast to obtain\n      normal breast tissue.  Short-term cell cultures will be established from this tissue and\n      early passages of the short-term cell lines will be stored.  A bank of high risk normal\n      mammary epithelial cells will be established.  To further characterize the mammary\n      epithelial cells in this population of women, cell cultures will subsequently be analyzed\n      for their growth and metabolic properties, sensitivity to chemopreventive agents, steroid\n      receptor characteristics, oncogene expression and regulation, and genetic changes."
