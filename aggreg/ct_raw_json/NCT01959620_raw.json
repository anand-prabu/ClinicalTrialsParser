However, there currently are no accepted interventions for the early\n      intervention and prevention of PTSD in the immediate aftermath of trauma. This study will\n      determine whether providing  exposure therapy to people who have recently experienced trauma\n      will significantly reduce the severity of PTSD symptoms post-trauma and if delivery of three\n      exposure sessions will result in larger reductions in the symptoms of PTSD post-trauma than\n      one exposure session. This study will also examine predictors for treatment response.\n\n      Participation in this study will last 12 months. Participants will first undergo an\n      evaluation session that will include an interview and questionnaires. They will then be\n      randomly assigned to one of the following three conditions: 1-session exposure therapy,\n      3-session exposure therapy, or assessment only. Participants receiving 1-session exposure\n      therapy will complete one treatment session in the emergency department (ED). Participants\n      receiving 3-session exposure therapy will complete three weekly treatment sessions, with the\n      first occurring in the ED. Treatment will involve reviewing memories of a recent trauma out\n      loud with a therapist and audio-recording these discussions for review at home. All\n      participants will undergo assessments 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after the initial evaluation\n      session."
