Assess the safety and maximum tolerated dose of interleukin-12 (IL-12) in\n      patients with hematologic malignancies or solid tumors who have undergone high-dose\n      chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation. II. Evaluate the hematologic and\n      immunologic effects of IL-12 in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive interleukin-12 (IL-12) IV as a\n      single test dose followed by 2 weeks of rest. Patients then receive IL-12 IV daily for 5\n      days followed by 16 days of rest for up to 6 courses. Cohorts of 3-5 patients receive\n      escalating doses of IL-12 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is\n      defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 5 patients experience dose-limiting\n      toxicity. Patients are followed until death.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12 patients will be accrued for this study."
