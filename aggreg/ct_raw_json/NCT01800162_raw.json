We will recruit hemodynamically stable women with a\n      confirmed PPUL to be randomized to one of three strategies: 1) Uterine evacuation followed\n      by methotrexate (MTX) for some (those that have evidence of a non visualized ectopic\n      pregnancy) 2) Empiric treatment with MTX for all 3) Expectant management. Randomization will\n      be 2:2:1 into these three arms. After randomization, they will be followed and treated\n      clinically as is indicated by the progression of their condition. Primary outcome measures:\n      uneventful decline of hCG to 5 IU/mL. Secondary outcome measures: re-interventions,\n      treatment complications, health-related quality of life, financial costs, future fertility,\n      and patient's preferences."
