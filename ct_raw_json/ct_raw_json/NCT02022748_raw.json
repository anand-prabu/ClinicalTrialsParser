Up to a total of 30 male and\n      female adult subjects greater than or equal to 18 years of age will be dosed to assure that\n      there will be 20 evaluable subjects (10 subjects on HD and in 10 healthy subjects with\n      normal renal function (CrCL \u226590 mL/min). Subjects will be required to have an inpatient stay\n      from the day prior to dosing until the 48-hour post-dose time-point to ensure that all PK\n      samples are collected at the appropriate timepoints. The study will be conducted in two\n      groups: Group A consisting of ESRD subjects, Group B consisting of healthy subjects. A\n      crossover design will be implemented for Group A subjects as follows: Group A subjects will\n      be randomized into two sequences, Sequence 1 and Sequence 2. In Sequence 1, subjects will\n      receive treatment A in Period 1 and treatment B in Period 2. There will be washout period of\n      10-14 days between Period 1 and Period 2 in Sequence 1. Similarly in Sequence 2, subjects\n      will receive treatment B in Period 1 and treatment A in Period 2. There will be a washout\n      period of 10-14 days between Period 1 and Period 2 in Sequence 2 as well. Treatment A and\n      treatment B are defined as follows: Treatment A: subjects will be dosed with an oral 90 mg\n      ticagrelor tablet 2 days before the dialysis session; \u2022 Treatment B: subjects will be dosed\n      with an oral 90 mg ticagrelor tablet just prior to dialysis session. Group B subjects\n      (healthy subjects) with normal renal function (CrCL of >90 mL/min) will receive just an oral\n      90 mg ticagrelor referred to as treatment H.
