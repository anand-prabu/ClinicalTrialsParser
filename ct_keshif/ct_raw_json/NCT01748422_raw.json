            "textblock": "Arteriovenous fistulae are artificial connections between the artery and vein in the arm\n      which allow needles to be inserted for haemodialysisin patients wit hkidney failure.\n      Occasionally severe debilitating pain can arise from these fistulae for which no cause can\n      be found. Such pain can be very difficult to treat. Many commonly used used painkillers are\n      known to cause significant side effects in patients with renal failure (drowsiness,\n      confusion etc.\n\n      Qutenza (topical capsaicin 8%) is a new treatment made from chilli peppers which is applied\n      to the skin as a patch and works directly at the nerve endings in the skin to prevent pain.\n      It therefore should not have the systemic side effects of other drugs. It has been\n      demonstrated to be beneficial in other painful conditions for example post-shingles pain and\n      nerve pain from HIV. It has never been used for critical ischaemia before.\n\n      We propose to investigate the efficacy of Qutenza in treating patients with end stage renal\n      failure and chronic pain from their fistulae (AVF). We will recruit 20 patients with painful\n      AVF and treat them with Qutenza. We will follow them up for 12 weeks and monitor the change\n      in their pain scores."
