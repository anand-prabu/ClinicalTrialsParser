      This study aims to evaluate a clinico-biological predictive score, associating the faecal
      calprotectin, for the diagnosis of enterocolitis and enteropathy of the preterm neonates.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Enteropathy and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) are digestive emergencies in premature
      neonates which represent a major concern for the vital prognosis. It is therefore important
      to propose a tool for early diagnosis of these intestinal complications in order to avoid
      extended interruptions of enteral feeding at a period of life where growth (and digestive
      maturation) is in the foreground. Currently, the diagnosis of digestive impairment is based
      on classical clinical, biological (CRP, procalcitonin, fecal calprotectin, NFS) and
      radiological (abdomen without preparation) approaches, which induce on one hand a prolonged
      interruption of enteral feeding sometimes useless and even harmful for the intestinal
      maturation and, secondly, the establishment of a parenteral nutrition which is not
      risk-free. The study propose to dose the fecal calprotectin, a non-invasive marker of
      digestive inflammation, in order to validate the threshold decision proposed in a pilot
      study (350 µg/g of feces). Measurement of fecal calprotectin levels will be used as an
      integrated tool to build a powerful screening score combined to the usual parameters used in
      routine care for the diagnosis of and enteropathy and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) in
      premature neonates. A cohort of preterm infants born at a gestational age of 33 weeks or
      less will be included from birth. A stool sample will be collected from the diaper once a
      week, from birth until discharge from the hospital, and every day during gastrointestinal
      events (interruption of enteral feeding over 48 hours). The study will evaluate the
      performance of the rapid assay of fecal calprotectin by quantitative immunochromatography
      compared to the reference method by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
