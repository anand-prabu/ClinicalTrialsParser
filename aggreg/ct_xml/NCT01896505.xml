    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to find out more information such as: to determine the
      effects of high and low fat foods on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of oral KPT-330 tablets, to
      compare PK of capsules and tablets, to assess the effects of KPT-330 on cellular morphology
      and biomarker changes on sarcoma biopsy specimens (in patients who can safely undergo
      biopsy).

          4. Patients must have received at least one prior anticancer regimen for metastatic
             disease unless there is no other therapy available and evidence of progressive
             disease on study entry. Patients with stable disease will be included if there has
