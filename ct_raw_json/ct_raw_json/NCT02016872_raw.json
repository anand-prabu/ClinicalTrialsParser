Dynamic 18F-FMISO PET scans will be performed on one of the GE PET/CT scanners in 3D mode, at least one day after the baseline 18F-FDG PET scan. The dynamic 18F-FMISO PET scan will be repeated after the first one but before the start of therapy . The patient will have an IV line placed for radiotracer injection and for venous blood sampling. Both dynamic PET scans will be performed over one PET FOV centered at the lesion position. The 18F-FDG mid-treatment PET/CT scan will be performed over only one bed position."

The study will also investigate whether a\n      18F-FDG PET scan in the middle of radiation treatment can predict if lung cancer will\n      respond to standard therapy. Information obtained from this study may help doctors design\n      future studies on taking advantage of the low oxygen supply to the tumor tissue and improve\n      outcomes in lung cancer patients."
