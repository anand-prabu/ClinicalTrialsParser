Patients are stratified according to\n      disease classification (T3b (N0) or N1 (T1-3b) vs T3c or T4 (N0-1) vs N2 or N3 disease\n      (T1-4) vs M1 disease resected to no evaluable disease). Within 3-12 weeks after radical\n      nephrectomy and/or resection of metastases, patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment\n      arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive high-dose interleukin-2 IV over 15 minutes every 8 hours on\n           days 1-5 and 15-19 for a maximum of 28 doses.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients undergo observation alone. Patients may receive treatment as in arm I\n           beginning at the first sign of recurrence.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 4 months for 1 year, every 6 months\n      for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 68 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years."
