  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Based on laboratory studies, donepezil will improve pain relief more than placebo in
      patients with chronic neuropathic pain who are currently taking gabapentin or pregabalin.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigators are currently examining in the laboratory the mechanisms which lead to
      sprouting of noradrenergic fibers in the spinal cord in models of chronic pain as well as
      the mechanisms that lead to a novel noradrenergic - cholinergic circuit in the spinal cord.
      In addition to examining the circumstances which generate this increased capacity for
      analgesia and the mechanisms by which they occur, investigators will test in this protocol
      whether approved and experimental treatments for neuropathic pain exploit this increased
      capacity.

      This study is in patients with neuropathic pain taking gabapentin or pregabalin, and will
      test the clinical relevance of these preclinical data by comparing placebo to the
      cholinesterase inhibitor. Investigators focus not only on mechanistic hypotheses in the
      laboratory studies, but also on practical applications, using clinically approved drugs,
      including gabapentin and pregabalin to activate noradrenergic activity and  donepezil
      (Aricept®), approved for the treatment of Alzheimer's dementia, but not previously tested to
      treat neuropathic pain, to inhibit cholinesterase. Each of these drugs may act by mechanisms
      in addition to those involved in descending noradrenergic inhibition, but investigators
      hypothesize that the therapeutic strength of their combination relies heavily on this
      cascade engendered by noradrenergic sprouting and altered α2-adrenoceptor function.  The
      proposed studies will provide critical tests of this hypothesis and critical information to
      guide more effective clinical therapy of neuropathic pain.
