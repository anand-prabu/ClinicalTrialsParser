  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Compare Artegraft and Propaten grafts for use in dialysis access to see if one performs
      better than the other.  How long each one lasts until a complication arises or until the
      graft is no longer used will be compared.

      The study hypothesis is that the Artegraft, being an actual blood vessel, will work better
      than the manufactured Propaten graft.

    <textblock>
      Approximately 50 eligible patients with End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) requiring
      hemodialysis will be randomized to receive one of these two grafts as part of their standard
      care. Patients will be assessed at 2-3 weeks post-operatively and again at 6 and 12 months
      for flow characteristics, dialysis adequacy and graft associated complications such as
      stenosis, infection and thrombosis. Data on urea reduction ratio (URR), kinetic modeling
      (Kt/V), and access flow (QB) will be collected at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months via phone call to
      the hemodialysis center in order to evaluate patency and function.

      Access complications (stenosis, thrombosis, infection) will be treated per our standard
      protocol.  These data will be recorded and then primary, assisted primary and secondary
      patency rates will be calculated and the graft arms compared using life table analysis.
