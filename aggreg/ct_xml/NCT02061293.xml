  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several lines of evidence suggest that classic hallucinogens such as psilocybin can
      facilitate behavior change in addictions such as alcohol dependence. The proposed
      investigation is a multi-site, double-blind active-controlled trial (n = 180, 90 per group)
      contrasting the acute and persisting effects of psilocybin to those of diphenhydramine in
      the context of outpatient alcoholism treatment.  Two to four sites will participate. Aims of
      the study are 1) to characterize the acute effects of PO psilocybin 25 mg/70 kg, 30 mg/70
      kg, and 40 mg/70 kg in alcohol dependent patients; 2) to evaluate the effect of psilocybin
      treatment on drinking outcomes for 32 weeks after the first administration, relative to
      diphenhydramine control; 3) to evaluate the explanatory value of changes in alcohol craving,
      self-efficacy, motivation, and other psychological domains in accounting for the observed
      experimental effect of psilocybin relative to diphenhydramine control; and 4) to test
      whether or not characteristics of the drug administration session experiences and short term
      (1 week) persisting effects mediate effects of psilocybin on post-session drinking behavior.

      The total duration of psychosocial treatment in the double-blind period will be 12 weeks,
      and double-blind drug administration sessions will occur after 4 and 8 weeks. In the first
      psilocybin session, a dose of 25 mg/70 kg will be administered. Depending on the response in
      the first session, the dose for the second session may be increased to 30 mg/70 kg or 40
      mg/70 kg, or held at 25mg/70kg. The dose of diphenhydramine will start at 150 mg, and may be
      increased to 250 mg or held at 150 mg in the second session, depending on response in the
      first session. The drug will be administered during 8-hour sessions in an outpatient setting
      under close medical and psychiatric monitoring. The drug administration sessions will occur
      in the context of an extended version of Motivational Enhancement Therapy (Motivational
      Enhancement and Taking Action, META) with the addition of standardized preparation before
      and debriefing and follow-up after the psilocybin administration sessions. Extensive
      screening and baseline assessment will be completed, including thorough safety screening and
      assessment of participant characteristics that could potentially moderate treatment
      response. Within-session and short-term persisting effects will be assessed. Drinking
      outcomes and changes in several potential mediators of treatment effect, including
      motivation, self-efficacy, craving, depression, anxiety, and spiritual dimensions of the
      experience, will be measured until 32 weeks after the first drug administration session, for
      a total of 36 weeks from the initiation of treatment.
