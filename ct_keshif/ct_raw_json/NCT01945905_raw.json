Despite the availability of effective anti-tuberculosis medications,\n           there are still high levels of nonadherence to treatment. The nonadherence increases\n           the morbidity and mortality of patients, decreases the cure rate, increases the\n           community transmission and the increase of  chronically ill patients enables the\n           emergence of multi - drug resistant and increases treatment costs.\n\n        -  Despite the knowledge about different forms of cost-effective delivery of DOT (directly\n           observed treatment), recognition of the need to establish the DOT strategy related to\n           the context from local studies, in Colombia and in Cali we hadn't had made studies\n           similar than this one that establish the cost and results of the current DOT delivery\n           strategy and to identify other ways to improve adherence and cure rate for the TB\n           patients at reasonable cost for both: health services and families\n\n        -  Therefore, this research aims to compare the cost -effectiveness of current DOT\n           delivery method with an alternative extra- institutional delivery of anti -TB treatment\n           in urban areas of Cali. A cost-effectiveness study was conducted from the institutional\n           and familiar perspective with prospective information collection."
