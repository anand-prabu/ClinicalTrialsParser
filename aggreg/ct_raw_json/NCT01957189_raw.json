Approximately 24 healthy male volunteers will be enrolled. At\n      the first study period, the subjects will receive 0.5mg of dutasteride (Dut) as a single\n      dose (SD) under fed conditions. Serum sampling will take place pre-dose and over the next 72\n      hours post dose (Per. A). After a 28-30 days washout, the subjects will be brought in and be\n      given 0.2mg tamsulosin as Harnal D tablet for 7 days with the morning meal. Serum sampling\n      for pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin will take place at day 1, day 2 and day 3 pre-dose and at\n      days 4 for 24 hours (Per. B). On the next day (Day 5), the subjects will be given both 0.2mg\n      tamsulosin Harnal D tablet and 0.5mg of dutasteride. Serum sampling will take place at Day 5\n      pre-dose and followed for 72 hours (Per. C) for both dutasteride and tamsulosin. Subjects\n      will participate in a follow-up visit approximately 2 weeks after the last dose of study\n      drug."
