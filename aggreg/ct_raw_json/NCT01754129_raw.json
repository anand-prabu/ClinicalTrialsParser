These benefits have been obtained\n      in short and mid-term trials (mainly up to 2 years). Data on long-term effectiveness (5\n      years of treatment or more) and safety are not available. Also data concerning the benefit\n      of Duodopa on cognitive function, axial symptoms and disability have to be confirmed. Recent\n      data on deep brain stimulation (DBS), the alternative option treatment in advanced\n      Parkinson's Disease patients, showed that after 5 years from the implant, a worsening of\n      axial symptoms (gait and balance) and after 1 to 3 years of speech could occur. Moreover, it\n      has never been assessed if the benefit on motor and non-motor symptoms in patients treated\n      with DUODOPA could be influenced by age and duration of the disease, as already shown for\n      DBS implanted patients. This study should clarify the missing information on long-term\n      benefit of Duodopa (up to 7 years) especially focusing on motor fluctuations and disability."
