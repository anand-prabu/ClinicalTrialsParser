A percutaneous intraspinal catheter will be placed at the L5-S1 interspace and the catheter advanced 4-5 cm into the intrathecal space under fluoroscopic guidance. To confirm location, CSF will be aspirated and radioopaque contrast dye injected. 1-mL study drug will be mixed with 1-mL patient CSF fluid and administered intrathecally via the catheter. The catheter will be flushed with 1 mL bolus of saline. Four hours after injection (+15 min), the catheter will be removed and the exit site treated with Neosporin ointment and sterilely dressed. Subjects will be monitored in the recovery room for 4 hours and in the hospital for 24 hours and discharged home. Patients only receive a single IT dose."
