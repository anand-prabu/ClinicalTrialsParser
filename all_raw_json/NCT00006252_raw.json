It also\n      helps stop the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. When the\n      healthy stem cells from a donor are infused into the patient they may help the patient's\n      bone marrow make stem cells, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.\n\n      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well fludarabine and cyclophosphamide followed\n      by peripheral stem cell transplant works in treating patients with leukemia or lymphoma."

Patients undergo allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell\n      transplantation on days 0-1. Patients then receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously daily\n      beginning on day 5 and continuing until blood counts recover.\n\n      Patients with no signs of active graft-versus host disease and stable or progressive disease\n      receive donor lymphocytes IV over 2 hours beginning after day 120. Patients may receive a\n      total of 3 infusions at least 8 weeks apart if disease remains stable or progressive.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 5 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 45 patients will be accrued for this study."
