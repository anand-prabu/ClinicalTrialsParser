Hormone therapy\n      using leuprolide and flutamide may fight prostate cancer by reducing the production of\n      testosterone. It is not yet known whether receiving leuprolide and flutamide is more\n      effective than receiving no further therapy.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to determine the effectiveness of hormone therapy in\n      treating patients who have stage I or stage II prostate cancer that is at high risk of\n      recurrence and who have already undergone surgery."

Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive leuprolide intramuscularly once every 3 months and oral\n           flutamide three times daily for 1 year.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive no initial treatment. Quality of life is assessed every 6\n           months for 5 years. Quality of life of wives/partners of patients is assessed every 6\n           months for two years.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 4 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 496 patients (248 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this\n      study within 3.5 years."
