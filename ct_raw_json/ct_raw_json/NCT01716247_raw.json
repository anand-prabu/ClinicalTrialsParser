Breast MRIs will be read by the radiologist reading breast MRIs on any given day. CESM is a dedicated system, derived from a standard digital mammography unit modified to deliver the dual or multiple energy exposures and visualization of combined images after IV contrast administration. If the patient is having her routine mammogram within 30 days of her MRI, CESM can replace that mammogram Patients will be randomly assigned to one of the radiologists trained to interpret CESM. That radiologist will read the CESM blinded to the results of the breast MRI.This process will be monitored by the research assistant No radiologist will read both the breast MRI and CESM on the same patient.",
