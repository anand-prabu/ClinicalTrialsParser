The guide is clamped onto the patella and tightened so that it remains stable.  The guide has a slot that allows insertion of a standard sagittal saw blade, and this slot guides the blade as it is advanced across the patella.  The thickness is then measured in the center of the patella to ensure that the resection goal is achieved.  Additional resection may be performed as needed."

It consists of a free hand cut (no guide used) with a standard sagittal saw that is oriented based on osteo-cartilaginous landmarks and haptic palpation of the patella by the surgeon.  The resection thickness/obliquity can be altered based on haptic feedback of the patella. The thickness is then measured in the center of the patella to ensure that the resection goal is achieved.  Additional resection may be performed as needed."

Additional resection is performed as needed based on the quadrant measurements and the measurements are repeated after each resection until satisfactory resection thickness and symmetry are obtained."

This procedure is performed by a number\n      of different techniques that have been proved to be safe and effective.  Despite this,\n      patellar instability, tilt, obliquity, and maltracking are all possible complications of\n      improperly resected patellae during TKA.  The goals of resection are to create a patella\n      that is symmetrical, absent of obliquity (slanting), and thick enough to receive a patellar\n      prosthesis. Although outcomes are generally good for most described methods, to date, little\n      has been published regarding direct comparison of these methods.\n\n      A total of 90 patients undergoing TKA with planned patellar resection will be randomized to\n      have their patella resected by one of three methods during primary TKA: 1) use of a cutting\n      guide, 2) haptic feedback, or 3) free-hand resection guided by four quadrant measurements.\n      There will be three experienced fellowship trained arthroplasty surgeons (hip and\n      knee)performing the procedures who are all familiar and experienced with each of the three\n      techniques being investigated.  Each surgeon will, within a group of 30 of their patients,\n      perform a total 10 resections using each of the three methods listed above (30 resections\n      per surgeon for a total of 90 resections). The patients will be randomized (like the flip of\n      a coin) to one of the three resection techniques.\n\n      Before and after resection measurements of knee-cap thickness will be taken and used to\n      determine patellar symmetry.  The resulting symmetry of each of the three techniques will\n      then be compared between and within each of the three techniques and surgeons.\n\n      The purpose of this study is to compare the three resection techniques most commonly used at\n      the Mayo Clinic to determine which surgical procedure results in the most symmetrically\n      resected patella."
