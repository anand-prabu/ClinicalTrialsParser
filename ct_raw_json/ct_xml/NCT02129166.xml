  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is looking at how imatinib affects how dasatinib is absorbed and
      eliminated from the body. Both imatinib and dasatinib are in a class of medications called
      tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) and they are used to treat certain types of leukemia
      (cancer that begins in the white blood cells). Both imatinib and dasatinib have been given
      safely in healthy volunteers. In this study investigators will evaluate the pharmacokinetics
      interaction between imatinib and dasatinib when they are co-administered. The hypothesis is
      that imatinib will increase the blood levels of dasatinib through inhibiting the drug
      metabolizing enzyme and efflux transporter that are involved in the dasatinib absorption and
      removal.  This research will provide important new insight of combination TKI therapy in
      terms of transporter- and enzyme- mediated pharmacokinetic interactions. The research
      results will also help guide doctors in knowing how much of a tyrosine kinase inhibitor to
      give safely while reaching best effect in TKI combination therapy.

      If the subjects qualify to take part in this research study, they will undergo the following
      procedures.

      Subjects will be asked to abstain from alcoholic beverages (24 hours), grapefruit products,
      herbal supplements/teas, and over-the-counter medications (48 hours) prior to the study
      visits. There will be two study periods in this study. During each period all the subjects
      are outpatients and there will be no overnight stay. During each study period, the subjects
      will come to the University of Florida Clinical Research Center (UF CRC) three times: on Day
      -1, Day 1, and Day 2, respectively.  Subjects will report to the UF CRC the day before Day 1
       (i.e. Day -1) to have clinical lab test and urine pregnancy test (female only). Subjects
      will come to UF CRC at 6:30 a.m. on Day 1 and Day 2 of each study visit.  During the morning
      of each study period (around 8:30 am) subjects will be randomly assigned to receive a single
      oral dose of dasatinib 20 mg either with or without a single oral dose of imatinib 400 mg
      administered one hour prior to dasatinib. After the first study visit, the subjects will
      return one to two weeks later for the second study visit, receiving the opposite treatment.
      The treatment order for the study visits will be assigned randomly.  The end point measures
      for this study are plasma concentrations of dasatinib. A total of twelve (12) blood samples
      will be collected for a total amount of 84 ml (about 3 ounces or about 6 tablespoonsful) for
      each subject during each study period.
