The evaluation employs a randomized trial design to assess the effectiveness\n      of the FBP in the Santa Fe County, NM, site. FBP is a home visitation program that uses\n      clinically trained professionals to provide first-time parents with information, training,\n      and access to resources designed to promote early childhood development. Services are free\n      and may begin at any time during pregnancy or up to two months after the baby's birth and\n      may continue until the child is three years old.  In addition, a nurse postpartum home visit\n      is offered to the parents of all participating newborns.  The FBP model builds on other home\n      visiting and prevention programs that have been shown to improve long-term outcomes of\n      children and their families."
