This\n      non-interventional study will also collect medical information about participants through\n      questionnaire, phone interviews, and review of medical records regarding the person's usual\n      medical care, including lab testing and x-rays or other imaging studies.\n\n      Participants who are evaluated at the study center will have a physical examination\n      performed by a clinical geneticist and neuropsychological studies administered by the study\n      psychologist.  Neuropsychological studies assess intelligence, learning abilities, language\n      skills, and ability to participate in day to day activities of life. Participants seen at\n      the study center will have skeletal x-rays performed to evaluate the impact of the disease\n      on the participant's bones.\n\n      Every participant will complete (or have a care provider complete for them)\n\n        -  A questionnaire about their birth, development, and medical history\n\n        -  An interview with study personnel (in person or via telephone)\n\n        -  Follow up interviews on at least an annual basis to update the medical history\n\n      Each participant will be asked to\n\n        -  Give a blood sample\n\n        -  Give a urine sample\n\n        -  Some participants may be asked to give a skin biopsy."
