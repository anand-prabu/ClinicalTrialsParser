  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare two different ways of helping new hearing-aid users
      get the most out of their hearing aids and determine if one method is better than the other.
      One method provides the patient with routine information regarding the care and use of
      hearing aids the other method that uses tools to address patient-specific barriers against
      and motivators for hearing-aid use.

    <description>The &quot;standard-of-care&quot; control group will review and practice with the audiologist content such as: 1) information on hearing-aid batteries and how to change them, 2) cleaning/daily care of the hearing aids, and 3) inserting and removing the hearing aids.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  be aged between 20 and 89 years

          -  be a first-time hearing-aid user

          -  air-conduction pure-tone averages (mean thresholds at 500 Hz, 1000 Hz, and 2000 Hz)
             of 70 dB HL or less in both ears

          -  word-recognition scores of 40% or better in each ear

          -  English as their first language

          -  have sufficient vision and reading ability

          -  have the appropriate cognitive skills to participate in the study as determined by

          -  have been recently fit by the Portland VAMC Audiology and Speech Pathology Service
             (ASPS) with two hearing aids which have datalogging capabilities

          -  be independent in their completion of activities in daily living, as determined by
             their score on the Katz Index of Independence in Activities of Daily Living (Katz et
             al., 1970)

          -  have clinical notes suggesting poor adaptation to their new hearing aids

          -  be free of a documented diagnosis in the VA Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS)
             record of neurological or psychological disorder, such as Alzheimer's disease,
             schizophrenia, or uncontrolled substance abuse, which would interfere with the
             completion of the study. Vulnerable populations are not being studied.
