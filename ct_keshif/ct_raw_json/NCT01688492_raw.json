The Phase 1 dose escalation stage is to establish the tolerability of ipilimumab to be used in combination with the standard clinical dose of abiraterone acetate plus prednisone in chemotherapy and immunotherapy-na\u00efve patients with progressive metastatic CRPC. Due to the overlapping potential hepatic toxicity between abiraterone and ipilimumab, a Lead in Therapy with abiraterone plus prednisone for 2 cycles will assess for adverse events related to the abiraterone plus prednisone. Patients, who tolerate well the Lead in therapy as defined by Grade 1 or less AEs, will pursue Combination Therapy. Patients with AEs Grade \u2265 2 after Lead in Therapy will be excluded and replaced. The Phase 2 stage will assess efficacy and confirm an acceptable safety profile of the recommended dose."
