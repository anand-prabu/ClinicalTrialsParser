Evaluate the immunologic and biologic activity of flt3 ligand (Flt3L) alone\n      in patients with metastatic renal cell cancer or HLA-A2.1 negative melanoma.\n\n      II. Evaluate the immunologic and biologic activity of Flt3L alone or in combination with\n      melanoma peptide immunization (MART-1, gp100:209-217, gp100:280-288, and tyrosinase) in\n      patients with metastatic, HLA-A2.1 positive melanoma.\n\n      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups:\n\n      Group 1 (renal cell cancer): Patients receive Flt3 ligand (Flt3L) subcutaneously (SQ) alone\n      on days 1-14.\n\n      Group 2 (HLA-A2.1 negative melanoma): Patients receive Flt3L SQ alone on days 1-14.\n\n      Group 3 (HLA-A2.1 positive melanoma): Patients may receive either Flt3L SQ alone on days\n      1-14 or in combination with melanoma peptide immunization. Patients may receive melanoma\n      peptide immunization comprised of MART-1 immunodominant peptide, gp100:209-217,\n      gp100:280-288, and tyrosinase peptide emulsified in Montanide ISA-51 SQ on day 12 of Flt3L\n      administration.\n\n      Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for 2 courses.  Patients with no response or minor response\n      may receive 2 additional courses.  Patients with disease progression after 1 course are\n      removed from study.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL:\n\n      Approximately 54-96 patients (18-32 per treatment group) will be accrued for this study\n      within 16 months."
