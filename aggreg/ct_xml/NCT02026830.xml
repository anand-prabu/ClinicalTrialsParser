      To determine the causative microorganisms and their antibiotic sensitivity patterns in
      diabetic patients with a foot infection in Turkey.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent studies have demonstrated substantial variation in the etiology of DFIs (Diabetic
      Foot Infections) in different regions of the world . In contrast to Western countries,
      studies from  Asia and Africa have demonstrated that aerobic gram-negative organisms,
      particularly Pseudomonas aeruginosa, are far more common . The majority of current
      guidelines for the management of DFIs have been prepared in Western countries . Based on the
      results of more recent studies from the Asian continent, however, empiric antibiotic therapy
      for DFIs may need to be directed at organisms with substantially different antibiotic
      susceptibility patterns than those recommended in current guidelines. Thus, suggested
      antibiotic regimens for DFIs should be optimized for local clinical practice. The aim of the
      current trial is to provide an up-to-date view of the causative microorganisms and their
      antibiotic sensitivity patterns in diabetic patients with a foot infection in Turkey.
