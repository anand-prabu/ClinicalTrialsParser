      This clinical trial studies surgery and heated chemotherapy with or without non-heated
      chemotherapy after surgery in treating patients with ovarian, fallopian tube, uterine, or
      peritoneal cancer.  Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin, carboplatin, paclitaxel,
      pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride, and gentamicin, work in different ways to
      stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from
      dividing. Heating a chemotherapy solution and infusing it directly into the abdomen during
      surgery and infusing heated and unheated chemotherapy drugs directly into the abdomen after
      surgery may kill more tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether cytoreductive surgery with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy
      (HIPEC) followed by postoperative normothermic intraperitoneal (IP) chemotherapy is feasible
      and safe to administer, as measured by toxicities occurring during treatment or follow-up.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine quality of life (QoL) and compare the outcomes to a historical control of IP
      chemotherapy (no HIPEC) for women with ovarian cancer.

      II. To determine whether cytoreductive surgery with HIPEC alone is feasible and safe to
      administer, as measured by toxicities occurring during treatment or follow-up.

      III. To estimate progression-free survival (PFS). IV. To estimate overall survival (OS). V.
      To collect biospecimens and perform correlative translational studies focused on
      understanding the mechanisms of action of HIPEC on ovarian cancer.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo surgery and receive hyperthermic cisplatin intraperitoneally (IP) over 60
      minutes.

      At least 3 weeks after surgery, patients may receive carboplatin, paclitaxel, pegylated
      liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride, or gentamicin IP or intravenously (IV) at the
      discretion of the medical and gynecologic oncologists.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 2 and 6 weeks, every 3
      months for 2 years, and then every 4 months for 1 year.

    <description>The FACT-O has four subscales: physical, social/family, emotional, and functional well-being. Answers are on a scale of 0 'not at all' to 4 'very much'. To estimate effect sizes over time, generalized linear models will be used to estimate the correlations between potential prognostic factors. Generalized estimating equations (GEEs) have utility in modeling longitudinal effects across time in prospective cohorts, and the models will include time-dependent covariate structures for continuous outcomes. QoL will be compared to a historical control of IP chemotherapy for women with ovarian cancer.</description>

    <description>PFS will be estimated in both groups. The survival curve will be estimated using Kaplan-Meier method and graphically displayed along with the corresponding 95% confidence curves.
