    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to investigate the change in pulmonary function and exercise
      capacity in lung cancer patients after pulmonary resection. Furthermore, to study the effect
      of training on aerobic capacity and muscular strength. Physical activity level by
      accelerometers, body composition by DXA and quality of life by questionaire will also be
      reported.
