      Background

      In Denmark, breast cancer is the most common fatal cancer in women with more than 4700 new
      cases annually. Unfortunately, up to 60% of women who are treated surgically for breast
      cancer, will experience chronic pain as a consequence of the treatment. This state of
      chronic neuropathic pain is termed &quot;Post Breast Therapy Pain Syndrome&quot; or PBTPS.

      The purpose of the study

      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether transplantation of fat cells
      (lipotransplantation) to the pain affected mastectomy area, could have an analgesic effect
      in women who have developed PBTPS. Secondary, we wish to investigate if lipotransplantation
      has a beneficial effect on the quality of the skin and the scar in the area where the
      transplanted fat cells are placed.

      Hypotheses

        -  Lipotransplantation to the area under the scar tissue and the area under the
           pain-afflicted area reduces the pain in women with PBTPS.

        -  The neuropathic pain in PBTPS is correlated to the number of free nerve endings
           crossing the border between the dermis and the epidermis

        -  Lipotransplantation have a beneficial effect on the scar tissue structure and improves
           the skin quality.

      Patients

      Women who have undergone treatment for breast cancer and subsequently developed PBTPS. A
      total of 60 patients with PBTPS will be included. Furthermore, a control group of 30
      patients without PBTPS is to be included. The control group will serve as a baseline group.

      Methods

      Patients will be randomly assigned to receive either lipotransplantation or no active
      treatment. At three follow-up visits, the perceived pain of the patient and the skin and
      scar quality will be scored. In addition, a 3-mm biopsy from the skin and from the scar will
      be taken.

      The scoring of the perceived pain and the quality of the skin and the scar, allows us to
      investigate if the lipotransplantation have an effect on pain, and skin/scar quality.
      Additionally, the skin and scar biopsies will be examined on a microscopic level, in order
      to investigate why lipotransplantation has these effects.

      Conclusion

      In summary, the results of this project could help to increase our understanding of why some
      patients develop chronic neuropathic pain after mastectomy and radiotherapy. It is our hope
      that our results may contribute to the development of better and more effective treatment
      that will be beneficial for the project participants and future patients.

      Background

      In Denmark, breast cancer is the most common fatal cancer in women with more than 4700 new
      cases annually. All patients are treated according to national guidelines developed by the
      Danish Breast Cancer Cooperative Group (DBCG). Treatment primarily consists of surgical
      removal of all or parts of the breast and simultaneous removal of one-or lymph nodes in the
      ipsilateral axilla. Subsequently, there may be a need for additional treatment with
      chemotherapy, radiation and / or anti-hormonal therapy, in order to reduce the risk of
      recurrence.

      Up to 60% of women who are treated surgically for breast cancer, will experience chronic
      pain as a consequence of the treatment. This condition was previously referred to as &quot;Post
      Mastectomy Pain Syndrome&quot;, but because the condition is also seen after less extensive forms
      of breast cancer surgery, the condition is now termed &quot;Post Therapy Breast Pain Syndrome&quot;
      (PBTPS). PBTPS is defined as a neuropathic pain condition with pain localized to the axilla,
      the medial part of the upper arm, chest and or chest wall of the side of surgery, lasting
      more than three months after surgery and / or the end of treatment.

      In 2011 Caviggioli et al. published a study where lipotransplantation to the mastectomy area
      was found to have a significant analgesic effect. The aforementioned study is to date the
      only published study in the field. However, it is not a randomized study. In order to obtain
      further evidence of the apparent beneficial effect of lipotransplantation on pain, the
      present study has been initiated.

      Lipotransplantation is a fast and relatively non-invasive technique which is described in
      detail by Coleman et al.. Additionally, in a study from 2008, Klinger et al. found that
      lipotransplantation to burn scars in the face resulted in a significant improvement in the
      patient's skin and scar quality and also reduced pain in the treated areas. The theoretical
      basis for the scar and skin modifying effects of lipotransplantation has not yet been
      finally understood. To the best of our knowledge, no studies have systematically
      investigated and analysed the effects of lipotransplantation on the irradiated mastectomy
      area on a histological level.

      The purpose of the study

      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether lipotransplantation to the pain affected
      mastectomy area, could have an analgesic effect in women affected by Post Breast Therapy
      Pain Syndrome. Secondary, we wish to investigate the scar and skin modulating effects of
      lipotransplantation to the same area.

      By carrying out immunohistochemical staining and subsequent stereoscopic microscopy of free
      nerve endings in the skin biopsies taken before and after lipotransplantationen we wish to
      determine whether changes in the number and type of free nerve endings is part of the
      mechanism of pain reduction.

      By histologically comparing the amount of elastin and the distribution of the different
      types of collagen before and after lipotransplantation we also strive to illuminate the scar
      tissue modelling effects of lipotransplantation.

      Hypotheses

        -  Lipotransplantation to the area under the scar tissue and the area under the
           pain-afflicted area reduces the pain in women with PBTPS.

        -  The neuropathic pain in PBTPS is correlated to the number of free nerve endings
           crossing the border between the dermis and the epidermis

        -  Lipotransplantation have a beneficial effect on the scar tissue structure and improves
           the skin quality.

      Patients

      Women who have undergone unilateral mastectomy for breast cancer at Aarhus University
      Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark and has finished their adjuvant postoperative radiation therapy at
      least 6 months ago. Patients must have had pain localized to the area of the missing breast
      for at least three months after adjuvant radiation therapy ended. A total of 60 patients
      with PBTPS will be included.

      Furthermore, a control group of 30 patients without PBTPS is to be included. The control
      group will serve as a baseline group in regards to the nerve fibre properties of the skin in
      the mastectomy area for patients who have undergone the same treatment but haven't developed
      PBTPS.

      Methods

      Patients with Post Breast Therapy Pain Syndrome (PBTPS)

      Patients with PBTPS are randomly assigned to receive either lipotransplantation or no active
      treatment.

      Regardless of randomization, the patient will be invited to three follow-up visits,
      respectively 3, 6 and 12 months after inclusion/surgery. At each of the outpatient visits
      the participant will be asked to complete the DoloTest ® and the Patient Scar Assessment
      Scale. The clinician will complete the Observer Scar Assessment Scale and record the
      consumption of pain medication. DoloTest ® is a validated, visual analogue questionnaire
      designed to assess the patients experienced pain and impact on the patients daily life. Two
      3-mm punch biopsies will be taken at inclusion and at the follow-up visits visits 3 and 12
      months after inclusion, regardless of which group the patient was randomized to. One of the
      3-mm skin punch biopsy is taken directly from the scar. The second 3-mm skin biopsy is taken
      in the area of the missing breast the patient has designated as the most pain afflicted. If
      the patient's pain trigger area is located directly in the scar, the second skin punch
      biopsy will be taken at a distance of 1 cm from the scar.

      Patients without PBTPS

      The second control group, consisting of 30 women who have not developed PBTPS, will be
      subjected to a 3-mm skin punch biopsy from the skin above their mastectomy scar. The group
      will consist of patients who have opted for a secondary breast reconstruction, and the
      biopsy will be taken during the reconstructive procedure to ensure minimal added risk and
      discomfort.

      Histological examination

      The skin punch biopsies from the pain afflicted area will be fixed in 4% phosphate buffered
      paraformaldehyde. After freezing, the tissue samples are cut into 50-micron thick sections.
      Systematically sampled sections immunostained with rabbit anti-human Protein Gene Product
      9.5 (a neuron-specific protein), and DAB-marked goat anti-rabbit as the secondary antibody.
      The sections are then microscoped in an Olympus BX51 light microscope with an Olympus DP71
      digital camera and Prior motorized board connected to a computer with Newcast stereology
      software. Two goals can then be calculated: 1) the number of free nerve endings, which
      crosses the border between dermis and epidermis per mm 2) the average nerve fibre length
      density in the epidermis and / or dermis.

      The skin punch biopsies from the mastectomy scar are fixed in formaldehyde for embedding in
      paraffin. The tissue samples are cut into 1-2 micron thick sections and stained with
      Picrosirius red (PR) colour. By using polarized light microscopy, the various subtypes of
      collagen fibres may be visualized and differentiated. The thicker collagen fibres (type I)
      are red-orange-yellow and the thinner collagen fibres (type III) are green. Furthermore, the
      sections will be stained for elastin. Quantitatively, by means of the above-mentioned
      method, changes in the volume fraction of collagen type I and III, and elastin may be
      measured.

      Statistical analyzes

      The minimal clinically relevant difference the study is looking for, is a Visual Analog Pain
      score difference of 3. The common standard deviation was estimated from a similar study by
      Caviggioli et al. in 2011, and set to be 2.96 on the Visual Analog Pain scale. We assume
      that our standard deviation (SD) will be the same. Using the following formula: N = (Za +
      Zb)2 x SD2 / dif2 where Za and Zb are the standardized normal deviations corresponding to
      the selected levels of significance, SD is Standard Deviation and dif is the minimal
      clinically relevant difference the study is looking for. The result is 16 patients in each
      arm, totalling 32 patients, when the significance level is set at 5% and the power of the
      study is set to 80%. We plan to include 30 patients in each group, which will increase the
      power of the study to 97.5%. Statistical analyzes will be performed in collaboration with a
      biostatistician from the Health Sciences Institution, Aarhus University, Denmark.

      Economic Conditions

      The project is supported by: Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Aarhus with three
      full time equivalents, which is used to pay for full-time academic staff. Other project
      expenses are to be covered by independent foundations and endowments that do not have an
      influence on the study. None of the personnel in the project have a financial interest in
      the project.

      Compensation to the participating patients

      The participating patients in the study will not receive any financial compensation.
      However, documented travel expenses will be reimbursed.

      Recruitment of participants

      The patients will always be offered at least 24 hours of consideration before deciding to
      give written consent to participate in the study. With the signing of the consent form, the
      patient accepts the terms and conditions in the study. The patient may at any time and
      without justification withdraw her consent to participate, without her decision affecting
      her present or future treatment or any other rights the patient may have.

      Patients with PBTPS are recruited during their routine visits at the department of oncology.

      Patients without PBTPS are recruited at their standard visit before the breast
      reconstructive procedure that they have opted for.

      Publication of results

      Negative, inconclusive and positive results from the study will be published in
      internationally recognized, peer-reviewed, English-language journals with an interest in the
      field.

      Ethical statement, side effects and risks

      In the present project, data will be treated confidentially in accordance with the Danish
      Act on Processing of Personal Data. Participants shall be informed both in writing and
      orally prior to deciding to participate in the study. The participants are thus fully aware
      of the projects purpose, background and methods, as well as what is expected from the
      patient's role as a participant.

      The participating patients are in the lipotransplantation group, offered an active
      treatment, which if the current study program can confirm the foreign study, hopefully
      reduces their daily pain and discomfort and thereby also their consumption of analgesia. If
      the project provides positive results, the control group will, after the study has ended, be
      offered the same active treatment.

      The patients, which only after informed consent, is part of the project will, in connection
      with:

        1. Lipotransplantation in general anaesthesia; only be exposed to the risk associated with
           general anaesthesia. The patients in the present study have in relation to their
           previous surgery for breast cancer been exposed to one or more interventions in general
           anaesthesia.

        2. Risks related to the actual lipotransplantation. At the donor site, there is a risk for
           short-term tenderness and temporary discolouration. In the long term, a slightly rough
           surface of the skin may arise. The advantage of the harvest of the fat graft is that
           the patient achieves a visible improvement of the contour at the donor site.

        3. The risk related to the skin punch biopsies: apart from a small scar 1-3 mm
           corresponding to the place where the biopsy is collected, there is not assessed to any
           risk of permanent injury or damage.

      All interventions are carried out by experienced specialists in plastic surgery with several
      years experience with lipotransplantation. The general anaesthesia is performed by
      specialists in anaesthesiology, which are all part of the permanent team at the plastic
      surgery department and therefore familiar with providing anaesthesia during the described
      procedures.
