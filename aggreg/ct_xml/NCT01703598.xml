  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether performing deep brain stimulation surgery
      for Parkinson's disease using intraoperative imaging and frameless stereotaxis is
      noninferior to using frame-based stereotaxy and microelectrode recording.

    <textblock>
      Background: Frame-based stereotaxis and microelectrode recording (MER) with mapping of
      target structures has been the gold standard for deep brain stimulator (DBS) implantation.
      Though supported by historical considerations, no Class I or II evidence exists that MER
      adds significant value to the DBS implant procedure. With the advent of advanced magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) imaging, particularly intra-operative
      imaging, the argument for the continued use of MER during DBS implantation has been
      substantially weakened.  One rationale for pursuing CT-guided intraoperative imaging is due
      to presumed increase in patient comfort with this method.  DBS implantation with MER
      requires that the patient remain awake during the entire procedure.  , MER with frame-based
      stereotaxis requires the patient to keep their head in a fixed position for a prolonged
      period of time during which time they remain awake, causing significant patient discomfort.
      Furthermore, Parkinson's disease patients must withhold their PD meds for a minimum of 12
      hours prior to the procedure adding a sometimes significant degree of discomfort and anxiety
      to the procedure.

      Objective: The goal of this study is to compare the clinical outcomes of DBS electrodes
      placed using intraoperative CT and frameless stereotaxis with those placed using MER and
      frame-based stereotaxis.

      Design: The proposed study will be a prospective non-interventional data collection study.

      Setting and Subjects: Subjects for this study will be idiopathic Parkinson's disease
      patients identified from the Oregon Health &amp; Science University movement disorder clinic as
      candidates for deep brain stimulation therapy.  Enrollment will continue until fifty
      subjects have been implanted with electrodes using frameless stereotaxis and intraoperative
      CT. Data  regarding  quality of life,  motor control, and amount of time during the day
      without levodopa side effects will be collected pre-operatively and post-operatively. This
      data will be compared to historical controls who have been implanted with DBS electrodes
      using MER and frame-based stereotaxis. All surgical procedures will involve only Federal
      Drug Administration (FDA) approved stereotactic equipment, used in the manner for which they
      have been approved.  All clinic procedures are standard of care for movement disorders
      patients in the deep brain stimulation program.

      Intervention: This study will be a non-interventional data collection study.

      Measurements: Data regarding patient age, diagnosis, intracranial target, complications,
      Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale UPDRS Parts 3 (motor examination) and 4 (drug side
      effects), Parkinson's Disease Quality of life PDQ-39, 3 day motor diary, 3 month falls
      diary, neuropsychiatric evaluation and days in hospital following surgery will be collected.

      Analysis:   The patients will be examined prior to DBS placement both on and off
      dopaminergic medications.  They will then be examined 3 months and 6 months following DBS
      placement both on and off drug with stimulator on after programming parameters have been
      optimized.  The following measures will be performed:

        -  Change in UPDRS Parts 3 and 4

        -  Change in PDQ-39

        -  Change in amount of time patient is experiencing Parkinson's disease symptoms and/or
           side effects of treatment.

        -  Change in number of falls

        -  Change in neuropsychiatric evaluation, including:

        -  Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II)

        -  Mattis Dementia Rating Scale-Second Edition (DRS-2)

        -  Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS)

        -  Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R)

        -  Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI) We will also compare the number of
           days spent in hospital following surgery.  Adverse events related to the surgery will
           be captured.
