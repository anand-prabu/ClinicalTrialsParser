To assess time to initiation of chemotherapy following TEMLA with or without minimally\n      invasive surgery and SBRT.\n\n      II. To assess feasibility/toxicity of combining TEMLA with or without minimally invasive\n      surgery with various chemotherapy regimens (to be determined by medical oncologist based on\n      patient and tumor characteristics).\n\n      III. To estimate survival following TEMLA with or without minimally invasive surgery and\n      SBRT.\n\n      IV. To define any differences in quality of life/toxicity following TEMLA with or without\n      minimally invasive surgery and SBRT based on tumor location (peripheral/central).\n\n      V.  To assess response for primary tumor control and overall survival in TEMLA only\n      patients.\n\n      VI.  To assess progression free survival for TEMLA/VATS patients.\n\n      OUTLINE:\n\n      Patients undergo TEMLA to remove the mediastinal lymph nodes followed by a single fraction\n      of SBRT to the primary tumor and mediastinal lymph node beds (if positive on TEMLA), with or\n      without minimally invasive surgery.\n\n      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 6, 9, and 12 months, and\n      then every 6 months for 4 years."
