            "textblock": "A loss of vascular reactivity and increased vascular tone is being increasingly recognised\n      as a significant cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor and highly predictive of future\n      CVD events. A previous study by our group has shown the inclusion of a fish oil mixture\n      administered alongside a high fat meal preserves postprandial vascular function in healthy\n      men [1]. In this three arm, placebo controlled cross over study, the impact of individual\n      fatty acids contained within fish-oil on postprandial vascular reactivity (measured at 4\n      hour post test meal) will be assessed for the first time. Clinical measurements of vascular\n      function which correlate with CVD risk factors and are predictive of future CVD events will\n      be undertaken in order to assess any potentially beneficial effects. In addition plasma\n      samples will be taken at 0 and 4 hours to determine the change in concentration of\n      modulators of vascular tone. Accordingly, our nutrients of interest which will be\n      administered in the intervention arms of the study, will be present in this lipoprotein rich\n      fraction. By exposing cells in culture to these EPA- and DHA-enriched lipoproteins,\n      mechanisms underlying the vascular response in our human volunteers will be investigated.\n      Finally we will measure the plasma fatty acid profile to confirm that circulating\n      concentrations of EPA and DHA are increasing postprandially according to intake.\n\n      As it is now recognised that genetic variation, in addition to being an important\n      determinant of the risk of all known chronic diseases, plays a large part in determining an\n      individual's response to dietary change, DNA will be extracted from whole blood taken at the\n      clinical screening and stored for subsequent genotyping for variants likely to be important\n      in the regulation of EPA and DHA metabolism and vascular tone. Although the current study\n      will not be fully powered to generate definite conclusion regarding genotype*diet\n      interactions, it will serve to generate pilot data for future studies."

EndoPat has also been shown to correlate with multiple known CVD risk factors and to be predictive of future cardiovascular events. In addition, EndoPat will be utilised alongside oral administration of nitroglycerin in order to establish if peripheral arterial tone is altered in response to EPA or DHA in a non-Nitric Oxide dependent manner. EndoPAT produces a reactive hyperaemic index score which is indicative of the endothelial's capacity to produce NO, which itself is indicative of general endothelial function. EndoPAT will be assessed using a standardised methodology developed by Itamar Medical, which involves measuring changes in dilation in response to induced hyperaemia.",
