There are no FDA approved\n      therapeutic treatments for this disease. Therefore, the objective of this study is to\n      collect natural history data from a large population of children and adults in order to\n      evaluate possible efficacy measures for planned clinical trials.\n\n      Participants will be recruited from each Investigator's own patient population as the study\n      requires the availability of both multiyear retrospective data, as well as ongoing\n      prospectively collected data."

If only one ABCA4\n             allele contains a pathogenic mutation, the patient shall have a typical Stargardt\n             phenotype, namely at least one eye must have flecks at the level of the retinal\n             pigment epithelium typical for STGD.\n\n          -  The primary study eye must have clear ocular media and adequate pupillary dilation to\n             permit good quality FAF and sd-OCT imaging in the opinion of the investigator.\n\n          -  Be able to cooperate in performing the examinations.\n\n          -  Be willing to undergo ocular examinations once every 6 months for up to 24 months.\n\n          -  Be at least six years old.\n\n          -  Both eyes can be included if inclusion criteria are fulfilled for both eyes.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  Ocular disease, such as choroidal neovascularization, glaucoma and diabetic\n             retinopathy, in either eye that may confound assessment of the retina morphologically\n             and functionally.\n\n          -  Intraocular surgery in the primary study eye within 90 days prior to baseline visit.\n\n          -  Current or previous participation in an interventional study to treat STGD such as\n             gene therapy or stem cell therapy. Current participation in a drug trial or previous\n             participation in a drug trial within six months before enrollment. The use of oral\n             supplements of vitamins and minerals are permitted although the current use of\n             Vitamin A supplementation shall be documented.\n\n          -  The site Principal Investigator may declare any patient at their site ineligible to\n             participate in the study for a sound medical reason prior to the patient's enrollment\n             into the study.\n\n          -  Any systemic disease with a limited survival prognosis (e.g. cancer, severe/unstable\n             cardiovascular disease).\n\n          -  Any condition that would interfere with the patient attending their regular follow-up\n             visits every 6 months for up to 24 months, e.g. personality disorder, use of major\n             tranquilizers such as Haldol or Phenothiazine, chronic alcoholism, Alzheimer's\n             Disease or drug abuse.\n\n          -  Evidence of significant uncontrolled concomitant diseases such as cardiovascular,\n             neurological, pulmonary, renal, hepatic, endocrine or gastro-intestinal disorders."
