            "textblock": "Women having cesarean sections commonly experience post-operative nausea and vomiting\n      (PONV). This can be partly attributed to the long acting morphine (duramorph) given in the\n      anesthetic (either through the epidural or in the spinal anesthetic). Intravenous\n      dexamethasone is a widely used steroid medication with a well-established safety profile\n      which is the standard of care for the prevention of PONV for general anesthesia in both\n      adult and pediatric surgical patients. Many studies have shown that when intravenous\n      dexamethasone is administered before duramorph in the epidural, the incidence of nausea and\n      vomiting following cesarean section is significantly reduced. However, when patients receive\n      intravenous dexamethasone after duramorph in a spinal anesthetic, it does not reduce the\n      incidence of nausea and vomiting. There are not any published studies where dexamethasone\n      was administered before a spinal anesthetic. The investigators believe that if dexamethasone\n      is given intravenously before duramorph in a spinal anesthetic it may reduce the incidence\n      of nausea and vomiting. Patients who present for scheduled (non-emergent) cesarean section\n      will be given either intravenous dexamethasone or placebo prior to receiving a duramorph\n      containing spinal anesthetic. The investigators will then compare the incidence of nausea\n      and vomiting and the use of rescue anti-nausea medications in both groups.  Our hypothesis\n      is that patients receiving dexamethasone prior to duramorph containing spinal anesthesia for\n      cesarean section will have a significantly lower incidence and severity of PONV at 0, 1, 3,\n      6, and 24 hours following surgery."
