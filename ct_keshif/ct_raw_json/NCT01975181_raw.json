Framingham risk score is calculated and in combination with other factors, a\n      global score for CVD risk is appraised.\n\n      Subjects then attend a half-day workshop on heart healthy behaviors including a cooking\n      demonstration that promulgates a Mediterranean Diet. At approximately monthly intervals,\n      subjects consult in 20 minute appointments with a dietician, exercise physiologist, and\n      stress management coach to work on behavioral improvements to encourage heart health.\n\n      At program's end, typically 6 to 8 months after enrollment in the Registry, subjects repeat\n      their CVD risk assessment to receive a personal report card detailing the results of their\n      therapeutic lifestyle changes."
