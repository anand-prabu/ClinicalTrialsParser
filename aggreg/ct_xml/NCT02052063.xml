  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The stapled transanal rectal resection (STARR) has recently been recommended for patients
      with obstructed defecation syndrome (ODS) caused by rectocele and rectal wall
      intussusception.

      The aim of STARR is to correct the mechanical outlet obstruction using a stapler device for
      endorectal resection of the distal rectum.

      This technique significantly improves constipation. However, there are several reports of
      new-onset faecal incontinence after STARR and urgency has been identified as the major
      side-effect of this procedure.

      Although this technique has become an important surgical option in the treatment of
      obstructive defaecation syndrome, its impact on continence can be problematic and objective
      data about parameters that predict its result are not yet available One study evaluated the
      anal function after surgery in 30 patients. In this study, urgency or incontinence was
      complained by 26% of patients. No sonographically demonstrable sphincter fragmentations were
      noticed in the endoanal exam performed at the follow-up.

      No significant difference was observed in anorectal manometry. Even if data are not
      statistically significant, resting and squeezing pressures are lower in those patients not
      satisfied.

      Currently, anal canal pressure measurements using ano-rectal manometry are the most common
      means of assessment of sphincter function. Some studies have been looking at the concept of
      distending sphincter regions as a better measure of its performance.

      The functional lumen imaging probe (FLIP) is a novel technique which has the ability to
      provide real-time images of the function of human gastrointestinal sphincter during
      distension. This distensibility technique provides an important new way of studying the anal
      canal and hence may have a role in testing sphincter competence in patients with disorders
      after STARR procedure.

      Twenty-eight patients will be enrolled in this study over a period of 36 months.

      Preoperative assessment will include

        -  clinical examination

        -  the Wexner Incontinence Score and the Faecal Incontinence Quality-of-Life Index (FIQL)
           to rate anal incontinence

        -  video defecography, anorectal manometry, anal ultrasound (AUS) and measure of anal
           sphincter distensibility using endoFLIP Follow-up evaluation will scheduled for 3
           months after surgery, and will include symptom evaluation (using the same standard
           questionnaires for incontinence), clinical examination and investigation using anal
           ultrasound  and endoFLIP.

      If we demonstrate that this surgical technique can cause anal lesions with decreased
      sphincter competence, this may lead to a modification of the surgical technique especially
      in patients at risk of developing postoperative anal incontinence.
