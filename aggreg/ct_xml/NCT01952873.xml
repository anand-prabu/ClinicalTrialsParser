  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is universally accepted that high-pressure balloon inflation is required to most
      effectively deploy a coronary balloon-expandable stent. However, there is not consensus nor
      are there any guidelines regarding the method of balloon inflation, particularly the
      duration of inflation.  Underexpansion and strut malapposition after stent deployment are
      among the most powerful predictors for adverse vessel outcomes.  High-pressure inflation for
      stent deployment is effective to optimally expand the stent, but unlike in vitro testing in
      air, there are poorly distensible plaque elements that may not instantaneously yield to the
      balloon pressure. However, these elements may ultimately yield to prolonged inflation.  Most
      clinical interventional cardiologists inflate for a relatively short period (15-30 sec). The
      investigators have noted that when balloon pressure is maintained at a certain pressure
      level it tends to decrease over time, and may require 60-180 or more seconds to maintain
      pressure stability. This finding implies that plaque elements are yielding slowly over time
      to the increased pressure, thus increasing expansion, and suggests that a prolonged
      inflation until balloon pressure stabilizes is more effective than a rapid
      inflation/deflation sequence to fully expand and appose the stent to the vessel wall. At
      present there is no consensus on stent deployment strategy. It is our hypothesis that
      prolonged inflation is superior to the more commonly used strategy of rapid
      inflation/deflation.

      Optimal coherence tomography (OCT), a novel technology that measures near-infrared light
      reflections and translates them into a 2D image, has an axial resolution nearly 10-times
      that of intravascular ultrasound (IVUS). Thus it is possible to examine the extent of stent
      apposition and stent expansion using this modality.

      The current randomized trial tests the hypothesis that prolonged balloon inflation until a
      stable balloon pressure is maintained is more effective than a rapid inflation/deflation
      sequence when performed to the same balloon inflation pressure.
