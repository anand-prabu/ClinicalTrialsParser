  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this trial is to evaluate the safety of the study drug in healthy participants
      and participants with diabetes. It will investigate how much of the study drug gets into the
      blood stream and how long it takes the body to get rid of it. Information about any side
      effects that may occur will also be collected.

      The study consists of two parts. Part A will study healthy participants in up to 3 dosing
      periods over approximately 6 weeks. Part B will study participants with diabetes in up to 3
      dosing periods over approximately 6 weeks.
