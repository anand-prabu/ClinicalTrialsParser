While whole\n      blood donation is very safe, some donors experience faintness during or after donation. Any\n      injury resulting from a fall increases its seriousness, especially when it happens outside\n      the donation site.\n\n      According to various studies, adverse reactions are experienced by between 0.28% and 2.72%\n      of all donors and occur in all categories (sex and age).\n\n      A retrospective evaluation of the frequency of faintness incidents on during whole blood\n      donation over 2012 in the Rhone Alpes' region of France shows a frequency ranging from 1.05%\n      in mobile donation units in towns to 4.24% in donation units in high schools, with no\n      reporting of delayed incidents of faintness by this donor population."

They can have an impact on the frequency of donation as well as\n      on the blood donor's motivation and that in their close entourage. This impact should not be\n      overlooked in the context of the increasing need for blood components and tighter budgets..\n\n      In some other national health systems, the donor is given a drink shortly before giving\n      blood and / or donors are advised to do lower-body muscle tensing exercises whilst giving\n      blood.\n\n      The present study has a factorial design and compares 3 arms for hydration criteria and 2\n      arms for exercise criteria  with cluster randomization (1 cluster = 1 blood donation unit).\n      The randomization plan will be stratified according to the type of EFS donation unit (French\n      Blood Donation service: Etablissement Fran\u00e7ais du Sang): Fixed/Mobile unit; and also on the\n      location of the of mobile blood donation unit: in companies, towns or schools.
