  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stenting for systematic Intracranial artery stenosis is challenged recently, especially for
      safety. This registry is aimed to explore the safety profile during peri-operation period in
      Stenting procedures for systematic Intracranial artery stenosis in Chinese population in
      real world.
