We hypothesize that the combination\n      will be more effective than either agent alone in patients presenting to the emergency\n      department with acute pain from musculoskeletal injuries such as sprain, and bruises.  While\n      each agent alone is effective to some degree, many patients do not find complete relief with\n      them and often narcotic agents (with all of their potential side effects) are added.  In\n      this study patients experiencing any pain will be randomly given either ibuprofen OR\n      acetaminophen OR their combination and their degree of pain severity will be measured every\n      15 minutes up to one hour.  At the end of this 1 hour patients still experiencing pain and\n      requiring additional pain relief will receive additional analgesics at the discretion of\n      their treating physician.  We will not only measure how much the pain severity was reduced\n      but also the percentage of patients that require some form of additional or \"rescue\"\n      medication."
