            "textblock": "Depression and anxiety are among our most common diseases and the prevalence is increasing.\n      When suffering from depression or anxiety, the individual's ability to cope with everyday\n      life occupations is decreased, as well as the ability to relate to others. The Tree Theme\n      Method\u00ae (TTM) is a treatment method. The purpose is to enhance the ability to develop\n      strategies for occupations in everyday life and relationships with others. The method\n      involves using creative activities to create a life story focusing on everyday occupations\n      and to create an imagination of future possibilities/goals. The TTM is a short-term therapy\n      with five sessions. The treatment also implies that the patient is asked to identify various\n      homework tasks to perform between the sessions.\n\n      The aim of the project is to investigate the effects of the TTM compared to a control group\n      for people with depression and anxiety diagnosis. The intention is to examine the effect on\n      outcome measures regarding psychological symptoms, everyday occupations and health. The\n      study has been approved by the Regional Ethical Review Board.\n\n      The project is a randomized multicenter study with an intervention group and a control\n      group. A total of 130 patients will be included. Inclusion criteria are patients with\n      depression and/or anxiety in the age of 18-65 years and who have problems with their\n      everyday occupations. Exclusion criteria are individuals with a severe somatic illness or\n      psychosis and/or who have difficulties to understand and fill out self-rating\n      questionnaires. The hypothesis is that the intervention group has a higher degree of\n      improved mental health and structure in everyday occupations, compared with the control\n      group.\n\n      The project implies that doctors referral appropriate patients to the occupational\n      therapist. After informed consent each patient will be drawn to the TTM or control. Before\n      and after the treatment, as well as 3 and 12 months after finished treatment the patient\n      will meet a project assistant in order to respond to questionnaires regarding psychological\n      symptoms, everyday occupations and health.\n\n      The study is a collaborative project involving the Region Sk\u00e5ne, Kronoberg County Council,\n      and J\u00f6nk\u00f6ping County Council. Doctors will recruit patients and occupational therapists will\n      perform the treatment. The research team comprise of researchers from Kronoberg County\n      Council (B Gunnarsson and K Hedin), Lund University (C H\u00e5kansson) and School of Health\n      Sciences in J\u00f6nk\u00f6ping (P Wagman)."
