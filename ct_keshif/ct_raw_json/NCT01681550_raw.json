Currently,\n      some of these agents have been approved in combination with insulin. The potential for\n      combined use with insulin has garnered increasing attention due to reduce side effects\n      associated with insulin therapy and improve glycemic control. Some investigators reported\n      that GLP-1 analogue combined with insulin reduces HbA1c and weight with low risk of\n      hypoglycemia and high treatment satisfaction (3). However, their duration of treatment was\n      short time with less than a mean of 3.0 years and the alterations of chronic diabetic\n      complications by combination with incretin-based and insulin therapies are not known.\n\n      We evaluated the long effects of adding incretin-based therapy (DPP-4 inhibitors or GLP-1\n      analogues) to insulin therapy on glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) as glycemic control, body mass\n      index (BMI), blood pressure (BP), insulin dosage, frequency of hypoglycemia, and chronic\n      diabetic complications for 5 years-treatments."

Insulin therapy consisted of subcutaneous injections of long-acting insulin\n      analogues prior to sleep and bolus subcutaneous injections of rapid-acting insulin analogues\n      in multiple daily injections, or subcutaneous injections of mixed insulin analogues twice a\n      day. In spite of the treatments, when the physician in charge judged that their values of\n      HbA1c were inappropriate, the physician added the pharmacotherapy combined the insulin to\n      incretin-based therapy.                                                    2.3.2.
