It is known that antibiotics, like all medications, have side-effects although\n      these are rare.  This research study is designed to show us whether antibiotics improve\n      wound healing or not, so that we may determine if we should continue using antibiotics even\n      if they have side-effects in some patients.\n\n      Our  hypothesis is that patients treated with post-operative, systemic antibiotics will\n      demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in the survival of their facial full\n      thickness skin grafts compared to patients who are not treated with systemic antibiotics."
