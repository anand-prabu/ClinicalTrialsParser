In an exploratory aim, we will also assess whether there is a clinically\n      meaningful response as defined by improvement in both PTSD symptoms and QOL (defined as a\n      reliable change of 12 points on the CAPS and 10 points on the MCS, respectively, according\n      to the reliable change index).7, 8 One hundred fifty-two Veterans with PTSD will be\n      randomized to MBSR (n = 76) or CPT-C (n = 76). Comprehensive assessments will take place\n      post-treatment and 3 months later. Qualitative analysis of brief semi-structured interview\n      data will be used to identify previously unrecognized factors pertaining to participation,\n      adherence and response to treatment, spirituality and religion as treatment moderators, and\n      to identify common themes that may inform treatment retention efforts for both MBSR and\n      CPT-C. In addition, potential moderators of change in PTSD symptoms and QOL for MBSR and\n      CPT-C will be identified."
