Daily administration of\n      either probiotics or placebo will be continued from the date of inclusion in the study until\n      the date of liver transplantation. A quantitative and qualitative analyses of faecal\n      microflora will be performed in each patient before and after 10 week period (or shorter,\n      depending on the time on the waiting list) of administration of either probiotic or placebo.\n      Microbiological analyses of air samples from patients' home environment will be performed in\n      each case.
