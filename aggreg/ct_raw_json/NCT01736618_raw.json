The target enrollment sample size\n      is 1,616 subjects at up to 150 investigational sites to achieve 1,025 subjects in the\n      analysis cohort at 60 months.\n\n        -  The primary safety endpoint of the study is the Type I (caused by the S-ICD System)\n           Complication Free Rate at 60 months compared to a performance goal of 85%.\n\n        -  The primary effectiveness endpoint is the Overall Shock Effectiveness in Converting\n           Spontaneous Discrete Episodes of VT/VF through 60 months compared to a performance goal\n           of 94%.\n\n        -  The secondary safety endpoint of the study is the Electrode-Related Complication Free\n           Rate at 60 months compared to a performance goal of 92.5%.\n\n        -  The secondary effectiveness endpoint is First Shock Effectiveness in Converting Induced\n           (Acute) and Spontaneous Discrete Episodes of VT/VF through 60 months compared to a\n           performance goal of 84.0%.\n\n      Additional objectives include characterization of long term safety and effectiveness in\n      subjects of varied body habitus and in traditionally underrepresented populations.\n\n      Subjects must meet the following criteria to be eligible for inclusion in the study:\n\n        1. Eligible for implantation with an S-ICD System, OR previously implanted with an S-ICD\n           System in the S-ICD System Clinical Investigation (IDE G090013)\n\n        2.

Remaining life expectancy of less than 360 days\n\n      Enrolled subjects will be followed at the implant procedure, predischarge and annual(\u00b160\n      days) follow-up visits.
