  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with high aldosterone hormone have higher blood glucose than normal people. This
      study is being done to understand how aldosterone hormone affects the nerve activity that
      controls blood flow in the muscles and blood glucose. The information may be helpful in
      selecting blood pressure medications which can improve not only blood pressure but also
      improve blood sugar.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with primary aldosteronism are known to have impaired insulin sensitivity, which is
      improved after removal of aldosterone-producing adenoma. In patients with essential
      hypertension, plasma aldosterone levels have been also shown to positively correlate with
      indices of insulin resistance.

      Mechanism underlying aldosterone-induced insulin resistance is unknown. Aldosterone has been
      shown to interfere with insulin signaling the vascular cells by increasing production of
      reactive oxygen species via activation of NADPH oxidase, resulting in decreased availability
      of nitric oxide (NO), the key mediator for insulin-mediated vasodilation. Treatment with
      mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists has been shown to improve insulin sensitivity in mice
      with obesity and metabolic syndrome. Aldosterone has also been shown to increase resting
      sympathetic vasoconstrictor activity to the peripheral circulation. However, effects of
      aldosterone and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists on insulin-mediated skeletal muscle
      vasodilation, sympathetic activation, and vascular oxidative stress have not been assessed
      in humans.

      The investigators will collect venous endothelial cells, and measure skeletal muscle
      microvascular perfusion using Octafluoropropane microbubble contrast agents, and measure
      sympathetic nerve activity in normotensive controls (NT), stage 1 essential hypertensive
      subjects (ET), and patients with primary aldosteronism (PA) during hyperinsulinemic
      euglycemic clamp.

    <description>We will collect venous endothelial cells, and measure skeletal muscle microvascular perfusion using Octafluoropropane microbubble contrast agents (Definity), and measure sympathetic nerve activity in normotensive controls (NT), stage 1 essential hypertensive subjects (ET), and patients with primary aldosteronism (PA) during hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp. A 2-h euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp will take place after 12 hour fast. The antegrade line will be used to infuse insulin,  dextrose and  Normal Saline Solution (NSS) with potassium chloride.  The plasma insulin concentration will be acutely raised and maintained at  a steady concentration. The plasma glucose concentration will be held constant. Microvascular blood flow will be assessed during the clamp. Then the subjects will be asked to return to the lab in 4 weeks to finish studying in the remaining arm.</description>

    <description>Flow mediated vasodilation (FMD), which is a non-invasive assessment of endothelial function, will be performed on the brachial artery using ultrasound. After a clear picture of the artery has been obtained, the cuff on the same arm will be inflated until it is tight for five minutes.

    <description>We will collect endothelial cells from a superficial vein, usually in the arm. Following insertion of a peripheral intravenous (IV) catheter, we will collect cells from the inner lining of the vein using a thin, flexible J-tipped wire.

    <description>Using high-resolution ultrasound, we will measure skeletal muscle blood flow during infusion of a solution containing the octafluoropropane microbubble contrast agent, Definity. The solution will be a dilution of 1 vial of Definity to 30 cc of normal saline. The ultrasound probe will be placed over the forearm to obtain images while octafluoropropane microbubbles (Definity) are infused intravenously at the rate of 0.20 to 0.27 ml/min, not to exceed a maximum dose of 2 vials per study subject per day or visit. The microvascular perfusion assessment using Definity be performed at rest as well as during slow and fast handgrip exercises.</description>

    <description>Investigators will measure sympathetic nerve activity from the peroneal nerve by inserting a tiny needle directly into the nerve in the leg. Investigators will localize the nerve by electrical stimulation over the skin using a blunt probe. With this stimulation, subject will notice either involuntary twitching or a tingling sensation, which may be annoying but not painful. Investigators will then introduce a tiny, sterile wire needle (an electrode) through the skin at the same location. When the tip of the needle enters the nerve, subjects may again notice involuntary muscle twitches or tingling in the leg. Investigators will then turn the electrical stimulator off and make minor adjustments in the position of the needle until investigators begin to record the nerve signals. The recording needle will remain in position throughout the study.</description>
