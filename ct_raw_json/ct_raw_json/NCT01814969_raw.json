In these studies documented a significant reduction in\n      tumor mass as a result of preoperative radiotherapy or radiochemotherapy theoretically\n      increases the chance of performing operations with sphincters preservation, even in cases\n      originally eligible for abdomino - perineal resection.  There is the question whether the\n      combination of preoperative hyperfractionated radiotherapy and concurrent chemotherapy may\n      cause the further improvement of treatment outcome in patients with locally advanced rectal\n      cancer. Published in 2012 by Gerard et al. meta-analysis of randomized trials dedicated to\n      the treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer, confirms a higher percentage of\n      sphincters preservation in patients operated after more than 5-week interval between\n      neoadjuvant therapy and surgery.\n\n      Analysis of these issues will be taken in the current study. Comparison of the two treatment\n      regimens as preoperative phase III study with stratification for time interval between the\n      end of radiotherapy or radiochemotherapy and surgery may show differences that have not been\n      seen in previously published data."
