An immunoglobin  is a blood\n      protein. Hizentra is being studied for the treatment of patients with MG. Hizentra is\n      administered by an injection into the skin through a portable infusion pump, which may be\n      easier for patients to administer than the current treatments.\n\n      Participants will be asked to complete 9 clinic visits and 3 telephone calls. It could take\n      up to 30 weeks to complete all study visits."
