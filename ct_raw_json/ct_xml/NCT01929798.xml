  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to assess the performance of an Artificial Pancreas (AP) device
      using the Portable Artificial Pancreas System (pAPS) platform for subjects with type 1
      diabetes using an insulin pump and rapid acting insulin.  This proposed study is designed to
      compare closed-loop control with or without optimization of initialization parameters
      related to basal insulin infusion rates and insulin to carbohydrate (I:C) ratios for meals
      and snacks.

      The study consists of an evaluation of the Artificial Pancreas device system during two
      24-27.5-hour closed-loop phases in an outpatient/hotel environment.  Prior to the
      closed-loop phases, each subject will undergo a 7-day data collection period consisting of
      his or her usual free-living conditions along with 3 meals of known carbohydrate content.
      Data from the insulin pump, a continuous glucose monitoring sensor (CGM), diet and exercise
      records will be collected during this period.  These data from this 7-day period will be
      analyzed in order to come up with adapted basal insulin infusion rates and bolus insulin to
      carbohydrate (I:C) ratios.

    <description>The percentage time spent in safe blood glucose range of [80-140] mg/dl will be the primary endpoint. More time spent inside the desired range will be considered successful. Expected levels are [70-180] mg/dl the 5 hours after meals and [70-150] mg/dl 3 hours after exercise.</description>

    <description>The secondary endpoint measures glucose extremes and the need for outside intervention to prevent hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia. Interventions would be insulin injections or oral carbohydrates given to the subject by the physician. No need for physician intervention will be considered a successful outcome.</description>
