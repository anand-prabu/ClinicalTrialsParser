            "textblock": "Cerebral cavernous malformations (CCMs) are clusters of abnormal blood vessels in the brain\n      and spine. CCMs can bleed and cause strokes, seizures, and headaches. In some patients, CCMs\n      affect the blood brain barrier (BBB). The BBB is the body's separation of blood and its\n      contents in the brain from the brain tissue itself. Abnormal leakiness or permeability of\n      this barrier can cause disease. We will measure the permeability (leakiness) of the BBB\n      using a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique called dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI\n      (DCEMRI). The purpose of this study is to look at whether statin medications change the\n      permeability (leakiness) of the blood brain barrier in CCM patients. Statin medications are\n      used to lower cholesterol levels and prevent heart attack and stroke. In addition, this\n      medication may decrease the risk of brain hemorrhage or bleeding in patients with CCM. This\n      study will examine whether the permeability of the BBB changes following the administration\n      of simvastatin for three months."
