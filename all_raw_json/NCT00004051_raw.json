Characterize the\n      single and multiple dose pharmacokinetics of oral irinotecan and its metabolites, SN-38 and\n      SN-38 glucuronide, in these patients. III. Document any antitumor activity in these patients\n      treated with this regimen.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive oral irinotecan once daily for 14\n      days. Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable\n      toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of irinotecan until the maximum\n      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2\n      or more of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicity. Patients are followed monthly for 6\n      months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 3-40 patients will be accrued for this study."
