            "textblock": "Forced blockade of the renin-angiotensin-system (RAS) by using direct renin inhibition (DRI)\n      has long been propagated to effectuate beneficial outcomes. However, recent large clinical\n      trials have outlined harmful effects for DRI in combination with other forms of RAS\n      blockade. To date, information regarding DRI as RAS-blocking monotherapy is very limited.\n      Furthermore, it remains to be elucidated how DRI and angiotensin receptor blockers affect\n      the so-called 'classical' and 'alternative' RAS molecularly. As components of the\n      'alternative' RAS (e.g. Ang 1-7) have moved into research focus, it would be of importance\n      to determine angiotensin regulation with medical RAS blockade.\n\n      In this prospective, single-center randomized trial over 10 weeks, 24 patients with chronic\n      kidney disease (CKD) stage III-IV (eGFR 15-59 ml/min) will be randomized to take either\n      aliskiren (up to 300 mg per day) or candesartan (up to 16 mg per day) after a two week\n      run-in phase where all RAS-blockers are eliminated. The investigators will then employ a\n      novel mass spectrometry-based quantification method (after run-in and 10 weeks) to capture\n      the concentrations of ten different angiotensin peptides (including angiotensin I and II,\n      angiotensin 1-7 and angiotensin 1-5).\n\n      The investigators hypothesize that significant differences exist between angiotensin levels\n      in CKD patients with DRI compared to angiotensin receptor blockers. Specifically, the\n      investigators expect to determine the regulation of the alternative RAS represented by\n      angiotensin 1-7 with proximal versus distal blockade of the system.\n\n      Our data might contribute to a more profound understanding of results from registries and\n      clinical trials beyond the clinical effects of RAS blockade. Further, the study's results\n      might help to individualize and optimize RAS-blocking therapy strategies in CKD patients."
