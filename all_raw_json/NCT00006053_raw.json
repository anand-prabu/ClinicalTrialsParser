II. Provide\n      expanded access of this treatment to these patients. III. Confirm the rate of complete and\n      major cytogenetic response in patients treated with this regimen, as demonstrated by a\n      decrease in the percentage of Philadelphia chromosome positive cells in the bone marrow. IV.\n      Evaluate the improvement of symptomatic parameters in patients treated with this regimen.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is an expanded access, multicenter study. Patients receive oral STI571 daily.\n      Treatment continues for 12 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable\n      toxicity. Patients who respond after 12 months may continue with therapy.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Not determined"
