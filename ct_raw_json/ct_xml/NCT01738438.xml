    <textblock>
      This research study is  Phase II clinical trial, which tests the safety and effectiveness of
      an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a specific cancer.
      &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is being studied. It also means that the FDA has not
      yet approved XL184 for use in patients, including people with your type of cancer.

      XL184 is a drug that may stop cancer cells from growing.  It is a small molecule kinase
      inhibitor that inhibitors met and VEGFR2, as well as other targets. This drug has been used
      in Phase I studies in humans and laboratory experiments, and information from those other
      research studies suggests that this drug may help to slow tumor progression in this research
      study.  This drug has also been used in a phase II study for breast cancer patients (a
      randomized discontinuation trial) suggesting good benefit for this group of patients.

      In this research study, we are looking at the anti-tumor effects of XL184 in metastatic
      breast cancer.

      In order to determine if you are eligible to participate in this study you will need to
      undergo some tests and procedures. Many of these tests and procedures are likely to be part
      of regular cancer care and may be done even if it turns out that you do not take part in the
      research study. If you have had some of these tests and procedures recently, they may or may
      not have to be repeated. These tests and procedures include a medical history, physical
      exam, performance status, assessment of your tumor, blood tests, a urine test and a
      pregnancy test (if applicable). If these tests show that you are eligible to participate in
      the research study, you will begin the study treatment. If you do not meet the eligibility
      criteria, you will not be able to participate in this research study.

      If you take part in this research study, you will be given a one month supply of XL184 and a
      study drug-dosing calendar for each treatment cycle. Each treatment cycle lasts 3 weeks
      during which time you will be taking the study drug once per day by mouth.

      During all cycles you will have a physical exam and you will be asked questions about your
      general health and specific questions about any problems that you might be having and any
      medications you may be taking.

      The investigators will assess your tumor by CT scan or MRI after 6 weeks of treatment, and
      then every nine weeks you remain on treatment.

      The investigators will try to obtain samples of your tumor tissue from a biopsy if you have
      had one previously. A new biopsy is optional, but may provide researchers with additional
      information about how XL184 affects the tumor cells.

      Participants will receive a pain questionnaire along with information on how to fill in the
      questionnaire.

      The investigators would like to keep track of your medical condition for the rest of your
      life. The investigators would like to do this by calling you on the telephone once every 6
      months to see how you are doing. Keeping in touch with you and checking your condition every
      year helps us look at the long-term effects of the research study.
