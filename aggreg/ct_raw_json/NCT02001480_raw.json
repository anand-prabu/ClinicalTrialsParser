Preliminary data suggest\n      that beta-blocker treatment may reduce arrhythmias and mortality in this high-risk\n      population. However, no results from large-scale clinical outcome trials with beta-blockers\n      exist in this patient group and a broad, scientifically unapproved use of beta-blocker\n      treatment may not be justified due to potential harmful side-effects such as AV-block or\n      hypotension. In addition, we are lacking identified ECG surrogate parameters for SCD in this\n      high-risk population and on the occurrence of arrhythmias in temporary relationship to\n      hemodialysis sessions.\n\n      Therefore, the present study will identify surrogate parameters of SCD in hemodialysis\n      patients with T2DM and in an interventional trial investigate the suppressive effect of\n      beta-blockers on these identified ECG markers."
