Previous\n      studies have suggested that the amount of negative pressure used at the level of the chest\n      drainage device may affect the duration of air leak, but the results have been inconsistent,\n      however as revealed in more recent studies understanding of the physics of chest drainage\n      devices may have been confounded by lack of regulation of the pleural pressure.\n\n      In addition, experimental studies have shown that fluid drainage may be affected by the\n      degree of negative pleural pressure applied."
