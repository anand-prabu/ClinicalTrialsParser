  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the rates of major post-varicocelectomy
      complications (Recurrence, Hydrocele and Testicular Atrophy) in patients operated by a new
      method named Combined Mini-incision Microscopic Varicocelectomy. The study hypothesis is
      that using this method will lead to less incidental injuries to arteries and as a result to
      less testicular atrophy.In addition, using microscope would result in significantly low
      rates of all major complications of varicocelectomy.

      The sample is selected from the patients who were referred to our center for surgical
      treatment of varicocele. Most of them were diagnosed after being evaluated for infertility.

      All of them were operated by a single experienced and expert microscopic surgeon.

      Informed consent is received from all of the possible candidates in accordance to national
      and Declaration of Helsinki guidelines.

      Selection of patients for undergoing Combined varicocelectomy was done during the operation
      due to the nature of including criteria.

      In this method after making an incision at inguinal level, veins are evaluated and if the
      including criteria is existed, only external spermatic vein is ligated at the depth of the
      inguinal canal and other veins are left alone for prevention of damage to artery. Then
      another mini incision is made at high inguinal level and the rest of surgery is conducted by
      retroperitoneal approach.

      Outcome is compared to the outcome of non-microscopic methods of varicocelectomy and the
      inguinal and subinguinal microscopic varicocelectomy accompanied by testicular delivery that
      is suggested by Goldstein and associates.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Complexity and tortuosity of the veins at inguinal level so that separating and
             ligation of the vein could lead to artery injury

          -  Veins which are contiguous with arteries so that separating and ligation of the vein
             could lead to artery injury

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior surgery at inguinal level such as Herniorrhaphy, Orchiopexy,etc.
