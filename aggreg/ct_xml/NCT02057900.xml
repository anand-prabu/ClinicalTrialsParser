    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to assess the feasibility and safety of a transplantation of
      cardiac-committed progenitor cells derived from human embryonic stem cells in patients with
      severe heart failure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure due to coronary artery disease is a major problem because of its high
      prevalence, increased incidence and associated costs. When conventional
      medical/interventional treatments fail and if cardiac transplantation is contra-indicated,
      alternate options need to be considered. Transplantation of stem cells has emerged as one of
      them. While the optimal cell type still remains debatable, there is compelling evidence that
      cells whose phenotype closely matches that of the recipient tissue look sound candidates. In
      this context, human embryonic stem cells are attractive because of the possibility to drive
      their fate in vitro, prior to transplantation, towards a cardiac phenotype. We have
      developed a process for achieving such a commitment and generating cardiac-directed cells.
      The objective of this study is to assess both the feasibility and safety of this approach.
      In addition, the disadvantages of multiple intramyocardial injections have now been
      recognized. We have then taken advantage of the surgical setting of the trial (which entails
      concomitant coronary artery bypass or a mitral valve procedure) to switch from injections to
      the epicardial delivery of a fibrin gel into which the progenitor cells have been embedded.
      Coverage of this cell-loaded patch by an autologous pericardial flap is finally designed to
      provide trophic factors to the underlying cellular graft with the hope of improving its
      viability.

    <description>Feasibility will be assessed by the ability to generate hESC-derived CD15+ Isl-1+ progenitors according to preset quality measures, to incorporate these cells in a fibrin patch, to deliver this patch onto the epicardium of the infarct area and to cover it with an autologous pericardial flap. Efficacy will be assessed on the following end points : 1- left ventricular function; 2- viability of the grafted area; 3- functional status; 4- major adverse cardiovascular events.</description>
