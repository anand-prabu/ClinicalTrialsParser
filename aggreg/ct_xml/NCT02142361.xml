    <textblock>
      This is a 60-subject, single masked, bilateral, study design comparing the fitting
      characteristics of enfilcon A toric lenses against the subjects habitual hydrogel toric
      lenses. Subject's habitual toric lenses will be evaluated at the first visit and then
      re-fitted with a pair of Avaira toric lenses. After 1 week of daily wear, subjects will
      return for a second and final evaluation.
