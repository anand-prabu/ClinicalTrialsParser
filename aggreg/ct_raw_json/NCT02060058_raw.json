            "textblock": "Liver disease, especially viral hepatitis, is an important public health issue, which\n      frequent leads to liver cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and liver-related death.\n      Around 340 to 400 million persons are infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and 130 to 210\n      million persons are infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) worldwide, In Taiwan, the\n      prevalence of HBV infection is 15-20%, and the prevalence of HCV infection is 2-5% in\n      general population. Moreover, there are some HCV-hyperendemic areas in southern Taiwan with\n      anti-HCV prevalence rate of as high as 30-40%.\n\n      HBV/HCV dual infections is not uncommon in HBV epidemic areas, such as Southeastern Asia,\n      with a prevalence rate of 1.1% in southern Taiwan. Recent study showed that the risk of HCC\n      incidence is even higher among HBV/HCV co-infected persons than those with HBV or HCV\n      mono-infection, indicating the importance of disease control in this clinical setting.\n\n      The PEG-IFN/RBV has been effective in the treatment of HCV-dominant, treatment-na\u00efve\n      patients with HCV/HBV dual infections. For treatment-naive HCV genotype 1 (HCV GT1)/HBV\n      co-infected patients, 48 weeks of peginterferon (PEG-IFN) plus ribavirin (RBV) could achieve\n      an HCV sustained virological response (SVR) rate of 72%, which was comparable to 77% for\n      patients with HCV GT1 monoinfection. For treatment-naive HCV GT2 or GT3 /HBV co-infected\n      patients, 24 weeks of PEG-IFN plus RBV could achieve an HCV SVR rate of 83%, which was\n      comparable to 84% for patients with HCV GT2/3 monoinfection . Furthermore, PEG-IFN plus RBV\n      combination therapy could enhance seroclearance of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) with\n      an HBsAg loss rate of upto 11%. Nevertheless, there is about 30% of HCV GT1/HBV and 20% of\n      HCV GT2 or 3/HBV co-infected patients refractory to current PEG-IFN/RBV combination therapy,\n      which remains at high risk of HCC and liver-related death.\n\n      Boceprevir is an oral antiviral drug, which is NS3/4A protease inhibitor. Boceprevir has\n      been approved for treating HCV GT1 infection by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on 11 May\n      2011. For HCV GT1 mono-infected patients who refractory to previous PEG-IFN plus RBV\n      combination therapy, becoprevir combined with PEG-IFN/RBV triple therapy can improve the\n      treatment efficacy. The SVR rate of becoprevir-based triple therapy is about 3 times when\n      compared to patients who received PEG-IFN with RBV dual therapy [14].The investigators ,\n      therefore, hypothesize that boceprevir plus PEG-IFN/RBV is effective in treating HCV GT1/HBV\n      dually infected patients who are refractory to previous PEG-IFN/RBV combination therapy."
