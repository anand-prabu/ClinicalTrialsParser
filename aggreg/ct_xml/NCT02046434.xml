  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I clinical trial of the FDA approved drug Glycerol Phenylbutyrate to see if
      phenylbutyrate can increase the removal of alpha-synuclein from the brain into the
      bloodstream. Alpha-synuclein forms abnormal protein deposits in dopamine neurons and is
      believed to cause the death of brain cells, leading to Parkinson's Disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I clinical trial of phenylbutyrate in 20 Parkinson patients and 20 age- and
      sex-matched normal control subjects to see if phenylbutyrate can increase the removal of
      alpha-synuclein from the brain into the bloodstream. All subjects will receive 20 grams/day
      of phenylbutyrate in the liquid form phenylbutyrate-triglyceride taken as one teaspoonful
      three times per day with meals. Blood will be drawn on two days prior to starting
      phenylbutyrate to measure alpha-synuclein concentrations. Phenylbutyrate-triglyceride will
      then be started and the change in plasma alpha-synuclein will be measured on day 1, 7, 14,
      and 21 days while taking phenylbutyrate. After 21 days, the drug will be stopped and a final
      blood sample will be measured at 28 days to see if plasma alpha-synuclein has fallen to its
      pre-phenylbutyrate level. No effects on Parkinson symptoms are expected during this short
      trial. Please note that although taking any type of Parkinson's drugs for symptomatic
      treatment disqualifies you, if you and your neurologist are willing and able to have you off
      Parkinson medication for six weeks before and during the trial, you may be eligible to
      participate.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease and mild symptoms and not requiring
             symptomatic treatment with L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) or other
             anti-Parkinson drugs. Prior to entering the study, subjects may be on treatment with
             dopamine agonists provided that the treating neurologist agrees that the drugs can be
             stopped for at least three weeks prior to participating in the phenylbutyrate study
             and for the 4-week duration of the study.

          -  Age- and sex-matched normal control subjects will be recruited from spouses and the
             general population.

          -  All subjects will be in good general health.

          -  Candidates with hypertension or hypercholesterolemia controlled with medication are
             eligible.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Because of possible drug interactions and the unknown teratogenic risk of
             phenylbutyrate, exclusion criteria for both patients and controls include:

          -  Pregnant women

          -  Current treatment with L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA), monoamine oxidase (MAO)
              inhibitors, catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT) inhibitors, histone deacetylase
             (HDAC) inhibitors, prednisone or other corticosteroids

          -  Probenecid

          -  Severe cardiopulmonary disease such as congestive heart failure or emphysema
             requiring supplemental oxygen.

          -  Renal disease with serum creatinine greater than 2.5, history of depression in the
             prior year, epilepsy, stroke, prior brain surgery, dementia, or psychosis will also
             exclude candidates.
