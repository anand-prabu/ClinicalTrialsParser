These\n      abnormal movements may result from a variety of flexibilty, motion or strength impairments.\n      Therefore identifying any abnormal arm or scapular movement, as well as any impairments that\n      are associated with them can help clinicians plan a proper management strategy for patients\n      presenting with shoulder disorders. Our hypothesis is that specific impairments will be\n      associated with abnormal arm movement, while other impairments will be associated with\n      abnormal scapular movement among patients with shoulder pain."
