            "textblock": "This research study is evaluating a drug called cabozantinib as a possible treatment cancer\n      of the bile duct.  Cabozantinib is a drug that targets specific pathways inside the cells of\n      the body. By blocking the c-MET and VEGFR2 pathways from sending signals, cabozantinib may\n      prevent cells from multiplying. This drug has been used in other research studies and\n      information from those other research studies suggests that this drug may help to stop the\n      growth of bile duct cancer.\n\n      In this research study, the investigators are looking to see how well cabozantinib works in\n      slowing the growth of bile duct cancer. The investigators are also assessing the safety and\n      tolerability of cabozantinib in participants with this type of cancer."

Note: if initial QTcF is found to be >\n             500 ms, two additional EKGs separated by at least 3 minutes should be performed.

Low dose aspirin (\u2264 81 mg/day),\n             low-dose warfarin (\u2264 1 mg/day), and prophylactic Low Molecular Weight Heparin (LMWH)\n             are permitted.\n\n          -  The subject requires concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inducers (eg, dexamethasone,\n             phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentin, phenobarbital, and St.\n             John's Wort) or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (eg, ketoconazole, itraconazole,\n             clarithromycin, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, and ritonavir).\n\n          -  The subject has received prior treatment with a small molecule kinase inhibitor or a\n             hormonal therapy (including investigational kinase inhibitors or hormones) within 14\n             days or five half-lives of the compound or active metabolites, whichever is longer,\n             before the first dose of study treatment. Note: Subjects with prostate cancer\n             currently receiving LHRH or GnRH agonists may be maintained on these agents.\n\n          -  The subject is unable to swallow tablets\n\n          -  Individuals who are known to be HIV-positive are excluded from this study.  HIV\n             positive individuals are at increased risk of lethal infection when treated with\n             marrow-suppressive agents, and cabozantinib has not adequately been tested in this\n             population.  Also, antiretroviral therapy may have pharmacokinetic interactions with\n             cabozantinib that have not been fully characterized yet.\n\n          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study due to the potential for teratogenic or\n             abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk of adverse\n             events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with cabozatinib,\n             breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with cabozantnib. These\n             potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study.\n\n          -  Subjects may not be receiving any other study agents concurrently while on this study"
