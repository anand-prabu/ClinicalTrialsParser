The tumor cells and related proteins in patients with colorectal\n      cancer with liver metastases will be compared to blood taken from patients with benign\n      pancreas lesions.\n\n      Inclusion of patients with benign pathology will allow for the establishment of \"normal\"\n      values which currently do not exist"

Specific drugs are listed below.\n\n          -  5-FU based chemotherapy - 2 weeks off\n\n          -  Bevacizumab - 6 weeks off\n\n          -  Cetuximab or panitumumab - 2 weeks off\n\n          -  Control patients will include patients consented for pancreaticoduodenectomy for\n             benign or pre-neoplastic lesions. If lesions assumed to be benign turn out to be\n             malignant on final pathology, the blood will be discarded and the patient replaced.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  Evidence of extra-hepatic disease on pre-operative imaging or at operative\n             exploration, excluding the primary colorectal tumor\n\n          -  Those with known bleeding or clotting diatheses\n\n          -  Patients diagnosed with chronic inflammatory diseases such as lupus, rheumatoid\n             arthritis, psoriasis, ulcerative colitis, Crohns disease, etc.\n\n          -  Pre- or intra-operative evidence of portal vein thrombosis or hypertension\n\n          -  Patients who have taken immune modulating agents in the past 8 weeks including\n             steroids, anti-TNF-\u03b1, interferon etc. Patients taking a single dose of Decadron as\n             part of a chemotherapy regimen will not be excluded from the study.\n\n          -  Patients who take daily anti-inflammatory medications such as COX-2 inhibitors or\n             high dose NSAIDs. Patients taking a daily aspirin or acetaminophen or occasional\n             anti-inflammatory medications will not be excluded from the study.\n\n          -  If at the discretion of the operating surgeon, blood acquisition would lead to undue\n             morbidity, the patient will be excluded and replaced\n\n          -  Attending physicians authorized to obtain informed consent may exercise discretion in\n             excluding individuals for appropriate medical or other reasons."
