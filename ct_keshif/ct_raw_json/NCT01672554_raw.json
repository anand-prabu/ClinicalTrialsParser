Preliminary data on pharmacological properties of Quetiapine and\n      its metabolites and intuitive impression from our clinical experience lead to believe that\n      Seroquel XR use in monotherapy may offer advantages over other antipsychotics in treating\n      co-morbid anxiety disorder in patients suffering from schizophrenia. This open label switch\n      study conducted in a schizophrenic population intends to verify this hypothesis."
