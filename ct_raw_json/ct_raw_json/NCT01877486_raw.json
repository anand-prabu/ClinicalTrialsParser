            "textblock": "Pulmonary vein isolation is now considered a cornerstone of all atrial fibrillation (AF)\n      ablation procedures. In patients with paroxysmal AF, pulmonary vein isolation alone is\n      usually sufficient. The cryoballoon is now FDA approved to achieve PVI in patients with\n      paroxysmal AF.\n\n      Although no ablation system is yet approved in patients with persistent AF, these patients\n      are increasingly undergoing ablation. Many investigators feel that these patients have more\n      atrial disease and thus PVI alone is insufficient in these patients. As a result, it is\n      common for these patients to undergo additional ablation, which is often quite extensive and\n      exposes patients to proarrhythmia. Commonly utilized strategies include linear lesions (left\n      atrial roof; mitral isthmus line), ablation of complex fractionated atrial electrograms\n      (CFAEs), left atrial appendage isolation and/or even right atrial ablation. For years, the\n      investigators have been concerned about the adverse effects of this additional ablation. The\n      investigators postulated that the \"answer\" is not more ablation but trying to \"reverse\n      remodel\" patients with persistent AF back to a paroxysmal form, whereby PVI alone would\n      again be justified and sufficient. The efficacy of such a strategy has previously been\n      demonstrated.\n\n      In brief, the investigators start patients with persistent AF on dofetilide 3 months prior\n      to scheduled ablation. In 96% of patients, AF either suppresses completely or is transformed\n      into a paroxysmal pattern. The net effect is \"reverse remodeling\" of the left atria. The\n      investigators have confirmed this by using a reduction in P wave duration as a surrogate of\n      remodeling. At the ablation procedure, the investigators perform PVI alone."
