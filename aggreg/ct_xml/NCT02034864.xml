  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a standardised osteopathic manipulative
      treatment is more effective on 3 months functional recovery than a placebo of osteopathic
      manipulative treatment, in sub-acute and chronic low back pain less than 1 year duration.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sub-acute (4-12 weeks duration) and chronic (more than 3 months duration) low back pain
      (LBP) is frequent, disabling and costly. The effectiveness of usual treatments (including
      pain killers, anti-inflammatory drugs, spinal infiltrations, physiotherapy, spinal traction,
      transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, etc) may be not sufficient, and many patients
      resort to alternative therapies. Manipulative treatments represent en emerging therapy in
      this area, although studies assessing their effectiveness are limited and often biased. The
      purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of two manual therapies administered by
      osteopaths on improving functional recovery in sub-acute and chronic low back pain less than
      1 year. A standardised osteopathic manipulative treatment is compare to a placebo of
      osteopathic manipulative treatment.
