This\n      present study follows the children until 3 years of age. We have the hypothesis, that the\n      intervention during pregnancy results in a lower degree of adiposity and metabolic risk\n      factors in the offspring. Clinical examination is taking place at age 2.5-3 years including\n      anthropometric measurements, Dual energy x-ray (DXA) scans and blood samples measuring\n      metabolic markers."
