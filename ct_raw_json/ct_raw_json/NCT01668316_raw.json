Weight loss programs have been\n      shown to be effective in reducing postpartum weight retention. However, high attrition rates\n      in these studies suggest that the added responsibility of a new infant at home and returning\n      to work may limit a woman's ability to follow a diet plan and exercise regularly. We hope\n      that by offering a weight loss program at the workplace, we can increase participant\n      retention and maximize weight loss in this population. Our primary aim is to promote weight\n      loss while preserving lean body mass during the 12 week intervention. Secondary aims include\n      increasing cardiovascular fitness from baseline and improving cardiovascular biomarkers,\n      including total, LDL, and HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose, insulin, and markers of\n      inflammation and metabolism."
