  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Encouraging greater levels of physical activity is critical to improving health among
      Americans, who are largely sedentary. Neighborhood parks are resources for physical activity
      that are available to most Americans within a couple miles of their homes, yet many
      residents are unaware of the programs and facilities available.  Previous research indicates
      that park use is related to park programming and outreach.  Because funding for parks is
      limited, low-cost interventions are needed to attract more people to parks to engage in
      moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. While many community-based organizations would like
      to invest in efforts that increase physical activity, few low-cost park programs are
      documented to be both scalable and cost-effective. Effective programs that can be replicated
      to make population-level impacts are needed. The goal of this study is to develop and test
      an enhanced marketing approach to attract people to parks and 2 low-cost community-level
      approaches to promoting physical activity, singly and in combination, in 48 park settings in
      Los Angeles. Using a full factorial design we will compare the efficacy of: (a) organized
      programs promoting walking and fitness activities and (b) an incentive approach adopting the
      &quot;frequent user&quot; strategy now popular in commercial settings. We will test these approaches
      with and without an enhanced marketing/outreach component using special events to attract
      people to the park so they are aware of the programs and facilities there. We will also
      quantify the cost effectiveness of each intervention; identify which age, gender and
      racial/ethnic groups benefit the most from these interventions; and develop and disseminate
      materials describing procedures and lessons learned so they can be applied by parks
      throughout the country.
