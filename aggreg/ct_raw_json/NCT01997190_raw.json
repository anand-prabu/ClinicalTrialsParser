The first two dose levels will receive one\n      injection of AdV-tk through a pleural catheter on day 0. Dose level 3 will receive 2\n      injections of AdV-tk. Timing for the second administration for dose level 3 will be decided\n      based on the data obtained from dose level 1 and 2. The prodrug, valacyclovir, will be\n      administered orally at a fixed dose for 14 days after each AdV-tk injection. At Level 3,\n      valacyclovir will be administered after the first AdV-tk administration until 14 days after\n      the second administration of AdV-tk.\n\n      Chemotherapy may begin at any time after completion of valacyclovir. Choice of chemotherapy\n      depends on the treating oncologist."
