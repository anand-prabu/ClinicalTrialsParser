  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the screening of nasopharyngeal carcinoma using
      plasma Epstein-Barr virus DNA analysis would result in the down-staging of the NPC cases in
      asymptomatic individuals.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection is an important etiological factor for nasopharyngeal
      carcinoma (NPC). In a pilot study, we have shown that the analysis of Epstein-Barr virus
      (EBV) DNA in blood can detect early and asymptomatic NPC. However, it is unlcear if NPC
      screening can improve the prognosis of the screened NPC subjects.

      20,000 male subjects aged from 40 to 60 will be recruited because the incidence of NPC is
      higher in this target group. Twenty millilitres of venous blood will be collected from each
      subject at enrolment for plasma EBV DNA analysis.

      Subjects who have initial positive results for plasma EBV DNA will have another testing
      within 4 weeks. Subjects who have persistently positive results for the two plasma EBV DNA
      analyses will be investigated using nasal endoscopic examination. A third blood samples will
      be collected on the day of endoscopy. For those subjects who have persistently positive
      plasma EBV DNA results on the three occasions but negative endoscopy results will be further
      investigated by MRI.

      After the initial screening, all participants will be phone interviewed yearly to update
      their cancer status.

    <description>All the participants will be subjected to the screening of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) at the time of recruitment using plasma EBV DNA analysis. Subjects with positive results will be investigated using endoscopic examination (or MRI). If the subject is confirmed of having NPC, the stage of the disease would be recorded.</description>
