  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of this study is that participation in a formal cardiopulmonary
      rehabilitation program improves aerobic exercise capacity and quality of life over the
      medium term for patients with congenital heart disease with reduced exercise capacity.  To
      test this hypothesis, subjects will be randomized to either receive a 12-week
      cardiopulmonary rehabilitation program or standard of care, with interval testing of aerobic
      capacity and other physiologic markers improved fitness, as well as assessment of quality of
      life.

    <description>The subjects will attend 2 sessions each week for 12 weeks.  Each session will be approximately 2 hours in duration, consisting of both exercise (aerobic and strength,~60 minutes) and education. In addition, subjects will be directed to participate in 3 weekly ~40 minute home exercise training sessions, personalized to their level of aerobic conditioning.</description>
