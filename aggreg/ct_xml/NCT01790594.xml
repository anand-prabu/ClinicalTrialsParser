  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transplant recipients have to take anti-rejection medications to prevent their immune
      systems (the body's natural defense system against illness) from rejecting their new organs.
      Most patients who receive a transplanted organ must take these anti-rejection medications
      for the rest of their lives, or for as long as the transplanted organ continues to work.
      Taking standard anti-rejection medications for a long time can cause serious side effects,
      including pancreas and kidney damage. There would be a benefit to finding new anti-rejection
      medications that work just as well, but could lesson the amount of antirejection medications
      you are taking long term.

      The purpose of this study is to find out if the drug NULOJIX® (belatacept) will minimize the
      amount of other antirejection medications necessary and thereby reduce the long-term side
      effects caused by the other medications. The researchers also want to learn more about the
      safety of this treatment and long term health of transplanted pancreases and kidneys.

             c-peptide &lt;0.3 ng/mL.

          -  No known contraindications to study therapy using NULOJIX® (belatacept);

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test upon
             study entry;

          -  Female and male participants with reproductive potential must agree to use FDA
             approved methods of birth control during participation in the study and for 4 months

             documentation is not present at the time of transplantation, and the subject does not
             have any risk factors for TB, a TB-specific interferon gamma release assay (IGRA) may

          -  Need for multi-organ transplantation other than a kidney and pancreas

          -  Recipient of previous organ transplant;

          -  EBV sero-negative recipients or recipients whose EBV serostatus is unknown prior to
             the time of transplantation

          -  Individuals who have required treatment with systemic prednisone or other
             immunosuppressive drugs within 1 year prior to transplant;

          -  Individuals previously treated with NULOJIX® (belatacept);

          -  Any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would interfere with the
             participant's ability to comply with study requirements;

          -  Use of investigational drugs within 4 weeks of enrollment;

          -  Known hypersensitivity to mycophenolate mofetil (MMF)or any of the drug's components;
