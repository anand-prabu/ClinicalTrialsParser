The study objective is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of NexoBrid in removing\n      burn eschar earlier and reducing surgical needs in hospitalized subjects with large burns (\n      4-15% of Total Body Surface Area).\n\n      physicians will define one or more Target Wounds (TWs) per subject according to TWs\n      definition. All subjects' deep  (DPT and FT) burns that comply with the specified entrance\n      criteria are intended to receive study treatment per the randomized study arm.\n\n      The randomization procedure will be initiated only after all Target wounds of a subject have\n      been defined.  Patients  will be assigned to the treatment arm in a 3:3:1 ratio (NexoBrid:\n      SOC (Collagenase): Gel Vehicle).\n\n      Prior to eschar removal treatment with NexoBrid, Collagenase (SOC) or Gel Vehicle, patients\n      will be medicated with appropriate analgesia and undergo wound cleansing and dressing of all\n      wounds with antibacterial solutions. Following wound cleansing and antibacterial treatments,\n      subjects will undergo the eschar removal process as per treatment assignment. Eschar Removal\n      with NexoBrid, Gel Vehicle and Collagenase will be performed will be performed by two\n      different health care professionals. First, a health care professional will prepare and\n      apply the topical treatment. Wound assessment will be performed by a different health care\n      professional, masked to the application process and the applied product, after the topical\n      agent has been removed and the wound has been soaked for 2 hours (eliminating all traces of\n      the debriding agent). If medically judged, the same product may be applied for a second time\n      to the same burn area however, not more than twice to the same burn wound area. Additional\n      surgical and/or non surgical procedures, pre defined in the protocol, might be performed, if\n      medically warranted.\n\n      Subsequent to eschar removal, all wounds will be assessed and treated in the same manner, in\n      accordance with post-eschar removal wound care strategy. Further, patients will undergo\n      daily assessments of VS and pain assessments until HD and weekly assessments thereafter,\n      until wounds closure. Following wounds closure, patients will be followed up on a monthly\n      basis for 3 months and after that, at 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 months post complete wound closure\n      for long term outcomes evaluation (including cosmesis, function and QoL evaluation)."
