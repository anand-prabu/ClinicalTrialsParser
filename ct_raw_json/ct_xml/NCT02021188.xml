      This VISION study aims to investigate the role of inflammation in atherosclerosis using
      68Ga- DOTANOC PET, and to validate 68Ga-DOTANOC PET imaging for the detection and
      quantification of vascular inflammation in the aorta, coronary and carotid arteries. This
      study will test the hypothesis that in subjects undergoing carotid endarterectomy for
      symptomatic plaques, there will be a positive correlation between carotid artery
      68Ga-DOTANOC PET signal and the underlying degree of carotid inflammation measured by
      immunohistochemical analysis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Clinical events in atherosclerosis are largely driven by inflammation. Molecular imaging of
      atherosclerosis can potentially identify high-risk lesions, help guide treatment and
      illuminate the underlying biology of the disease. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) PET is
      the gold-standard nuclear molecular imaging technique with well-established roles in
      atherosclerosis imaging. However, the arterial 18F-FDG signal is non-specific, although it
      is related to increased macrophage activity with contributions from hypoxia and
      angiogenesis. Coronary artery imaging with 18F-FDG is particularly difficult, mainly due to
      high background myocardial cell 18F-FDG uptake, which obscures interpretation of the
      coronary signal. Efforts to suppress myocardial 18F-FDG uptake with dietary manipulation are
      challenging for patients and have limited efficacy.

      PET tracers currently used in cancer imaging, such as 68Ga-DOTANOC, are more specific for
      inflammation and also lack myocardial muscle uptake. 68Ga-DOTANOC might therefore be better
      suited than 18F-FDG for imaging inflammation, particularly within the coronary arteries. The
      VISION study is a prospective, observational study designed to investigate the biology of
      plaque inflammation in atherosclerosis, using PET imaging with the somatostatin receptor
      ligand 68Ga-DOTANOC. 50 subjects with atherosclerosis will undergo sequential PET/CT imaging
      with 68Ga-DOTANOC and 18F-FDG, along with contrast angiography of the carotid and coronary
      arteries. Autoradiography and immunohistochemistry of excised carotid plaques will be used
      to validate the imaging data. If successful, 68Ga-DOTANOC imaging will offer a cheaper, more
      specific non-invasive measure of inflammation than 18F- FDG, particularly in the coronary
      arteries. This opens up the possibility of better risk stratification for patients with
      atherosclerosis and could provide a non-invasive platform to test the effects of novel
      anti-atherosclerosis drugs.

        The study will recruit participants with recent transient ischaemic attack or stroke due
        to carotid artery disease, from which they have made a good functional recovery. A
        proportion of these patients will undergo carotid endarterectmy as part of clinical
        management. We will also recruit participants with asymptomatic carotid atheroma, and
        those with stable coronary artery disease or recent acute coronary syndrome.
