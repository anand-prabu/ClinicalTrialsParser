            "textblock": "Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist are new treatment of type 2 diabetes, they\n      lower blood glucose level (by enhancement of glucose-dependent insulin secretion and\n      suppression of excess glucagon secretion) and reduce weight by inducing satiety and slowing\n      of gastric emptying. Beneficial effects of GLP-1 and GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists on\n      cardiovascular function have been suggested. They improve biomarkers of CV risk, decrease\n      systolic blood pressure, improve endothelial function and have beneficial effects on\n      myocardium. Nevertheless, few studies have analysed the effect of GLP1 treatment on\n      myocardial function in type 2 obese diabetic.\n\n      Myocardial steatosis is an independent predictor of diastolic dysfunction in type 2 diabetes\n      mellitus. It was recently shown that 16 weeks of caloric restriction in obese patients with\n      diabetes decrease myocardial triglyceride content and improve myocardial function (cardiac\n      output, normalized stroke volume, LV mass and normalized end diastolic volume), and\n      diastolic function. However, no study has evaluated the impact of Glucagon-like peptide-1\n      (GLP-1) receptor agonist in obese diabetics on myocardial TG content.\n\n      Recent studies have suggested that increased epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) could be an\n      important risk factor for cardiac diseases. We and others have already evidenced a\n      correlation between the volume of epicardial adipose tissue and the presence or the severity\n      of coronaropathy. The impact of weight loss on the volume of EAT or the characteristics of\n      EAT is mostly unknown."
