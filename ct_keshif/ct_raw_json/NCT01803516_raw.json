This is a laser that targets\n      red blood vessels and delivers heat causing the telangiectasias to become smaller and less\n      visible. The laser has been used safely to treat telangiectasias on the skin of patients who\n      received radiation for breast cancer.\n\n      Patients in the study will be asked to complete a questionnaire asking how they feel about\n      the telangiectasias, their radiated skin and its effect on their daily lives. The\n      questionnaire will be given before the first laser treatment and after the final treatment.\n      The improvement in the look of patients' radiated skin will also be compared to answers to\n      the questionnaire. We hope the study will improve our understanding of how patients feel\n      about the long term effects of radiation on their skin."
