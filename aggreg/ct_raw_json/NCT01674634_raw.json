A finger extension procedure to facilitate cord disruption will be performed (after\n      administration of local anesthesia, if needed) 24 to 72 hours after injection in those\n      subjects who do not have spontaneous disruption of their cord(s).\n\n      Follow up visits for the evaluation of safety and efficacy will be required for all subjects\n      24 to 72 hours after injection, and on Days 15, 31, and 61.\n\n      Upon completion of the day 60 follow-up visit (end of study visit), subjects who require\n      additional treatment in the treated hand may receive up to three additional injections of\n      AA4500 according to the XIAFLEX package insert.  Subjects may receive up to a total of five\n      injections and individual cords may receive up to a total of three injections.  Subjects who\n      require additional treatment will be followed for safety."

Received surgery (fasciectomy or surgical fasciotomy) and/or needle\n             aponeurotomy/fasciotomy on the selected joints to be treated within 6 months before\n             administration of study drug\n\n          2.

Has a known systemic allergy to collagenase or any other excipient of AA4500\n\n          4. Has received any collagenase treatments (eg, Santyl\u00ae ointment and/or\n             XIAFLEX\u00ae/XIAPEX\u00ae) within 30 days before injection of study drug in the hand selected\n             for treatment\n\n          5.

Has a known recent history of stroke, bleeding, or other medical condition, which in\n             the investigator's opinion would make the subject unsuitable for enrollment in the\n             study\n\n          7.
