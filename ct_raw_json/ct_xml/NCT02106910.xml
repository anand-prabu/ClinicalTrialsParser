  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects presenting to UNC Hospitals for routine endoscopic surveillance examinations after
      successful radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of dysplastic Barrett's Esophagus (BE) will be
      offered enrollment in the study. After informed consent, and the same day as the endoscopic
      procedure, the subject will undergo administration of the Cytosponge assay. The patient will
      then undergo routine endoscopic surveillance, using a standard Seattle biopsy surveillance
      protocol. The Cytosponge will be placed in fixative and shipped to the Fitzgerald laboratory
      at the University of Cambridge for processing according to their established protocols.
      Tissue biopsies will undergo standard processing and H&amp;E staining, with assessment by expert
      gastrointestinal pathologists at UNC. The primary outcome variables will be sensitivity and
      specificity of the novel assay, compared against the gold standard of the presence of
      recurrent BE as detected by upper endoscopy with biopsies. Secondary outcomes include
      acceptability of the nonendoscopic assay to the patient (assessed by a standardized tool,
      the Impact of Events Scale, as well as a visual analogue scale), and likelihood of assay
      positivity as a function of amount of residual disease (as measured by Prague criteria).

    <textblock>
      Esophageal Adenocarcinoma is a Lethal Cancer with a Rapidly Increasing Incidence. Barrett's
      Esophagus (BE) is the Strongest Risk Factor for Esophageal Adenocarcinoma. Endoscopic
      Ablation Induces Reversion of Barrett's Esophagus, and Decreases Progression of Disease.
      Unfortunately, data demonstrate a risk of recurrence of BE following successful eradication.
      Recent data published by the candidate and colleagues from the Ablation of Intestinal
      Metaplasia Containing Dysplasia (AIM Dysplasia) study demonstrate that approximately 25% of
      subjects who experience successful eradication of dysplastic BE will develop recurrent BE.

      Therefore, following successful endoscopic ablation, patients receive ongoing endoscopic
      surveillance. More recently, a simple, non-endoscopic device, termed the Cytosponge, has
      been developed for endoscopic screening of subjects at risk for BE. Cytosponge demonstrated
      a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 94% for the detection of BE.

      We expect these investigations to lead to a less costly, highly accurate, less invasive and
      more preferred screening paradigm for the large number of subjects who have undergone
      endoscopic ablative therapy.

      The Cytosponge is a simple, non-endoscopic device developed for endoscopic screening of
      subjects at risk for Barrett's esophagus (BE) by investigators at the University of
      Cambridge in the U.K. The Cytosponge is an ingestible gelatin capsule enclosing a compressed
      spherical polyurethane mesh sponge of 3 cm diameter, the center of which is attached to a
      string (Astralen, braided synthetic non-absorbable suture) (Figure 1). The capsule and
      string are swallowed with water. The string is held at the mouth without tension by means of
      a 7 cm cardboard tab attached to the string, and esophageal peristalsis and gravity move the
      capsule into the stomach. After 5 minutes (during which the gelatin capsule dissolves and
      the sponge is liberated), the sponge is withdrawn by gentle traction on the string and as it
      does so, collects cells from the lining of the esophagus. The sponge is placed in fixative
      for 48 hours, then the cells are pelleted, and processed into paraffin blocks. The pellets
      are immunostained with trefoil factor 3, which is interpreted simply as either positive or
      negative by the presence of any staining.

    <description>Acceptability will be measured the Impact of Events Scale. This widely used scale was developed to assess the distress associated with a specific life event. It includes measures of both the intrusiveness of the event, and any avoidance responses by the subject in response to the event. The scale will be administrated both shortly after, and 7 days after, the sampling. In order to allow the subjects to have time to reflect on the experience and to compare with the EGD, the 7 day measurements will represent the primary acceptability outcome of the study. Secondary acceptability outcomes will include a visual analogue scale of acceptability of the Cytosponge, performed after the Cytosponge is administered. Also, the subject will be asked whether he/she would be willing to repeat the assay, and, assuming similar accuracy between Cytosponge and upper endoscopy, whether he/she would rather undergo surveillance by Cytosponge or standard esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with biopsies.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female subjects, age 18-80 years,

          -  Previous diagnosis of BE with dysplastic LGD or HGD, as evidenced by both classical
             endoscopic appearance of salmon-colored mucosa in the tubular esophagus, as well as
             endoscopic biopsies from the involved areas demonstrating columnar metaplasia with
             goblet cells. The diagnosis of dysplasia must have been confirmed by a second expert
             pathologist. Previous endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) of focal nodular HGD or
             superficial intramucosal cancer (IMC) is allowable, as long as the EMR specimen shows
             complete resection of any IMC with clear margins, and biopsies following ablation
             confirm excision of the lesion,

          -  A history of complete eradication of both dysplasia and intestinal metaplasia by
             radiofrequency ablation. Complete eradication is defined as a normal endoscopic
             appearance of the tubular esophagus, and histologic confirmation by biopsies in 4
             quadrants every cm from throughout the length of the previous BE,

          -  Ability to discontinue aspirin, clopidogrel, and/or warfarin for 5 days prior and 7
             days after procedures,

          -  Good general health, with no severely debilitating diseases, active malignancy, or
             condition that would interfere with study participation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of esophageal stricture precluding passage of the endoscope or sponge,

          -  Pregnancy, or planned pregnancy during the course of the study,

          -  Any history of esophageal varices, liver impairment of moderate or worse severity
             (Child's- Pugh class B &amp; C) or evidence of varices noted on any past endoscopy,

          -  Any history of esophageal surgery, except for uncomplicated fundoplication, and,

          -  History of coagulopathy, with INR&gt;1.3 and/or platelet count of &lt;75,000.
