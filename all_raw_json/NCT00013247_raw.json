Intervention materials\n      were mailed two weeks prior to a target primary care appointment and patient telephone\n      surveys were conducted one week (T1) and one year (T2) after the target appointment.\n      Outcomes included:  a 10- item validated knowledge index; responses to questions on CaP\n      natural history, treatment efficacy, PSA accuracy, and expert disagreement about the PSA;\n      whether screening was discussed with provider; scores on decision information seeking,\n      participation and satisfaction scales; screening and treatment preferences; and PSA testing\n      rates.\n\n      Status:\n\n      Complete"
