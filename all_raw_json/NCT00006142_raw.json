            "textblock": "PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.\n\n      Patients receive a phenylalanine restricted diet based on a medical food such as\n      Phenyl-free, Lofenalac, PKU 3, or Maximum XP (may be supplemented with tyrosine as needed)\n      to achieve a target blood phenylalanine level of 2-6 mg/dL.  The diet begins approximately 3\n      months prior to conception and continues until delivery of the baby.  Patients are evaluated\n      once a month before conception and weekly during pregnancy.  Patients also undergo\n      sonographic examination at 8, 20, 28, and 34 weeks gestation.  At birth, the cord blood is\n      evaluated for plasma amino acids.  If the baby is found to have an elevated phenylalanine\n      level, blood and urine are obtained to determine the baby's genetic status.  Phenylalanine\n      and tyrosine levels are checked in the baby daily for three days after birth.\n\n      The baby is followed for physical and mental development at 3 and 6 months and then annually\n      thereafter."
