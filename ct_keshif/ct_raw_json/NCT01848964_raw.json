All the patients and volunteers will be concerned by this first part.\nA second part will be conducted in 15 amputees within the 40 patients. Assessments of pressure pattern during gait and standing will be repeated two times: by the same investigator and by a different investigator, in order to test intra- and inter-evaluator reproducibility.\nAfter the first assessment, the prosthesis may be modified in order to solve clinical problems. In that case, a new assessment will be proposed 2 to 8 weeks after in order to test the effect of the prosthesis modification on pressure pattern, gait, posture and clinical parameters."
