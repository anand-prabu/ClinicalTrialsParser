A convenience\n      sample of 100 of these patients with ischemic stroke will be included in BAPTISe and will\n      receive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans and blood tests before and after the\n      PHYS-STROKE intervention. Imaging scans will address parameters of cerebral perfusion and\n      vessel size imaging. Blood tests will determine several parameters such as immunity,\n      inflammation, and endothelial function. Additionally, we will assess the association between\n      functional outcomes (co-primary outcome measures of PHYS-STROKE) and biomarkers including\n      imaging results."
