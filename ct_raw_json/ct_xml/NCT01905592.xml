  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare progression-free survival (PFS)in patients with
      advanced/metastatic breast cancer who have a BRCA gene change when treated with niraparib as
      compared to those treated with physician's choice
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase III, randomized, open label, multicenter, controlled trial of niraparib
      versus physician's choice in previously-treated, HER2 negative, germline BRCA
      mutation-positive breast cancer patients. Niraparib is an orally active parp inhibitor.
      Niraparib (in a 2:1 ratio) will be administered once daily continuously during a 21-day
      cycle.  Physician's choice will be administered on a 21-day cycle. Health-related quality of
      life will be measured.  The Safety and tolerability will be assessed by clinical review of
      adverse events (AEs), physical examinations, electrocardiograms (ECGs), and safety
      laboratory values.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation; patients with unknown BRCA status who meet NCCN
             BRCA screening criteria will be screened for BRCA mutation.

          2. Metastatic or locally advanced disease that is not amenable to resection or radiation
             with curative intent.

          3. Up to 2 prior cytotoxic regimens for advanced or metastatic breast cancer  patients
             with no prior cytotoxic regimens for advanced or metastatic disease will only be
             allowed if they relapsed during or within 12 months of (neo-) adjuvant cytotoxic
             therapy that included a taxane and anthracycline, if not contraindicated.

          4. Prior therapy should have included an anthracycline and a taxane (or contraindication
             to those) in the neoadjuvant, adjuvant, or advanced/metastatic setting.

             a. Hormone receptor positive patients must also have hormone resistant disease
             (progression during at least one prior hormonal therapy) for which chemotherapy is
             indicated.

          5. ECOG performance status 0-2

          6. Adequate bone marrow, kidney and liver function

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with platinum resistant cancer

          2. Symptomatic uncontrolled brain metastasis

          3. Prior diagnosis of Stage IV ovarian cancer; Stage III ovarian cancer must have a
             5-year disease-free interval and normal CA125; Stage II ovarian cancer must have a
             2-year disease-free interval and normal CA125

          4. Known hypersensitivity to the components of niraparib

          5. Invasive cancer other than ovarian cancer within 2 years (except basal or squamous
             cell carcinoma of the skin that has been definitely treated)

          6. Symptomatic uncontrolled brain metastasis

          7. Pregnant or breast feeding patients

          8. Immunocompromised patients

          9. Known active Hepatitis B or C

         10. Prior treatment with a PARP inhibitor
