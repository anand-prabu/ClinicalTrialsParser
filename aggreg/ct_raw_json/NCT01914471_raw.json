School\n      records were obtained for number of fruits and vegetables served, students served lunch, and\n      snacks sold per attending student.  Pre- and post-intervention surveys assessed psychosocial\n      variables among 2,997 seventh-graders (75% of all seventh-graders across schools).\n\n      Hypotheses: For the RCT of SNaX, we hypothesized that SNaX would lead to increases in the\n      proportion of students served in the cafeteria (because SNaX markets cafeterias' healthy\n      foods); increased fruit and vegetable servings (because SNaX increases access to\n      sliced/bite-sized fruits and vegetables); decreased school store snack sales; and greater\n      water consumption.  We also hypothesized that SNaX would lead to more positive attitudes\n      about the cafeteria and water, improve obesity-prevention knowledge, and increase intentions\n      to drink water."
