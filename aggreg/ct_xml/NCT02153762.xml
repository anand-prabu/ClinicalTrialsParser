  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability, as well as
      effectiveness, with regards to the order of application for Locoid Lipocream and Hylatopic
      Plus cream in patients with atopic dermatitis (AD), which is a type of skin rash.Topical
      skin barrier repair therapies (BRT) that are plain moisturizing creams/lotions with added
      lipids (fats/oils), such as Hylatopic Plus cream, have emerged as an effective addition to
      the the treatment of atopic dermatitis. BRTs are often used along with topical steroids
      (medicated creams), such as Locoid lotion, on skin with AD, and as a monotherapy (single
      treatment) on both non-diseased and diseased skin.  Since BRTs help to restore components of
      skin that are absent in skin with AD, it is believed that long-term BRT use may reduce
      further development of further AD. This is an open-label, single site study.
