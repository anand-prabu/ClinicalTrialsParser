Carfilzomib\n      may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.\n      Monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab, can block cancer growth in different ways. Some\n      block the ability of cancer to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and help kill them\n      or carry cancer-killing substances to them. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as ifosfamide,\n      carboplatin, and etoposide, also work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells,\n      either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving carfilzomib with\n      rituximab, ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide may be an effective treatment for diffuse\n      large B-cell lymphoma."

(Phase I) II. To assess the toxicity of dose regimen using the Cancer Therapy\n      Evaluation Program (CTEP) National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for\n      Adverse Events (CTCAE version 4.0). (Phase I) III. To evaluate the safety of carfilzomib\n      (given at maximum tolerated dose [MTD] as determined in Phase I of this study) in\n      combination with R-ICE salvage therapy in relapsed/refractory DLBCL patients. (Phase II) IV.\n      To achieve an overall response rate (complete response [CR] and partial response [PR]) of\n      70% after 3 cycles of C-R-ICE in patients between the ages of 18 to 75 with\n      relapsed/refractory cluster of differentiation (CD)20-positive DLBCL previously treated with\n      rituximab-based immunochemotherapy (e.g., rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin,\n      vincristine [vincristine sulfate], and prednisone [R-CHOP], rituximab, etoposide,\n      prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin [REPOCH], rituximab,\n      cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, dexamethasone, methotrexate, and cytarabine\n      [R-HyperCVAD], etc.) induction. (Phase II)\n\n      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. To determine the feasibility of successful mobilization of autologous stem cells (i.e.,\n      minimum of 2 x 10^6 CD34+ cells/kg should be collected) to be used for autologous stem cell\n      transplant (ASCT).\n\n      II. To determine toxicities associated with C-R-ICE salvage therapy. III. To determine the\n      time to progression (TTP), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS)\n      followed by ASCT; disease-free survival in CR patients.\n\n      IV. To determine the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics relationship between carfilzomib's\n      degree of proteasome inhibition and response rate along with the time course of\n      thrombocytopenia.\n\n      V. To study differences in clinical outcomes between germinal center B-cell-like (GCB) and\n      non-GCB relapsed/refractory DLBCL following therapy with carfilzomib and R-ICE.\n\n      VI. Correlative translational research studies to include: phenotypic/genotypic analysis and\n      functional activity (i.e., antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity [ADCC] and\n      complement-mediated cytotoxicity [CMC]) of patient's peripheral blood mononuclear \"effector\"\n      cells (PBMC), as well as ex vivo analysis of sensitivity of primary tumor cells to various\n      combinations of carfilzomib versus bortezomib +/- rituximab; enzymatic assay for\n      chymotrypsin-like activity to determine the degree of proteasome inhibition in primary DLBCL\n      patient samples and patient PBMC specimens; explorative analysis to identify potential\n      factors predictive of response to therapy will be performed.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of carfilzomib, followed by a phase II\n      study.\n\n      Patients receive carfilzomib intravenously (IV) over 10-30 minutes on days 1, 2, 8, and 9;\n      rituximab IV over 3-8 hours on day 3; etoposide IV over 1 hour on days 4-6; carboplatin IV\n      over 1 hour on day 5; and ifosfamide IV over 24 hours on day 5. Treatment repeats every\n      21-28 days for up to 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable\n      toxicity.\n\n      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 4 months for 1 year,\n      every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually for 2 years."
