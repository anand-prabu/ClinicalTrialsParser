Although persons with COPD often have concomitant nasal disease,\n      there are few studies that report physiological or inflammatory changes in the upper airways\n      in young asymptomatic smokers. The investigators investigated physiologic and inflammatory\n      changes in the nasal and lower airways of young smokers and if these changes were related to\n      smoking history.\n\n      Methods: Seventy-two subjects aged \u2264 35 years (32 healthy nonsmokers and 40 young smokers)\n      participated in this study. The investigators measured nasal mucociliary clearance (MCC),\n      nasal mucus physical properties, cell count, myeloperoxidase and cytokines concentrations in\n      nasal lavage fluid, exhaled breath condensate (EBC) pH and lung function."
