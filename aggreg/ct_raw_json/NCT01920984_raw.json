            "textblock": "Introduction:\n\n      Angiogenesis, the growth and proliferation of new blood vessels, is an important aspect of\n      the vascular proliferation found in tumor growth, wound repair, inflammatory states, and\n      ischemic sequel in the ocular angiogenetic diseases. Intraocular neovascularization, the\n      major eventually complication of diabetic mellitus, may result in vitreous hemorrhage,\n      tractional retinal detachment, neovascularization glaucoma and eventually blindness. The\n      involved factors include basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), insulin-like growth factor-I\n      (IGF-I), vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF), and  Connective tissue growth\n      factor (CTGF)/Cysteine-rich protein (Cyr61)/Nephroblastoma overexpressed gene (CCN) family.\n      VEGF is a primary angiogenic factor that mediates ischemic-induced retinal\n      neovascularization. VEGF level are elevated in the vitreous fluid in patients with\n      proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). The unselective anti-VEGF antibody bevacizumab has\n      been used for the treatment of diabetic retinopathy.\n\n      Problem:\n\n      In spite of its potent anti-VEGF property, it does not completely inhibit ischemia-induced\n      retinal neovascularization. Several other factors which were detected to have increased\n      vitreous levels in the PDR patients might participate in the angiogenic process of diabetic\n      retinopathy. One of the member of the CCN family, connective tissue growth factor (CTGF),\n      was found to be involved in the angiogenesis and fibrosis mechanism of PDR. It is unclear if\n      the other factors in the CCN family might also control the development of retinal\n      angiogenesis and fibrosis.We measured vitreous cysteine-rich 61 (Cyr61) levels in PDR\n      patients, non-diabetic patients,and PDR patients pretreated with bevacizumab. We further\n      correlated the cysteine-rich 61 levels with different stages of PDR. Concomitant VEGF level\n      was also measured to better understand the interaction of different factors."
