Linac based stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT)\n      administered in 1-3 fractions has been shown to be an effective treatment option for\n      patients with unresectable, locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma, achieving local\n      control rates of 84-92% at one year. Associated late gastrointestinal toxicity rates have\n      been reported to be 22-25% at 1 year. We hypothesize that similarly excellent local control\n      rates (80-90% at one year) with a reasonable rate of toxicity (\u226420%) can be achieved using\n      Linac based SBRT delivered as 5 Gy x 5 for patients with local failure (remaining disease)\n      after previous treatment with conventional chemoradiation therapy (CRT) with or without\n      surgery and as 6.6 Gy x 5 for radiation-na\u00efve patients with local failure (remaining\n      disease) after previous treatment with surgery and/or chemotherapy. The toxicities of note\n      for this trial are grade 2 and greater gastritis, fistula, enteritis, ulcer, or any other\n      grade 3 or greater gastrointestinal toxicity."
