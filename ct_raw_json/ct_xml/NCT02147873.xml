    <textblock>
      This is a randomized double blind placebo controlled study of  azacitidine with or without
      birinapant in subjects with higher risk Myelodysplastic syndrome  myelomonocytic leukemia
      (CMMoL) who are naïve, to azacitidine therapy. Pre-clinical and mechanistic studies support
      that azacitidine may modulate pathways that enable birinapant-mediated anti-tumor activity.

      This is a randomized double blind placebo controlled study of  azacitidine with or without
      birinapant in subjects with higher risk Myelodysplastic syndrome  myelomonocytic leukemia
      (CMMoL)

      The primary purpose of this study  is :

      -To compare the relative effect of azacitidine plus birinapant versus azacitidine plus
      placebo on response rate in patients with higher-risk MDS or CMMoL.

      The secondary purpose of this study is to compare effect of azacitidine plus birinapant
      relative to azacitidine with placebo on:

        -  Hematologic improvement

        -  Relapse free survival

        -  Time to respond

        -  Change in transfusion requirements

        -  Duration of response

        -  Overall survival

        -  Adverse events

             control as defined by the investigator, for example, those which result in a low
             failure rate (i.e., less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly
             during the study and for a period of 3 months following the last dose of any drug
             administered during the study.

          -  In France, a subject will be eligible for inclusion in this study only if either

             clinically significant cardiac disease

          -  QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTcB) more than 480 msec

          -  Lack of recovery of prior adverse events to Grade ≤1 severity (National Cancer
             Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4) (except alopecia)
             due to therapy administered prior to the initiation of study drug dosing.

          -  Nursing or pregnant.

          -  Known allergy or hypersensitivity to any of the formulation components

          -  Any concurrent disease and/or medical condition that, in the opinion of the
