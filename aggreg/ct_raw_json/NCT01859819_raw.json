Patients who have received emergency irradiation and/or steroid\n        therapy will be eligible ONLY if started on protocol therapy not more than 72 hours from\n        the start of radiotherapy or steroids.  Bone marrow and cerebrospinal fluid MUST be\n        obtained before steroids are given for patient to be eligible for the study.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  Patients with newly diagnosed Group A (low risk) lymphoma.
