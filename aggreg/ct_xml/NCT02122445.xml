  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low back pain is a problem which affects up to 70-80% of people in their lifetime. In the
      United States, it is estimated that the total direct and indirect costs of low back pain
      combined ranges from $19.6 to $118.8 billion. Recent studies have shown the importance of
      the gluteal musculature in the treatment of low back pain. It was found that the gluteus
      maximus (Gmax) is significantly more active in a low back pain population compared to a
      healthy population, indicating the low back pain population relied on the Gmax to fire more
      to overcome the gluteal weakness. A new approach to treating musculoskeletal conditions is a
      taping technique designed to target muscles and lymphatic system. Limited research is
      available for the treatment of specific conditions, including low back pain, but it is
      theorized to inhibit or facilitate the muscle, improve blood flow, reduce pain, and improve
      joint alignment. Methods: The purpose of this study is to determine the immediate and
      delayed effectiveness of Cramer® Sports Motion Tape on Gmax and lumbar paraspinal activation
      in a chronic mechanical low back pain population. A convenience sample of 20 new patients
      with current, chronic low back pain, no current neurologic signs or symptoms, no previous
      spinal surgery, no corticosteroid treatment within the last two weeks, and who are not
      pregnant will be recruited for this study. Patients will sign an informed consent, complete
      all initial paperwork. Surface electromyography will be used to quantify the activity level
      of the Gmax and lumbar paraspinals (LP). The MVIC will be estimated for each muscle group
      and the patient will perform a series of 4 randomized exercises, 5 repetitions each; Clams
      with Resistance, Standing Hip Abduction with Resistance, Sidelying Hip Abduction, and a
      forward bend. After each exercise the patient will rate &quot;How hard they are working&quot; on the
      RISE scale. Following the initial test, Cramer® Sports Motion Tape will be applied to the
      gluteal and low back area. After the tape is applied, the EMG exercise protocol will be
      repeated. The tape will be left on until the patient returns for their next appointment,
      within 24 to 48 hours, where they will have a delayed post-test. Patients will rate their
      pain, surface electrodes will be applied to the previous testing sites, and MVIC will be
      retested for each muscle group. The patient will perform the same protocol that was
      performed in the initial testing session. The EMG signals will be smoothed, rectified and
      analyzed using a root-mean-square algorithm. The investigators will use visual onset and
      offset of the EMG signal amplitude to select the middle 3 trials. Average activation and
      peak activation will be determined and compared to the MVIC for each muscle group, and
      expressed as a %MVIC. This will allow %MVIC to be compared and rank order among groups and
      muscles.
