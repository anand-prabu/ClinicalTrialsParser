            "textblock": "The long-term goal of this program of research is to disseminate an effective, brief\n      computer-based intervention that can be readily integrated into HIV treatment settings to\n      motivate tobacco quitline use among smokers living with HIV. The overall objective of this\n      application is to develop this computer intervention, modify it based on initial piloting\n      and feedback, and obtain preliminary data supporting the efficacy of the intervention. This\n      will be accomplished by pursuing three specific aims: 1) to develop and conduct preliminary\n      pilot testing (n=16) of a brief, computer-based intervention intended to motivate tobacco\n      quitline use among cigarette smokers living with HIV (Computer Intervention to Motivate\n      Engagement in Tobacco Quitline treatment; CI-METQ) and to develop and pilot (n=4) a\n      computer-based, time matched nutrition education for PLWH control intervention (NC) equated\n      for the offer of a tobacco quitline referral and 8 weeks of free nicotine patch for those\n      who engage in quitline treatment, 2) to conduct a preliminary smoking cessation, randomized\n      controlled trial (RCT) with 100 people living with HIV (PLWH) who smoke cigarettes,\n      comparing CI-METQ vs. NC, with predictions that CI-METQ relative to NC will result in\n      increased readiness, higher rates of tobacco treatment engagement, more quit smoking\n      attempts and higher rates of 7-day point prevalence abstinence rates at 1-, 3- and 6-month\n      follow-ups. Health-related quality of life over this period will also be examined, and 3) to\n      examine CI-METQ's effects on key mechanisms during the computer session and their\n      associations with tobacco treatment engagement and smoking outcomes at 1-, 3- and 6-month\n      follow-ups."
