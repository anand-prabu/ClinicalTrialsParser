            "textblock": "The main objective of this study is to assess the safety and the efficacy of EscharEx in\n      preparing the wound's bed in patients with hard to heal venous leg ulcers, diabetic lower\n      extremity ulcers and traumatic/post operative wounds.\n\n      This study will be a multi-center, blinded, randomized, controlled study intended to\n      demonstrate superiority of EscharEx debriding treatment over the Gel Vehicle control\n      treatment in patients with hard to heal wounds.\n\n      72 adults with >50% necrotic/slough/fibrin non-viable tissue on a hard to heal wound (venous\n      leg ulcer, diabetic lower extremity ulcer or traumatic/ post operative wound) between 5 cm2\n      and 100 cm2 (surface area), will be enrolled into the study.\n\n      Patients will undergo a 1 week screening period (2 visits) which will include: record of\n      demographics, medical history and concomitant medications, vital signs, physical\n      examination, clinical laboratory tests, wound photography and assessments and questionnaires\n      (wound status and quality of life). During this period wounds will be cleansed with normal\n      saline and the wound will be dressed with moist-to-moist saline gauze. During this screening\n      period, subjects whose study wound size (surface area) decreases by a stated amount (i.e. >\n      20 percent) will be excluded. Following completion of the screening process, eligible\n      patients will be randomized to either EscharEx or Gel vehicle debridement treatments.\n      Treatment will be performed once daily up to 10 applications (up to 10 visits) or until\n      complete debridement is achieved, whichever occurs first. The duration of each application\n      is 4 hours.  Following each application the wound will be washed photographed and assessed\n      for wound size, removal of nonviable tissue and change in granulation tissue (by digital\n      planimetry software), wound status, and safety parameters.  Subsequent to each debridement\n      treatment the wound will be dressed with moist-to-moist saline gauze.  Following completion\n      of the debridement treatment period, patients will be treated according to standard\n      procedures and evaluated (wound assessments) once a week until complete wound closure for up\n      to 12 weeks from last application (up to 12 visits).  For patients who achieved wound\n      closure, additional 3 months (3 visits) follow up of wound closure recurrence will be\n      conducted. Quality of life (QoL) will be evaluated at the last wound closure follow-up visit\n      and 3 months post wound closure follow-up period (for all patients)."
