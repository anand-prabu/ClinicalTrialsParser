            "textblock": "INTRODUCTION\n\n      1.1  Rationale for the study\n\n      There is a significant relation between postoperative cognitive dysfunction and increasing\n      age, increasing duration of surgery. But, up to now, the effect of the depth of anesthesia\n      on POCD remains controversial. This study is designed to investigate whether the depth of\n      anesthesia affects the incidence of POCD, we will use propofol for total intravenous\n      anesthesia in elderly patients whose depth of anesthesia was monitored and adjusted by\n      bispectral index (BIS). The early and long-term incidence of POCD will be compared between\n      deep and light-anesthesia groups.\n\n      1.2  Background\n\n      We hypothesize that depth of anesthesia may exert an influence on the early postoperative\n      cognitive dysfunction. One reason that deep anesthesia might protect cognitive function is\n      the prevention of the stress response to noxious stimulation. The noxious stimulation of\n      surgery can induce stress responses whose severity correlates with the intensity of surgery\n      (major versus minor).Light anesthesia with a serious stress response to noxious stimulation\n      may increase the incidence of POCD. Furthermore, major surgery causing a serious stress\n      response can give rise to a higher incidence of early postoperative cognitive dysfunction\n      than minor. This may also prove our hypothesis on the other hand.  The elderly patients who\n      received major surgery had a higher incidence of early POCD than those who received minor\n      surgery. A deleterious stress response can be associated with major surgery or light\n      anesthesia, and it can cause excessive production of corticosteroids that target receptors\n      in the cerebral cortex and subcortical nucleus, eventually resulting in neuron injury. This\n      may explain why the elderly has a higher incidence of early POCD after surgery. However, the\n      effect of the depth of anesthesia on POCD remains controversial. Farag E et al. randomized\n      74 patients to either a low Bispectral Index (BIS) regimen or a high BIS regimen during the\n      surgical procedure. Preoperatively and 4-6 week after surgery, the patients' cognitive\n      status was assessed with a cognitive test battery consisting of processing speed index,\n      working memory index, and verbal memory index. Processing speed index was higher in the low\n      BIS group versus the high BIS group. But no difference was observed in the other two test\n      battery components. Certainly one of the limitations of their data is that the observed\n      difference in cognitive ability occurred in only one of three assessments. Recently, we have\n      made a randomised, double-blind, controlled study to demonstrate that deeper general\n      anesthesia, as defined by a median BIS of 38, when compared with a median BIS of 58, was\n      associated with a reduced incidence of early POCD(at 1 week postoperationly). This study has\n      been published in J Neurosurg Anesthesiol , Volume 23, Number 1, January 2011. as it was\n      just a small sample(n=40) study without considering incidence of long-term POCD, we hope to\n      obtain more reliable data from a multi-center study to investigate  whether the depth of\n      total intravenous anesthesia using propofol  affects the early and long-term incidence of\n      POCD.\n\n      The bispectral index\uff08BIS\uff09can reflect the depth of anesthesia of propofol combined with\n      opioids. In our study, BIS will still be used to provide a reference for the selection of a\n      suitable depth of anesthesia."
