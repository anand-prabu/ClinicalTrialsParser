Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive bryostatin 1 IV over 24 hours on days\n      1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for 2 courses. For patients with stable or\n      responding disease after completion of course 2, treatment repeats every 4 weeks in the\n      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-25 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-18\n      months."
