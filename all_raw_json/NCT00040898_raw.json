This\n      may be an effective treatment following hepatic artery embolization.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of Sho-saiko-to following hepatic artery\n      embolization in treating patients who have liver cancer."

Treatment with\n      Sho-saiko-to continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 78 patients will be accrued for this study within 18-24\n      months."
