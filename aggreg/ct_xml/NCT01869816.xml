  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Visceral obesity is the one of the major causes of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in
      industrialized countries. Adipose tissue secretes various kinds of bioactive molecules
      termed adipokines which contribute to the development of obesity-related disorders including
      cardiovascular disease (CVD). Progranulin and CTRP3 are recently discovered novel
      adipokines. Therefore, the investigators tried to compare circulating CTRP-3 and progranulin
      levels in patients with CAD and investigated whether CTRP-3 or progranulin is significantly
      associated with CAD prevalence after adjustment for well-known CAD risk factors.

        Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients, who were admitted to the coronary care units of
        the Division of Cardiology at Guro Hospital in Korea University Medical Center.

        Control subjects were recruited from the participants for a routine health check-up in the
        Health Promotion Center of Korea University Guro Hospital.
