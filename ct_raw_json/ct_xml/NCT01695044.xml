    <textblock>
      PSMA ADC 2301 is a Phase 2, open-label, study to assess the anti-tumor activity and
      tolerability of PSMA ADC in two groups of subjects with metastatic castration-resistant
      prostate cancer (mCRPC).  One group comprises subjects who must have received at least one
      taxane-containing chemotherapy regimen (e.g. docetaxel, cabazitaxel).  If a subject has
      received more than two cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens, Sponsor approval is required for
      study participation.  The second group comprises subjects who are cytotoxic
      chemotherapy-naïve.  Subjects who are cytotoxic chemotherapy-naïve must have received and
      progressed on-, be ineligible for, refused, have an intolerance to-, or not have access to
      Radium-223. Both groups of subjects must also have received and progressed on abiraterone
      acetate and/or enzalutamide.  If a subject is unable to receive abiraterone acetate and/or
      enzalutamide, Sponsor approval is required for participation in the study.  Subjects will
      receive up to eight doses of PSMA ADC approximately once every three weeks.
