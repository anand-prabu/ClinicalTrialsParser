    <textblock>
      Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory condition of unknown aetiology,
      characterized by a diffuse confluent mucosal inflammation of the colon starting from the
      rectum with a relapsing and remitting course. Conventional endoscopy was thought to be a
      reliable parameter of disease activity, but microscopic inflammation can persist despite
      normal mucosal findings. Histologically detectable inflammation is associated with a greater
      risk of subsequent relapse. A flare in UC activity is difficult to predict, but a simple,
      easily measured biological marker of relapse would be important in guiding the most
      appropriate therapy.

      Recent technological advances in fiber optics, light sources, detectors, and molecular
      biology have stimulated development of numerous optical methods that promise to
      significantly improve our ability to evaluate human epithelium in vivo. These methods,
      collectively termed &quot;optical biopsy,&quot; are nondestructive in situ assays of mucosal
      histopathology using light that can provide instantaneous tissue assessment. Narrow band
      imaging (NBI) is a novel technique that enhances the diagnostic capability of endoscopes in
      characterising tissues by using filters in a redgreenblue (RGB) sequential illumination
      system. This results in improved mucosal contrast and detail.

      UC always involves the distal colon and activity is usually greatest in rectosigmoid area.
      This makes evaluation of the rectum and sigmoid an attractive marker in patients with UC.
      Unlike serum and faecal markers, endoscopic assessment of the mucosa is unlikely to be
      affected by systemic disease and would be acceptable test for patients and physicians.

      We plan to evaluate THE rectosigmoid mucosa in patients with UC by flexible endoscope using
      both white light and NBI endoscopy. These patients will be followed by for one year or until
      they relapse, whichever comes first. The aim of our study is to develop endoscopic
      biomarkers to predict relapse in acute and quiescent UC.
