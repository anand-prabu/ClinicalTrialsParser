    <textblock>
      Freezing of gait (FOG) is a disabling episodic gait disturbance that is common among
      patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). The symptoms of PD generally show an asymmetric
      onset and progression.

      In particular, impairments in rhythmicity, symmetry, and bilateral coordination  have been
      reported to be associated with FOG episodes. As the maintenance of gait depends on the
      precise alternating movements of both legs, irregularities in rhythm, symmetry, and
      bilateral coordination may impair gait sequence, potentially causing freezing.

      Results of recent studies strongly suggest that bilateral uncoordinated gait and marked gait
      asymmetry are associated with FOG. Moreover, it has recently been hypothesized that this may
      lead to a degree of asymmetric motor function, and that FOG in parkinsonian patients is
      triggered by a breakdown in the bilateral co-ordination underlying the normal timing of
      gait. Aim of the study was to evaluate how the modulation of asymmetry through physical
      therapy might improve gait and FOG.

      The patients will be'blind' to the study protocol and will be randomly assigned to one of
      the three study arms: 1) physiotherapy aimed to potentiate the more affected body side
      (worst side improvement, WSI); 2) physiotherapy aimed to potentiate the less affected body
      side (best side improvement, BSI); 3) physiotherapy aimed to potentiate both sides equally
      (standard treatment, ST). Each group will be undergo physiotherapy twice a week for three
      months. Each session will have duration of one hour and include a first part of warming up,
      a final part of cooling down (these two parts are the same for all the groups) and an active
      part (which is different from group to group). The active part includes exercises which are
      alike for all the groups but with a number of repetitions different from group to group
      according to the aim of potentiating the most affected side (WSI) or the least affected side
      (BSI) or both sides equally (in this case the number of repetitions was the same for both
      sides; ST). Medical treatment will be kept stable through all the study duration;
      medications are expressed as levodopa daily dose equivalent (LEDD).
