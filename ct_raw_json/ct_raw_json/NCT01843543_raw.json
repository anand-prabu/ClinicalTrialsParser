New findings have discovered that urgency incontinence may be connected to the\n      interactions of certain regions of the brain and the bladder.  Although this is a common\n      problem, researched still do not know how these interactions impact the process of urgency\n      incontinence.  Furthermore, there is preliminary data to suggest that interventions such as\n      Mindful-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) can potentially be used as therapy for UI. The purpose\n      of this study is to determine the impact MBSR training on UI symptoms, quality of life, and\n      anxiety measures."
