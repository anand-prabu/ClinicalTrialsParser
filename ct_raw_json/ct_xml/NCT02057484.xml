  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of Advagraf, prolonged-release, once
      daily tacrolimus formulation, on long-term graft survival in kidney and liver allograft
      recipients. This study will also evaluate the overall long-term impact of Advagraf on kidney
      and liver allograft recipients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prograf is one of the medications taken by a patient after they have had a liver or kidney
      transplant to prevent their body from rejecting the new liver or kidney transplant. Prograf
      is taken by the patient twice a day. Advagraf is a similar medication but is taken by the
      patient only once a day. There is some evidence emerging that may show that this once-a-day
      medication may show additional benefits over the twice a day medication, such as, patients
      more likely to remember to take this medication. Also, this once a day medication is slowly
      released in the body through the course of a day which in turn may provide better protection
      against the body rejecting the new transplanted organ over a longer period.

      This study will follow up adult patients who were previously enrolled in an Advagraf trial
      after they have had a liver or kidney transplant. The information collected for this study
      will be information that the patient's doctor will normally collect when he/she sees the
      patient  for their regular check-ups. Information will be collected once a year  for a
      period of 5 years from when the patient received their new organ transplant.  It is hoped
      that patient information collected during the study will provide prescribers with useful
      information in treatment of organ transplant patients.

        previously treated with Advagraf. Therefore patients do not have to be currently receiving
        Advagraf to be included, nor do they have to have completed a previous Astellas clinical
        trial.
