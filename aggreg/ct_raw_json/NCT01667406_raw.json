            "textblock": "Infertility affects one in six couples in the UK and has devastating physical, social and\n      emotional consequences for affected couples. In vitro fertilisation (IVF) treatment is now\n      widely and successfully used to enable infertile couples to conceive. However, IVF treatment\n      can result in the potentially life threatening condition, ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome\n      (OHSS). Mild forms of OHSS occur in approximately 1 in 3 of all IVF cycles, whilst\n      approximately 1 in 10 IVF cycles result in moderate or severe OHSS. OHSS is caused by the\n      use of human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) used in IVF treatment to stimulate oocyte (egg)\n      maturation. Kisspeptin is a hormone which stimulates reproductive hormone secretion and is\n      responsible for the release of reproductive hormones which result in oocyte maturation and\n      ovulation (the release of an egg from the ovary). The significant advantage of kisspeptin\n      over current treatments to stimulate ovulation, is that it would stimulate a more\n      physiological increase in reproductive hormones and oocyte maturation during IVF treatment.\n      The aims of this project are to investigate whether administration of kisspeptin to women\n      can result in oocyte maturation."
