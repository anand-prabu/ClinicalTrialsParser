  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The trial will compare results of screening colonoscopy performed by means of conventional
      colonoscopy and using new visualisation techniques during endoscopic examination.

        -  Electronic colonoscopes Olympus CF-HQ190F with following options: magnetic positioning
           (Scope Guide), responsive insertion technology (RIT), dual focus function, narrow band
           imaging (NBI) will be used for innovative colonoscopies

        -  Electronic colonoscopes Olympus CF-H180DL with Scope Guide and NBI options will be used
           for conventional colonoscopies Endoscopists will archive all images and establish
           presumptive diagnosis based on the results of different visualisation techniques. All
           endoscopes will be attached to Olympus Evis Exera III system. Biopsy of all
           pathological lesions will be performed to establish final diagnosis. The main outcome
           measure is diagnostic accuracy of innovative colonoscopy in comparison with
           conventional technique.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 600 consecutive patients undergoing screening unsedated colonoscopy will be
      randomly assigned to innovative or conventional examination. Randomization will be based on
      computer-generated randomization lists. All patients will be blinded so they will not know
      which techniques will be used to assess lesions found in colon. In innovative colonoscopy
      group narrow band imaging (NBI) and Dual Focus (DF) function will be used to identify and
      classify all lesions acc. to Sano and Kudo classification. Endoscopic biopsy will be taken
      from all lesion and endoscopic diagnosis will be compared with final histological diagnosis.
      Thus sensitivity, specificity, diagnostic accuracy, predictive values, likelihood ratio and
      Youden index will be calculated. As secondary endpoints total examination time, coecal
      intubation rate and pain intensity (VAS scale) will be established. This study will help to
      establish whether new technologies used during colonoscopy may improve diagnostic
      possibilities and whether they prolong examination time or lead to increase of pain
      intensity afterwards.
