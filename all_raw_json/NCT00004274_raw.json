Giving estrogen is standard treatment for girls who\n      have Turner's syndrome. Estrogen may be effective treatment for mental and social\n      functioning problems experienced by girls with Turner's syndrome.\n\n      PURPOSE: Clinical trial to study the effectiveness of long term estrogen therapy on mental\n      and social functioning in girls who have Turner's syndrome."
