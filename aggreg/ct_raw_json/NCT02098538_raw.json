Cancers arising from non-salivary gland primary sites are allowed.\n\n          -  Patients must have recurrent and/or metastatic disease not amenable to potentially\n             curative surgery or radiotherapy.\n\n          -  At least 2 weeks must have elapsed since the end of prior systemic treatment (4 weeks\n             for bevacizumab- containing regimens) or radiotherapy with resolution of all\n             treatment-related toxicity to NCI CTCAE Version 4.0 grade \u22641 (or tolerable grade 2)\n             or back to baseline (except for alopecia, lymphopenia, or hypothyroidism). Any number\n             of prior therapies for recurrent/metastatic ACC are allowed.\n\n          -  Patients must have RECIST v1.1 measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion\n             that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be\n             recorded for nonnodal lesions and short axis for nodal lesions) as > or = to 20 mm\n             with conventional techniques or as > or = to10 mm with spiral CT scan.\n\n          -  Patients must have documentation of a new or progressive lesion on a radiologic\n             imaging study performed within 6 months prior to study enrollment (progression of\n             disease over any interval is allowed) and/or new/worsening disease related symptoms\n             within 6 months prior to study enrollment. Note: This assessment will be performed by\n             the treating investigator. Evidence of progression by RECIST criteria is not\n             required.\n\n          -  Patients must have archival tissue from the primary tumor or metastases available for\n             correlative studies. Either a paraffin block or twenty unstained slides are\n             acceptable.

Ho.\n\n          -  Patients must agree to undergo biopsy of a malignant lesion. Biopsies do not need to\n             be done if either the investigator or person performing the biopsy judges that no\n             tumor is accessible for biopsy or that biopsy poses too great of a risk to the\n             patient. Patients may also be exempt if frozen tumor tissue has been collected within\n             12 months of study enrollment that the Principal Investigator deems is\n             appropriate/sufficient for analysis on this protocol.\n\n          -  Age \u2265 18 years.\n\n          -  ECOG performance status \u2264 2 (Karnofsky > or = to 60%,).\n\n          -  Life expectancy of at least 12 weeks (3 months) as determined by the investigator.\n\n          -  Life expectancy of at least 12 weeks (3 months) as determined by the investigator.\n\n          -  Subjects must be able to understand and be willing to sign the written informed\n             consent form.

The definition of adequate contraception will be\n             based on the judgment of the principal investigator or a designated associate.\n\n          -  Subject must be able to swallow and retain oral medication.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  Concurrent anti-cancer therapy (chemotherapy, definitive radiation therapy, surgery,\n             immunotherapy, biologic therapy, or tumor embolization) other than study treatment.\n             Concurrent therapy with bisphosphonates or denosumab for bone metastases is allowed.\n\n        Palliative radiation to non-target lesions is also allowed.\n\n          -  Prior use of regorafenib.\n\n          -  Uncontrolled hypertension (systolic pressure >140 mm Hg or diastolic pressure > 90 mm\n             Hg [NCI-CTCAE v4.0] on repeated measurement) despite optimal medical management.\n\n          -  Concurrent use of another investigational drug or device therapy (i.e., outside of\n             study treatment) during, or within 4 weeks of trial entry (signing of the informed\n             consent form).\n\n          -  Concurrent use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. clarithromycin, grapefruit juice,\n             itraconazole, ketoconazole, nefazodone, posaconazole, telithromycin, and\n             voriconazole). or strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepine,\n             phenobarbital, and St. John's Wort).\n\n          -  Use of any herbal remedy (e.g. St. John's wort [Hypericum perforatum])\n\n          -  Major surgical procedure, open biopsy, or significant traumatic injury within 28 days\n             before start of study medication.\n\n          -  Active or clinically significant cardiac disease including:\n\n        Congestive heart failure - New York Heart Association (NYHA) > Class II.\n\n          -  Active coronary artery disease that is not medically treated.\n\n          -  Cardiac arrhythmias requiring anti-arrhythmic therapy other than beta blockers or\n             digoxin.\n\n          -  Unstable angina (anginal symptoms at rest), new-onset angina within 3 months before\n             randomization, or myocardial infarction within 6 months before randomization.\n\n               -  Therapeutic anticoagulation with Vitamin-K antagonists (e.g., warfarin) is not\n                  allowed if the medication dose and/or INR/PTT are not considered stable by the\n                  treating physician. If the dose and/or INR/PTT are stable, therapeutic\n                  anticoagulation with Vitamin-K antagonists is allowed with close monitoring.\n                  Anticoagulation with heparin or heparinoids is allowed.\n\n               -  Evidence or history of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy.\n\n               -  Any hemorrhage or bleeding event \u2265 NCI CTCAE Grade 3 within 4 weeks prior to\n                  start of study medication.\n\n               -  Subjects with thrombotic, embolic, venous, or arterial events, such as\n                  cerebrovascular accident (including transient ischemic attacks) deep vein\n                  thrombosis or pulmonary embolism within 6 months of start of study treatment.\n\n               -  Subjects with a past or current diagnosis of another malignancy that will\n                  interfere with conduct of the trial. Patients with past or current cancer\n                  diagnoses other than ACC are allowed to enroll if the investigator believes it\n                  will not interfere with trial conduct.\n\n               -  Patients with phaeochromocytoma.\n\n               -  Known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or current chronic\n                  or active hepatitis B or C infection requiring treatment with antiviral therapy.\n\n               -  Active infection that would impair the ability of the patient to receive study\n                  treatment.\n\n               -  Symptomatic metastatic brain or meningeal tumors (asymptomatic or treated\n                  metastatic brain and meningeal tumors are allowed).\n\n               -  Presence of a non-healing wound or non-healing ulcer that is not tumor related.\n\n               -  Renal failure requiring hemo-or peritoneal dialysis.\n\n               -  Patients with seizure disorder requiring medication.\n\n               -  Interstitial lung disease with ongoing signs and symptoms at the time of\n                  informed consent.\n\n               -  History of organ allograft (including corneal transplant).\n\n               -  Known or suspected allergy or hypersensitivity to any of the study drugs, study\n                  drug classes, or excipients of the formulations given during the course of this\n                  trial.\n\n               -  Any malabsorption condition.\n\n               -  Women who are pregnant or breast-feeding.\n\n               -  Any condition which, in the investigator's opinion, makes the subject unsuitable\n                  for trial participation.\n\n               -  Substance abuse, medical, psychological or social conditions that may interfere\n                  with the subject's participation in the study or evaluation of the study\n                  results."
