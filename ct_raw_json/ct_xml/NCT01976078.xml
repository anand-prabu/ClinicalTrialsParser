  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The death rate in children from the invasive fungal infection called aspergillosis is more
      than 50%. Voriconazole is the first-line therapy for this infection. In a previous
      publication the investigators have shown a highly significant relationship between
      voriconazole plasma concentrations and survival. However, voriconazole dosing is currently
      poorly established, and plasma drug exposure varies between children by 400% or more, even
      after intravenous dosing. The objective of this study is to investigate the reasons for this
      variability in voriconazole pharmacokinetics (PK).In two studies, the investigators will
      enroll 80 children/adolescents receiving oral or intravenous voriconazole, divided by age
      under 2 years (n=15), and 2-18 years (n=65).  From each patient the investigators will
      collect the following: 1) a blood sample for detection of several genetic changes known to
      affect drug metabolizing enzyme (DME) activity; 2) up to 9 blood samples after a
      voriconazole dose for measurement of voriconazole (&quot;PK sampling&quot;); 3) follow-up samples
      after each PK sampling visit if necessary to adjust the dose so that voriconazole
      concentrations in the blood are satisfactory (known as therapeutic drug monitoring or TDM).
      At the time of the voriconazole dose prior to the PK sampling, we will also give single IV
      or oral (corresponding to the route of voriconazole administration) low doses of
      esomeprazole (an antacid), midazolam (a sedative), and ranitidine (an antacid) as a cocktail
      to test or probe DME activity. All of these medications are used commonly in children
      already. The investigators will estimate DME activity or phenotype using ratios of probe
      drug metabolite to parent drug concentrations, while simultaneously quantifying the amount
      of DME genetic material (mRNA) and protein in white blood cells. The investigators will test
      associations between DME activity, mRNA, protein, voriconazole PK, age, sex, and degree of
      illness. The investigators will also use a computer program to integrate all these data to
      develop a comprehensive model that will predict blood concentrations of voriconazole in
      children of all ages, as well as assist physicians and pharmacists to dose voriconazole more
      accurately.The total study duration for each subject will be until after the TDM follow up
      visit, generally about one week.

    <description>At the time of the voriconazole dose used for the primary outcome, an intravenous or oral cocktail of &quot;probe drugs&quot;, depending on the route of the voriconazole dose, consisting of midazolam, ranitidine, and esomeprazole will be administered.  Using the samples collected for the primary outcome, concentrations of all three probe drugs and their major metabolites will be measured and used to compute activity of the relevant drug metabolizing enzymes.</description>

    <description>Using existing voriconazole pharmacokinetic data, we have constructed a population model of the drug's behavior in children and adults.  We are testing the use of this model in study subjects to compare the doses predicted by the software to achieve actual, measured voriconazole concentrations obtained for routine clinical care after the study PK visit, with the real doses that were administered and resulted in those measured voriconazole concentrations.</description>
