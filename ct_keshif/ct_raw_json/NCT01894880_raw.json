            "textblock": "In the past decades frequency of cesarean section was increasing. Bonding or early\n      skin-to-skin contact (SSC) starts ideally straight after birth. After vaginal delivery\n      bonding/early SSC is already well-established. After cesarean section this important process\n      starts after termination of operation. A Cochran review analyzed randomized studies and\n      shows positive effects of early SSC. Possible concerns to adopt bonding in the operating\n      room are beside organizational ones (change of established processes) also a different\n      ambiance in the operating room (temperature, light, noise). In a prospective randomized\n      trial, early SSC after cesarean section should be analyzed.\n\n      Hypothesis\n\n      Mothers, who have the chance to bond immediately after birth in the operating room, have\n      lower cortisol, chromogranin A and alpha amylase levels as well as higher oxytocin levels.\n      Adaptation of the newborn is within the normal range. Early bonding has a further positive\n      effect on breast feeding, maternal pain processing and mental health."
