To evaluate the ability of this technique to improve lymph node yield, providing a\n      potential therapeutic benefit to these patients by removing additional lymph nodes that may\n      otherwise have been missed.\n\n      OUTLINE:\n\n      Patients receive indocyanine green transperineally and undergo diffuse optical imaging\n      during robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy with bilateral lymph node\n      dissection using the da Vinci Robotic Surgical System.\n\n      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 1-2 weeks."
