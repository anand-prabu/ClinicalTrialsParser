            "textblock": "Photocoagulation (thermal laser) was the first modality to be described for the treatment of\n      PDR. Different types of laser such as xenon, krypton, argon, red diode and green diode can\n      be used for this treatment. The Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) showed\n      the benefit of early treatment of PDR and of macular edema with laser photocoagulation.\n\n      However, several studies have reported loss of visual field after laser photocoagulation of\n      the bilateral full-scatter type (PRP) due to the expansion of the thermal injury, possibly\n      even compromising the ability to drive automotive vehicles according to the standards of the\n      transit authorities of some countries. Thus, this implies a greater impact on the quality of\n      life of the patient, especially if he is a young diabetic.6\n\n      The objective of new laser photocoagulation technologies is to provide a treatment that will\n      permit the development of a regenerative response of photoreceptors and of the retinal\n      pigment epithelium (RPE) with the minimum loss of photoreceptors and the minimum cicatricial\n      expansion of the thermal injury on the targeted RPE.7\n\n      The PASCAL photocoagulator (OptiMedica, Santa Clara, California) (a standard scanning laser)\n      was introduced in 2005 for retinal photocoagulation. The device functions as if it partially\n      automated the procedure by means of a shorter laser pulse (short pulse strategy) combined\n      with multiple simultaneous firings in a pattern, performing the procedure within a shorter\n      period of time  and with less damage to the outer retina or the RPE, in addition to\n      providing better patient comfort.8\n\n      Regarding combined therapy, the combination of intravitreous injection of ranibizumab with\n      PRP (ETDRS) proved to be more promising in terms of improved visual acuity, stability of\n      macular thickness and a greater regression rate of neovessel areas than the use of PRP alone\n      (ETDRS) in patients with high risk PDR.1\n\n      Thus, in the present study we would like to determine which would be the best therapeutic\n      combination of laser and an anti-VEGF drug for our patients, or whether treatment with an\n      anti-VEGF drug alone would be better in terms of the anatomical and functional parameters\n      proposed."
