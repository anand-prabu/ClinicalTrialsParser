      The purpose of the study is to assess the safety, tolerability and to assess the
      HPV-specific immune responses of different doses of ISA101 vaccine with or without pegylated
      IFNα as combination therapy with carboplatin and paclitaxel.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A majority of cervical carcinomas are caused by an uncontrolled, persistent infection with
      high risk Human Papilloma Virus (HPV). ISA101 is a novel therapeutic synthetic long peptide
      (SLP) vaccine targeting HPV16 which is being developed and has shown efficacy in patients
      with high-grade premalignant vulvar lesions caused by HPV with only minor toxicity. For most
      advanced cancers, chemotherapy remains the treatment modality of choice but has been
      considered to be immunosuppressive. However, accumulating evidence indicates that many
      modalities of conventional chemotherapy not only are less immunosuppressive than previously
      thought but in fact can exert favorable effects on the tumor micro-environment by
      interfering with suppressive immune cells and by stimulating the release of immune
      activating molecules by tumor cells. Thus chemotherapy may enhance tumor-specific immunity
      and synergize with cancer immunotherapy. Addition of pegylated interferon alpha (IFNα) two-b
      (IIb) to vaccination might even further improve the immune response. This multicenter, open
      label, non-randomized Phase I/II study will be performed to assess the safety and
      tolerability of the ISA101 vaccine, and the immune modulating effects of ISA101 with or
      without pegylated IFNα when combined with carboplatin and paclitaxel.
