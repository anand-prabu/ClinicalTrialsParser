  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The immune system is an intricate system comprised of specialized cells, proteins, tissues
      and organs. Proper functioning is critical to the body's ability to defend itself against
      harmful pathogens. Immunological disorders and deficiencies are defects in the immune system
      that lead to abnormal immune responses. Abnormal immune responses could be derived from
      immune deficiencies, dysregulations or hypersensitivities.

      The overall goal of this research study is to identify the mechanisms of primary immune
      deficiencies and immune disorders at the genetic, cellular and molecular level, using novel
      analytic techniques to be performed on immune cells derived from blood samples. The
      knowledge gained from the aims of this study could lead to better diagnostics and identify
      novel targets for therapeutic interventions.

    <textblock>
      Primary immunodeficiency diseases (PID) represent a class of disorders in which there is an
      instrinsic defect in the human immune system. The PID could be caused by defects or
      perturbations in either the innate or adaptive immune cells, such as B cell defects which
      result in lack of antibodies. Research in this topic remains a difficult feat due factors
      such as genetic heterogeneity and the gene-environment interface. Limitations of standard of
      care testing leads to many patients with immunological problems to be undiagnosed. In
      addition to the variety of primary immune deficiencies, there are large number of immune
      system disorders due to various perturbations in the immunological components that cause
      diseases with much greater prevalence such as autoimmune diseases, lymphoproliferative
      diseases, chronic inflammation and certain cancers. The causes of these immune disorders are
      typically more complex than PID but there are also many overlaps in immune hyper-activation
      and deficiency.
