            "textblock": "AIMS The aims were 1) to describe the quality of life (QoL) of a cohort of children born\n      very preterm (<28 weeks of gestation) aged 7 to 9 years; 2) to compare children's QoL to the\n      QoL reported by a French general population of reference.  3) to determine whether\n      socio-demographic factors, neonatal features and neurocognitive status were impacting their\n      QoL.\n\n      METHODS:\n\n        -  Multi-centre study: 6 French level three perinatal care units (Marseille, Montpellier,\n           Nantes, N\u00eemes, Nice and Rouen).\n\n        -  Inclusion criteria: all infants born before 28 weeks of gestation between January 2005\n           and December 2007, from 7 to 9 years old of age at the time of evaluation.\n\n        -  Written agreement to participate: collected from parents.\n\n        -  Data collection: reports of children's QoL by children and their parents (using\n           standardized validated questionnaires); clinical information about the children,\n           obtained through a medical examination; children neurocognitive profile.\n\n        -  Duration of inclusion: over 24 months.\n\n        -  Population: of the six structures, approximately 300 children will be evaluated\n           consistent with the active files of the participating centres and an attrition rate of\n           30%.\n\n      PERSPECTIVES This is one of the first studies to collect self-reported data on quality of\n      life of school-age children (7-9 years) born before 28 weeks of gestation. A better\n      understanding of demographic and clinical determinants of QOL of school-age very preterm\n      children may help clinicians involved in the care of these children in their ethical and\n      medical considerations."
