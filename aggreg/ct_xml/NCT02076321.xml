  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen, are excellent medications
      for providing pain control in children with fractures or those who have surgery to correct
      bony deformity requiring the bone to be cut (osteotomy) and realigned. There is some data to
      suggest that these types of medications can adversely affect bone healing in adult patients
      with broken bones or those having spine fusion surgery. There is little data with regard to
      how these medications effect bone healing in children. With this project, our goal is to
      determine if NSAIDs delay or otherwise adversely effect bone healing and to demonstrate that
      these medications adequately control pain in children with broken bones or those who have
      had an osteotomy.
