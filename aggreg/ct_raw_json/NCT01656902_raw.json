            "textblock": "For the cartilage cell product NOVOCART\u00ae 3D plus, which is used in the study described here,\n      the company TETEC AG obtained an expanded production authorization from the medication\n      monitoring authorities in compliance with Section 13, Para. 1 of the Medicinal Products Act\n      in 2003. This entitles TETEC AG to produce the pharmaceutical product and already distribute\n      it. More than 6000 patients were already successfully treated with NOVOCART\u00ae 3D in Europe\n      since 2003. In order to obtain a general market authorization for NOVOCART\u00ae 3D plus, this\n      control group study is conducted, in which the superiority of the safety and effectiveness\n      of carrier-bound Autologous Chondrocyte Transplantation with NOVOCART\u00ae 3D plus compared to\n      the standard of care microfracture surgery needs to be proven. This study further aims at\n      developing and validating known and new biologic markers for the quality and clinical\n      efficacy of the product as requested in the context of identity, purity and potency\n      characteristics of the medicinal/investigational product.\n\n      The patients will receive one of the therapeutic procedures in the study. The treatment\n      procedure which will be used will be decided by a previously specified random process. This\n      type of study meets the high quality requirements of the statutorily specified safety and\n      quality regulations which are also referred to as \"Good Clinical Practice\" (GCP). The\n      probability of the patient being allocated to one of the two treatments is 2:1; that is, an\n      approx. 67% probability of therapy with NOVOCART\u00ae 3D plus and an approx. 33% probability of\n      therapy with microfracture. Neither the patient, nor the investigator will be able to\n      influence the treatment assignment.\n\n      Patients will be screened for eligibility at the Screening Visit. Each patient will remain\n      in the study for 36 months post-implant for the effectiveness assessments, and then an\n      additional two years to complete the planned post-market phase. Each patient will be in the\n      study for up to five years.\n\n      Cells and tissues collected from this study will be used in other in vitro-controlled\n      experiments aimed at developing and validating known and novel biologic markers to quantify\n      cell quality in the context of identity, purity and potency. Prognostic values of these\n      biologic markers will be examined by correlating them with clinical data collected in this\n      study."
