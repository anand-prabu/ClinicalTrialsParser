A two way catheter is placed in the urinary bladder, and continuous\n      isotonic saline irrigation is performed throughout scan acquisition to reduce the\n      interference in imaging lesions in the pelvic lymph nodes and adjacent pelvic bones caused\n      by radiation excreted in urine held in the bladder.\n\n      Each patient receives C11-methionine intravenously. PET imaging begins immediately after\n      injection for approximately 60 minutes total using standard imaging procedures. Immediately\n      following the completion of imaging after C11-methionine administration, each patient\n      receives FDG intravenously. PET imaging begins approximately 45 minutes thereafter for\n      approximately 60 minutes using standard imaging procedures."
