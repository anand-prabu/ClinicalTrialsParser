There will be four treatment arms in the study and\n      participants will be assigned to 1 of 4 possible treatment arms in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. The\n      planned number of evaluable participants for this study is 24 with 6 participants completing\n      all critical assessments in each of the four treatment arms. The total duration of\n      participation from screening to follow-up for Treatment Arms A, B and D (single dose of\n      GSK933776), will be approximately 113 days and total duration for Treatment Arm C (repeat\n      dose of GSK933776) will be approximately 134 days."
