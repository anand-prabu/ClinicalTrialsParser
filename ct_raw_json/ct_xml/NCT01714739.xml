    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of BMS-986015 given in
      combination with BMS-936558 and to identify dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) and the
      maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of the combination, in subjects with advanced (metastatic
      and/or unresectable) solid tumors.
