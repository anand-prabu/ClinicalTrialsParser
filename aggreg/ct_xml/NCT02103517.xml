      The purpose of this study is to determine whether omega-3 fatty acids supplementation are
      effective in the improvement of suboptimal health status and cardiovascular risk.

      The Suboptimal health status questionnaire (SHSQ-25) is used to evaluate the suboptimal
      health status. The SHSQ-25 includes 25 questions. The score of the SHSQ-25 is from 0 to 100.
      Suboptimal health status is defined as the SHSQ-25 score above than 35. The higher scores of
      the SHSQ-25 one gets, the more severity of suboptimal health status he/she has. All
      participants are asked to fill in the SHSQ-25 before and after the intervention. If the
      score decreases after the intervention, it means that the suboptimal health status has been
      improved.

    <description>To investigate the changes of traditional cardiovascular risk factors such as blood pressure, lipids, fasting plasma glucose, and body mass index with three months supplementation of omega-3 fatty acids. Abnormal cardiovascular risk factors are defined according to the Adult Treatment Panel III criteria for metabolic syndromes and the recommendation by the Working Group on Obesity in China. The number of abnormal cardiovascular risk factors for each participant is recorded before and after intervention. If the number decreases after intervention, it means that the traditional cardiovascular risk factors have been improved.</description>
