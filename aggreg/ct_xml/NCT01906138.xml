        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of primary angle closure (PAC) or primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG)
             with indication for laser peripheral iridotomy (PAC is defined by the presence of a
             partial or complete iridotrabecular contact in more than 2 quadrants with either
             raised intraocular pressure [i.e. more than 21 mmHg] and/or primary adhesion to the
             trabecular meshwork (peripheral anterior synechiae [PAS]; however, with normal optic
             disc and visual field. PACG is defined by the presence of iridotrabecular contact
             with either raised intraocular pressure and/or PAS, and evidence of glaucomatous
             optic disc and visual field)

          -  No intraocular pressure-lowering drug treatment or a 4-week wash-out period prior to
             study day 0 and throughout the study

          -  Aged ≥18 years, of either sex

          -  Not more than 6 diopters spherical equivalent on the study eye

          -  Not more than 2 diopters cylinder equivalent on the study eye

          -  Have given written informed consent, prior to any investigational procedure

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of acute angle closure glaucoma

          -  Secondary angle closure glaucoma

          -  History of ocular surgery within the last 3 months

          -  History of ocular laser treatment, including previous laser peripheral iridotomy

          -  Corneal or conjunctival abnormality precluding contact lens adaptation

          -  Severe dry eye syndrome

          -  Patients with allergy to corneal anesthetic

          -  Patients with contraindications for silicone contact lens wear

          -  Patients not able to understand the character and individual consequences of the
             investigation

          -  Participation in other clinical research within the last 4 weeks
