Fatty liver can increase blood glucose concentrations leading to a prediabetes\n      like state.\n\n      The present study will determine how overweight men respond to the over-consumption of\n      alcohol/food to identify which characteristics might protect some men from fatty liver,\n      while others might be more susceptible to this condition.\n\n      The goal of this work is to determine the direct impact of alcohol/food intake to cause\n      acute fatty liver through the stimulation of de novo lipogenesis in 20 overweight, healthy\n      men.  Understanding individual susceptibility to alcohol-induced fatty liver will aid in the\n      development of strategies designed to help people mitigate these risks.\n\n      Hypothesis is that 5h excess consumption of alcohol and food will increase liver\n      triglycerides by 4% or more, in comparison to fasting state."
