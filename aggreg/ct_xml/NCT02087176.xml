    <textblock>
      This multicentre trial consists of an open-labelled single cohort lead-in (Part A) followed
      by a phase II double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled comparison of AZD1775 (or
      placebo)and an antimitotic agent. Review by a central laboratory of fresh tumour or archival
      tumour samples will be required prior to study entry to assess TP53 mutation status.
      However, subjects will be allowed to enter the single cohort (Part A) regardless of TP53
      mutation status (wild-type or mutant). In addition, patients in the single cohort Part

    <description>The antimitotic is a drug that stops cells from dividing. This leads to cell death. Because cancer cells divide faster than normal cells, they are more likely than normal cells to be affected by this drug.</description>

    <description>Pegfilgrastim is a man-made version of a protein called granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF). This protein is made by cells in the body to stimulate the bone marrow to make more infection-fighting white blood cells.Pegfilgrastim is made by attaching filgrastim to a molecule called polyethylene glycol (PEG). This addition helps it stay in the body longer than filgrastim, which means it can be given less often.</description>
