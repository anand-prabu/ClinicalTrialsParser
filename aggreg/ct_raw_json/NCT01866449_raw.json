In\n           case of i.v. antihistamine other than promethazine is not being available, local\n           practice should be followed.\n\n        -  Corticosteroid (dexamethasone 8mg or equivalent)\n\n        -  H2 antagonist (ranitidine or equivalent).\n\n        -  Antiemetic prophylaxis is recommended and can be given orally or intravenously if\n           necessary.\n\n        -  Primary prophylaxis with Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor (G-CSF) should be\n           considered in patients with high-risk clinical features (age \u226565 years, poor\n           performance status, previous episodes of febrile neutropenia, extensive prior radiation\n           ports, poor nutritional status, or other serious comorbidities) that predispose them to\n           increased complications from prolonged neutropenia as per ASCO and ESMO guidelines."
