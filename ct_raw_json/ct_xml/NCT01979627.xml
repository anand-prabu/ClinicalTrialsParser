  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The transradial approach for coronary angiography and angioplasty is now widely used in
      catheterization laboratories worldwide, which had been shown as advantages over the
      conventional femoral and brachial approaches due to the lower incidence of bleeding and
      other cardiovascular complications. However, the transradial approach does not seem suitable
      for 5-15% of patients undergoing coronary angiography and angioplasty. The ulnar artery
      which is one of the two terminal branches of the brachial artery is usually larger than
      radial artery and it may be as a potential approach for cardiac catheterization. Recently,
      some reports have demonstrated that the transulnar approach may be both feasible and safe
      for coronary angiography and angioplasty in selective patients.we performed this study to
      evaluate the safety and feasibility of transulnar approach coronary catheterization in real
      world non-selective patients.
