The intervention was\n      implemented in parallel in 2 separate groups, by focusing specifically on problem solving\n      strategies and structured psychosis-related information to manage daily life hassles\n      associated with the disease in order to manage crises and prevent relapses.\n\n      Method: The investigators performed a 9-month, randomized, rater-blind clinical trial\n      involving adolescent patients with early onset psychosis and 1 or both of their parents. The\n      primary outcomes were number of hospitalizations, days of hospitalization, and visits to the\n      emergency department. The secondary outcome measures were clinical variables and family\n      environment and well being."
