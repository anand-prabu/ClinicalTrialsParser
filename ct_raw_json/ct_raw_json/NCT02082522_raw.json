            "textblock": "Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a combination of a drug, porfimer sodium (Photofrin), which is\n      activated by a light from a laser that emits no heat.  This technique works to allow the\n      medical doctor to specifically target and destroy abnormal or cancer cells while limiting\n      damage to surrounding healthy tissue.  The activation of the drug is done by lighting the\n      abnormal areas using a fiber optic device (very fine fiber like a fishing line that permits\n      light transmission) inserted into a flexible tube with a light called cholangioscope for the\n      bile duct.  The light will activate the porfimer sodium concentrated in the abnormal tissue,\n      leading to its destruction.\n\n      This research study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of PDT with porfimer sodium\n      administered with Standard Medical Care (SMC) compared to SMC alone on the overall survival\n      time of patients with non-operable advanced cholangiocarcinoma, a rare cancer of the bile\n      ducts.  It will involve 200 patients across North America and Europe.  Other countries may\n      participate if needed.  Participation will last at least 18 months."
