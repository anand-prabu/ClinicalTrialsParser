Drugs used in\n      chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or\n      die. Combining chemotherapy with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells. It is not\n      known whether receiving either radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or observation is more\n      effective for cancer of the bladder.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of radiation therapy,\n      chemotherapy, or observation following tumor surgery in treating patients who have bladder\n      cancer."

Patients are stratified according to\n      center, extent of tumor (single tumor without carcinoma in situ (CIS) vs multiple tumors or\n      CIS), and WHO performance status. Patients with a single tumor and no CIS are randomized to\n      arm I or II. Patients with multiple tumors or CIS are randomized to arm II or III.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients undergo observation only.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients undergo radical radiotherapy 5 days a week for 6 weeks. Patients found\n           to be node positive on CT scan may undergo pelvic irradiation and remain on study.\n\n        -  Arm III: Patients receive intravesical BCG or mitomycin (at the discretion of the\n           physician) weekly for 6-12 weeks.\n\n      Patients on arms I and III are followed at 3 months after randomization. All patients are\n      followed at 6, 9, and 12 months and then annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 200 patients will be accrued for this study."
