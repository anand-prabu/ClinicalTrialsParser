    <textblock>
      To evaluate immunomodulatory effects of perioperative application of omega-3 polyunsaturated
      fatty acids in gastric cancer surgery, the effects of postoperative recovery, the
      improvement of nutritional status, incidence rate of related complications, and whether it
      can reduce the average postoperative hospitalization days.

      Methods: Choose from 6 to 2013-2013-12 gastric cancer patients, according to inclusion
      criteriaS to choose the objectS of study from the gastric cancer patients coming to our
      hospital 2013-06 to 2013-12 .The included patients will be randomly divided into two groups
      A and B, two groups of patients 4 days before operation begin to give parenteral nutrition:
      A: the control group of normal intravenous nutrition. B: the trial group,add Omega-3
      Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids 0.2 g/kg to parenteral nutrition,  no use on the day of surgery,
      postoperative 2 days continue to add Omega-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids 0.2 g/kg. Detect
      and compare  CRP、TNF-α、IL-1、IL-4、lL-6、 IL-8、lL-10 levels of two groups in days before
      parenteral nutrition and applicating 3rd day and postoperative 1st, 3rd, 5th,and detect
      liver function in preoperative and postoperative 2nd,5th,7th day. Record postoperative anal
      exhaust time, postoperative complications, postoperative hospital days, preoperative and
      postoperative body weight.Results: Trail group patients compared with the control
      group,Omega-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids can reduce early postoperative inflammatory
      cytokines release, reduce the postoperative fever time, reduce the incidence of systemic
      inflammatory response syndrome, promote the recovery of gastrointestinal function, improve
      the nutritional state of patients, reduce infection and related complications after the
      surgery and reduce postoperative hospitalization days. Conclusions: Perioperative
      application of omega 3 PUFA  can reduce the release of inflammatory cytokines, regulating
      cell and humoral immunity, reduce the postoperative fever time, reduce the local
      inflammation medium that inhibit the gastrointestinal peristalsis, promote the recovery of
      gastrointestinal function, improve the nutritional state of patients, thereby reducing the
      occurrence of postoperative infection and related complications, reduce postoperative
      hospitalization days.
