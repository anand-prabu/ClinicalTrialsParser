The subjects will be randomized to\n      hypoxia, hyperoxia, or normoxia, and will all undergo experimental human endotoxemia\n      (administration of 2 ng/kg LPS iv).\n\n      In the hypoxia group: the subjects will breathe an individualized mix of nitrogen and room\n      air for 3.5 hours using an air-tight respiratory helmet. The gas mixture will be adjusted to\n      achieve a saturation of 80-85%. In the hyperoxia group, subjects will breathe 100% oxygen\n      for 3.5 hours using the same respiratory helmet. In the normoxia group, subjects will\n      breathe room air (21% oxygen, 79% nitrogen) also wearing the respiratory helmet. 1 hour\n      after oxygen status adjustment (t=0), all subject will be administered an intravenous bolus\n      (2ng/kg) of LPS derived from E coli O:113. 2.5 hours after LPS administration, the helmets\n      will be removed and all subjects will breathe ambient room air.\n\n      The primary study endpoint is the difference in plasma cytokines between the hypoxia and\n      normoxia group, and between the hyperoxia and normoxia group. Secondary objectives include\n      HIF-1\u03b1 protein and mRNA, aHIF mRNA expression in circulating leukocytes, measures of ROS,\n      leukocyte phagocytosis, and cytokine production by leukocytes stimulated ex vivo with\n      various inflammatory stimuli, and measurement of basic hemodynamic and ventilatory\n      parameters and temperature."
