  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, appropriate patients undergo MRI imaging with immobilization and sequences
      optimized for diagnostic radiology purposes.  Using a mutual information algorithm, these
      images are then registered to a treatment planning CT obtained with custom immobilization to
      minimize intra-and inter-treatment motion and positional variation.  This image registration
      process is time-consuming and introduces additional layers of geometric uncertainty into
      what should be a highly precise treatment planning process.  However, it is necessary, since
      radiation dose calculations cannot be performed on MRI data due to the lack of crucial
      density information.  Ultimately, we envision CT-less treatment planning, using only MRI,
      due to superior imaging characteristics, fully integrated into the radiation oncology
      clinic.  This study will begin this process.
