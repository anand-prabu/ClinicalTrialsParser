Based on the interim\n      analysis, the study plans to adapt limited aspects of the design including: 1) to drop\n      ineffective treatment arm/arms; 2) to reassess sample size based on the interim analysis\n      results.\n\n      This multi-centre trial will be conducted in North America and Europe. The overall time to\n      participate in this study is up to 14 weeks. Participants will make 8 visits to the clinic,\n      and will be contacted by telephone 30 days after last dose of study drug for a follow-up\n      assessment."
