All patients receive 2 separate operations in\n      which the substantia nigra from either 4 fetuses (Group A) or 1 fetus (Group C) is implanted\n      into the striatum of each side.\n\n      Group B patients receive 2 separate placebo operations without fetal transplantation.\n\n      The second surgical procedure begins approximately 1 week after the first operation.\n\n      After 2 years, treatments are compared.  If transplant is shown to benefit Parkinson's\n      disease, then patients who received placebo operation will be offered transplant surgery in\n      the final year of the study."
