  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypertension and diabetes are major risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. Although these
      two conditions can be detected much early in life and are amenable to interventions at
      primary health care level, the health system in India fails to provide adequate
      interventions at primary health care level which translates to huge burden of undiagnosed
      and uncontrolled hypertension and diabetes in the community. This study aims to design a
      feasible and sustainable evidence-based, decision support-enabled, health care delivery
      model for the management of hypertension and diabetes in the primary health care facilities
      of Himachal Pradesh. The study will be conducted at the 5 Community Health Centers (CHCs)
      and District Hospital of Solan District, Himachal Pradesh using both qualitative and
      quantitative methods. The design and development of the model will be carried out in the
      initial six months followed by piloting the services at the CHCs and District Hospital. The
      impact of the model on quality of care will be assessed in a pre-post design measuring
      changes in both clinical and process indicators.

    <description>The study focus on preliminary work before a definitive randomised controlled trial. In this phase, we are developing an intervention for the evidence based management of hypertension and diabetes at primary care setting in India.
The components of the interventions that we are developing are:
A structured training of the health care staff for identifying people at risk of developing diabetes or hypertension
Treating patients as per a standard clinical guidelines
Giving health education to patients on lifestyle changes for better self-care
Optimizing the care pathways at the health facilities to enable better delivery of the intervention and
Development and implementation of a smartphone based decision support system (DSS) with inbuilt diagnostic and treatment algorithm</description>
