This study tends to explore whether or not an acute bout of exercise can affect the\n      neural response to food cues in adolescents, obese or lean."

This\n      computer task consists in visual recognition of rare pictures compared to frequent ones\n      (oddball method). at 1215  they will be offered ad libitum meals. At regular intervals\n      through the day, their appetite feelings will be assessed using Visual analogue scales.\n\n      Ad libitum energy consumption will be assessed by investigators and recorded for each\n      participants."
