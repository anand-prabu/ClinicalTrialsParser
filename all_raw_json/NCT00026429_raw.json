Determine the safety of this\n      drug in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive denileukin diftitox IV over 30-60\n      minutes on days 1-5. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or\n      unacceptable toxicity. Patients may receive up to 2 additional courses after achieving\n      complete response. Patients are followed every 3 months until they have progressed or for 2\n      years from date of termination.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 58 patients (29 with low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL)\n      and 29 with intermediate-grade NHL) will be accrued for this study within 12 months. The\n      study may be stopped after accrual of 20 patients (10 with low-grade NHL and 10 with\n      intermediate-grade NHL) if observed response rate is less than 1 in 10 for each stratum."
