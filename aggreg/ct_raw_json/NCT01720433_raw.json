This prospective, double-blind, randomized controlled\n      trial attempts to reduce post-operative pain in patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery by\n      implementing a simple intra-operative technique.\n\n      Patients who undergo elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy for gallbladder disease or\n      laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair will be recruited to the trial. Patients will be\n      randomized to either the current standard (control group) or to receive an intervention to\n      remove residual CO2. In the intervention group the pneumo-peritoneum will be removed, at the\n      end of the operation, by placing the patient in the Trendelenburg position and utilising a\n      pulmonary recruitment maneuver consisting of two manual inflations to a maximum pressure of\n      60 cm H2O. In the control group residual pneumo-peritoneum will be evacuated at the end of\n      the procedure by passive decompression via the open operative ports."

This study was\n             approved by the local ethics committee  (National Research Ethics Service REC ref:\n             09/H0405/65) and informed consent was obtained from all patients after they had the\n             opportunity to study information leaflets that were also given to them. The trial was\n             designed as a prospectively randomized and double blind trial with a 1:1\n             (control:intervention) allocation.\n\n        The inclusion criteria was all adults with an American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA)\n        physical status grade 1 or 2, who were undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy\n        for gallbladder disease or laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair performed as a\n        transabdominal preperitoneal procedure (TAP). All procedures and data collection occurred\n        at a District General Hospital.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n        The pre-operative exclusion criteria included patients younger than 18 years, those who\n        refused to give consent, those that had an inability to understand the research\n        questionnaire and pregnancy. Patients who were found to require additional procedures, for\n        example a conversion to open surgery, were excluded from the study prior to randomization.\n\n        -"
