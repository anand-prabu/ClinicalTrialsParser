  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is controversy about the effectiveness of interventions based on spirometry for
      smoking cessation.

      The investigators want to evaluate the effectiveness of motivational intervention performed
      by a doctor to obtain abstinence compared with normal practice in primary care.

      This study, is the second half of what was began with ESPITAP study

  <detailed_description>

      Design: Multicentric randomized clinical trial with two groups. Setting:  20 primary care
      centers inTarragona. Subjects: 1100 active smokers (consumption&gt;10 packs/year) aged 35-70,
      seeking medical advice for any reason, with no exclusion criteria, will be randomized to
      receive the intervention or not.

      Intervention: A 20-minutes visit with details of the spirometry data (values of respiratory
      capacity and volumes referring on the theoretical). The lung age index will be reported
      compared to chronological age to illustrate lung damage suffered as a result of tobacco
      consumption.

      Measurements: Basal Spirometry. Structured questionnaire interviewed in the center at 0 and
      12 months and telephone interview at 3 and 6 months. At 12 months, patients who stopped
      smoking will perform a CO test and if the CO exhaled will be &lt;10ppm abstinence will be
      verified by determination of urinary cotinine.

      Primary endpoint: Cessation of tobacco consumption at 12 months. Analysis: Data will be
      analyzed in the &quot;intent to treat&quot;, the unit of analysis will be the smoker.

      Expected Results: smoking cessation in the intervention group will exceed at least 5% the
      achieved by normal practice in primary care.
