  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is defined as &quot;any degree of glucose intolerance with
      onset or first recognition during pregnancy.&quot;  GDM is one of the most frequent metabolic
      disorders occurring during pregnancy.  Approximately 7% of all pregnancies in the United
      States are complicated by gestational diabetes resulting in more than 200,000 cases
      annually.   There is epidemiologic evidence associating GDM with insulin resistance, glucose
      intolerance, and type 2 diabetes (DM2).   Among all the risk factors of diabetes mellitus,
      the experience of gestational diabetes is the strongest one.   Systematic reviews of older
      studies conclude that 35-60% women with gestational diabetes will develop type 2 diabetes at
      rates much greater than control groups who did not have glucose intolerance during
      pregnancy. Studies are needed for optimal postpartum and long-term health of women who have
      had GDM.  Recent evidence suggests that incretin-based therapies may be useful for the
      treatment of DM2 because continuous administration of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1)
      produces substantial improvements in glucose control and ß-cell function in subjects with
      DM2. Inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) increases the concentration of GLP-1 and
      may potentially delay disease progression in GDM considering the ß-cell function improvement
      in DM2 and ß-cell mass shown to increase in animal models.  This study will examine if
      combination sitagliptin (a DPP-4 inhibitor)-plus metformin is more effective than metformin
      alone or placebo in improving metabolic parameters, specifically the impact on β-cell
      function, in prior GDM women with glucose abnormalities.

      Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is defined as &quot;any degree of glucose intolerance with
      onset or first recognition during pregnancy.&quot;  GDM is one of the most frequent metabolic
      disorders occurring during pregnancy.  Approximately 7% of all pregnancies in the United
      States are complicated by gestational diabetes resulting in more than 200,000 cases
      annually.   There is epidemiologic evidence associating GDM with insulin resistance, glucose
      intolerance, and type 2 diabetes (DM2). Among all the risk factors of diabetes mellitus, the
      experience of gestational diabetes is the strongest one.

      Gestational diabetes is often the culmination of years of unrecognized and unmodified
      diabetes risk factors that lead to overt and occult clinical manifestations during
      pregnancy.  Systematic reviews of older studies conclude that 35-60% women with gestational
      diabetes will develop type 2 diabetes at rates much greater than control groups who did not
      have glucose intolerance during pregnancy. The higher rates were in studies of particular
      ethnic groups in the U.S.   Presently, in the literature, there are described new, more
      efficient methods of diabetes prevention in groups with a high risk of this disorder, which
      involve both, lifestyle modification and pharmacological therapies.  Lifestyle intervention
      was found to reduce the incidence of type 2 diabetes by 58% and metformin by 31% as compared
      with placebo. Studies are needed for optimal postpartum and long-term health of women who
      have had GDM.  Considerable recent evidence suggests that incretin-based therapies may be
      useful for the treatment of DM2 because continuous administration of glucagon-like peptide 1
      (GLP-1) produces substantial improvements in glucose control and ß-cell function in subjects
      with type 2 diabetes.  Inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) increases the
      concentration of GLP-1 and may potentially delay disease progression in GDM considering the
      ß-cell function improvement in DM2 and ß-cell mass shown to increase in animal models.  This
      study will examine if combination sitagliptin-plus metformin is more effective than
      metformin alone or placebo in improving metabolic parameters, specifically the impact on
      β-cell function, in at-risk women with a recent history of GDM.
