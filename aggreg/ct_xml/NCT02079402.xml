      The purpose of this trial is to o assess feasibility of a protocol comparing conservative
      (trigger guided) vs. liberal (target guided) approach to fluid resuscitation in patients
      with septic shock after initial fluid resuscitation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fluid resuscitation is a key intervention in treatment of sepsis, but exact indications for
      fluid and amount of fluid administered is not established. Current guidelines for fluid
      therapy beyond 6 hours are vague and ungraded and most observational studies suggest harm
      with increasing positive fluid balance.

      Objective To assess feasibility of a protocol comparing a conservative (trigger guided) vs.
      liberal (target guided) approach to fluid resuscitation in patients with septic shock after
      initial fluid resuscitation.

      Design Multicentre, parallel group, centrally randomised, open label trial with adequate
      generation of allocation sequence, and adequate allocation concealment.

      Sample size 150 included patients we will be needed to show a 1.7 L difference in fluid
      volumes between the groups based on the mean volume of resuscitation fluid given within
      first 5 days observed in the 6S trial of 5.3 L (SD 3.7 L) with a maximal type 1 and 2 error
      of 5% and 20% (power=80%), respectively.

      Funding The trial is publicly funded by the Danish Council for Strategic Research

Fluid boluses may be given as long as hemodynamic variables improve (dynamic or static variable(s) of choice). A fluid bolus is to be followed by evaluation of effect 30 minutes after the intervention at the latest.
'Variable(s) of choice' refers to the variable(s) used to assess hemodynamic improvement.
Only isotonic crystalloids are to be given as resuscitation fluid; the type of isotonic crystalloid is free of choice.</description>

Plasma lactate concentration ≥ 4 mmol/l at point-of-care testing.
Severe hypotension (MAP &lt; 50mmHg).
Mottling beyond edge of kneecap.
Severe oliguria (only in the first 2 hours after randomisation).
