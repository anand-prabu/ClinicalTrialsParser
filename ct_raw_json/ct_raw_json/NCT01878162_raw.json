The\n      effectiveness of exercise-based work injury prevention programs (WIPPs) to reduce the risk\n      and costs associated with occupational injury has yet to be tested rigorously in LEOs.  The\n      accuracy of existing field tests of physical functioning to predict occupational injuries\n      and related expenses remains unclear.  The objectives of this study are to: (i) determine\n      the effect of an exercise-based WIPP on occupational wellness and productivity in a cohort\n      of LEOs, and (ii) to determine the accuracy of 2 common field assessments of physical\n      function to predict lost work productivity and related expenses in a cohort of LEOs."

As a triage tool, FMS is used to determine regions that require additional clinical investigation.  The FMS is a battery of 7 tests that are intended as an integrated assessment for limitations in range of motion, weakness, and incoordination.  FMS tests consider spine, upper extremity, and lower extremity movements in the context of their respective regional kinetic chain.  Component tests of the FMS involve rating of performance by a standardized examiner on a 3-point scale, and specific criteria exist for each rating.  A composite score for the FMS may be calculated by summing the item scores.",
