  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to determine if quantitative analysis of fetal Fibronectin (fFN) can
      be used to advance prediction of spontaneous preterm birth (sPTB). This will be a
      prospective observational multi-center study with approximately 15 to 20 US sites, and
      approximately 1210 subjects evaluating the clinical utility of the Rapid fFN 10Q system for
      preterm birth risk assessment. A single fFN specimen will be collected from each subject
      between 16 weeks, 0 days and 21 weeks, 6 days. The primary and secondary maternal outcome
      measures will be determined based on the date of delivery and the estimated date of
      confinement (EDC), which will be evaluated in a standardized manner.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hologic has developed a quantitative test to assess the amount of fetal fibronectin (fFN)
      present in cervicovaginal secretions, and evaluate the clinical utility of the test in
      assessing spontaneous Pre-Term Bith risk in a high risk population. Identifying women at
      high risk of giving birth prematurely can be challenging. It is believed that higher levels
      of fFn measured in vaginal fluid suggest a woman is at a greater risk for delivering early.
      fFN testing is already approved for use in women from weeks 22 to 35 of pregnancy.  The goal
      of this study is to evaluate the benefits of collecting fFN measurements from a vaginal
      fluid specimen taken during early pregnancy (from 16 weeks to 22 weeks) to assess the risk
      of pre-term birth.
