The causes of these late adverse\n      neurologic outcomes are multifactoral and include both fixed (or patient-specific factors)\n      and modifiable factors. They relate to both the mechanism of CNS injury associated with\n      congenital heart disease and its treatment. Measuring cerebral oxygenation is a promising\n      non-invasive way of cerebral monitoring in a neonatal intensive care unit. The importance of\n      cerebral monitoring in neonates with congenital heart problems at risk of developing\n      neurological complications is increasingly recognized. In this way the most vulnerable\n      moments for the newborn brain can be detected and ,if possible, lead to change in (timing\n      of) treatment."
