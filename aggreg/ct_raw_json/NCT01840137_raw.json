Ultimately, such work may lead to novel\n           clinical approaches to optimize patients for surgery.\n\n      The investigators will study the effects of preoperative exercise training on cystectomy\n      patients, specifically targeting increasing functional capacity and muscular strength.\n      Prior to conducting a more extensive, multi-center, randomized-controlled trial, the\n      feasibility, safety, and initial efficacy of preoperative exercise in cystectomy patients\n      must be determined.  To address this issue, the investigators will complete a trial of\n      rehabilitation in cystectomy patients at the University of Michigan."
