    <textblock>
      This study is to examine the hypothesis that administration of RDEA3170 to Japanese patients
      with gout or asymptomatic hyperuricemia in doses of 5 mg, 7.5 mg, 10 mg, 12.5 mg and 15 mg
      once daily, respectively will result in greater reduction of sUA compared to placebo.
