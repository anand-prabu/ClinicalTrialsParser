To determine whether eribulin (eribulin mesylate) therapy increases the disease control\n      rate at 4 months to at least 42% in patients with recurrent osteosarcoma or demonstrates a\n      Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) response rate of at least 22%.\n\n      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. To investigate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of eribulin in subjects with recurrent\n      osteosarcoma.\n\n      II. To further describe the tolerability of single agent eribulin.\n\n      OUTLINE:\n\n      Patients receive eribulin mesylate intravenously (IV) over 2-5 minutes on days 1 and 8.\n      Courses repeat every 21 days for up to 24 months in the absence of disease progression or\n      unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up annually for 5 years."
