If a bone marrow biopsy is also performed prior to study\n      treatment or at any time during treatment, a sample will be sent for analysis.  Normal PBMC\n      (and bone marrow when it is obtained) will be examined for changes in key targets related to\n      the inhibition of PDE4 and potential reversal of glucocorticoid resistance.  Biomarker blood\n      samples will be analyzed in order to characterize the pharmacodynamics of roflumilast alone\n      and in combination with prednisone on PDE4 activity and on biomarkers, such as phospho-AKT,\n      phosphorylation levels of mTOR targets."
