Splenectomy can significantly\n      reduce transfusion requirement in thalassemia patients, but it is associated with an\n      increased risk of serious complications such as sepsis and thrombosis. Preliminary\n      preclinical and clinical data suggest that JAK2 inhibition, by reducing spleen size, may\n      improve hemoglobin levels, thereby eliminating the need for splenectomy and reducing\n      transfusion requirement and related iron overload."
