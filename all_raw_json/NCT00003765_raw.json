Determine the maximum tolerated dose and the dose limiting toxicity of carmustine\n      administered after O6-benzylguanine in children with refractory primary CNS tumors.\n\n      II. Determine a safe and tolerable dose of carmustine administered after O6-benzylguanine to\n      be used in phase II studies.\n\n      III. Determine the pharmacokinetics of O6-benzylguanine and its metabolite,\n      O6-benzyl-8-oxoguanine, in these patients.\n\n      IV. Seek preliminary evidence of antitumor activity of this regimen in these patients.\n\n      V. Evaluate the acute and chronic toxicities, and describe cumulative toxicity, in patients\n      treated with multiple courses of this regimen.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of carmustine.\n\n      Patients receive O6-benzylguanine IV over 1 hour, then, 1 hour later, carmustine IV is\n      administered over 1 hour. Treatment is repeated every 6 weeks for up to 1 year in the\n      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
