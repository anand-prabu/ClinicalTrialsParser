Three hundred thirty patients with ALS\n      from 20 medical centers participated in this double blind, placebo-controlled two-year\n      study. Half the patients received IGF-1 and the other half received placebo. The drug will\n      be administered twice a day.\n\n      ALS is a neurodegenerative disorder that causes progressive muscle weakness and loss of\n      motor neurons. IGF-1 is a neurotrophic factor essential for normal development of the\n      nervous system and shows protection of motor neurons in animal models and cell culture\n      systems. It is thought to block cell death pathways and promote muscle re-innervation and\n      axonal growth and regeneration."
