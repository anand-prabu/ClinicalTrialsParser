            "textblock": "The incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is increasing rapidly.  The combination of\n      T2DM and smoking is particularly lethal, as smokers with T2DM are significantly more likely\n      to develop a number of health related complications.  Community-based diabetes education\n      programs (DEPs) have been developed to support patient self-care behaviours (e.g. adherence\n      to oral medications, insulin therapy, nutrition management, regular blood glucose\n      monitoring, and physical activity); however, specific assistance for smoking cessation is\n      rarely provided.  Our investigative team has developed a knowledge transfer and practice\n      change process to introduce evidence-based interventions for smoking cessation into clinical\n      practice settings.  This process is known as the Ottawa Model for Smoking Cessation (OMSC).\n      Investigators believe there is an opportunity to use the OMSC intervention to dramatically\n      enhance the effectiveness of DEPs in addressing smoking cessation among smokers with T2DM,\n      and in so doing, improve quit rates in this high risk population.\n\n      The purpose of this project is to evaluate the effectiveness of the Ottawa Model for Smoking\n      Cessation (OMSC) intervention in multiple diabetes education programs (DEPs) in Ontario.\n      Investigators are surveying smokers who attend this clinic before and after implementing the\n      new program.  Investigators want to test the impact of the OMSC intervention on quit rates\n      among smokers with diabetes and pre-diabetes referred to these programs.\n\n      Investigators will conduct a matched-pair cluster design trial at 18 DEPs in Ontario.  These\n      sites will be matched based on baseline rates of assistance with smoking cessation at each\n      clinic.  Within each pair, sites will be allocated randomly to either OMSC intervention or\n      control groups.  In total, 2,520 participants will enroll in the study at one of the\n      eighteen DEPs selected within the Champlain, Toronto Central, or Mississauga-Hamilton Local\n      Health Integration Network.  From each participating DEP, a \"before\" and \"after\" sample of\n      70 smokers will be recruited to assess smoking cessation outcomes.  Over a three-month\n      period between the before and after samples, strategies to implement the OMSC will be\n      carried out at the intervention sites.  The primary outcome will be the\n      biochemically-validated 7-day point prevalence abstinence rate six months after an index\n      visit to the DEP. Secondary outcomes will include: rates of identification and intervention\n      of smokers, and diabetes educators' attitudes, confidence, and perceptions of barriers and\n      facilitators to implementing smoking cessation support as part of routine care.\n\n      If proven effective, the OMSC is appropriate for implementation in DEPs across Canada and\n      could have profound impacts on patient and community health."
