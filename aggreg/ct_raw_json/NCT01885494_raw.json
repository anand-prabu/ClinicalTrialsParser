This is offered to patients who received PD01A\n      vaccinations but also to the patients who served as controls in AFF008. Thus, AFF008E will\n      ensure standardized and controlled management of individuals who have received PD01A as part\n      of AFF008, the Phase I study analyzing for the first time in humans this first in class\n      candidate."
