      The purpose of ZA-302 is to determine the effects of Androxal on morning testosterone and
      reproductive status in younger overweight men with acquired hypogonadotropic hypogonadism
      (confirmed morning T&lt;300 ng/dL) and normal sperm concentration, compared to changes with
      placebo.  Subjects must not have previously been treated with testosterone products within
      the last 6 months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Protocol ZA-302 is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multi-center Phase 3 study
      to evaluate normalization of morning testosterone levels in overweight men with acquired
      hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and normal baseline sperm concentrations.  The study requires
      10 to 12 clinic visits (2 for eye exams), and is approximately 4 to 5½ months in duration.
      Subjects will be treated for 12-18 weeks.  At Visit 3 (Week 6) subjects who do not achieve
      morning T values ≥300 ng/dL will be up-titrated to 25 mg.  Placebo subjects may be sham
      titrated.  Up-titrated subjects will receive an additional 6 weeks of treatment (18 weeks
      total).  A schedule of procedures and assessments is displayed in Section 4.  The study will
      enroll up to 152 male subjects, up to 114 randomized to treatment with Androxal and up to 38
      randomized to placebo, in a 3:1 ratio.  Subjects must not have used any prior testosterone
      treatments within the last 6 months.

      Eligible subjects must have 2 consecutive assessments of morning T below 300 ng/dL and LH
      below 9.4 mIU/mL.  They will provide 2 sperm samples at baseline, at least 2 days apart,
      another 2 after 12 weeks of treatment, and up-titrated subjects will provide an additional 2
      samples at the end of treatment.  After 12 weeks of treatment (V5) all subjects will undergo
      serial T assessment for determination of the Cavg.  Safety assessments will include
      collection of adverse events, eye examinations, physical examinations and clinical
      laboratory assessments.
