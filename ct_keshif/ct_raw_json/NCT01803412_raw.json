The Purpose of\n      this study is to evaluate the effects of long-term administration of drisapersen in US male\n      subjects with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD), who have previously participated in one of\n      the following eligible studies of drisapersen: DMD114876, DMD114044 and DMD114349. This\n      study does not have a minimum duration of participation. The study participation time of the\n      subjects will vary depending on when they enter from one of the eligible studies, and will\n      be permitted to continue the study until such a time that they withdraw based on\n      protocol-defined criteria or GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) stops the study. Subjects will receive\n      drisapersen 6 milligrams (mg)/kilogram (kg) as Subcutaneous (SC) injection(s) once a week\n      (wk), continuously throughout their duration of participation. For subjects who cannot\n      continue on 6 mg/kg/wk for safety and/or tolerability reasons, but who may benefit from\n      drisapersen, an alternate intermittent dosing will be given as a regimen of 6 mg/kg/wk for 8\n      weeks followed by 4 weeks off treatment. Subjects withdrawing from this study but who do not\n      withdraw consent, will be followed up for safety and progress as clinically indicated, for\n      at least 20 weeks after the last dose of study treatment, after which a follow-up telephone\n      call will be conducted. If subjects withdraw, they will not be replaced."
