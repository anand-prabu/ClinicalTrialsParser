  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treatment with statins has a class I indication after percutaneous coronary intervention
      (PCI), but is often discontinued by patients due to side effects.

      Pharmacologic alternatives shown to be useful after PCI include ezetimibe and nutraceuticals
      (i.e. compounds derived from foods with cholesterol lowering actions).

      It remains unknown, however, which of these two therapeutic approaches is more effective
      after PCI.

      The primary objective of this study is to compare the efficacy and tolerability of ezetimibe
      vs. a nutraceutical-based protocol in statin-intolerant patients treated with percutaneous
      coronary intervention.

      Background

      Treatment with statins has a class I indication after percutaneous coronary intervention
      (PCI), but is often discontinued by patients due to side effects.

      Pharmacologic alternatives shown to be useful after PCI include ezetimibe and nutraceuticals
      (i.e. compounds derived from foods with cholesterol lowering actions).

      It remains unknown, however, which of these two therapeutic approaches is more effective
      after PCI.

      Purpose

      The primary objective of this study is to compare the efficacy and tolerability of ezetimibe
      vs. a nutraceutical-based protocol in statin-intolerant patients treated with percutaneous
      coronary intervention.

      Study Population

      Patients with coronary artery disease in stable conditions treated with percutaneous
      coronary intervention who have withdrawn statin treatment due to side effects

      Randomization

      Patients will be randomized to receive for 6 months either ezetimibe (10 mg/day) or a
      commercially available nutraceutical combined pill (1 capsule/day containing monacolin K 10
      mg, policosanol 10 mg, and phytosterols 300 mg).
