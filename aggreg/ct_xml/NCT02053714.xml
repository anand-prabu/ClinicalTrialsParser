  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Persons with severe mental illness are at great risk for developing type 2 diabetes (T2DM).
      Unfortunately, persons with mental illness and T2DM are less likely to receive recommended
      diabetes monitoring and are more likely to have poorly controlled diabetes, which leads to
      microvascular and macrovascular complications later in life. Evidence-based diabetes
      self-management education and support interventions have yet to be adapted for persons with
      mental illness and there have been no randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to examine their
      feasibility and efficacy. The purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility of
      conducting a RCT of a diabetes self-management intervention for persons with severe mental
      illness and T2DM.
