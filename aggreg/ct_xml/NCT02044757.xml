    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study to investigate the addictive properties of soda and other sugar
      sweetened beverages (SBBs) in teenagers aged 13-18 years. It is hypothesized that
      participants who were regularly consuming sweetened and caffeinated beverages will
      experience symptoms typical of caffeine withdrawal, such as headache and fatigue, during the
      SSB withdrawal period.

    <description>Symptoms of withdrawal during the SSB withdrawal period (days 6-8) will be compared to symptoms of withdrawal during usual consumption period (days 1-3). Three measures are used to assess withdrawal symptoms: Griffiths' withdrawal scale, the relative reinforcing value of soda, and daily check in questions on well-being.</description>
