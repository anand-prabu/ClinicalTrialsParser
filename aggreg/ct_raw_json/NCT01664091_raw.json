The investigators also\n      want to know if it is easier to give the radiation with this type of reconstruction than\n      with other kinds of reconstruction procedures.  The reconstruction procedure involves the\n      temporary use of a tissue expander and an acellular dermal matrix (ADM)."

The\n           only difference between being on the study and not being on the study is that the\n           research team will analyze the records of those who participate to see how easy it was\n           to give the radiation, how good the cosmetic outcome of the reconstruction is and what,\n           if any, complications occured.\n\n        -  A minimum of 6 weeks between the surgery and the start of radiation therapy is required\n           to allow for adequate healing.  Often this interval will be longer, as many patients\n           will receive chemotherapy in the interim. There is no maximum time from surgery to\n           radiation.\n\n        -  Around the time of radiation planning, the radiation oncologist and plastic surgeon\n           will agree upon how much deflation of the tissue expander will be required to permit\n           simulation of the radiation therapy.\n\n        -  Radiation therapy to the chest wall (with or without adjacent lymph nodes) will be\n           given once daily Monday through Friday over 5-7 weeks.\n\n        -  After the completion of the radiation therapy, the tissue expander will be re-expanded\n           and eventually replaced by the permanent implant or flap reconstruction at the\n           discretion of the plastic surgeon.\n\n        -  Participants will be expected to return to the Radiation Oncology Clinic for follow-up\n           visits 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after the end of the radiation therapy.  Evaluation of\n           cosmetic results and complications will be done at these visits using a recognized\n           scoring system and photographs taken at each time point and scored for specific items\n           (necrosis, telangiectasia, etc)."
