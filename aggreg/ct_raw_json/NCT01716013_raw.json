Overall, eligible subjects will be randomized in\n      a pre-defined 2:1 ratio to BondEase\u2122 skin adhesive or CWCD.\n\n      In Part 1 of the study 30 subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio (BondEase\u2122 : CWCD).\n      This part of the study is designed to assess the feasibility and validate use of the device.\n      Pediatric subjects younger than age 18 will not be included in this part of the trial. The\n      results from these 30 subjects will be compiled and submitted to FDA for review and approval\n      prior to proceeding with Part 2. Part 2 of the study will only be initiated after FDA\n      indicates it is acceptable to begin. In Part 2 of the study a total of 123 subjects will be\n      randomized, of which 82 subjects will be randomized to the BondEase\u2122 group and 41 subjects\n      to the CWCD group. This will result in 102 subjects in the BondEase\u2122 group and 51 subjects\n      in the CWCD group across the both parts of the trial."
