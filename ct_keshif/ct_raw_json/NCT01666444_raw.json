Experimental data obtained in an animal model of ovarian cancer\n      supports the combination of VTX-2337 with PLD. In this model, the combination of VTX-2337\n      and PLD resulted in a significant reduction in tumor growth compared to either agent alone\n      and an increase in the number of T lymphocytes infiltrating the tumor. The combination of\n      PLD and VTX-2337 has been tested in a small number of women with ovarian cancer in a Phase\n      1b study and appears to be generally well-tolerated."
