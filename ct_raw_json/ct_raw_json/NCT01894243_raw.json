History\n        or presence of hepatic disease known to interfere with the absorption, distribution,\n        metabolism or excretion of olaparib.  In addition to exclusion criteria 1 to 18, patients\n        with mild or moderate hepatic impairment should not enter the study if the following\n        exclusion criteria are fulfilled: 20.

Fluctuating or rapidly deteriorating hepatic function as indicated by widely varying\n        or worsening of clinical and/or laboratory signs of hepatic impairment within the\n        screening period (eg, advanced ascites, fever, active gastrointestinal bleeding).\n\n        22. Change in dose regimen of medically required medication within the last 2 weeks before\n        screening and/or the use of disallowed co-medication in the 3 weeks prior to admission to\n        the clinic.\n\n        23. Presence of acute liver disease caused by drug toxicity or by an infection. 24. Severe\n        portal hypertension or surgical porto-systemic shunts. 25.
