Patients who have an ileostomy or colostomy created will\n      be excluded.  Patients enrolled in the study will be randomized to one of three groups:\n      nicotine gum, regular gum, or no gum.  Patients randomized to nicotine gum or regular gum\n      will chew the gum three times a day for 1 week.  The main outcome measure is time to first\n      bowel movement or flatus."
