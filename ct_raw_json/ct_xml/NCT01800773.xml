  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although evidence-based treatments for PTSD exist, a significant minority of individuals do
      not benefit from these treatments and many individuals to not seek treatment, citing
      barriers such as time commitment and expense of treatment. The goal of the proposed study is
      to establish an alternative PTSD treatment that is effective and efficient.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prior research has demonstrated that written exposure therapy (WET), is an efficient,
      well-tolerated, and efficacious treatment for PTSD. The proposed project takes the next step
      in establishing WET as an intervention for PTSD by examining whether WET is equally
      efficacious to an evidence-based treatment for PTSD.  Using a randomized noninferiority
      controlled trial, 126 adults diagnosed with PTSD will be assigned to either WET or Cognitive
      Processing Therapy (CPT). Outcome data will be collected at baseline and 6-, 12-, 18-, 24
      and 60-weeks post-baseline. The primary aim is to examine whether PTSD participants assigned
      to WET demonstrate PTSD symptom severity outcome that is noninferior to PTSD participants
      assigned to CPT. Secondary aims include examining whether expected treatment gains are
      sustained for both treatments and whether WET has a lower treatment dropout rate relative to
      CPT.  Exploratory aims include examining moderators and mediators of WET and CPT.  If the
      hypothesis that WET is noninferior to CPT is confirmed then a brief treatment option for
      PTSD will be established.
