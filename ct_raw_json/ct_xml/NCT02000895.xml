      Infants born preterm and of low birth weight are known to be at increased risk for early
      onset of cardiovascular and renal disease in adult life. This has been related to low
      nephron mass due to inadequate or early termination of glomerulogenesis in utero and during
      the perinatal period. Risks for subsequent development of hypertension and kidney disease
      include proteinuria, excessive weight gain during early life with insulin resistance and
      supplemental high calorie feedings. The long-term goal is for early diagnosis of those
      infants who are at risk for future development of hypertension and kidney disease so that
      the investigators might intervene to potentially avert progression to adult disease. The
      objective of this clinical trial is to acquire data on the natural history of neonatal
      kidney function and size in infants born preterm during the first 2 years of life. This will
      be done through the use of standard serum and urine markers as well as non-invasive
      ultrasound technology. The central hypothesis of this clinical trial is that a subgroup of
      patients born preterm and of low birth weight will demonstrate early markers of kidney
      injury including elevated serum cystatin C, proteinuria and low kidney size. This hypothesis
      has been formulated on the basis of preliminary data from our group studying this question
      retrospectively in older children born prematurely who have developed overt kidney disease.
      The rationale for the proposed research is to develop early serum and demographic markers of
      pre-clinical kidney disease so that early intervention can occur. The proposed clinical
      trial is innovative because it will investigate the risk factors for kidney dysfunction at a
      pre-clinical stage with the idea of gaining more knowledge regarding therapeutic
      interventions. In addition, the study will assess serum cystatin C as a surrogate test for
      glomerular filtration rate which could indicate worsening kidney function at an earlier
      stage than serum creatinine.

      The proposed research is significant because it is expected to identify at-risk patients for
      future renal impairment and to prospectively monitor the persistence of proteinuria and its
      effect on kidney function in the short term.

      Objectives and Hypotheses:

      Infants born preterm and of low birth weight are known to be at increased risk for early
      onset of cardiovascular and renal disease in later life. This has been related to low
      nephron mass due to inadequate or early termination of glomerulogenesis in utero and during
      the perinatal period. Risks for subsequent development of hypertension and kidney disease
      include excessive weight gain during early life with insulin resistance and supplemental
      high calorie feedings.

      Specific Aims The long-term goal is for early diagnosis of those infants who are at risk for
      future development of hypertension and kidney disease so that investigators might intervene
      to potentially avert progression to adult disease. The objective of this clinical trial is
      to acquire data on the natural history of neonatal kidney function and size in infants born
      preterm during the first year of life. This will be done through the use of standard serum
      and urine markers as well as non-invasive ultrasound technology. The central hypothesis of
      this clinical trial is that a subgroup of patients born preterm will demonstrate early
      markers of kidney injury including elevated serum cystatin C, proteinuria and hypertension.
      This hypothesis has been formulated on the basis of preliminary data from the group studying
      this question retrospectively in older children born prematurely who have developed overt
      kidney disease. The rationale for the proposed research is to develop early serum and
      demographic markers of pre-clinical kidney disease so that early intervention may occur.

      The investigators expect to test the central hypothesis and to achieve the objectives of
      this application by pursuing the following 3 specific aims:

        1. Identify risk factors associated with proteinuria, microalbuminuria, hypertension and
           kidney function in preterm infants.

             1. Intra-uterine and perinatal factors: Based on preliminary data, the working
                hypothesis is that infants born preterm have a nephron deficit that predisposes
                them to hypertension and subclinial and clinical kidney disease during their
                lifetimes that may have origins in the perinatal period.

             2. Acquired factors: The investigators postulate that early perinatal stressors and
                exposures such as nephrotoxic antibiotics and vasoactive medications as well as
                high calorie nutritional supplements may pre-dispose to renal disease in this
                vulnerable population.

             3. Ethnic differences among Caucasians, African Americans, Caribbean Blacks and
                Hispanics. Based on preliminary data, the working hypothesis is that there will be
                a statistically significant difference among the ethnic groups.

        2. Observe the natural history of proteinuria, microalbuminuria, hypertension and kidney
           function in preterm infants during the first year of life. Based on preliminary data in
           older infants and children, the working hypothesis is that the degree of proteinuria
           and microalbuminuria is a reflection of kidney injury and dysfunction that correlates
           with ongoing disease progression. The investigators postulate that a subset of patients
           will have persistent manifestations of kidney disease after the perinatal period,
           especially those with nephrotoxic exposures and high calorie nutritional supplements.

        3. Establish serum cystatin C as a sensitive test to measure kidney function in preterm
           infants. The investigators hypothesize that cord blood and early serum cystatin C will
           be more predictive of kidney function than serum creatinine in preterm infants.

      Study Design. This is a single-center case-controlled prospective observational study with
      the rationale of evaluating parameters of renal function including proteinuria,
      microalbuminuria and cystatin C in preterm infants and associating this with kidney size and
      blood pressure during the first year of life. Demographics including race, gender and growth
      will provide important perspectives relative to formula and/or breast feeding with/without
      high calorie supplements during the first year.
