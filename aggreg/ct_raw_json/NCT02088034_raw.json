There will be 8-12 participants per group. One promotora will lead each session in Spanish, exploring Diabetes Prevention Program topics. The promotora and participants will spend the first half of each session reviewing goals from the previous session and problem-solving; the second half will cover new content and set the following week's goals. Participants will be instructed to record their physical activity and dietary intake daily. Participants will also weigh themselves weekly. The core curriculum will be followed by a maintenance phase of 10 biweekly and then monthly 90-minute sessions during months 4 through 12."
