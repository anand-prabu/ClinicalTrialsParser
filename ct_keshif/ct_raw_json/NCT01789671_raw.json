            "textblock": "The current study seeks to test the alternative approach of partnering with families, and\n      more specifically parents who have previously received family-based weight control\n      treatment, to serve as peer interventionists to deliver this treatment to other families.\n      Peer-led interventions, common for other health behaviors among adults, has not been\n      previously developed or tested for family-based pediatric weight control intervention.\n      Peer-delivered interventions considerably reduce the high costs of delivering behavioral\n      interventions and could increase the availability of those able to deliver the intervention.\n      In fact, peer interventionists' may be better able to deliver intervention than\n      professionals to families, given these peers have faced similar challenges and barriers to\n      behavior change within their own families. It is also possible that continued engagement in\n      the behavior change process through delivering this intervention to other families could\n      improve peer interventionists' own family's long-term health behaviors and outcomes.\n\n      Before utilizing a peer delivery approach more broadly, the novel approach of peer-delivered\n      intervention requires development of training/supervision for peer interventionists and\n      initial evaluation of acceptability/feasibility and efficacy. Therefore, this project has\n      the following aims:\n\n        1. To develop procedures for training and supervising of parents to be peer\n           interventionists, based on our prior intervention delivery experience and family\n           advisory board input\n\n        2. To evaluate the acceptability and feasibility of peers as interventionists in\n           delivering family-based behavioral pediatric weight control intervention\n\n        3. To compare change in weight and health behavior outcomes of overweight/obese children\n           and parents receiving peer- versus professionally-delivered intervention\n\n      This study begins to address the high cost and limited availability of the needed, but\n      intense, family-based pediatric weight control intervention required for efficacy. This\n      approach expands the interdisciplinary nature of this work by engaging the resources and\n      assets of previously treated families to contribute to the reduction of the burden of\n      childhood obesity. Led by a project director (Saelens) and intervention coordinator (Scholz)\n      with over 20 years of combined experience in family-based pediatric weight control\n      intervention, this project moves this intervention in a different and important direction."
