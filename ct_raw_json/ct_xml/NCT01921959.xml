  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lifestyle interventions targeting overweight/obese individuals can produce positive &quot;ripple&quot;
      effects on untreated overweight partners in the home. Interestingly, ripple effects on
      partners' weight appear most pronounced when the interventions target women.  Women, and
      mothers in particular, remain the primary &quot;nutritional gatekeepers&quot; of the home.  Despite
      widespread recognition that motherhood is a powerful motivator for behavior changes, no
      study to date has examined the &quot;ripple&quot; effects of a postpartum Internet-based lifestyle
      intervention that target mothers' weight.  The purpose of this ancillary study is to
      determine whether a behavioral weight loss intervention for postpartum mothers
      (5R01DK087889-02, PI Phelan; Co-I Tate) has a positive &quot;ripple&quot; effect on weight and health
      of partners and children/offspring.  The proposed study is ancillary to an ongoing
      clinic-randomized trial examining the efficacy of an innovative multicomponent (online,
      face-to-face, mobile phone) postpartum behavioral weight loss intervention in 408 low-income
      women in the Women, Infants, and Children program.  The proposed study will determine
      whether partners of women randomized to the postpartum BWL intervention have greater weight
      losses and greater improvements in health outcomes than partners of women in standard WIC.
      Similar to the parent grant, assessments will occur at study entry, 6 months, and 12 months.
       This project is highly innovative, as it capitalizes on existing funded research and is the
      first study to examine ripple effects of multicomponent Internet-based intervention in
      low-income individuals. The project also has high impact, as the postpartum period is a
      powerful motivator for behavior and environmental changes in the home; and, if positive
      ripple effects occur, the field of obesity treatment and prevention could move beyond focus
      on individual level to the often, unrecognized interpersonal effects of lifestyle
      interventions.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research project will examine whether a
      postpartum weight-loss intervention has a positive &quot;ripple&quot; effects on weight and health of
      untreated partners and offspring/children in the home.
