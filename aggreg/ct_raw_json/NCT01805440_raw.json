            "textblock": "The purpose of this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study is to see if the\n      investigational medication, uridine, reduces symptoms of depression in adolescents and young\n      adults with bipolar disorder.  Uridine is a naturally occurring chemical that is made by the\n      human liver.  Uridine is part of a family of compounds called pyrimidines and is normally\n      involved in many of the body's processes, such as the use of energy by cells.  The reason\n      for the MRI component of this study is to learn about new ways to see inside the brain. The\n      investigators will use magnetic fields and radio waves to look at the brain and chemicals in\n      the brain. The investigators hope that this technique will have medial use in the future.\n\n      The primary hypothesis is that compared to placebo, 500 mg of twice daily uridine for six\n      weeks will be associated with a significant increase in phosphocreatine (PCr) and\n      glutamate-glutamine-GABA (Glx) brain concentrations. A secondary hypothesis is that\n      decreased depressive symptoms measured with the Children Depression Rating Scale-Revised\n      (CDRS-R) and Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) will be reciprocally\n      correlated with a significant increase in PCr concentrations in subjects randomized to\n      uridine compared to placebo. Additionally, we hypothesize that 500 mg of twice daily uridine\n      for 6 weeks will be associated with a significant decrease in Glx compared to placebo."
