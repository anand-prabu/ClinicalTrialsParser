    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effect on various biomarkers of treatment with
      MK-8237 in participants with allergic rhinitis or rhinoconjunctivitis. In Part 1 of the
      study healthy participants undergo nasal allergen challenge (NAC) with house dust mite (HDM)
      extract in order to verify the operational performance of NAC and associated sample
      collection methods. Part 2, the main study,  is a placebo controlled, double blind study of
      participants with HDM-induced allergic rhinitis or rhinoconjunctivitis. The primary
      hypotheses are that the changes from baseline in post-allergen challenge HDM-specific
      Immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) and Immunoglobulin E blocking factor (IgE-BF) are greater after
      treatment with MK-8237 than after treatment with placebo.
