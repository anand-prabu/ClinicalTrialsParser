  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vemurafenib ( Zelboraf) inhibits BRAF- mutated kinase activation code 600. Ipilimumab (
      Yervoy) is a monoclonal antibody that binds to a cytotoxic T - lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-
      4).

      Both drugs have proven effective in  the treatment of  melanoma. DNE3 (PI3K-Akt inhibitor)
      enhances the antitumor activity of drugs with less toxicity to normal tissues , reduce the
      restrictive metastatic melanoma
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mutations in the BRAF gene are characterized by the replacement of valine at amino acid
      position 600, which leads to constitutive activation of BRAF protein and can facilitate cell
      proliferation in the absence of growth factors that are required for normal proliferation.

      Vemurafenib is a low oral inhibitor of the enzyme serine - threonine kinase , which is
      encoded by the gene BRAF inhibition of BRAF- mutated kinase activation code 600.

      Ipilimumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to a cytotoxic T - lymphocyte antigen 4
      (CTLA- 4).

      When receiving DNE3 p-Akt inhibition may reduce the expression of metalloproteinases MMP 2
      or u- PA (plasminogen activator) , as well as invasion of tumor cells. DNE3 can reduse Akt
      phosphorylation in B16-F10 cells.

      Combining these drugs should lead to increased antimetastatic effect without increasing
      toxicity and increase disease-free interval in the treatment of melanoma

(Time Frame: Up to 5 year after completion of study treatment ) Tolerability of the regimen in each of the treatment arms will be collected and summarized using descriptive statistics. We will also capture the proportion of patients who go off treatment due to adverse reactions or even those who refuse further treatment for lesser toxicities that inhibit their willingness to continue participation on the trial. These tolerability measures will be assessed within each of the treatment arms and we will explore differences in these measures .</description>

    <description>This is a multi centre study for treatment of patients with histologically confirmed, BRAF V600 mutation-positive  melanoma. 95 patients will be enrolled.
Study of combination therapy with dose DNE3 0.2 g/kg of body weight, daily on a continuous basis with Vemurafenib 960 mg tablet Per Os (oral) twice daily  (Vem 1 Phase) followed by Ipilimumab 10 mg/kg Intravenous (IV) injection once every 3 weeks for 4 doses, then once every 12 weeks  until disease progression (PD) or unacceptable toxicity for total of 12 months treatment (2 Phase) Treatment will continue until progression of disease or as long as the patient is deriving clinical benefit, as judged by the investigator, or until unacceptable toxicity occurs.
During treatment  they will take drugs for 2 months &amp; then be assessed for respectability. then continue vemurafenib, Ipilimumab and DNE3  for another 10 months, for total of 12 months or until disease recurrence, death, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent.</description>
