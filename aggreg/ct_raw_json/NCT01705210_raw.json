            "textblock": "Diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2) is a common chronic metabolic disorder that affects 4.1% of\n      the Dutch population. In addition to vascular disease, DM2 is associated with structural\n      brain changes visible on MRI, accelerated cognitive decline, and dementia in older\n      individuals. The exact pathophysiological mechanisms underlying cognitive decrements in DM2\n      still remain to be elucidated. The 'metabolic syndrome' (MetS), defined as a cluster of\n      cardiovascular risk factors (including obesity, hypertension, and dyslipidemia) is often\n      considered a prediabetic condition. Individuals with MetS display similar cognitive\n      decrements as do DM2 patients, but do not share the severity of brain injury. It has been\n      indicated that in prediabetic MetS, cognitive problems precede structural brain changes, and\n      that MetS and DM2 affect the brain through a shared mechanism in which vascular co-morbidity\n      is essential.\n\n      The primary objectives are defined according to a hierarchical design: i) to tailor and\n      apply multi-parametric, functional MRI techniques to identify cerebral abnormalities\n      (cerebral biomarkers) in DM2 and MetS; ii) to investigate which cerebral biomarkers are\n      shared and differ between DM2 and MetS; iii) to assess whether these cerebral biomarkers are\n      associated with cognitive decrements."
