  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Menopausal syndromes includes somatic symptom, psychosomatic symptoms, sexual dysfunction
      and even urinary symptoms. Hormone therapy (HT) is widely used for controlling menopausal
      symptoms. Common HT for menopausal syndrome with intact uterus includes tibolone, estradiol
      valerate (E2V) 1mg &amp; medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) 2.5 mg, and conjugated equine
      estrogens &amp; MPA.

      However, only a few literatures mentioned about the therapeutic effect of tibolone, but lack
      of comparison research about their therapeutic effect on somatic symptoms, psychosomatic
      symptoms, sexual dysfunction and even urinary symptoms. The knowledge of the above
      therapeutic effects should be important for choosing a suitable medication. Therefore, the
      aim of this study is to assess the therapeutic effect on somatic symptoms, psychosomatic
      symptoms, sexual dysfunction and even urinary symptoms between tibolone and E2V/MPA.
