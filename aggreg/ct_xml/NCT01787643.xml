  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine whether height-adjustable desks change
      sitting and standing time at work and away from work, engery expenditure, dietary intake,
      and body composition.  Intermittent peroids of standing made possible by height-adjustable
      desks may help to impart long-term health benefits.

    <measure>Workplace sitting time to be reduced</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Workplace sitting time will be reduced by 60 minutes across an 8 hour work day and this time will be replaced by standing.</description>

    <measure>Total sitting time will be reduced</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Total sitting time will be reduced by 30 minutes across a 16 hour day.  Decreased sitting during the weekday will not be fully compensated for by increased sitting during nonwork hours.</description>

    <measure>Energy expenditure will increase</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Energy expenditure will increase across an 8 hour workday and a 16 hour day.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Health behavior change of consuming a lower fat diet</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The non-targeted health behavior of consuming a lower fat diet will co-occur with standing behavior.  Increases in standing behavior will be inversely correlated with changes in total dietary fat intake.</description>

    <measure>Body weight, BMI, and fat mass reduction</measure>
