There were still no specific\n      biomarkers to predict the susceptibility of complications and outcomes, which leading to the\n      limited prevention methods and the high mortality rate of severe trauma patients. Previous\n      studies from our and other group have found some sepsis and MODS predictors, including\n      genetic polymorphisms, serum cytokines and cell-surface markers. The purposes of this\n      multi-center observational study is to select biomarkers and evaluate a clinically and\n      economically most effective diagnostic algorithm for prediction of complications in severe\n      trauma patients."
