    <textblock>
      Major depressive episodes (MDEs) occur frequently during the course of psychotic disorders,
      and several antidepressive agents have been successfully applied. The new melatonergic
      antidepressant agomelatine (AGO) appears promising for the treatment of MDEs in
      schizophrenia for several reasons. The investigators plan to test the efficacy and
      tolerability of AGO for antidepressive treatment in schizophrenia. For this task, the
      investigators plan to enrol 27 schizophrenic patients into an open, single-armed,
      prospective clinical trial with agomelatine.

      Major depressive episodes (MDEs) occur frequently during the course of psychotic disorders,
      and several antidepressive agents have been successfully applied. The new melatonergic
      antidepressant agomelatine (AGO) appears promising for the treatment of MDEs in
      schizophrenia for several reasons: 1. AGO provides a unique pharmacological profile by
      combining antidepressive potency, sleep regulation and enhancement of frontocortical
      dopaminergic activity by 5-HT-2C-blockade. 2. AGO might exert favourable effects on
      cognition. 3. While pharmacokinetic interactions are generally possible, major influences on
      antipsychotic substances are unlikely due to metabolism by cytochrome isoenzymes CYP1A2 and
      CYP2C9/19. 4. AGO is characterized by a favourable range of adverse events (AE) which do not
      overlap with typical antipsychotic AEs such as weight gain and sexual dysfunction. Thus, the
      risk of additive effects seems to be small. The investigators plan to enroll 27
      schizophrenic patients into an open, single-armed, prospective clinical trial with
      agomelatine. As predefined primary and secondary endpoints, we are going to investigate
      whether AGO is able to improve MDE severity, sleep quality, general and psychosocial
      functioning as well as cognitive function in schizophrenia without detrimental effects on
      the psychotic syndrome. Moreover, we intend to monitor for pharmacokinetic interactions. The
      results obtained will allow designing future randomized and controlled clinical trials in
      order to improve the range of therapeutic options for affective and cognitive deficits in
      schizophrenia.
