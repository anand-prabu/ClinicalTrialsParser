  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether an escalating dose of GSK2402968 is
      effective in the treatment of boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy resulting from a
      mutation thought to be corrected by exon 51 skipping.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Boys aged between 5 and 16 years inclusive.

          -  Duchenne muscular dystrophy resulting from a mutation correctable by treatment with
             PRO051.

          -  Not ventilator dependent.

          -  Life expectancy of at least six months.

          -  No previous treatment with investigational medicinal treatment within six months
             prior to the study.

          -  Willing and able to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol
             requirements.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Aberrant RNA splicing and/or aberrant response to PRO051, detected by in vitro PRO051
             assay during screening.

          -  Known presence of dystrophin in 5% of fibers in a pre-study diagnostic muscle biopsy.

          -  Severe muscle abnormalities defined as increased signal intensity in &gt;50% of the
             tibialis anterior muscle at MRI.

          -  FEV1 and/or FVC &lt;60% of predicted.

          -  Current or history of liver or renal disease.

          -  Acute illness within 4 weeks prior to treatment (Day 1) which may interfere with the
             measurements.

          -  Severe mental retardation which in the opinion of the investigator prohibits
             participation in this study.

          -  Severe cardiac myopathy which in the opinion of the investigator prohibits
             participation in this study.

          -  Need for mechanical ventilation.

          -  Creatinine concentration above 1.5 times the upper limit of normal (age corrected).

          -  Serum ASAT and/or ALAT concentration(s) which suggest hepatic impairment.

          -  Use of anticoagulants, antithrombotics or antiplatelet agents.

          -  Subject has donated blood less than 90 days before the start of the study.

          -  Current or history of drug and/or alcohol abuse.

          -  Participation in another trial with an investigational product.
