            "textblock": "Vertigo is a common medical issue with a broad expectrum of diagnoses that requires a global\n      approach to patients through structured clinical interview and physical examination. The\n      main cause of vertigo in primary care is benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) that is\n      confirmed by a positive Dix-Hallpike positional test and treated with repositioning\n      manoeuvres. Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of Epley's manoeuvre performed by\n      general practitioners (GPs) in the treatment of BPPV. Design: randomized clinical trial\n      conducted in primary care. Scope: Two urban centres serving about 50,000 patients. Patients:\n      All patients with newly diagnosed BPPV will be offered to participate in the study and will\n      be randomly assigned to the treatment group (Epley manoeuvre) or control group (sham\n      manoeuvre) and both groups will receive betahistine. Outcome variables will be: response to\n      the Dix Hallpike test, patients will inform if vertigo was present during the last week\n      (dichotomous variable: yes/no), intensity of vertigo symptoms on a Likert scale in the past\n      week, score of Vertigo Handicap Inventory and quantity of betahistine taken. Statistical\n      analysis: Descriptive statistics of all variables collected. Groups will be compared using\n      the intent-to-treat approach and either parametric or nonparametric tests depending on the\n      nature and distribution of the variables. Chi-square test or exact Fisher test will be used\n      to compare qualitative measures and Student's t test o Mann Whitney U test will be used for\n      between-group comparison of variables.\n\n      Positive results from our study will highlight that treatment of BPPV can be performed by\n      trained GPs and its widespread practice can greatly improve the quality of life of these\n      patients."
