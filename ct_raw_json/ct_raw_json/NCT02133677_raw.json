It is observed in more than 50% of\n      patients with lung cancer and 15% to 25% of patients with breast cancer. Temozolomide (TMZ)\n      is an oral alkylating agent that crosses blood-brain barrier (BBB). This pilot study aims to\n      evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) plus\n      concomitant TMZ in lung cancer and breast cancer patients with BM."
