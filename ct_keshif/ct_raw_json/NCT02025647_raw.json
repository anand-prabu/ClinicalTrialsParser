We hypothesize that by both\n      providing patients the opportunity to reflect on their physical, emotional and behavioral\n      symptoms and functioning, and giving providers accurate, reliable, current, symptom-based\n      mental health evidence in an accessible organized format prior to the face-to-face visit,\n      Innerview will enhance diagnostic and treatment processes from both a patient- and\n      population-based perspective, as well as enhance communication between patient and provider."
