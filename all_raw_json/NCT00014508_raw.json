            "textblock": "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing\n      so they stop growing or die. Peripheral stem cell transplantation may be able to replace\n      immune cells that were destroyed by chemotherapy. Sometimes the transplanted cells are\n      rejected by the body's tissues. Peripheral stem cell transplantation with the person's own\n      stem cells followed by donor peripheral stem cell transplantation may prevent this from\n      happening.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining chemotherapy with autologous\n      peripheral stem cell transplantation and donor peripheral stem cell transplantation in\n      treating patients who have multiple myeloma."

Autologous peripheral blood stem\n      cells (PBSCs) are reinfused on day 0. Patients also receive sargramostim (GM-CSF)\n      subcutaneously (SC) or IV over at least 30 minutes daily beginning on day 1 and continuing\n      until blood counts recover. Beginning 100-182 days after autologous PBSC transplantation,\n      patients receive fludarabine IV over 30 minutes on days -6 to -2 and cyclophosphamide IV\n      over 1-2 hours on days -3 and -2. Allogeneic PBSCs are infused on day 0. Patients may\n      receive a second allogeneic PBSC infusion on day 1. Patients also receive GM-CSF SC or IV\n      over at least 30 minutes daily beginning on day 1 and continuing until blood counts recover.\n      Cyclosporine is administered IV or orally twice daily as graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)\n      prophylaxis, beginning on day -1 and continuing until day 60, followed by a taper in the\n      absence of GVHD.\n\n      Patients are followed for 5 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total 19-46 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years."
