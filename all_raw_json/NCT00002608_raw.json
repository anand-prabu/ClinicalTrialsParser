Estrogen can stimulate\n      the growth of tumor cells. Hormone therapy using tamoxifen may fight cancer by blocking the\n      uptake of estrogen. Combining tamoxifen with chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving cisplatin and doxorubicin together\n      with tamoxifen works in treating patients with solid tumors."

Treatment\n      continues every 3 weeks in the absence of the total cumulative doxorubicin dose reaching at\n      least 500 mg/m2, disease progression, or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve partial\n      remission (PR) undergo local surgery or radiotherapy, if feasible, to convert PR to complete\n      remission.\n\n      Patients are followed every 2 months for 1 year and then every 3 months for 2 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-30 patients will be accrued for this study."
