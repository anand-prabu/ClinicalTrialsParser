Patients receive carboplatin IV over 15 minutes followed by lobradimil IV\n      over 10 minutes concurrently with radiotherapy.\n\n      The first cohort of 3-6 patients receives treatment with carboplatin and lobradimil for the\n      first three weeks of radiotherapy, with the duration of chemotherapy increasing by one week\n      with each subsequent cohort until the maximum duration of 6.5 weeks is reached or until\n      unacceptable toxicity occurs in 2 of 6 patients.\n\n      Patients are followed at 6 weeks; every 3 months for 2 years; every 6 months for 3 years;\n      and then annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-24 patients will be accrued for this study within 36\n      months."
