Patients whose CA 125 levels rise to more\n      than two times the upper limit of normal are randomized to one of two treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: The clinician is informed of the initial rise in CA 125 level. A confirmatory\n           test is performed immediately. Within 4 weeks of the initial CA 125 elevation, patients\n           with a second confirmed elevation receive treatment for recurrent disease according to\n           standard local practice. Patients with a normal CA 125 on the confirmatory test receive\n           no treatment until clinically indicated.\n\n        -  Arm II: The clinician is blinded to the CA 125 results. Patients undergo normal\n           monitoring. When clinically indicated, patients commence treatment according to\n           standard local practice.\n\n      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, at each follow-up visit, and, if treatment is\n      instituted, before each chemotherapy course.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 1,400 patients will be accrued for this study."
