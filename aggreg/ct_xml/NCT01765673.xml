    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop a vibratory self-trainer for the treatment of
      dysphagia post-stroke.

      The aim is to identify the optimal stimulation characteristics for use with participants
      with swallowing problems including:

        -  Frequency of vibration

        -  Mode of vibration either continuous or pulsed

        -  Pressure of device against the neck

        -  Duration of vibration to allow a participant to initiate a swallow

      This study investigates the use of self-training device to improve swallowing post-stroke.
      The device has motors placed on the neck over each side of the thyroid cartilage and
      provides noninvasive vibratory stimulation. The vibration penetrates through the neck to the
      tissues in the larynx to activate mechanoreceptors  innervated by the internal branch of the
      superior laryngeal nerve, which when stimulated will trigger swallowing at the brain stem
      level. The outcomes of this research will be used   to develop a device for use by the
      patients for daily swallowing self-training in their own environment.

      Site monitoring and auditing will be conducted at crucial time points during the study,
      including just prior to participant enrollment. Auditing will be conducted by Julie Kobak,
      Vice President for Clinical Education of Passy Muir , Inc.

      Source data verification will be comparing raw data forms to electronic case report forms.

      Standard operating procedures are in place for participant recruitment, data collection,
      data management, data analysis, and reporting adverse events.

      Sample size assessment: Based on previous studies in healthy volunteers contrasting air puff
      stimulation on the rate of swallowing (1, 2) the expected change in rate of swallowing will
      be from 1.2 swallows/minute without stimulation to 2.0 swallows/minute with stimulation with
      a standard deviation of the differences being 0.9. Using a Bonferroni corrected alpha of
      0.025 (to test 2 measures) at 0.80 power with an effect size of 0.88, the number of
      participants needed will be 15 per experiment. Allowing for some participants to participate
      in several studies, the investigators plan to recruit between 30 and 40 participants with
      risk of aspiration post stroke.

      Potential problems and alternative strategies: Anticipated problems include difficulties
      with recruiting an adequate sample. There are 3 rooms available for participant testing at
      Rockingham Memorial Hospital to support multiple participants being tested simultaneously.
      Furthermore, all the equipment is portable including Powerlab, a laptop, the amplifier
      system, the Kistler accelerometers, and Inductive plethysmography so participants can be
      tested in rehabilitation settings and/or in their own home. Advertisements and a website
      have also been created.
