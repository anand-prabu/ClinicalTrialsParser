There is evidence to suggest that Androgen Receptor (AR) may\n      be a target in patients with advanced breast cancer.  Breast cancer patients whose tumors do\n      not express the ER, PR or HER2 (triple negative) have very few options for treatment.\n      Orteronel is being developed as an endocrine therapy for relevant hormone-sensitive cancers\n      such as prostrate cancer and breast cancer. Triple-negative metastatic breast cancer\n      patients with AR expression could potentially benefit from anti-androgen therapy like\n      orteronel."
