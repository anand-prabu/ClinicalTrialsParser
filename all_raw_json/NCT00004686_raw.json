Compare remission relapse rates in these patients after glucocorticoid therapy with or\n      without methotrexate.\n\n      III.  Determine whether adjunctive use of methotrexate lowers cumulative dose and duration\n      of glucocorticoid therapy and whether there is less treatment related morbidity and\n      mortality.\n\n      IV.  Demonstrate the feasibility of long term, double blind, placebo controlled, randomized,\n      multicenter trials for treatment of systemic vasculitides."

Patients are\n      randomized into initial therapy with prednisone plus weekly placebo or prednisone plus\n      weekly oral methotrexate.  Patients who do not respond to treatment within 5 days are taken\n      off study.  If methotrexate toxicity dose not occur after 2 weeks, methotrexate is increased\n      by one tablet per week until a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is achieved.  The MTD of\n      methotrexate or the matching placebo dose is continued for 12 months in the absence of\n      toxicity.  Once 12 continuous months of remission are achieved, methotrexate or placebo is\n      tapered to discontinuation.\n\n      Patients are followed for 1-6 years."
