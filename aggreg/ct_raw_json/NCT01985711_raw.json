            "textblock": "Recent study shows that the overall prevalence of diabetes was estimated to be 11.6% (95%\n      confidence interval, 11.3%-11.8%) in the Chinese adult population[1]. Depression is a common\n      comorbidities in patients with diabetes with prevalence rates more than 30%[2, 3]. Co-morbid\n      depression portends worse health outcomes (such as glycemic control, medication adherence,\n      quality of life, physical activity, and blood pressure control\uff0cdiabetic complication) and\n      increases health care costs[4-6]. But the rate of diabetes-depression recognition and\n      treatment is low. Collaborative primary care model, which involves a multidisciplinary\n      health care team guiding patient-centered care , has been tested in the US and showed a\n      significant reduction of depressive symptoms, improved diabetes care and patient-reported\n      outcomes, and saved money. We aim to developing a web-based collaborative care system and\n      compare the effectiveness of this new collaborative care model with usual diabetes\n      outpatient care for patients with type 2 diabetes and depression in China.\n\n      The web-based collaborative care system integrates usual management plan of diabetes and\n      established theories for treating depression and diabetes specific behaviors or affective\n      disorders. Diabetes management plan consists of a meal plan, exercise guidance, oral\n      medications or insulin guidance, health education, supervision and regular blood glucose\n      monitoring. Three main established theories of psychology as follows: 1) Cognitive\n      Behavioral Therapy (CBT); 2) Transtheoretical Model\uff08TTM\uff09of Behavior Change[7]; and 3)\n      Motivational interviewing(MI)[8]. Cognitive behavioral therapy helps people learn to change\n      inappropriate or negative thought patterns and behaviors associated with the illness.\n      Web-based CBT is generally viewed as a very effective form of psychotherapy for treating\n      depression[9-12], which is also effective to manage diabetic stress[13]. Transtheoretical\n      Model of Behavior Change and Motivational interviewing are both evidence-based behavior\n      change techniques to improve diabetes and depression associated healthy behavior (such as\n      taking medicine, physical activity, diabetic diet, drug therapy compliance) and to decrease\n      unhealthy behavior(such as sedentary activities, smoking, alcohol addiction).The\n      intervention will be conducted in a safety-net health system primary care setting.\n\n      A randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of\n      culturally adapted diabetes and depression collaborative treatment for reducing depressive\n      symptoms, activating diabetes healthy behaviors, decreasing unhealthy behaviors and\n      improving adherence to diabetes self-care regimens in Chinese with depression and diabetes.\n      Participation in this study will last 12 months. All participants will firstly undergo\n      baseline assessments that will include a 40-minute interview about personal health and\n      feelings. Eligible participants will then be assigned randomly to receive either web-based\n      collaborative care or wait-list. Participants in web-based collaborative care group will\n      receive 24 weekly 40-minute web-based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) sessions, undergo\n      structured Transtheoretical Model of Behavior Change or Motivational interviewing to set up\n      proper life-style and healthy behavior to improve their live quality\uff0cconducted on the web.\n      Besides, they will receive usual diabetes outpatient care and web-based diabetes care.\n      Participants assigned to the wait-list group will be given usual diabetes outpatient service\n      (diabetic medication guidance and appointment to see doctor as routine, without specific\n      anti-depression therapy). After 6 months, they will receive web-based collaborative care for\n      6 months too. All participants receiving web-based collaborative care management will also\n      receive supportive patient navigation services and maintenance/relapse telephone monitoring,\n      their assistants (family member; online systems nurse, psychiatrists and endocrinologist)\n      monitor and help them change their behaviors. All participants will undergo follow-up\n      on-site interviews about their status at months 3, 6, 9 and12."
