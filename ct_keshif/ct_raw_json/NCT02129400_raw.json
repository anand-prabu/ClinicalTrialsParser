Several clinical and pre-clinical studies have shown a positive effect of xenon\n      on several organ functions such as in brain, kidneys and heart. In two studies, an enhanced\n      expression of hypoxia inducible factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1) could be shown in animal kidneys and\n      kidney cells. Interestingly, HIF-1\u03b1 leads to an enhanced formation of erythropoetin (EPO).\n      This might result in an enhanced oxygen transport capacity and an enhanced oxygen-level\n      after xenon-treatment.\n\n      Aim of the project is to analyze the effect of xenon-inhalation on circulating\n      erythropoetin-level in blood of healthy volunteers in a randomized controlled pilot study.\n      Besides, other positive stimulating factors for erythropoiesis (such as HIFa stabilizing\n      factors) and growth factors (such as fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), hepatocyte growth\n      factor (HGF), mechano growth factors (MGFs), platelet-derived growth factors (PDGFs),\n      vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs)) shall be analyzed."
