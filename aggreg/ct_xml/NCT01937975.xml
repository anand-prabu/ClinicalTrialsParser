  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      MK-5172 and MK-8742 are being studied as the principal components of combination oral
      therapy for hepatitis C virus (HCV).

      The study will examine the pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of MK-5172 and MK-8742 following 10
      days of dosing in participants with end stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD) or
      severe renal impairment.  Both groups will be compared to healthy matched controls.
