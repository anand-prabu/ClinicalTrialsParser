In this manner, pts receive navigation services tailored to their individual needs & barriers. Once pts are connected with a cessation service (defined as either using cessation medication or at least 1 contact with a Quitline or community-based cessation counselor)or provider-prescribed cessation medication usage, continues the navigation intervention will be considered complete. W/I the 3 month engagement period, pts will receive up to 6 contacts from the Pt Navigator following referral from primary care provider. Consistent with recommended pt navigation practice, the navigator will provide feedback to primary care provider regarding cessation services that the pts are receiving.",
