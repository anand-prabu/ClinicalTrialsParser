  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained arrhythmia in the United States and it
      has been associated with ethanol use. Understanding how ethanol affects the electrical
      properties of the heart and induces AF has important public health implications. The
      objective of this research is to investigate the mechanistic relationship between ethanol
      and atrial fibrillation in humans by performing a placebo controlled study looking at the
      electrical properties of the heart in patients receiving intravenous ethanol or placebo. The
      investigators hypothesize that ethanol increases the susceptibly of human myocardium to
      atrial fibrillation through electrophysiologic changes in the atrial myocardium in the acute
      setting.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to look for changes in the electrical properties of heart that
      may be caused by ethanol (commonly referred to as alcohol) and specifically how ethanol may
      trigger episodes of the most common abnormal heart rhythm, atrial fibrillation (AF). This
      study will demonstrate the mechanism of ethanol induced atrial fibrillation and clarify the
      health effects of one of the worlds' most popular drugs (ethanol). With this understanding,
      physicians may be able to better identify those patients most at risk for ethanol induced AF
      and target public health campaigns towards this vulnerable population.

      Patients in this study will undergo an electrophysiologic study both prior to and after
      receiving either an ethanol or placebo infusion. This electrophysiology study will measure
      AF inducibility (the primary outcome), left and right atrial conduction times, and the
      atrial effective refractory period in multiple locations (AERP). The changes in the
      conduction times and AERPs (before and after study drug infusion) will be recorded as
      secondary outcomes.

      About 50 people will participate in this study. 25 people will be randomized to receive
      intravenous ethanol, and 25 people will be randomized to receive an intravenous placebo. The
      placebo will be in the form of 0.45% saline solution (&quot;half normal saline&quot;) and the alcohol
      will be in the form of 6% volume/volume ethanol in 0.45% saline solution.
