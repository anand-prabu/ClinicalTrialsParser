Fatigue will be assessed with the FIS and sub-maximal exercise capacity with the\n      6-minute walk test (6MWT), a standardized exercise test that measures the distance that a\n      patient is capable of walking in 6 minutes (6MWD).  Depression will be assessed by using\n      three well-known questionaires.  The SF-36, Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI-II), EQ-5D, and\n      the Psychological General Well-Being Index (PGWBI).  Univariate analysis will be performed\n      to select the factors that potentially are associated with the scores as indicated by a P\n      value <.20; the selected factors will then be entered in a stepwise regression to create a\n      multivariate model giving the combination of factors that are significantly associated with\n      the measure of fatigue and depression.   Hemoglobin (Hb) levels will then be added to the\n      model in order to test its significance while controlling for the other factors."
