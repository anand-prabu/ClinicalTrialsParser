In this population it will be analysed the cost-effectiveness of a\n      telemedic assistance with a technological system and its ability to modify lifestyle habits,\n      reduce weight and cardiovascular risk associated parameters.\n\n      Previously to the clinical implementation, a pilot study for testing the telemedical system\n      will be made. Efficacy and security variables will be evaluated along the study."
