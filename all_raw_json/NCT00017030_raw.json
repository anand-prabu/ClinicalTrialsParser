Determine the rate of clinical benefit, in terms of the incidence of\n      objective partial and complete response, stable disease, or minor response of more than 3\n      months duration, in patients with previously treated, unresectable advanced or metastatic\n      soft tissue sarcoma treated with ecteinascidin 743. II. Determine the progression-free\n      survival, overall survival, and response duration in patients treated with this drug. III.\n      Determine the toxicity profile of this drug in these patients. IV. Determine the\n      pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationship of this drug in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to number of prior\n      cytotoxic therapies for advanced disease (1-2 vs more than 2). Patients receive\n      ecteinascidin 743 IV over 3 hours on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for at least 2\n      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are\n      followed every 3 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 36-76 patients (18-38 per stratum) will be accrued for this\n      study within 13 months."
