            "textblock": "Currently, there is no reliable, bedside, and non-invasive method for assessing connectivity\n      changes in electrophysiological activity of the brain associated with brain-related\n      pathologies, e.g., concussion, ADHD, autistic spectrum disorders (ASD), etc. Event Related\n      Potentials (ERPs), which are temporal reflections of the neural mass electrical activity of\n      cells in specific regions of the brain that occur in response to stimuli, may offer such a\n      method, as they provide both a non-invasive and portable measure of brain function. The ERPs\n      provide excellent temporal information, but spatial resolution for ERPs has traditionally\n      been limited. However, by using high-density electroencephalograph (EEG) recording spatial\n      resolution for ERPs is improved significantly. The paradigm for the current study will\n      combine neurophysiological knowledge with mathematical signal processing and pattern\n      recognition methods (BNA) to temporally and spatially map brain function, connectivity and\n      synchronization.\n\n      The need of objective measures that will help the clinician in its decision making in\n      brain-related pathologies is recognized. BNA is a new imaging modality that has been\n      developed to fill this gap."
