Patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus for more than 5 years duration\n\n          3. Body Mass Index (BMI) 4. Fulfill one or more of the following:\n\n        1. Manifest signs and symptoms that are severe enough to be incapacitating. Incapacitating\n        signs and symptoms include hypoglycemic episodes requiring assistance by others and\n        hypoglycemia unawareness, (the inability to recognize low blood glucoses; glucoses <54\n        mg/dl). These patients are at high risk for involvement in accidents (they can lose\n        consciousness or act irrationally), thus causing harm to themselves and/or others; and/or\n        2. Patients with poor diabetes control (HbA1c > 8.0% but < 12%), despite intensive insulin\n        therapy, as defined by: self monitoring of blood glucose \u2265 4 times/day, and multiple\n        insulin injections (\u2265 3/day) or insulin pump, and close monitoring of blood glucose\n        control by an Endocrinologist. These patients can experience acute, rapid hyperglycemia\n        secondary to several stress factors, that can lead to dehydration, disorientation, and in\n        some instances, ketoacidosis; and/or 3. Progressive diabetic complications. These patients\n        with chronically poor glycemic control are at higher risk for the development of a wide\n        variety of complications (retinopathy, neuropathy, nephropathy, and cardiovascular\n        disease) associated with diabetes.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n        Potential candidates will be excluded as per following criteria:\n\n          1.

Body Mass Index >30\n\n          5. Weight >80 kg;\n\n          6. Insulin requirement >1.0 u/kg/d;\n\n          7. HbA1C >12%;\n\n          8. Stimulated or basal C-peptide >0.3 ng/ml;\n\n          9. Iohexol GFR<80\n\n         10. Macroalbuminuria (>300 mg/24 hours);\n\n         11.

Any medical condition requiring chronic use of steroids;\n\n         30. Active alcohol or substance abuse; smoking in the last 6 months;\n\n         31. Sexually active females who are not: a) post-menopausal, b) surgically sterile, or c)\n             not using an acceptable method of contraception (oral contraceptives, Norplant,\n             Depo-Provera, and barrier devices with spermicide are acceptable; condoms used alone\n             are not acceptable);\n\n         32. Positive pregnancy test or intent for future pregnancy, or male subject's intent to\n             procreate;\n\n         33.
