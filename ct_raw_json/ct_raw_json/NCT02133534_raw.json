The study team will obtain one blood and urine sample at baseline prior to starting atorvastatin therapy, and again after 30 days of drug therapy. The study team will do ultrasound imaging of the arm in which a probe will be placed over the blood vessels to measure the diameter of the artery and how this changes after a blood pressure cuff is inflated and then deflated.  Subjects will take one nitroglycerine tablet during the ultrasound imaging."
