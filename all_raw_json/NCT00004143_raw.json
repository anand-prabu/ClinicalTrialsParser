Unfortunately, the conventional approach to allogeneic stem cell\n      transplantation is a risky procedure.  For some non-cancerous conditions, the risks of this\n      procedure outweigh the potential benefits.  This protocol is designed to test a new approach\n      to allogeneic stem cell transplantation.  It is hoped that this approach will be better\n      suited for patients with non-cancerous blood and bone marrow disorders."

Recommended minimum\n             standards include an Ejection Fraction (EF) greater than 40% and DLCO greater than\n             40% for this less toxic regimen.\n\n          -  Appropriate cardiology or pulmonary consultations should be considered if the patient\n             has severe cardiac or lung disease at the initiation of therapy.\n\n        I) Hemoglobinopathies:\n\n        (a)Sickle Cell Anemia having history of one or more of the following despite treatment\n        with standard therapies such as hydroxyurea: i) 2 or more episodes of acute chest syndrome\n        since age 13 years ii) pulmonary hypertension as measured by tricuspid regurgitant jet\n        velocity of greater than 2.5m/s iii) 2 or more painful crisis per year requiring medical\n        care  and  analgesia in excess of what is needed at baseline.\n\n        iv) history of  cerebrovascular accident (b)Thalassemia major: Those eligible will have\n        either cardiac or hepatic sequela of thalassemia as documented by biopsy or functional\n        studies.  For those with hepatic damage, this would be an increase in size by 50% of the\n        liver or a doubling of the total bilirubin, aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine\n        aminotransferase (ALT), or alkaline phosphatase.  To be eligible for transplant due to\n        cardiac damage, there must be evidence of left ventricular dysfunction as measured by MUGA\n        scan or echocardiography.\n\n        II) Bone marrow failure Disorders\n\n          1. Severe Aplastic Anemia: Cytopenia consisting of at least 2 of the following 3:\n             absolute neutrophil count less than 500/\u03bcL, platelet count less than 20,000/\u03bcL, and\n             reticulocyte count less than 50,000/\u03bcL.\n\n          2. Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH): Patients must have a history of either\n             life-threatening thrombosis, cytopenia, transfusion dependence or recurrent,\n             debilitating hemolytic crisis\n\n          3. Pure red cell aplasia: Patients must be transfusion dependent.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  pregnant or lactating women,\n\n          -  patients with other major medical or psychiatric illnesses which the treating or\n             transplant physician feels could seriously compromise compliance to this protocol\n\n          -  patients with known history of allergies to murine protein"
