      Primary Objective:

      - To assess the safety, tolerability and plasma pharmacokinetics (PK) of SAR245408 given
      once daily as a tablet formulation of polymorph E in subjects with solid tumors or lymphoma.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To evaluate the pharmacodynamic (PD) effect of SAR245408 given once daily as a tablet
           formulation of polymorph E in subjects with solid tumors or lymphoma.

        -  To explore the antitumor activity of SAR245408 given once daily as a tablet formulation
           of polymorph E in subjects with solid tumors or lymphoma.

      Screening: 1 to 28 days Study treatment period: two 28-day cycles (56 days) End-of-treatment
      visit: no later than 7 days after the last study drug administration Subjects not eligible
      for treatment continuation after Cycle 2 will be followed up for safety; a follow-up visit
      will be performed within 30 Â± 3 days after the last study drug administration Subjects
      eligible for treatment continuation after Cycle 2 will be offered the opportunity to enroll
      in the treatment-extension study TED12414.

      Total duration of study participation for each patient: 58 to 118 days.
