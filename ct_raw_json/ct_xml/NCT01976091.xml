      Dose escalation study of self-complementary scAAVrh74.tMCK.hSGCA to LGMD2D (alpha-SG

    <textblock>
      The proposed clinical trial is a dose escalation study of self-complementary
      scAAVrh74.tMCK.hSGCA to LGMD2D (alpha-SG deficient) subjects delivered via a major lower
      limb artery of each leg sequentially by modified isolated limb perfusion and isolated limb
      infusion (ILP/ILI);1 henceforth designated as isolated limb recirculation for gene therapy
      (ILR-GT). Two cohorts will undergo gene transfer in a standard three-six dose escalation
      scheme to establish maximum tolerated dose (MTD) using toxicity. A minimum of three subjects
      will be enrolled into each cohort. The first cohort will receive a total dose of 2 x 1012
      vg/kg split between the 2 lower extremities (1 x 1012 vg/kg per limb). The vector will be
      infused into an indwelling catheter in the femoral artery. This will be a one-time vector
      infusion that will recirculate over a period of 30 minutes in a closed circuit that
      includes: arterial delivery to an isolated limb (proximal tourniquet), return via the
      femoral vein and redelivered to the artery via extracorporeal pump. The second cohort will
      receive 6 x 1012 vg/kg total dose - split between the 2 lower extremities (3 x 1012 vg/kg
      per limb) delivered to the whole limb according to the same protocol. The total vector
      genome dose for each subject will be adjusted by rounding down to the closest 10 kg.

      The primary objective of this study is the assessment of the safety of intravascular
      administration of scAAVrh.74.tMCK.hSGCA delivered via the femoral artery to both lower
      extremities LGMD2D (alpha-SG deficient) subjects. Safety monitoring during recirculation
      will include: activated clotting times, limb gases, real time monitoring of arterial and
      venous access pressures, and perfusate temperature. Safety endpoints will be assessed by
      changes in hematology, serum chemistry, urinalysis, immunologic response to rAAVrh74 and
      hSGCA, and reported history and observations of symptoms.  The six minute walk test will be
      used as secondary outcome for these disorders. Other exploratory measure will include direct
      muscle testing for strength (MVICT) of lower limb muscles. These quantitative measures will
      be done at baseline, day 30, 60, 90, 180, and at the end of 1st and 2nd years.   Subjects
      will be evaluated at baseline, infusion visit (days 0-2), and return for follow up visits on
      days 7, 14, 30, 60, 90, and 180.  On Day 180, subjects will undergo a muscle biopsy on the
      injected muscles in one leg to compare with the pre-treatment biopsy done at baseline
      screening in the opposite leg to establish the size of muscle fibers and any potential
      toxicity from gene transfer.

        Inclusion Criteria

          -  Ambulant subjects, age 7 or older

          -  Proven alpha-sarcoglycan deficiency by muscle biopsy or DNA testing.

          -  Impaired muscle function based on clinical evidence of muscle weakness assessed by PI
             and staff.

          -  Males and females of any ethnic group will be eligible

          -  Ability to cooperate with muscle testing.

             gene therapy (females) or until two negative sperm samples are obtained post gene
             transfer (males).

        Exclusion Criteria
