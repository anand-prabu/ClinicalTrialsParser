  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are a number of risk factors for development of chronic pain that have been evaluated
      including age, gender, type and duration of surgery, duration of pain prior to surgery and
      tourniquet application. There is some scientific evidence from animal studies demonstrating
      that prolonged tourniquet application can result in lack of oxygen supply to nerves, and
      subsequent nerve damage resulting in chronic pain. This theory has not been proven in
      humans. In this study the investigators will indirectly assess the evidence for
      abnormalities caused by tourniquet application on subjects' nerves using well established
      devices to determine the function of these nerves.
