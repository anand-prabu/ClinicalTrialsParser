    <textblock>
      Alcohol use disorders (AUDs) are highly prevalent among U.S. civilians, and even more
      prevalent in the U.S. Veteran population. AUDs are frequently co-morbid with depressive
      symptoms in psychiatric clinical populations, resulting in an increased severity of both
      conditions. Indeed, returning OEF/OIF Veterans have extraordinarily high rates of alcohol
      misuse and co-morbid psychiatric symptoms, indicating that future Veteran clinical
      populations will be particularly affected by AUDs. While FDA-approved medications are
      available to treat AUDs, their efficacy is low compared to available psychosocial
      treatments. Despite the lack of evidence for efficacy from controlled trials,
      antidepressants are frequently prescribed to clinical populations (including Veterans) with
      active AUDs. A better understanding of patient-level clinical variables that may confer poor
      response to treatment with antidepressants would allow clinicians better tools to
      distinguish those alcohol-dependent Veterans likely to do worse with antidepressant
      treatment.

      Description of Proposed Study A. Scientific Basis: Alcohol abuse and dependence represent a
      spectrum of maladaptive behaviors with enormous public health impact, especially for the
      U.S. veteran population (Calhoun et al, 2008). Depressive symptoms are frequently comorbid
      with alcohol use disorders, but despite the frequent use of serotonin reuptake inhibitors
      (SSRIs) in clinical practice, clinical trials with these agents for alcohol use disorders
      have yielded mixed results concerning their impact on drinking behavior (Kampman et al.,
      2007).

      The characterization of alcohol-dependent subjects on the basis of demographic variables,
      severity of addiction, and psychiatric symptomatology has revealed a divergence in response
      to treatment with SSRIs among different subtypes of alcoholics (less severe &quot;Type A&quot; vs.
      more severe &quot;Type B&quot; alcohol dependence; Kampman et al., 2007). Type A alcoholics have
      exhibited a trend toward decreased drinking behavior in clinical trials with SSRIs, whereas
      type B alcoholics showed a trend in the opposite direction (Kampman et al., 2007). The
      literature does not offer an explanation for this divergence, and therefore, it is not clear
      how these research findings can be applied clinically.

      As intravenous (iv) citalopram infusion (40 mg) bypasses hepatic metabolism, a single
      infusion produces a clinically relevant concentration in human brain, and the brain
      concentration remains stable for up to 4 h post-infusion, and is well-tolerated (Smith et
      al, 2009). A single infusion reduces striatal dopamine receptor binding potential by a
      magnitude comparable to the effect of chronic oral citalopram treatment, as measured by
      positron emission tomography (PET; Smith et al., 2009). The subjective experience of craving
      for alcohol in alcohol-dependent individuals has been associated with decreased dopamine
      receptor availability in the striatum via PET (Heinz et al., 2004).

      B. Significance of the research: Alcohol abuse and dependence occur at a higher rate in
      veterans than in the overall U.S. population, and the presence of comorbid depressive
      symptoms amplifies the health risks to affected veterans (Calhoun et al, 2008). While
      FDA-approved medications are available to treat alcohol dependence, their overall efficacy
      is low compared to available psychosocial treatments (Soyka, et al., 2008). Given that SSRIs
      are frequently utilized in veteran populations with depressive symptoms and alcohol use
      disorders, there is the certainty that many veterans with Type B alcohol dependence are
      receiving a pharmacological intervention that may exacerbate their drinking behavior,
      thereby increasing morbidity. A better understanding of patient-level clinical variables
      that may confer poor response to treatment with SSRIs would allow clinicians better tools to
      distinguish those alcohol-dependent veterans likely to do worse, and prevent what was
      intended to be a beneficial medical intervention from worsening a veteran's clinical course.
      This research is well-suited to a veteran population because of the high proportion of
      veterans with alcohol dependence.

      C. Program Objectives: The nominee has a strong background in clinical addiction psychiatry,
      and he seeks to accomplish two objectives through the proposed training program: 1) to
      become an expert in the field of human alcohol addiction research, and 2) to learn
      techniques of  PET research. The nominee's work environment at the West Los Angeles Veterans
      Administration Medical Center (WLAVA), in collaboration with colleagues at UCLA provides an
      ideal infrastructure for this training. He will be mentored by renowned experts in these
      areas, Drs. Arthur Brody, and Edythe London. The mentors have several NIH and VA
      grant-funded ongoing studies in alcohol and other addictive disorders research with strong
      ties to the VA PET research infrastructure. As part of training, the nominee will attend
      several courses and workshops at UCLA in foundational neuroimaging topics with relevance to
      PET (statistics, neuroimaging, neuroanatomy), as well as courses in the neurobiological
      bases of addiction. He will also attend annual conferences in Alcohol Dependence (Research
      Society on Alcoholism annual meeting) and neuroimaging (e.g., Society for Nuclear Medicine
      annual meeting), and meet with mentors regularly. The nominee plans to submit an NIH R01
      and/or VA Merit Review grant toward the end of the award period. Long term, he plans to
      found an independent research career studying neuropharmacological approaches to treating
      and understanding substance use disorders, focusing primarily on alcohol.

      D. Project Design and Methods: This project proposes to study 20 individuals in each of 3
      groups (Type A alcohol dependence, Type B alcohol dependence, and healthy control subjects)
      for a double-blinded, placebo-controlled, within-subjects, outpatient study with iv
      citalopram (40 mg and saline, in counter-balanced order) and [18F]fallypride PET scanning.
      Participants should be in good physical health, have no history of complicated alcohol
      withdrawal symptoms (e.g., seizures, delirium tremens), be 21-55 years of age, and taking no
      psychoactive medications. Typology among alcohol-dependent subjects will be assessed after
      Kampman et al. (2007). The project aims: 1) To determine whether iv citalopram (40 mg)
      affects measures of craving for alcohol compared to a blinded saline iv control infusion; 2)
      to determine the change in striatal dopamine receptor D2/3 receptor availability (measured
      as binding potential for the radiotracer) with iv citalopram (40 mg) as compared to iv
      saline by [18F]fallypride PET scanning; and 3) to assess whether changes in striatal D2/3
      receptor availability with iv citalopram (40 mg, compared to iv saline control) is related
      to measures of craving for alcohol among subjects.

      E. Description of Intervention(s)/Treatment(s): Through Internet advertising, interested
      participants will be invited to call a phone number for anonymous phone screening, and
      individuals who pass phone screening will be invited to the WLAVA for a screening visit.
      Potential subjects will meet criteria for alcohol dependence (via SCID; except for control
      subjects), will have no current psychotropic medication use, will be in good physical health
      (as assessed by clinical history and physical examination and laboratory assay), and have no
      current dependence on other substances of abuse (SCID; aside from nicotine). After
      screening, qualified participants will be invited to participate in a structural magnetic
      resonance imaging (sMRI scan) for PET scan registration purposes, and two day-long
      experimental sessions at WLAVA, where they will undergo infusions with iv citalopram (40 mg
      and saline, double blinded); at least one week will separate infusion days to allow for
      participants to return to baseline functioning between sessions. After each infusion,
      participants will undergo ~30 min of paper- and computer-based questionnaires designed to
      assess measures of mood and other psychiatric symptoms, and ~15 min of assessment of both
      baseline and cue-induced craving for alcohol. Subsequently, participants will undergo
      [18F]fallypride PET scanning (~2h) to assess striatal D2/3 receptor availability. After
      completion of both infusions and PET scans, participants will be discharged from the study.
      Participants will be compensated for their participation according to VA research
      guidelines.
