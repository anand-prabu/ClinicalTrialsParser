Participants will be randomized to: 1) weekly high-dose vitamin D3 (50,000 IU) or 2)\n      vitamin D placebo only for a period of 24 weeks.

The vitamin D supplementation is aimed at reducing fracture risk\n      by maintaining proper bone density, thereby preventing osteoporotic/osteopenic conditions\n      and increasing muscle mass.  Both vitamin D and exercise are efficacious in maintaining\n      proper bone health and muscle mass among the general population, but little research has\n      been done on prostate cancer patients and survivors.  Vitamin D could reduce fracture risk\n      among prostate cancer survivors."
