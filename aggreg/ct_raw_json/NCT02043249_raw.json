Also benefits  were proved by\n      means of less need for blood tranfusion, less intra ventricular hemorrhage; necrotzing\n      entero colitis and iron deficiency anemia. The hypothesis is that delayed clamping /milking\n      it will increse the level of IgG's in preterm infants.  The end point hypothesis is that\n      delayed cord clamping /milking cause to less fever disease or hospitalization it the\n      neonats."
