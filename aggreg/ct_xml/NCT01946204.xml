      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ARN-509 in adult men
      with high-risk non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized (individuals will be assigned by chance to study treatments),
      double-blind (individuals and study personnel will not know the identity of study
      treatments), placebo (an inactive substance that is compared with a drug to test whether the
      drug has a real effect in a clinical trial)-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of ARN-509 versus placebo in adult men with high-risk non-metastatic
      castration-resistant prostate cancer. Approximately 1200 participants will be randomly
      assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive either ARN-509 (treatment arm A) or placebo (treatment
      arm B). Serial pharmacokinetic blood samples will be collected. Participants will be
      followed for safety and efficacy and will remain on study treatment until documented
      radiographic disease progression, development of unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of
      consent. Participants discontinuing study treatment will enter the survival follow-up period
      where they will be followed for the development of symptomatic progression and initiation of
      subsequent anti-cancer therapies, until death, loss of follow-up, or withdrawal of consent,
      whichever comes first. The total study duration will be approximately up to Month 59.
