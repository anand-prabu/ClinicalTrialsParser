    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well trametinib and radioiodine work increasing tumoral
      iodine incorporation in patients with thyroid cancer that has come back or spread to another
      place in the body. Trametinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the
      enzymes needed for cell growth and help make treatment more effective. Iodine-124 is a type
      of radioactive iodine that may help to see how much radioactive iodine is absorbed by
      thyroid tumors with scans. Giving trametinib with radioiodine may help increase tumoral
      iodine incorporation with radioiodine and help doctors plan better treatment.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the effect of trametinib on enhancing radioiodine (RAI) activity by
      determining the proportion of patients alive at 6 months without disease progression by
      Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v 1.1) criteria following
      treatment with RAI in co-administration with trametinib. (Cohort A) II. To evaluate the
      effect of trametinib on enhancing RAI activity by determining the objective response rate
      (ORR) at 6 months following treatment with radioiodine (RAI) in co-administration with
      trametinib. (Cohort A) III. To determine the proportion of patients following trametinib
      therapy with increased tumoral iodine incorporation as quantified by iodine iodine-124
      (I-124) positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) lesional dosimetry.
      (Cohort B )

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the proportion of patients following trametinib therapy with increased
      tumoral iodine incorporation as quantified with I-124 PET/CT lesional dosimetry. (Cohort A )

      tumoral pharmacodynamic changes induced by trametinib to clinical outcomes. (Cohort B) X.
      Preliminary evaluation of best objective response (BOR) rate for patients treated with
      trametinib alone. (Cohort C) XI. Preliminary evaluation of the proportion of patients
      following treatment with trametinib alive at 6 months without disease progression by RECIST
      v 1.1 criteria. (Cohort C) XII. To evaluate the safety/tolerability of trametinib. (Cohort
      C) XIII. To evaluate changes in serum thyroglobulin levels in patients treated with
      trametinib. (Cohort C) XIV. To explore potential correlations between genomic alterations
      present in the tumor and/or tumoral pharmacodynamic changes induced by trametinib to
      clinical outcomes. (Cohort C)

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo iodine I-124 PET/CT on day 5 of week 1. Beginning day 6, patients receive
      trametinib orally (PO) daily for 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo second iodine I-124 PET/CT on week 5. If I-124
      PET/CT shows enough iodine absorption, patients may receive iodine I-131 PO and continue
      receiving trametinib for another 2 days. If I-124 shows that the thyroid is not absorbing
      iodine, patients may continue trametinib at the doctor's discretion and do not receive
      iodine I-131.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.

             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and
             for the duration of study participation; women of child-bearing potential must have a
             negative serum pregnancy test within 2 weeks prior study registration; should a woman
             become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating
             in this study, she should inform the treating physician immediately; men treated or
             enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the
             study, for the duration of study participation, and 4 months after completion of
             trametinib administration

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document

          -  Patients must agree to undergo two separate biopsies of a malignant lesion; biopsies
             do not need to be done if one of the following apply:

               1. If either the site investigator or person performing the biopsy judges that no
                  tumor is accessible for biopsy or that biopsy poses too great of a risk to the
                  patient

               2. The goal will be to have a minimum of 6 patients from Cohort A and 3 patients
                  from Cohort B attempt to have one or both of these research biopsies done (for a
                  total of 9 patients total); accrual may be limited only to subjects for whom
                  tumor is accessible for biopsy and attempt at biopsy is considered safe if
                  continued enrollment of those who are not candidates for biopsy make it
                  impossible to reach the accrual goals for research biopsies described above.
                  (e.g., if 19 (of 25) patients are accrued to Cohort A without any biopsies
                  having been obtained within the cohort, then all further subjects who are
                  registered to that cohort must qualify for attempted research biopsy in order to
                  be enrolled into the study (i.e., subjects who would have been excluded from
                  having biopsies done due to the above reasons would be excluded from
                  participating in the study; these conditions also apply to Cohort B)

          -  Availability of archival tumor tissue from the thyroid cancer primary or metastasis
             (a tissue block or a minimum of 30 unstained slides would be required; patients with
             less archival tissue available may still be eligible for the study after discussion
             with the MSKCC Principal Investigator)

          -  COHORT A: Confirmation in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)
             certified laboratory that one of the patient's thyroid tumors (primary tumor,
             recurrent tumor, or metastasis) has an neuroblastoma RAS viral (v-ras) oncogene
             homolog [NRAS] or Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog [KRAS] or Harvey rat
             sarcoma viral oncogene homolog [HRAS] mutation at G12, G13, or Q61; this group of
             patients will also be referred to as &quot;RAS MUT&quot;

          -  COHORT A: Patients must have progressive disease, defined as the presence of new or
             growing lesion(s) on radiologic imaging within 14 months of study enrollment and/or
             new/worsening disease related symptoms within 14 months of study enrollment;
             (progression according to RECIST v 1.1 criteria is not required)

          -  COHORT B: Confirmation in a CLIA certified laboratory that one of the patient's
             thyroid tumors (primary tumor, recurrent tumor, or metastasis) does not have any of
             the following mutations:

               -  Mutation at V600 of the v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B (BRAF)
                  gene

               -  Mutation in NRAS or KRAS or HRAS at G12, G13, or Q61

               -  These patients will be designated &quot;BRAF/RAS wild type (WT)&quot;

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of another malignancy; exception: patients who have been disease-free for 3
             years, patients with a history of completely resected non-melanoma skin cancer,

               -  History of RVO or CSR, or predisposing factors to RVO or CSR (e.g., uncontrolled
                  glaucoma or ocular hypertension, uncontrolled systemic disease such as
                  hypertension, diabetes mellitus, or history of hyperviscosity or
                  hypercoagulability syndromes; assessment of what is an &quot;uncontrolled&quot; condition
                  is left to the discretion of the site investigator)

               -  Visible retinal pathology as assessed by ophthalmic exam that is considered a
                  risk factor for RVO or CSR such as evidence of new optic disc cupping, evidence
                  of new visual field defects, and intraocular pressure &gt; 21 mm Hg

          -  History or evidence of cardiovascular risk including any of the following:

               -  Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt; LLN

               -  A QT interval corrected for heart rate using the Bazett's formula (QTcB) &gt;= 480
                  msec

               -  History or evidence of current clinically significant uncontrolled arrhythmias
                  (exception: patients with controlled atrial fibrillation for &gt; 30 days prior to
                  prior to the initiation of therapy on this protocol are eligible)

               -  History of acute coronary syndromes (including myocardial infarction and
                  unstable angina), coronary angioplasty, or stenting within 6 months prior to the
                  initiation of therapy on this protocol

               -  History or evidence of current &gt;= class II congestive heart failure as defined
                  by the New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification system

               -  Known cardiac metastases

          -  Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), or hepatitis C
             virus (HCV) infection (with the exception of chronic or cleared HBV and HCV
             infection, which will be allowed)

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements

          -  Study drug must not be administered to pregnant women or nursing mothers

          -  HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible

             in iodide (amiodarone)

          -  Patients who received iodinated intravenous contrast as part of a radiographic
             procedure within 3 months of study registration; those that have had iodinated
             intravenous contrast within this time frame may still be eligible if an urinary
             iodine analysis reveals that the excess iodine has been cleared after the last
             intravenous contrast administration
