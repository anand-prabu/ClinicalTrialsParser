            "textblock": "Background:\n\n      - Nicotine addiction often makes it difficult to stop smoking. Researchers want to\n      understand the areas of the brain that are important in nicotine addiction. They will use a\n      type of brain stimulation called repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to look\n      at part of the brain that may be involved in nicotine addiction. They will see how these\n      areas affect brain function, thinking, and decision making. For this study, rTMS will first\n      be tested on nonsmokers, then smokers will be recruited at a later time.\n\n      Objectives:\n\n      - To study areas of the brain involved in nicotine addiction.\n\n      Eligibility:\n\n      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who do not smoke.\n\n      Design:\n\n        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. They will also\n           provide a urine sample.\n\n        -  There will be four study sessions. The first session will involve a magnetic resonance\n           imaging (MRI) scan. The other three visits will involve rTMS and MRI scans.\n\n        -  The first MRI scan will take a baseline picture of the brain. Participants will also\n           practice the tasks for the other three sessions in a mock scanner.\n\n        -  At the next three visits, participants will have rTMS and MRI scans. Two visits will\n           involve rTMS; the other visit will involve mock rTMS with no actual magnetic\n           stimulation. During the MRI scans, participants will perform tasks that involve\n           decision making."

Specifically,\n      we will examine insula neurocircuitry using a unilateral H-coil to deliver rTMS to the Right\n      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (R DLPFC) and insula.  We will examine the effect of various\n      stimulation parameters on behavior as well as on task based activation and resting state\n      functional connectivity (rsFC) during fMRI scanning.\n\n      Study population: Up to 40 healthy adults who are non-smokers will be enrolled to achieve 28\n      completers.\n\n      Design: Within subject design with each subject completing 4 sessions: rTMS at two different\n      stimulation frequencies and a third sham session.\n\n      Outcome measures:  Behavior on a decision making task and task based and resting state blood\n      oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) activation in neural circuits relevant to nicotine addiction\n      during fMRI scanning."

A woman is considered of childbearing potential\n                  unless post-menopausal or surgically sterilized. Female patients of childbearing\n                  potential who are or who anticipate the possibility of becoming sexually active\n                  with a male partner must use either: (1) contraceptive pill or intrauterine\n                  device (IUD) or depot hormonal preparation (ring, injection implant); and/or (2)\n                  a barrier method of contraception such as diaphragm, sponge with spermicide, or\n                  condom. Women who are not sexually active do not have to agree to use one of the\n                  acceptable contraception methods.  Contraceptive measures will be reviewed with\n                  female subjects at each visit prior to the TMS session.\n\n        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:< TAB>\n\n          1.

Current use, or use in the past 4 weeks of any investigational drug or of any\n             medications with psychotropic, anti or pro-convulsive action\n\n          4. Increased intracranial pressure (lowers seizure threshold)\n\n          5.

History of myocardial infarction, angina, congestive heart failure, cardiomyopathy,\n             stroke or transient ischemic attack, or any heart condition currently under medical\n             care.\n\n          7.
