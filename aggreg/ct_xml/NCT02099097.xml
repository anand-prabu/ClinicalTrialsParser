    <description>on smoking abstinence and relapse prevention. We will examine time to smoking relapse following hospitalization, measured as part of the follow-up Smoking Status 1 and 3 months following enrollment. We will also biochemically verify 7-day point prevalence smoking abstinence at the 3 month follow-up assessment.</description>

    <description>All patients will receive our standard of care: 4 cessation counseling telephone (or face to face) sessions, self-help print material written specifically for tobacco-dependent cancer patients and individualized recommendations for cessation medication. Cessation counseling will be provided by trained oncology nurses certified as tobacco treatment specialists (TTS) who follow evidence based behavioral and pharmacological best practices in treating tobacco dependence.5 After patients consent to the study, the initial counseling session focuses on motivation-building, choosing a quit date, if applicable, reviewing the self-help guide, and education about cessation pharmacotherapies. The second counseling session will focus on coping with smoking urges and preventing smoking relapse. Delivered within one month following hospitalization, the third and fourth counseling sessions focus on relapse prevention or recycling to a repeat quit attempt for those who have resumed smoking.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Smokers randomly assigned to SC+SCCS/Quit IT will receive all the components of Standard Care. The patient will be oriented and trained face-to-face (during their hospitalization) on use of the game by study staff using an iPad. The orientation and training session will comprise: 1) Overview of the game and its objectives; 2) discussion of the rules of the game; 3) watching a 10 minute tutorial given by the game narrator (avatar); 4) answering all patient questions; and 5) evaluation of the patient's comprehension of game play via a 15 question survey.</description>
