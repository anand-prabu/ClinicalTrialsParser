    <textblock>
      This prospective cohort study will provide information about: characteristics of Rivaroxaban
      use in patients who are prescribed Rivaroxaban for the first time compared to patients who
      are prescribed Phenprocoumon for the first time, the occurrence of intracranial haemorrhage,
      gastrointestinal and urogenital bleeding, and the occurrence of non-infective liver disease.
