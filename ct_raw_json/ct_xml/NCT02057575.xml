  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this double-masked, randomized, parallel-group study is to evaluate the
      ocular hypotensive efficacy of a fixed combination of latanoprost and AR-13324 (PG324)
      relative to its individual components in patients with open angle glaucoma or ocular
      hypertension.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  18 years of age or greater.

          -  Diagnosis of open angle glaucoma (OAG) or ocular hypertension (OHT).

          -  Corrected visual acuity in each eye +1.0 logMAR or better by ETDRS in each eye
             (equivalent to 20/200)

          -  Able and willing to give signed informed consent and follow study instructions.

          -  Additional protocol-specific criteria may apply

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Glaucoma: pseudoexfoliation or pigment dispersion component, history of angle
             closure, or narrow angles.

          -  Known hypersensitivity to any component of the formulation (benzalkonium chloride,
             etc.), latanoprost, or to topical anesthetics.

          -  Previous glaucoma intraocular surgery or glaucoma laser procedures in study eye(s)

          -  Refractive surgery in study eye(s) (e.g., radial keratotomy, PRK, LASIK, etc.)

          -  Ocular trauma within the six months prior to screening, or ocular surgery or laser
             treatment within the three months prior to screening.

          -  Clinically significant ocular disease (e.g. corneal edema, uveitis, severe
             keratoconjunctivitis sicca) which might interfere with the study, including
             glaucomatous damage so severe that washout of ocular hypotensive medications for one
             month is not judged safe (e.g., cup-disc ratio &gt; 0.8).

          -  Clinically significant abnormalities (as determined by the investigator) in
             laboratory tests at screening.

          -  Clinically significant systemic disease (e.g., uncontrolled diabetes, myasthenia
             gravis, hepatic, renal, endocrine or cardiovascular disorders) which might interfere
             with the study.

          -  Women of childbearing potential who are pregnant, nursing, planning a pregnancy, or
             not using a medically acceptable form of birth control.  An adult woman is considered
             to be of childbearing potential unless she is one year post-menopausal or three
             months post-surgical sterilization.  All females of childbearing potential must have
             a negative urine pregnancy test result at the screening examination and must not
             intend to become pregnant during the study.

          -  Additional protocol-specific criteria may apply
