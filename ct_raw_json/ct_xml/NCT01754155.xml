  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to use Radiostereometric Analysis (RSA) and clinical outcome
      measures to evaluate early, post-operative implant stability, post-operative implant
      fixation, clinical performance, and in-vivo wear of the Zimmer® Continuum® Cup with vitamin
      E stabilized polyethylene.
