            "textblock": "Breastfeeding is one of the prime factors of long-term health protection in newborns, for\n      nutritional, immunological and developmental reasons. In France there is a wide\n      inter-regional variability of breastfeeding rates at discharge. This variability associates\n      different factors involving both, mothers, birth conditions, newborns and mother-child\n      couple. Some approaches, including osteopathy, aim to support early breastfeeding\n      difficulties. As many others non-conventional medicines, there is a huge and growing\n      interest for this alternative therapy and a spontaneous recourse in the first months of\n      life. Nevertheless, neither efficacy nor the benefits have been studied. Thus, our objective\n      is to evaluate for the first time in France, in a randomized, double-blinded design, the\n      efficacy of early osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT), in suboptimal breastfeeding\n      behaviour healthy newborns.\n\n      128 couples mother-child will be randomized in two groups: with or without osteopathic\n      intervention on the newborn."
