Combining more than one drug with radiation therapy and/or\n      surgery may kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy, consisting\n      of gemcitabine and cisplatin, followed by chemotherapy and radiation therapy and/or surgery\n      in treating patients who have pancreatic cancer."

Following gemcitabine,\n      patients receive cisplatin IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15. Course is repeated every 4\n      weeks. After 2 courses of induction chemotherapy, disease is restaged.\n\n      Patients may then receive radiotherapy in addition to chemotherapy. Radiotherapy is given\n      daily for 5 weeks and 3 days. During radiotherapy, cohorts of 3 patients are treated with\n      escalating doses of gemcitabine and cisplatin administered as described above in induction\n      chemotherapy. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is defined as the lowest dose at which no\n      more than 2 of 6 or 2 of 3 patients experience dose limiting toxicity. When the MTD has been\n      determined, additional patients accrued into the study receive the dose level immediately\n      below the MTD.\n\n      If after 2 courses of induction chemotherapy with gemcitabine and cisplatin the tumor is\n      radiographically considered resectable by operating surgeon, the patient undergoes surgical\n      exploration or laparoscopy for staging and verification of resectability. If the tumor is\n      found to be resectable without evidence of distant disease, the patient undergoes complete\n      surgical resection and radiation plus adjuvant gemcitabine and cisplatin.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months until death.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 15-36 patients will be accrued for the Phase I portion of\n      this study and there will be 14-25 patients accrued into the Phase II portion of this study."
