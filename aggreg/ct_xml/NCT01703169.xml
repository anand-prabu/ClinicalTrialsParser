  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesis is that eltrombopag given to patients with moderate to very
      severe aplastic anemia will result in an increase in platelet counts. The investigators
      hypothesize that in patients with moderate to very severe aplastic anemia, treatment with
      eltrombopag will lead to fewer platelet transfusions, red blood cell transfusions, and fewer
      bleeding events. The investigators hypothesize that in patients with moderate to very severe
      aplastic anemia, eltrombopag will have an acceptable toxicity rate &lt;3%, at doses that result
      in increased platelet counts. Finally the investigators hypothesize that plasma eltrombopag
      levels in peripheral blood will correlate with improved platelet counts.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Able to provide written informed consent and any other authorizations required by
             local law (e.g., Protected Health Information [PHI])

          -  Have severe or very severe aplastic anemia, or moderate aplastic anemia with platelet
             counts that have dropped below 20,000/μl

          -  Have moderate, severe, or very severe aplastic anemia with moderate bleeding during
             or after a surgical procedure, (including bone marrow biopsy, lumbar puncture,
             thoracentesis, paracentesis, port placement, dermal biopsy) or minimal mucocutaneous
             bleeding otherwise noted

          -  Subjects with current or previous exposure to approved medications for the treatment
             of aplastic anemia will not be excluded; these include but may not be limited to,
