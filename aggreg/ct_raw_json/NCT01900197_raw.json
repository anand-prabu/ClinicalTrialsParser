The number of patient visits depends on the number of Monofer\u00ae treatment\n      courses needed during the study period. Each patient can receive one or more treatment\n      courses during 12 months after informed consent. The last blood test will be taken after the\n      last Monofer\u00ae treatment course which might occur 13-15 months after Informed consent.\n      Patients will only attend hospital visits planned as part of their standard treatment.\n      However, in the case the first treatment course lasts longer than 12 months, the\n      observational period for that subject will be extended with an additional 12 months of\n      observational period or until a second treatment course is needed, whichever comes first.\n      Despite the length of observational period, the patient will receive treatment as a part of\n      standard care and according to the doctor's discretion. Each treatment course can consist of\n      one or more Monofer\u00ae administrations. For each administration of Monofer\u00ae either intravenous\n      infusion or injection can be used.\n\n      Pre- and post-treatment blood tests according to standard treatment are a part of the\n      Monofer\u00ae treatment course.\n\n      DATA COLLECTION:\n\n        -  Clinical data management will be performed in accordance with applicable standards and\n           data cleaning procedures.\n\n        -  The collected data will systematically be entered into an eCRF (MyEDC, Biostata). The\n           source of information is the relevant laboratory results obtained from the patient\n           record.\n\n        -  The data will be evaluated by the Pharmacosmos A/S Medical Affairs team.\n\n      Laboratory assessments, i.e. anemia work-up/treatment evaluation, shall be a part of local\n      standard practice. The protocol does not accept any additional samples outside current local\n      standard practice to be taken."
