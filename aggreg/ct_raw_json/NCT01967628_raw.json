            "textblock": "For most individuals, the lung has a remarkable ability to deal with exposure to a variety\n      of inhaled bacteria. Some individuals, however, do have recurrent bacterial infections,\n      usually in the form of acute or chronic bronchitis and, in some instances, pneumonia. The\n      reasons for this variability in bacterial infections between otherwise healthy subjects,\n      between types of lung disease, and within the same type of lung disease are poorly\n      understood.\n\n      Variability in susceptibility to bacterial infections is partially explained by differences\n      in exposure to infectious agents, genetic susceptibility and innate (or early) immune\n      responses. It is of interest that the incidence and severity of bacterial infections is\n      greatest during the winter months. Other than viral infections, there are few variables that\n      change with season. Vitamin D is one known immune modulator with a seasonal periodicity. The\n      hypothesis of this study is that levels of vitamin D are an important determinant of the\n      innate defense of the lung against inhaled bacteria. The investigators further postulate\n      that vitamin D has effects on the innate immune function of both alveolar macrophages and\n      lung epithelial cells."
