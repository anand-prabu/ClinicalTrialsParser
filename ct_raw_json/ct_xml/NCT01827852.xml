  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective observational study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of first-line
      Avastin (bevacizumab) in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy in different age
      groups (&lt;60, 60-69, 70-79, &gt;80 years) in patients with inoperable advanced, metastatic or
      recurrent adenocarcinoma non-small cell lung cancer. Patients will be followed for 18 months
      from the start of first-line therapy.
