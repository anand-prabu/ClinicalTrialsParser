  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Water-aided insertion of the colonoscope has been repeatedly proven to beneficial in terms
      of lower discomfort and need for sedation during colonoscopy. Patients with inflammatory
      bowel diseases (IBD) undergo repeated colonoscopy in course of their disease. According to
      our preliminary experience, water immersion could be beneficial while scoping these
      patients. As far as the investigators know, water-aided colonoscopy has never been studied
      in this indication. Results of our trial might support use of water-aided colonoscopy in
      common practice and decrease associated discomfort in IBD patients.
