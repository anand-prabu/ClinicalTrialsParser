The behavior change strategies and content will be derived from the same\n      behavior change theory (the Transtheoretical Model [TTM]). A representative sample of ~1200\n      adults from a large urban area will be recruited through a list-assisted telephone list\n      which will be bought by the University of Rhode Island so that subjects can be randomized\n      into one of three groups: a Web-based system (WEB- DIET), a computer telephone system (TLC\n      [Telephone Linked Communications]-DIET), or assessment only control. The study hypotheses,\n      which will be evaluated both at the end of the 6-month intervention period and at the end of\n      18-month follow-up (post-baseline) observation period, are: 1. TLC-DIET> Control 2.\n      WEB-DIET> Control 3. WEB-DIET> TLC-DIET."
