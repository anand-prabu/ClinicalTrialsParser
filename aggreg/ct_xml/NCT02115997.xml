  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a perspective, phase IV, multi-center, single arm, open-label, interventional study
      in adult patients with Wegener's granulomatosis (granulomatosis with polyangiitis   GPA) or
      microscopic polyangiitis. Patients will be treated with Ristova and glucocorticoids. Ristova
      will be administered by intravenous (IV) infusion at a dose of 375 mg/m2 body surface area
      once weekly during Weeks 1 to 4. Patients will also receive one or three pulses of
      methylprednisolone (1000 mg each), followed by a tapering dose of oral prednisolone (start
      dose of 1 mg per kilogram per day). The dose of oral prednisone will be reduced as per
      evaluation by the investigator till the patient is completely off the drug. The patients
      will be followed up for duration of 6 months from the date of starting Ristova therapy with
      three follow-up visits at Days 52, 112 and 172. All adverse events occurring during this
      period will be captured.
