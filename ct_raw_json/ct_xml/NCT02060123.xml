      telomerase activity in Chinese women with a history of intimate partner violence.

    <textblock>
      Qigong is a mind-body exercise rooted in the paradigm of traditional Chinese medicine,
      aiming to achieve a harmonious flow of energy (qi) in the body through gentle movements and
      is thus considered as a holistic health practice towards promoting physical and mental
      well-being and improving longevity. It was suggested that qigong exercise, as a stress
      management strategy, could be effective in improving psychological symptoms, as well as
      enhancing cellular telomerase activity by reducing oxidative stress level and regulating
      immune response.

      The study is to evaluate the effects of a qigong intervention on telomerase activity and
      pro-inflammation cytokines, perceived stress, perceived coping, and depressive symptoms in
      Chinese women with a history of intimate partner violence. The study design is a randomized,
      wait-list controlled design with intervention and wait-list control groups. A total of 240
      Chinese abused women will be recruited. The qigong intervention program consists of: (i) a
      2-hr group qigong training twice a week for 6 weeks; (ii) weekly group follow-up of a 1-hour
      group qigong exercise for 4 months; and (iii) self-practice of qigong exercise for 30
      minutes each day throughout the intervention period lasting 5.5 months. It is hypothesized
      that the participants in the intervention group will have higher levels of telomerase
      activity and perceived coping, and lower levels of pro-inflammation cytokines, perceived
      stress, and depressive symptoms, on completion of a qigong intervention program, compared to
      abused Chinese women in the wait-list control group.
