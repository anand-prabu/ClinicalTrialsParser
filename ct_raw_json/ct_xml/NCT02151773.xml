      The purpose of this survey  is to assess the safety freeze-dried live attenuated measles and
      rubella combined vaccine (Schwarz FF-8 strain/TO-336 strain) (freeze-dried live attenuated
      measles and rubella combined vaccine &quot;Takeda&quot;) in terms of the occurrence of unknown/known
      adverse drug reactions and factors that may influence the safety of vaccinees after the
      first vaccination.

      This survey was designed to assess the safety of live attenuated measles and rubella
      combined vaccine (Schwarz FF-8 strain/TO-336 strain) (freeze-dried live attenuated measles
      and rubella combined vaccine &quot;Takeda&quot;) in terms of the occurrence of unknown/known adverse
      drug reactions and factors that may influence the safety of vaccinees after the first
      vaccination.

      Freeze-dried live attenuated measles and rubella combined vaccine (Schwarz FF-8
      strain/TO-336 strain) is dissolved in 0.7 mL of accompanying reconstitution fluid (water for
      injection [Japanese Pharmacopoeia]), wherein a 0.5-mL portion is typically administered
      subcutaneously as a single dose.

      In addition, freeze-dried live attenuated measles and rubella combined vaccine (Schwarz FF-8
      strain/TO-336 strain) should be used in accordance with the &quot;Regulations for Vaccination&quot;
      and the &quot;Guidelines for Routine Vaccination.&quot;
