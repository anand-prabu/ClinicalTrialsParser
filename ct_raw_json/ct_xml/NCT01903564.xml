  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fetal research and clinical practice has been hampered by a lack of suitable investigational
      techniques.  Currently, ultrasound is the only widely used method of studying fetal anatomy
      and physiology, but it has significant limitations for assessment of cardiac rhythm. The
      proposed study will allow us to investigate fetal magnetocardiography (fMCG) as a new tool
      for the study of normal and abnormal fetal heart rate and rhythm, with a goal of
      demonstrating probable benefit from use of the device in patients with serious fetal
      arrhythmia.  We propose a study that will last 1-2 years and will provide data to aid in
      assessing the safety and effectiveness of fMCG for diagnosis and management of patients with
      abnormal fetal heart rate and rhythm.  We hope that the data from the study will support a
      Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE) application for the subject device.  The safety and
      efficacy study designs are described below.  High-risk subjects will undergo
      echocardiography as part of their routine clinical management, and our results will be
      compared to the echocardiography results, as well as with postnatal ECG, when available.
      (Since many arrhythmias resolve prior to birth, either due to resolution of disease or due
      to treatment, only a limited number of diseases allow postnatal comparison).  For rhythms
      that persist after birth, the diagnostic utility of fMCG and echocardiography will be
      assessed by computing the sensitivity (Sn) and specificity (Sp) relative to postnatal ECG
      for the following prenatal modalities: (i) the fMCG, (ii) the original (referral) echo,
      (iii) if available, the in-lab echocardiogram at the time of the fMCG study.  Secondary
      endpoints will assess changes in diagnosis and in clinical management due to the additional
      information provided by fMCG, compared to the information provided by echocardiography
      alone.

        We plan to study a total of 125 subjects.  Twenty-five will be pregnant women with
        uncomplicated pregnancies; 100 will be pregnant women with pregnancies complicated by
        fetal arrhythmia or a condition that puts the fetus at risk of fetal arrhythmia. We refer
        to these cases as &quot;high-risk&quot; due to the presence of or risk of arrhythmia to the fetus.
        The pregnant mothers will be age 18 or older.  They will be studied as early as 15 weeks'
        gestation and may be asked to return about once every 4 weeks, if their physician
        determines that additional fMCG studies are necessary.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Normal subjects: normal, healthy adult women with uncomplicated pregnancies

        High-risk cohort: The primary inclusion criterion is diagnosis of serious fetal
        arrhythmia, which is defined as sustained low or high heart rate.  Low heart rate, or
        bradycardia, and high heart rate, or tachycardia, are based on normative values for
        gestation (usually below 110 -120 beats/min, or above 160-180 beats/min).  Intermittent
        bradycardia and tachycardia are also important to detect because these arrhythmias may
        become incessant over the course of pregnancy and have implications for patient
        management.  Abnormal repolarization, such as long QT syndrome (LQTS), is another
        important class of arrhythmia.  Fetuses with a family history of LQTS or a suspicious
        rhythm (low heart rate, intermittent AV block, or ventricular tachycardia) will also be
        studied.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        The pregnant women subjects must by aged 18 or older.  They may be excluded if they have a
        pacemaker or other device that produces large magnetic interference.  Pacemakers in a
        sensing mode typically do not produce large magnetic interference.  High-risk subjects
        cannot participate if their physician in consultation with the lead physician of the study
        does not grant permission for them to participate in the study due to risk of travel or
        other reason.
