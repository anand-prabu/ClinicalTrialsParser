            "textblock": "Current therapeutic options for myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are limited and, aside from\n      bone marrow transplantation, none have proven superior to supportive measures alone.\n      Preclinical investigations have indicated the potential therapeutic role for vitamin D in\n      the treatment of MDS. However, because of the dose-limiting toxicity of hypercalcemia, past\n      clinical trials with vitamin D have been forced  to utilize low doses, with promising but\n      inconsistent results.\n\n      This study utilizes a dosing schema of dexamethasone (Dex) and calcitriol (the active form\n      of vitamin D) that augments the therapeutic index of calcitriol, and allows for safe\n      administration of 5-10 times higher dose of calcitriol than previously has been used in\n      clinical trials for MDS. Patients will receive dexamethasone 4 times per week and calcitriol\n      3 times per week. This schedule will continue weekly until patients are off study. The dose\n      of calcitriol will be increased until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined.\n      History and physical examination, blood monitoring, urinary ultrasounds, and bone marrow\n      aspirations and biopsies will be used to assess disease response."
