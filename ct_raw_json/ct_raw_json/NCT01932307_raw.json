Instructional videos outlining the program along with\n      surveys designed to assess attitude towards neck health will be distributed to first year\n      general surgery residents at the University of British Columbia (UBC) through their required\n      online curriculum webpage. A followup survey will be administered 10 weeks later to\n      determine efficacy of the program through self-reported adherence and changes in attitude\n      towards neck health."

            "textblock": "1. Purpose:\n\n           To evaluate the efficacy of a pre-operative 2-minute exercise program in reducing\n           surgical residents self-reported neck pain.\n\n        2. Hypothesis:\n\n           A 10 week 2-minute neck strengthening exercise program completed between cases will\n           reduce self-reported chronic neck pain caused by the use of surgical instruments and\n           increase musculoskeletal health awareness in a group of residents.\n\n        3. Justification:\n\n           Surgical residents will be asked to complete a baseline survey regarding their\n           self-rated neck pain.  Then they will be introduced to a 2-minute neck strengthening\n           exercise to be performed in between surgical cases.  They will be asked to evaluate\n           their neck pain again 10 weeks later.\n\n           Neck pain experience before and after the introduction of neck exercises will be\n           compared.\n\n        4. Objectives:\n\n             1. Define the problem through prevalence data in a sample of surgeons.\n\n             2. Understand qualitatively and quantitatively measures of pain and quality on\n                residents.\n\n             3. Evaluate the efficacy of a pre-operative 2-minute exercise program.\n\n             4. Disseminate our results and change the cultural norms of practice.\n\n        5. Research Method:\n\n           All first year general surgery residents at the University of British Columbia will be\n           invited to participate.  They will be asked to complete a survey regarding neck pain\n           experience and introduced to a 2-minute neck muscle exercise video which they will be\n           advised to follow for the next 10 weeks.  Another follow-up survey will be sent at the\n           end of 10 weeks.\n\n        6. Statistical analysis:\n\n      Percentage of residents showing >50% improvement using an alpha of 0.05 statistical\n      significance will be the primary outcome measure using the appropriate validated pain\n      questionnaire. The attitude of the residents towards their neck health before the\n      intervention will be compared to their attitudes at the completion of the study using a\n      Pearson's chi squared test as a measure of significant difference.  The self-reported\n      effectiveness and adherence of the program at the completion of the study will be used as a\n      measure of efficacy. All statistical analysis will be conducted in SAS 9.3."
