  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study examines the hemodynamic and hemolytic properties of two additional smaller size
      valves to the On-X line of valves already approved by FDA.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to assess the safety and efficacy of the 17mm On-X Aortic
      Prosthetic Heart Valve and  the 23mm On-X Mitral Prosthetic Heart Valve when used to replace
      diseased mitral valves in human subjects.

      The On-X 17mm aortic and 23mm mitral valves will be implanted in approximately 20 and at
      least 15 patients per size and each will be followed for at least 1 year. Patients will be
      any age and will require these size valves as determined in surgery but will be recruited
      prior to surgery based on results of preoperative screening tests.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients of any age, assent of the patient and consent of parent or authorized legal
             representative is required if a patient is under the age of majority and not legally
             emancipated.

          2. Patients who are sufficiently ill to warrant replacement of their diseased natural or
             prosthetic valve, based on standard cardiovascular diagnostic workups.

          3. Patients who are in sufficient satisfactory condition, based on the physical exam and
             investigator's experience, to be an average or better operative risk,  (i.e., likely
             to survive one year postoperatively).

          4. Patients who require an isolated aortic valve replacement size 17 mm or isolated
             mitral valve replacement size 23mm.

          5. Patients who are geographically stable and willing to return to the implanting center
             for follow-up visits.

          6. Patients who are adequately informed of their participation in the clinical study and
             what will be required of them in order to comply with the protocol.

          7. Patients requiring concomitant cardiovascular surgery, such as coronary bypass may be
             included in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        1. Patients who are pregnant, planning to become pregnant or are lactating. 2 Patients who
        have a noncardiac progressive disease, which in the investigator's experience produces an
        unacceptable increased risk to the patient.

        3 Patients who have a documented history of substance (drug or alcohol) abuser or are
        prison inmates.

        4. Patients with a previous prosthetic valve, where it is not being replaced by a study
        valve, or patients requiring multiple valve replacement.

        5. Patients with active endocarditis or active myocarditis. 6 Patients who require
        tricuspid or pulmonic valve replacement. 7. Patients who have not agreed to return for the
        required number of follow-up visits or who are geographically unavailable for follow-up.

        8. Patients who cannot be maintained on long-term anticoagulant therapy. 9. Patients with
        non-cardiac illness resulting in a life expectancy of less than 1-year.

        10. Patients previously enrolled and implanted in this trial may not re-enter after
        withdrawal.

        11. Patients already enrolled in another investigational device or drug study (nor can
        enrolled patients be enrolled in other studies).

        12. Patients with acute preoperative neurological deficit, myocardial infarction, or
        cardiac event who have not returned to baseline for at least 30-days prior to enrollment.

        13. Patients with aortic aneurysm or other medical condition that creates a higher than
        usual risk of surgical complication.

        14.  Patients who are prisoners or mentally ill, and pediatric patients who are incapable
        of understanding their assent as judged by the principal investigator.
