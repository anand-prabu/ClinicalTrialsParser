  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The great saphenous vein is the most commonly used material in coronary vascular bridging
      operation. Coronary bypass operation to obtain the great saphenous vein is mainly through
      the incision open groin to ankle. This operation may damage the lymphatic, cause lymph
      circumfluence obstacle, cause fat liquefaction, scar formation, wound dehiscence, around
      hematoma and other a series of symptomsBased on some studies and our experience that vacuum
      assisted closure （VAC）is effective in complex wound failures following Stripping saphenous
      vein, we use VAC to prevent seroma formation after Stripping saphenous vein in Coronary
      bypass. This study is aimed to evaluate the efficacy, safety and economics benefits of early
      VAC application on postoperative complications and wound healing after Stripping saphenous
      vein in Coronary bypass in comparison to conventional suction drain.
