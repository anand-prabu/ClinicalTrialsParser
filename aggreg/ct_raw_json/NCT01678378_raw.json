The\n      goal of this study is to examine the effectiveness of the School Health Center Healthy\n      Adolescent Relationships Program (SHARP) intervention in SHCs on individual SHC clients, the\n      SHC clinic environment, and the schools in which the SHCs are located. Evaluation of the\n      intervention will involve random assignment of eight comparable SHCs in the Greater Bay Area\n      of California that provide comprehensive health services, to either intervention or control\n      sites. Adolescent females and males ages 14-19 seeking care at any of these SHCs (N=1200)\n      will be assessed via audio computer-assisted survey instrument (ACASI) at baseline and 16-20\n      weeks follow-up to examine intervention effects on knowledge and self-efficacy regarding\n      ARA, harm reduction and ARA-related resources as well as intentions to intervene with peers.\n      For youth reporting recent ARA victimization, the investigators will assess for increases in\n      ARA disclosure, resource utilization, as well as reduction in ARA victimization."
