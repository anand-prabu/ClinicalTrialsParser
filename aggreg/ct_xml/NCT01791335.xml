  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Noninvasive ventilation (NIV) can provide ventilatory support in selected patients with
      acute respiratory failure, for instance due to acute exacerbation of COPD and acute heart
      failure. Advantages of noninvasive ventilation compared to invasive mechanical ventilation
      include absence of complications associated with endotracheal intubation, lower risk of
      pneumonia, lower level or even absence of sedation and the ability of the patient to
      verbally communicate. However, in approximately 30% of patients NIV fails and endotracheal
      intubation is needed to provide optimal ventilatory support. Surprisingly, very few studies
      have investigated why patients fail on NIV. Clinical observations indicated that agitation,
      delirium and most importantly asynchrony between patient and ventilator play a role in
      unsuccessful support with NIV. The upper airways are bypassed during endotracheal
      intubation. However, with NIV the upper airways may play a role in the efficiency of
      ventilatory support. In normal breathing the upper airways actively dilate before initiation
      of inspiratory flow. This is a highly appropriate response as it prevents narrowing of the
      upper airways during inspiration, which would result in elevated inspiratory resistance.
      Experiments in newborn lambs have shown that NIV has profound effects on physiology of the
      upper airways. Positive pressure during inspiration results in constriction of upper airway
      muscles in the early phase of inspiration. This results in elevated upper airway resistance
      with lower tidal volume delivered to the lungs. Subsequent studies revealed that reflexes
      that mediate this response originate in vagal afferences located in the lower airways. From
      an evolutionary point of view this might be an appropriate response, as high pressure
      delivered to the lungs may induce barotraumas. However, these responses may negatively
      affect the efficiency of ventilatory support delivered during NIV. The understanding of
      upper airway constriction and dilation during NIV is rudimentary. This study aims at
      determining the effect of NIV on regulation of upper airway patency in patients with COPD.

        The patient population for this study will be included from the intensive care. All
        patients at the intensive care unit who are in clinical need of noninvasive mechanical
        ventilation  due to hypercapnic COPD and with a NAVA catheter in situ, will be screened
        and asked for informed consent to participate.
