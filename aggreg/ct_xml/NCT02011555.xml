  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since the 1950s, it has been known that lower doses of primaquine can be highly effective at
      reducing gametocyte carriage and infectivity to mosquitoes. Evidence suggests that doses as
      low as 0.1 mg/kg could be effective and low dose primaquine is likely to have an improved
      safety profile, especially on those with G6PD deficiency.

      The first step is to identify the lowest efficacious dose in those with the lowest safety
      risk. This investigation has just been recommended as having the highest priority by the
      World Health Organisation Global Malaria Programme Malaria Policy Advisory Committee.  Thus,
      we plan a dose escalation study to identify the lowest efficacious dose in malaria infected
      G6PD normal adults which can prevent transmission in mosquitoes.

      In addition, we will also carry out a feeding experiment.  A. dirus mosquitoes will be fed
      on P.falciparum infected blood meal through a membrane feed before and after administration
      of primaquine at -0.5, 0, and 24 hours and after 2 and 7 days. Infectivity to mosquitoes
      will be measured by the presence of oocysts and sporozoites respectively at 7-9 and 14-16
      days post infected blood meal.

      This is a phase 2a dose escalation study. The study design is adaptive, meaning that earlier
      doses of drug tested will inform on whether a subsequent group is needed.The study will be
      conducted sequentially:

        1. Adult G6PD-normal malaria patients will be enrolled and treated with Dihydroartemisinin
           - Piperaquine (DP) and increasing doses of primaquine (PQ). The effect on gametocytes
           will be measured. Blood samples for membrane feeding experiments will be collected. The
           safety of study participants, specifically signs of hemolysis will be closely followed.

        2. Blood from study participants will be used in membrane feeding experiments. The
           primaquine doses will be increased until no oocysts can be detected in membrane feeding
           experiments.

      The intervention will be a dose escalation study in groups of 10 G6PD-normal participants.
      They will each receive between 0 and 0.5mg/kg. A control group will receive DP without
      primaquine.

      The first 10 participants will be randomly allocated to each treatment groups 1, 3, and 5
      (30 participants in total). Due to the adaptive design, subsequent groups will not be
      randomized. Once the membrane feeding experiments as well as the 28 follow-up have been
      completed the findings will be reviewed by the investigators. If there is evidence that
      mosquitoes have become infected the next higher primaquine dose will be administered to the
      next group (10 study participants). The DSMC will review the results and decide either to
      proceed or not to the next group. We will follow the dosing groups outlined below:

        -  first group (total number 10) : Will be treated with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine
           (DP) and will not get primaquine(PQ),

        -  Second group (total number 10): Will be treated with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine
           (DP) and very low dose of (0.125 mg/kg) primaquine(PQ)

        -  Third group (total number 10): Will be treated with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP)
           and low dose of (0.5 mg/kg) primaquine(PQ)

      After this, the study drug will be given with next higher PQ dose:

        -  Fourth group (total number 10): Will be treated with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine
           (DP) and dose of 0.0625/kg primaquine(PQ)

        -  Fifth group (total number 10): Will be treated with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP)
           and a dose of 0.25mg/kg primaquine(PQ)

        -  Sixth group (total number 10): Will be treated with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP)
           and a dose of primaquine(PQ) (which we will know after we have the result of PQ highest
           group)

      Doses will be given on the first day of treatment.
