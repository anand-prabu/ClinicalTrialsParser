Karnovsky performance status of < 60\n\n               2. Inadequate venous access (two antecubital or equivalent venous access sites are\n                  required for study drug injection and PK blood sampling, respectively)\n\n               3. Patient received a permanent prostate brachytherapy implant within the last 3\n                  months (for Pd-103 implants) or 12 months (for I-125 implants)\n\n               4.

Prior radiation therapy or chemotherapy within 2 weeks prior to study\n                  radiotracer administration (Washout is one half-life of the drug or 2 weeks,\n                  whichever is longest).\n\n              10.
