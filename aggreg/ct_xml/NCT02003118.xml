        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patient is between 40 and 75 years of age with a clinical diagnosis of OA of the knee for
        more than 6 months prior to Visit 1 based on clinical and radiographic criteria, and being
        of American Rheumatism Association (ARA) functional Class I, II, or III. Patients should
        have an average pain level of between 4 and 8 on a Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) for at least
        5 of 7 days before the randomisation, when answering the question: Please, rate the
        average pain in your index knee during the last 24 hours. Prior to the study, patients
        should have been using pharmacological treatments, such as Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory
        Drug (NSAIDs), acetaminophen or weak opioids for their OA pain on a regular basis (defined
        as having used NSAIDs, acetaminophen or weak opioids at least 10 days out of 30 days
        during the last month prior to the screening visit).

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patient has a concurrent medical/arthritic disease that could confound or interfere with
        evaluation of efficacy.

        Patients with impaired renal function, defined as an estimated creatinine clearance less
        than or equal to 50 ml/min, or patients taking medications that might impair renal
        function.

        Patient has New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III-IV congestive heart failure.

        The patient has a history of uncontrolled hypertension or a current blood pressure that in
        the opinion of the Investigator makes the patient unsuitable for the study.

        Patients with a trauma or surgery at the index knee within 3 months prior to screening.
