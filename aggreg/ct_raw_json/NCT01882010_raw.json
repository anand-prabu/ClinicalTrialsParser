            "textblock": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive and disabling neurological disorder involving the\n      nigrostriatum and for which no cure is known. Evidence suggests that inflammation\n      contributes, significantly, to the cause and/or progression of the disease. Studies in\n      postmortem human brain, animal models, and human peripheral blood support the idea that the\n      frequency and function of particular circulating T cell subsets are abnormal and worsen as\n      disease progresses. This abnormality is linked specifically to increases in numbers of T\n      effector neurodestructive cells (Teff) and to dysfunction of regulatory T cells (Treg) that\n      control Teff.  This imbalance tips the homeostatic balance to a pro-inflammatory profile\n      with limited control.  Nonetheless, whether such T cell deficits are a cause of PD or a\n      reaction to it remains unknown.  If these deficits are causal or exacerbative, then\n      correcting the deficit could have significant positive effects on disease progression and\n      could ameliorate nigrostriatal degeneration or its sequelae.  Granulocyte macrophage colony\n      stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is a potential immunomodulatory therapeutic for PD to increase\n      Treg numbers or function and reduce or transform proinflammatory Teff responses, leading to\n      neuroprotection of the nigrostriatum and improved clinical outcomes for disease.\n      Recombinant human GM-CSF (sargramostim) is available as Leukine\u00ae.  The purpose of this study\n      is to determine if Leukine (sargramostim) can be safely administered to Parkinson's disease\n      patients for an extended period of time (56 days).\n\n      In a previous study conducted at the University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC) using\n      samples of whole blood, PD patients showed differences from caregiver controls according to\n      results from complete blood count (CBC) with white blood cell (WBC) differential,\n      fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis for T cell markers, and Treg functional\n      assays.  These immune aberrations correlated with motor dysfunction as determined by\n      Parkinson's disease rating scale (UPDRS) part III assessments.  In this pilot study, the\n      effect of Leukine treatment on immune deficits in PD patients will be monitored.  Immune\n      cell analyses of whole blood, motor assessments, and physical examinations and blood\n      analyses for safety, will be conducted before, during, and after Leukine or placebo\n      treatment of PD patients, and using healthy controls during baseline data collection before\n      drug treatment.  Initially, 16 PD patients and 16 controls will be recruited.  Subjects will\n      be drawn from the previous study.  Enrollment will be supplemented as needed with patients\n      from Neurology Consultants of Nebraska-PC, UNMC Neurological Sciences, or recruitment\n      through the American Parkinson's Disease Association.  Enrollment will be staggered, and\n      additional subjects will be recruited as needed to replace any withdrawing participants,\n      with the goal of 32 subjects, 16 PD patients and 16 controls, completing the study.\n\n      At enrollment and repeating again at two 4-week intervals, whole blood from PD patients and\n      controls will be obtained percutaneously using standard sterile techniques.  CBC with WBC\n      differential, FACS analysis for T cell markers, and Treg functional assays will be performed\n      and used to calculate immune response profiles as a baseline for comparison after drug\n      treatment.  Blood chemistries will be analyzed including liver enzymes, electrolytes, blood\n      urea nitrogen, creatinine, total protein, albumin and bilirubin levels, and anti-GM-CSF\n      antibodies will be assessed in PD patients. PD patients will be evaluated by physical and\n      clinical examinations, including UPDRS part III assessments for evaluation of motor\n      function.\n\n      PD patients will then be randomized into two groups, placebo (n=8) and Leukine (n=8), and\n      participation of the controls will end.  Patients entered into the study will not have any\n      noted co-morbid conditions including infection, inflammatory or cancerous diseases and will\n      not be taking immunostimulatory or immunosuppressive medicines.  Patients will continue to\n      take medicines prescribed for the general treatment of PD, including, but not limited to,\n      dopamine or dopamine agonists.  There will be no history of prior surgeries linked to PD\n      treatment.  Patients will receive training for self-injection, and the treatment group will\n      self-administer Leukine (6 \u00b5g/kg) by subcutaneous injection daily for eight weeks.  The\n      placebo group will self-administer saline as placebo.  Every two weeks after the start of\n      treatment and again 4 weeks after cessation of administration, all PD patients, receiving\n      drug or placebo, will be evaluated by physical and clinical examinations, including UPDRS\n      part III assessments.  Every 2 weeks during Leukine treatment and again 4 weeks after\n      cessation of drug, whole blood from PD patients will be obtained percutaneously using\n      standard sterile techniques.  At weeks 2, 4 and 8, results from CBC with WBC differential,\n      FACS analysis for T cell markers, and Treg functional assays will be used to calculate\n      immune response profiles and compared with baseline values.  CBC with WBC differential,\n      total T cell count, and blood chemistries will be analyzed every 2 weeks for evidence of\n      potential toxicities, as well as 4 weeks after termination of Leukine treatment.  Levels of\n      anti-GM-CSF antibodies will be assessed for PD patients at enrollment and at 4 weeks\n      intervals during drug treatment and 4 weeks after termination.\n\n      An additional component of the study includes the development of magnetoencephalography\n      (MEG) as a monitoring tool for PD.  MEG provides a non-invasive method to study brain\n      activity.  Currently, there are not adequate assessment tools for monitoring disease\n      progression or treatment protocols in PD.  In preliminary experiments on PD patients and\n      their caregivers, MEG data have indicated strong beta synchronization during rest in PD and\n      milder beta desynchronization during movement preparation compared to age- and sex-matched\n      controls. In this study, the amplitude of this pathological beta\n      synchronization/desynchronization will be monitored to evaluate improvements in cortical\n      brain function of PD patients treated with Leukine.  MEG will be performed on PD patients\n      and controls at the start of drug treatment, and on PD patients at the end of the drug\n      treatment period and 4 weeks after drug is stopped."
