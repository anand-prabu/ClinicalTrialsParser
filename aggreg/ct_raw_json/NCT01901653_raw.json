Once a safe and tolerable dose is determined, the\n      anti-cancer activity of SC16LD6.5 will be assessed by measuring the extent of tumor\n      shrinkage. SC16LD6.5 is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC). The antibody (SC16) targets a\n      protein that appears to be expressed on the surface of most small cell lung cancers that\n      have been assessed using an immunohistochemical assay. The drug, D6.5, is a very potent form\n      of chemotherapy, specifically a DNA-damaging agent, that is cell cycle independent. ADC's\n      theoretically provide more precise delivery of chemotherapy to cancer cells, possibly\n      improving effectiveness relative to toxicities."
