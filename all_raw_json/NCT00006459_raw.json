Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

Patients are randomized to one of two\n      treatment arms. Patients receive paclitaxel with or without gemcitabine. Treatment continues\n      every 21 days in the absence of disease progression. Patients are followed every 2-4 months\n      for 2 years after active treatment.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Not specified\n\n      National Cancer Institute (NCI) registered this trial with Eli Lilly as sponsor.  NCI did\n      not update the record when the trial completed. In June 2012, NCI transferred the trial to\n      Lilly's clinicaltrials.gov account and Lilly updated the record with the trial completion\n      date.
