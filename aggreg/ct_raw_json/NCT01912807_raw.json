It is a commonly used and safe intervention that could potentially reduce the\n      amount of rescue antiemetic medications, improve recovery in same-day surgery pediatric\n      patients as well as the impact on patient and parents satisfaction after the procedure."

The intervention group will\n      receive D5NS at maintenance intravenous rate. The control group (150 patients) will receive\n      Normal Saline (NS) not containing dextrose at a similarly calculated intravenous rate.

As a second antiemetic, the control group will receive Ondansetron and the\n      intervention group will receive D5NS at an intravenous rate calculated based on their weight\n      and determined for the purpose of the study.\n\n      Patients will then undergo a general anesthetic maintained with a volatile anesthetic and\n      including endotracheal intubation, crystalloids (RL or NS) for IV fluid replacement therapy\n      as well as narcotics and other medications at the discretion of the anesthetic provider\n      based on the standard of care from the American Society of Anesthesiologists. While the\n      patient is asleep, under general anesthetic, the blood sugar level will be measure using a\n      chemstrip and a glucometer. There is no need to send any sample to the laboratory for\n      results.\n\n      The researchers will be in the Post Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU) in order to document the\n      measured outcomes at different times; immediate postoperative period and 2 hours\n      postoperatively / discharge time; as this is the length of stay in the PACU before\n      discharge.\n\n      The researchers will also follow up with the participants/parents 24 hours after discharge\n      via telephone and record the same outcome variables, including any medical attention sought\n      after discharge due to POV."
