            "textblock": "Research Question:\n\n      What effect if any does the use of lavender aromatherapy have on a patient's stress and\n      anxiety during the MRI procedure in the Cardiovascular Services Department?\n\n      Hypothesis:\n\n        1. The use of lavender aromatherapy will reduce anxiety by 20% during MRI procedures.\n\n        2. MRI cancellations related to stress and anxiety will decrease by 10%.\n\n      Sample size of 30 patients is needed for the control group and the lavender aromatherapy\n      group, for a total of 60 patients.\n\n      Rationale:\n\n      Patients undergoing MRI procedures may experience stress and anxiety related to the small\n      and confining space required during the scan.  Anyone with a history of claustrophobia,\n      panic attacks, or fear of enclosed spaces is more likely to experience symptoms of panic,\n      fear, or anxiety during the MRI procedure (Harris, Cumming, & Menzies, 2004, p. 1).  This\n      stress and anxiety may cause the patient to abort the scan, the patient may refuse future\n      scans, or the patient's nervous tremors or involuntary quivering may adversely affect the\n      images obtained. Lavender aromatherapy has been shown to reduce stress and anxiety for\n      patients in other settings; however, its use during MRI procedures has not been studied.\n\n      This project investigates the use of lavender aromatherapy as a non-pharmacological way to\n      help patients relax during their MRI procedure.  Lavender aromatherapy has been studied and\n      shown to reduce stress and anxiety for patients in other situations, but it has not been\n      studied during MRI procedures.  Lavender is known to be uplifting, as well as soothing and\n      helpful for reducing stress, anxiety, depression, and insomnia (Herz, 2007, p. 264).  If\n      aromatherapy proves useful as an agent to reduce stress and anxiety, patient satisfaction\n      with their MRI procedure will increase and the need for sedating medication could decrease."
