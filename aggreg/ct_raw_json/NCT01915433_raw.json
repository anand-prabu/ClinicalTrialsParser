The intent is to measure the effect size of a  Wahls Paleo\n      plus Diet and the effect size of the Wahls Diet in reducing fatigue and improving quality of\n      life scores as measured by fatigue severity scale score and MS quality of life 54 physical\n      and mental scores and various subscale scores.   Inclusion criteria is the presence of\n      fatigue and the diagnosis secondary and primary progressive MS, progressive relapsing MS or\n      relapsing-remitting MS with an expanded disability status scale score (EDSS) score of 4.5 or\n      greater but otherwise stable medically. The Wahls Paleo plus (ketogenic diet) and the Wahls\n      diet (modified paleolithic diet) groups will be instructed in completing a daily food log\n      and receive coaching from registered dieticians who are expert in motivational interviewing.\n       The control group will receive usual care.  Biomarkers of nutrient levels (e.g. vitamin)\n      and inflammation, blood sugar and insulin levels will be monitored.  Additional blood will\n      be frozen for future analysis.  Nutrient (e.g. vitamin and antioxidant) intake will be\n      assessed using food frequency questionnaires and 24 hr diet recalls. Test of endothelial\n      function will be done at baseline and 12 weeks. Outcome measures will be change in quality\n      of life and fatigue, endothelial function and blood biomarkers between enrollment and end of\n      study at 12 weeks.  The hypotheses are that the diet intervention groups will experience\n      reduced fatigue and improved quality of life and improved biomarkers 1) between zero and 12\n      weeks and that the  wahls paleo plus (ketogenic diet) and the wahls diet (modified\n      paleolithic diet) groups will experience more improvements in quality of life and reduced\n      fatigue and in biomarkers than the usual care group  experiences at 12 weeks. The usual care\n      group will be given instruction in following both the wahls paleo plus and the wahls diet\n      plans and how to utilize the daily food logs at the end of study visit.  The usual care\n      group will receive one nutrition coaching call to assist with implementation of the study\n      diet."
