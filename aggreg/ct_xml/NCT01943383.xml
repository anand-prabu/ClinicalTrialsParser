    <textblock>
      Patients enrolled in this study will have completed one of the parent studies
      &quot;Pharmacogenomic Evaluation of Antihypertensive Responses&quot; (PEAR-1 or PEAR-2) evaluating how
      well their blood pressure was controlled by medication.  Patients in the current study will
      provide a single tube of blood which will be used to create adult stem cells that can be
      converted into other cell types, like heart or vasculature.  Patients will not be asked to
      return for any follow up visits.

      If the patient decide to participate in this study, they will have 1 visit for the study
      that will include a blood draw. Upon arrival to the clinic, the study will be explained to
      the patient in detail. The patient will be asked at that time to sign this consent form. The
      patient will have the opportunity to ask questions and the research staff will answer those
      questions. If the patient decides to participate in this study and sign a consent form, then
      a blood sample will be collected from a vein in the arm. A total of 2 teaspoons full of
      blood will be drawn for the study.

      During this visit, in addition to collecting a blood sample, patients will be asked about
      their medical history and medications they are currently taking, and will have their vital
      signs assessed, including blood pressure, pulse, and temperature.

      Blood will be drawn by a trained nurse or a phlebotomist at a family medicine clinic in
      Gainesville, Florida. The blood sample will be further processed in  laboratories at the
      University of Florida, for the establishment of iPS cells. iPS cells will retain the
      patient's genetic makeup which makes them useful for research. Several experiments will be
      conducted on these cells that will provide data that can be used to learn more about how
      genetic markers can lead to differences in blood pressure response to medicines. These cells
      will be used for up to 8 years.
