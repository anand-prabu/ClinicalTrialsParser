All patients in the intervention group will receive rapid HIV\n      antibody testing, CD4 cell testing, clinically relevant testing for opportunistic\n      infections, WHO staging, comprehensive counseling and social support, and ART initiation on\n      the day of presentation.

For the\n      same-day ART group, these activities will take place on the day of ART initiation and during\n      the subsequent two weeks.  Three specific aims are proposed.  The first aim is to compare\n      the proportion of patients in the standard and same-day ART groups that are alive and\n      in-care with an undetectable HIV viral load at 12 months after HIV testing.  The second aim\n      is to compare six-month ART adherence between the two groups using pharmacy refill records.\n      The third aim is to compare the cost and cost-effectiveness of standard and same-day ART,\n      where cost is measured by the mean treatment cost and effectiveness is measured by being\n      alive and in care with an undetectable viral load at 12 months after HIV testing."
