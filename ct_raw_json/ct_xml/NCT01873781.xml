  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Age related cataracts are responsible for about 51 percent of blindness worldwide and
      according to the WHO affect about 20 million people, according to the WH . As cataract
      surgery is firstline treatment in the western world, there is a constant attempt to improve
      artificial intraocular lenes (IOL).

      As for this study, the investigators seek to compare four different IOL designs in in a
      psychophysiological setting, allowing to assess the impact of these IOLs on vision and
      psychological processing of visual information.

      As these IOLs also have downsides, such as reduced light intensity or image alterations, the
      subjective preference and overall impression shall be investigated. The healthy subjects
      look through a stable spectacle frame mounted onto a table, which enables the investigator
      to insert the different IOLs. This would allow subjective testing of  IOLs before surgery.
