    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess safety and the inhibition of restenosis of the CVI
      Paclitaxel-coated PTA Balloon Catheter in the treatment of de-novo occluded/stenotic or
      reoccluded/restenotic superficial femoral (SFA) or popliteal arteries.

      The primary endpoint for this analysis is late lumen loss at six (6) months.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with symptomatic leg ischemia, requiring treatment of SFA or popliteal (P1
             segment) artery

          -  De novo or restenotic lesion(s) &gt;70% within the SFA and popliteal arteries in a
             single limb which are ≥3 cm and ≤15 cm in cumulative total length (by visual
             estimation).

          -  Target vessel reference diameter ≥3 mm and ≤7 mm (by visual estimation).

          -  Rutherford classification of 2, 3 or 4

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Lesion length is &lt;3 cm or &gt;15 cm or there is no normal proximal arterial segment in
             which duplex ultrasound velocity ratios can be measured.

          -  Outflow arteries (distal popliteal, anterior or posterior tibial or peroneal
             arteries) with significant lesions (≥ 50% stenosis) may not be treated during the
             same procedure.

          -  Treatment of the contralateral limb during the same procedure or within 30 days of
             the study procedure.
