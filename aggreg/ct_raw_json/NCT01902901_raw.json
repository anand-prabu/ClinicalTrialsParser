The investigators hypothesize that whole genome sequencing will increase the detection\n           of carrier status for Mendelian recessive and x-linked conditions.\n\n        2. The investigators hypothesize that parents will act on the knowledge of their carrier\n           status by making different reproductive choices than parents who do not receive this\n           information.\n\n        3. The investigators hypothesize that the psychosocial risks are increased among parents\n           who receive expanded carrier screening using Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) compared\n           with usual care."

Patient reported outcomes (PRO) on the impact on quality of life, satisfaction with\n           care, timeliness of reporting, and use of the genomic information.\n\n        2. Process outcomes such as timeliness, number of reportable findings, and time of\n           interpretation.\n\n      Project 2 -WGS technology, informatics, and Return of Results Committee (RORC)\n\n      Aim 1: To generate whole genome sequence and interpret variants on samples randomized from\n      the Kaiser Permanente Northwest (KPNW) preconception carrier screening cohort.\n\n        1. To perform whole genome sequencing, assembly, and variant detection for each sample.\n\n        2. To provide variant data on each sample with annotation and ranking of clinical\n           significance.\n\n        3. To validate data using an orthogonal platform for findings relevant to carrier status\n           and actionable secondary findings.\n\n      Aim 2: To develop and implement a return of results committee (RORC) that incorporates\n      evidence to assess criteria for reporting carrier status for reproductive decision making\n      and secondary findings.\n\n      Project 3 - Ethical and Psychosocial Implications\n\n      Aim 1: To evaluate, patient and clinical perspectives on informational needs, satisfaction,\n      knowledge, and decision-making relating to the choice to obtain results of carrier status\n      from WGS in four categories of genetic conditions.\n\n      Aim 2: To evaluate, from patient and clinician perspectives, the immediate and downstream\n      ethical, psychosocial, and behavioral consequences of expanded carrier screening using WGS.\n\n      Aim 3: To evaluate the impact of expanded carrier test using WGS on subsequent health care\n      utilization, and to compare the cost of delivery WGS to usual care."
