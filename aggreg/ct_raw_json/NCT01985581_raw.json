Executive functions\n      are a set of mental processes that include emotional control, planning, organization,\n      working memory, inhibition of behaviors, and managing time and space. As children with ADHD\n      usually have difficulties with Executive Function, and Executive function difficulties lead\n      to more difficulties in school and behaviour, it is anticipated that adding INTUNIV extended\n      release to usual stimulant therapy will improve Executive Function scores as rated by\n      parents and teachers. Improvements in quality of life will also be measured."

The manifestation of clinical symptoms\n      related to impairment in EF often leads to the search for additional treatment options and\n      in many cases to adjunct therapies to the traditional stimulant medication treatment\n      regimen. Demonstrating that the addition of INTUNIV extended release to usual stimulant\n      therapy is effective for symptom control as well as in improving EF may influence clinical\n      treatment algorithms and the need for health care resources to effectively manage patients.\n      Since EF deficits negatively impact academic achievement and behavior at school and because\n      children spend a large number of daytime hours at school, the concordance of any reported\n      improvement in the school and the home environment will be examined. Overall improvement in\n      quality of life with the addition of INTUNIV extended release will also be evaluated."
