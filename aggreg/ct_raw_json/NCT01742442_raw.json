The aim is to describe\n      the frequency of age related problems in a cohort of Norwegian cancer patients > 70 years of\n      age, to investigate the predictive/prognostic impact of these indicators on cancer and\n      treatment related morbidity and mortality, and to investigate the association between\n      clinical frailty indicators, sarcopenia (severe loss of muscle mass) and inflammatory\n      response. Patients will be recruited at outpatient cancer services, Innlandet Hospital HF\n      (SI), Vestre Viken HF and Oslo University Hospital.Estimated sample size is 400 with 18 to\n      24 months inclusion and 2 years follow-up.

The prevalence and impact of age\n      related problems are, however, poorly documented, and elderly patients may therefore be\n      subjects to under-treatment and arbitrary modifications of treatment regimens. In order to\n      improve clinical practice, precise identification of patients with increased vulnerability\n      and risk of adverse outcomes is paramount.\n\n      In the present study, eligible patients will be identified by referral to oncology services\n      at one of the participating cancer units. After consent, the baseline registrations will be\n      performed including relevant medical and sociodemographic data, and quality of life. Age\n      related problems will be assessed by clinical indicators covering comorbidity, medication,\n      emotional, physical and cognitive function and nutritional status. Muscle mass will be\n      quantified by analyses of diagnostic CT scans and a biobank will be established for the\n      analyses of inflammatory markers. Upon inclusion, the patients' physician will be asked to\n      rate the patients as fit, frail or intermediate according to the physicians' subjective\n      judgement. The patients will be followed with assessments of quality of life, emotional\n      function and nutritional status (self-report), cognitive and physical function (performance\n      tests), muscle mass (diagnostic CT scans when available) and inflammatory markers (biobank).\n      Follow up data will also include registry data (hospital records, primary health care\n      registries, The Norwegian Patient Registry, The Norwegian Cancer Registry and the Norwegian\n      Cause of Death registry). We will describe the prevalence of age related problems,\n      investigate the relation between clinical frailty indicators, sarcopenia, inflammatory\n      response and the physicians' subjective evaluation of the patients' health status. The\n      predictive/prognostic impact of frailty indicators on the patients' quality of life,\n      hospital and nursing home admittance, treatment toxicity and survival will also be\n      investigated"
