  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Based on the evidence acquired in the post-menopausal setting with everolimus and on
      pre-clinical evidences supporting the investigation of PI3K inhibitors, such as BYL719 and
      buparlisib, in combination with endocrine therapy in hormone receptor-positive MBC, the
      purpose of this phase II trial is to assess the safety and the clinical anti-tumor activity
      of tamoxifen plus goserelin acetate in combination with BYL719 or buparlisib vs tamoxifen
      plus goserelin acetate in premenopausal hormone receptor-positive advanced breast cancer
      patients, through a randomized open label 3-arm study.

             Multiple Gated acquisition (MUGA) scan or echocardiogram (ECHO)

         18. Patient has any of the following cardiac conduction abnormalities

               1. Ventricular arrhythmias except for benign premature ventricular contractions

               3. Conduction abnormality requiring a pacemaker

               4. Other cardiac arrhythmia not controlled with medication

               5. Patient has a QTcF &gt; 480 msec on the screening ECG (using the QTcF formula)

         19. Patient is currently receiving treatment with medication that has a known risk to
             prolong the QT interval or inducing Torsades de Pointes, and the treatment cannot be
