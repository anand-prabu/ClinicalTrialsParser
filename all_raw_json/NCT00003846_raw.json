Drugs used in chemotherapy\n      use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Peripheral\n      stem cell transplantation may allow doctors to give higher doses of radiation therapy and\n      chemotherapy and kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of radiation therapy, chemotherapy and\n      peripheral stem cell transplantation in treating patients with primitive neuroectodermal\n      tumors."

Peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) are then collected.\n\n        -  Chemoradiotherapy: After blood cell counts recover, and within 28 days of starting\n           induction, patients begin chemoradiotherapy. Patients receive vincristine IV once\n           weekly for 8 doses. Radiotherapy is administered 5 days a week, for 6 weeks, beginning\n           within the same week as the start of vincristine.\n\n        -  Consolidation: Therapy begins 4-6 weeks after the last radiation treatment in the\n           absence of disease progression. The first and third course are the same and comprise\n           vincristine IV on day 0, carboplatin IV over 1 hour on days 0 and 1, thiotepa IV over 3\n           hours on days 2-4, and G-CSF SC daily beginning on day 7. PBSC are reinfused on day 7.\n           The second course comprises vincristine IV on day 0, carboplatin IV over 1 hour on days\n           0 and 1, cyclophosphamide IV over 2 hours on days 2 and 3, and G-CSF SC daily beginning\n           on day 5. PBSC are reinfused on day 5. Each course lasts 21 days.\n\n      For consolidation therapy, cohorts of 6-12 patients each receive escalating doses of\n      thiotepa until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the\n      dose at which no more than 2 of 12 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 2 years, and then\n      annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24-56 patients will be accrued for this study."
