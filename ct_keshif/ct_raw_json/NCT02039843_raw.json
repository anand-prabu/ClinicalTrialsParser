Service Dogs are efficacious for individuals with\n      disabilities, such as vision limitations, spinal cord injury and hearing problems. In\n      addition, some mental health outcomes have improved with the introduction of a Service Dog.\n      A research study was mandated in the Department of Defense Bill of 2010, to examine the\n      efficacy of service dogs for Veterans with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Together\n      with the Cooperative Studies Program, the proponents have designed a research study to\n      effectively meet the demands of the Bill and to provide timely research into an evolving\n      field.\n\n      Study Primary Objective:  To examine how limitations on activity and quality of life in\n      Veterans with PTSD are impacted by the provision of a Service Dog versus an Emotional\n      Support Dog.\n\n      Study Design:  A three-year prospective randomized study is proposed which has two\n      randomized arms.  Arm one of the study will be Veterans (n=110) randomized to receiving a\n      Service Dog, which has been trained for specific tasks to assist with the Veteran's\n      disability. Arm two (n=110) of the study will be Veterans randomized to receive an Emotional\n      Support Dog (a dog which provide emotional comfort).  All Veterans, after confirmation of\n      eligibility will be observed a minimum of three months. During this period, Veterans will be\n      required to participate in a Dog Care Course to ensure they are aware of the demands dogs\n      place on humans. Once dogs become available, Veterans will be randomized to be paired with a\n      Service Dog or Emotional Support Dog. Follow-up will begin at one month post pairing to\n      track any dog behavior issues, and will continue every three months after pairing for 18\n      months. Primary outcomes to be examined include limitations on activity (as measured by the\n      WHO- DAS 2.0), quality of life (measured by the VR-12). Secondary outcomes include PTSD\n      symptoms (measured by the PCL-S), Suicidal ideation (Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating\n      Scale); depression (PHQ-9) and Sleep (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index).  In addition, health\n      care utilization, anger management, employment and productivity will also be examined.  This\n      multi-site study will be conducted at three locations, Nationwide."
