However, uncovered stent are often associated with re-stenosis caused by tumor\n      in-growth through the stent mesh. The Self-expandable metallic stents which has the design\n      of smaller wire mesh size (double bare stent) were developed and used in Korea. This new\n      design was developed to minimize the re-stenosis of uncovered stent, but the outcome is\n      unknown. The end point of this study is the 8-weeks patency rate after placement of double\n      bare as well as technical and clinical success rates."
