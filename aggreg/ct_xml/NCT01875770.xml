      This research is being done to assess the long term prognosis of patients treated with
      ranibizumab for edema due to retinal vein occlusion.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      People treated with ranibizumab for edema due to retinal vein occlusion as part of previous
      studies at the Wilmer Eye Institute and who are currently being seen by their
      ophthalmologist at the Wilmer Eye Institute are followed up to assess long term outcomes
