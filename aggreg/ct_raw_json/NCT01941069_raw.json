The overall purpose of this project\n      is to determine whether school personnel implementing a two-tier School-wide Positive\n      Behavior Support (SWPBS, an evidence based intervention) program for typically developing\n      children as well as children with, or at risk for, externalizing or anxiety disorders can\n      implement the components of the program with the same level of fidelity, integrity and\n      clinical effectiveness when they receive a low level of support (consultation) from their\n      coaches and supervisors as they can with a high level of support (consultation and\n      coaching). This study will target six schools within the Philadelphia School District (PSD).\n       Within those 6 schools, research participants will consist of students (grades 4-8) and\n      school staff members. The investigators will evaluate 1) the effectiveness of SWPBS with\n      consultation and coaching, as compared to the baseline and to SWPBS with consultation only;\n      in reducing office discipline referrals (ODRs) and improving school climate, and children's\n      grades, diagnostic status, symptom severity and impairment; 2) the effectiveness of the\n      SWPBS with consultation and coaching, as compared to SWPBS with consultation only, in\n      increasing program fidelity and integrity."
