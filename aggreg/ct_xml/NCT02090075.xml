  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vitamin K-antagonists (VKA) such as warfarin are the most widely used blood thinners for
      irregular heart beats like atrial fibrillation. Several lines of evidence indicate, however,
      that these agents also cause calcification of vessels (hardening of the vessels).  Vascular
      calcification is one of the recently revealed side-effects of warfarin therapy. We will be
      randomizing 66 patients to either take warfarin or a new blood thinner that works without
      affecting vitamin k (apixaban).  Patients will undergo blood testing and a CT angiogram
      (non-invasive angiogram) at the beginning of the study, and then be followed for one year
      with quarterly visits including blood tests and given either warfarin or vitamin K.  After
      one year, they will undergo another CT angiogram and examination and blood tests and the
      effect of apixaban and warfarin are tested to look at plaque and changes over time.
      Patients will be consented in a private room and the risks and benefits will be explained.
      The risks include the CT angiogram and the possibility of either remaining on warfarin
      therapy for another year (standard of care) or taking a medicine that doesn't require
      monitoring (apixaban) for one year.  The CT angiograms will require some contrast and some
      radiation dose, which will be minimized as much as possible.  A cardiologist will be present
      during each CT angiogram to minimize risk and ensure patient safety.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Eligible patients with atrial fibrillation or flutter at enrollment or two or more
             episodes of atrial fibrillation, as documented by electrocardiography, at least 2
             weeks apart in the 12 months before enrollment; Age 18-84 years; Willingness to
             participate in the study and ability to sign informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Atrial fibrillation due to a reversible cause, moderate or severe mitral stenosis, or
             conditions other than atrial fibrillation that require anticoagulation (e.g., a
             prosthetic heart valve);A need for aspirin at a dose of &gt;165 mg a day or for both
             aspirin and P2Y-inhibitor; Serious bleeding event in the previous 6 months or a high
             risk of bleeding (eg, active peptic ulcer disease, a platelet count of &lt;100,000/mm3
             or hemoglobin level of &lt;10 g/dL, stroke within the previous 10 days, documented
             hemorrhagic tendencies, or blood dyscrasias) Renal insufficiency (serum creatinine
             level of 12.5 mg per deciliter or calculated creatinine clearance of &lt;50 ml per
             minute); Weight in excess of 325 pounds; Resting hypotension (systolic blood pressure
             of &lt;90mmHg) or resting hypertension (systolic blood pressure of &gt;170mmHg or diastolic
             blood pressure of &gt;110 mmHg); History of active malignancy requiring concurrent
             chemotherapy; Any unstable medical, psychiatric, or substance abuse disorder that in
             the opinion of the principal investigator is likely to affect the subject's ability
             to complete the study; Known allergy to iodinated contrast material; pregnancy, women
             of childbearing potential unwilling to use adequate contraception.
