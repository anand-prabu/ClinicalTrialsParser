The study\n      period per subject is the time it takes to assess the ex vivo breast tissue samples using\n      the study device during their lumpectomy.\n\n      This trial compares intraoperative imaging analysis of breast tumor margins to results from\n      post-operative histology. The study will evaluate the ability to identify margin status\n      (sensitivity and specificity) of intraoperative imaging vs. final pathology."
