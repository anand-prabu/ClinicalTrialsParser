      The objective of the AMPLATZER Cardiac Plug (ACP) Registry Long Term Follow-up study is to
      evaluate long term performance of the ACP in closure of the Left Atrial Appendage (LAA) in
      subjects with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation and assess adverse events up to two (2) or
      more years post implant.
