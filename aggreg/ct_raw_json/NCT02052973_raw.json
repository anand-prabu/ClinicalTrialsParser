The antimicrobial effects of natural\n      substances are being studied for exhibiting antimicrobial properties similar to those of\n      chlorhexidine, but less toxic in some cases. Several studies with propolis has proven its\n      efficacy against several microorganisms of the oral cavity, specially Streptococcus mutans.\n      A pharmaceutical formulation containing brazilian green propolis was developed based on the\n      chitosan polymer that is biocompatible and biodegradable. In a previous study, we observed\n      in vitro antimicrobial properties of the varnish against Streptococcus mutans. This work\n      aims to study the preliminary evidence of the efficacy of the propolis dental varnish in\n      reducing Streptococcus mutans in saliva and in the biofilm control through a phase II study\n      involving patients with 8-10 years. After 30 days, the results will be compared and\n      statistically analyzed at a level of significance of 5 % ."
