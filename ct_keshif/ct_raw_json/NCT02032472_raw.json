Hypothesis: the monitoring of these patients through the Office of Pharmacy will be\n      as effective in obtaining good control of blood pressure as it is to obtained through health\n      centers. Design: Multicenter randomized controlled trial along one year of follow up.\n      Location: the city of Cerdanyola del Vall\u00e8s (Barcelona). Participants: All patients\n      diagnosed with hypertension and good control criteria in the past year. Arms: Health centers\n      (control) and Pharmacy Offices (intervention). Outcome variable: blood pressure under good\n      control along the monitoring"
