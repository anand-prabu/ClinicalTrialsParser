Targeted marrow irradiation is a type of\n      specialized radiation therapy that delivers a high dose of radiation directly to the cancer\n      cells, which may kill more cancer cells and cause less damage to normal cells. Giving\n      targeted marrow irradiation and chemotherapy drugs, such as fludarabine phosphate and\n      busulfan, before a donor progenitor cell transplant may help stop the growth of cancer\n      cells. It may also stop the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's progenitor\n      cells. When the healthy progenitor cells from a donor are infused into the patient they may\n      help the patient's bone marrow make progenitor cells, red blood cells, white blood cells,\n      and platelets."
