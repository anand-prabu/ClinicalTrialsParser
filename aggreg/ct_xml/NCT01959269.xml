      The purpose of the study is to investigate the safety and effectiveness of Stivarga in
      patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma in routine use in Germany. The study is purely
      observational, only data from routine treatment are to be collected. The treatment and
      treatment conditions are solely at discretion of the treating physician.

    <description>The tumor status at different visits will be evaluated according to the categories &quot;complete response&quot;, &quot;partial response&quot;, &quot;stable disease&quot;, &quot;progressive disease by clinical judgment&quot;, &quot;progressive disease measurement proven&quot;, &quot;unknown&quot; and &quot;not applicable&quot;.

    <description>Detailed information collected for each TEAE will include: a description of the event, duration, whether the TEAE was serious, relationship to Stivarga, action taken, clinical outcome. Summary tables will present the number of subjects observed with TEAEs and corresponding percentages. Additional subcategories will be based on event intensity and relationship to study drug.</description>

        Female and male patients ≥ 18 years of age with a diagnosis of metastatic colorectal
        carcinoma (mCRC) will be enrolled in the sites during the enrollment period. All treatment
        decisions prior inclusion of a patient as well as during the observation must be made by
        the investigator based on his regular medical practice. Patients must give written
