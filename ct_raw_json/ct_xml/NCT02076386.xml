      DOL-ART is a multi-center, prospective, non-interventional study of the use of doluetegravir
      as part of an antiretroviral combination therapy in routine daily practice in Germany. The
      primary study objective is a descriptive characterization of the frequency of therapeutic
      monitoring measures in HIV-infected patients under dolutegravir-containing ART in routine
      daily practice in Germany.

      The study is designed to enroll approximately 400 patients. There are no protocol-mandated
      visits or procedures associated with the study. Each patient is expected to participate for
      a maximum of 3 years or until premature discontinuation (i.e., discontinuation of
      dolutegravir, due to death, withdrawal of consent, lost to follow-up).

        Approximately 40 HIV treatment centers in Germany are planned to be involved in the
        documentation.  The participating study site will document a maximum of 20 patients for
        this observation study.  Overall, approximately 400 patients under dolutegravir-containing
        ART are to be documented.  This selection process is intended to achieve the documentation
        of patients under dolutegravir-containing ART in routine daily practice representative for
        Germany.
