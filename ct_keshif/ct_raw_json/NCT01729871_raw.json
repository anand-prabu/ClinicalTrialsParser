This study requires collaboration with medical institutions\n      that provide access to electrophysiologists who normally perform the catheter ablation\n      procedure. In this study, NVAF is to be defined as the presence of AF in a person who does\n      not have a prosthetic heart valve (annuloplasty with or without prosthetic ring,\n      commissurotomy and/or valvuloplasty are permitted) and who does not have hemodynamically\n      significant mitral valve stenosis. Approximately 250 eligible participants, age 18 years or\n      older, with a history of paroxysmal, persistent, or long standing persistent NVAF who are\n      scheduled to undergo an elective catheter ablation procedure will be randomized in a 1:1\n      ratio to receive either rivaroxaban 20 mg orally, once-daily, administered preferably with\n      the evening meal or VKA (adjusted to achieve a recommended International Normalized Ratio of\n      2.0 to 3.0).\n\n      The study will consist of a screening period, a pre-procedure period, procedure period and\n      post-procedure period. The screening period will begin up to 2 weeks prior to randomization.\n      Participants will be randomized at the beginning of the pre-procedure period. During this\n      period, participants will be recommended to receive their assigned treatment for at least 4\n      weeks (maximum of 5 weeks) before the catheter ablation procedure. For participants with the\n      sufficient anticoagulation, documented for the 3 weeks prior to randomization, and for\n      participants with a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) or intracardiac echocardiography\n      (ICE), the length of the pre-procedure period may be reduced down to 1-7 days and must\n      include any transition from the previous anticoagulation therapy to randomized study drug.\n\n      After the catheter ablation procedure, participants will receive their post-procedure dose\n      of study drug through a minimum of 30 + - 5 days. In addition to scheduled visits and\n      telephone calls the study may also include additional phone calls and visits by the\n      participant to the site when dose adjustment is required for usual care."
