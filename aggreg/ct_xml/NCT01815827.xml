  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label, parallel group study will evaluate the safety, tolerability,
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of single doses of inclacumab in Japanese healthy
      volunteers compared to Caucasian healthy volunteers. Subjects will receive a single
      intravenous dose of inclacumab. Follow-up will be for up to 197 days.
