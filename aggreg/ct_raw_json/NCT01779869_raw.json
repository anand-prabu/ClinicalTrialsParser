Hypothesis:  The hypothesis is\n      that high resolution, high sensitivity DCE MRI could replace the rest PET myocardial\n      perfusion imaging, significantly decreasing examination time and patient radiation dose\n      while maintaining the comprehensive reference-quality PET myocardial stress perfusion\n      coverage.\n\n      The primary outcome will be comparison of diagnostic accuracy of each combination of imaging\n      to detect clinically significant coronary artery stenosis (\u226570% diameter stenosis). The\n      secondary outcome will be comparison of confidence for presence of disease among data sets."

            "textblock": "Simultaneous acquisition PET-MRI is a new technology that has the potential to significantly\n      impact diagnostic patient care. It combines high signal resolution MRI anatomic imaging and\n      PET biological measurements, with the added benefit of radiation dose reduction in\n      comparison to PET-CT.  As the incidence of false positive SPECT-MPI studies secondary to\n      attenuation artifact is relatively high and MRI coverage of the left ventricular myocardium\n      is limited, it is likely that one of the immediate applications of PET-MRI technology is\n      myocardial ischemia assessment.\n\n      PET has long been considered the noninvasive reference standard for myocardial perfusion.\n      However, delayed contrast enhanced (DCE) MRI is very sensitive for infarct detection.\n      Indeed, both PET and MR imaging have the potential to provide comprehensive whole heart\n      ischemia and infarct detection.\n\n      PET-MR technology, with its ability to obtain simultaneous perfusion information via both\n      PET and MRI, has the potential to obtain multiple, possibly redundant, data sets. On the\n      other hand, it also has the potential to combine the best of both techniques to provide a\n      highly robust examination that is both shorter and of lower radiation dose than the standard\n      myocardial PET perfusion examination.  Optimization of a protocol is necessary to develop a\n      comprehensive protocol without redundancy.  Because of its single injection capability,\n      regadenoson is ideally suited to a protocol that will assess and employ dual-modality\n      myocardial perfusion data collection.\n\n      It is expected that the best candidates for PET-MR myocardial perfusion imaging will likely\n      be a) patients whose body habitus suggests that their SPECT-MPI examination would be limited\n      by attenuation artifact -- women with large breasts and patients (usually men) with\n      abdominal obesity and/or b) patients who may have a smaller region of ischemia that might be\n      missed on an MRI examinations with limited perfusion coverage."
