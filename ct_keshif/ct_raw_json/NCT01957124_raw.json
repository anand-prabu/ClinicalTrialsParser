Their treatment is\n      not well established.\n\n      We want to study the efficacy of PRF applications on the pains related to those ulcers.\n\n      PRF (Platelet-Rich Fibrin) is an autologous fibrin clot, obtained extemporaneously from\n      patient's blood, without any additive nor complex manipulation. It contains blood platelets\n      and white blood cells, trapped in fibrin during clot formation.\n\n      PRF (Platelet-Rich Fibrin) is form immediately after blood punction in a dry tube, that does\n      not contain any anticoagulant. Coagulation naturally occurs within few minutes, and tubes\n      are placed in a centrifuge: red blood cells are separated from the fibrin clot thanks to\n      difference of density, and blood platelets and white blood cells are trapped in the fibrin\n      clot.\n\n      The fibrin clot is then rapidly applicated on the ulcer surface for four days. Our\n      hypothesis is that platelet growth factors and cytokines, liberated during platelet\n      activation, could help to treat hypertensive leg ulcers, that are caused by a vascular\n      spasm."
