  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if a decrease in the standard volume of local
      anesthetic used to numb your shoulder area before shoulder arthroscopy will provide adequate
      anesthesia for the procedure and decrease the amount of time until you are ready for
      discharge from the hospital.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Traditionally, an interscalene block is done either with nerve stimulator or ultrasound
      guided using 40-60mL of local anesthetic.  The study plans to investigate the difference in
      hand grip strength post-operatively in patients who will receive interscalene blocks with
      40mL versus a lower dose (20mL) of local anesthetic.  We suspect the lower dose will achieve
      adequate surgical anesthesia while creating less motor block and thus, increase patient
      satisfaction, present fewer complications or adverse affects and decrease time in the
      recovery room.

  <study_design>Allocation: Randomized, Endpoint Classification: Safety/Efficacy Study, Intervention Model: Parallel Assignment, Masking: Double Blind (Subject, Caregiver, Outcomes Assessor), Primary Purpose: Treatment</study_design>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Handgrip Strength</measure>
    <time_frame>A one time assessment pre-operatively in the holding area and each hour (every hour up until 180 minutes) post-operatively in the PACU until patient discharge</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The primary outcome will be handgrip strength as measured by a dynamometer.  A reading will be obtained at baseline (before the interscalene block), upon arrival to the PACU, every 60 minutes after entering the PACU and one reading immediately prior to patient discharge.  Two measurements will be taken bilaterally at each time point.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Readiness to Discharge</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will be followed every 15 minutes from entry into the PACU until discharge from the hospital up to 180 minutes post PACU arrival.</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Patient readiness to discharge- Evaluated every 15 minutes using the PADDS discharge criteria.
BP and pulse within 20% of preoperative baseline
Steady gait, no dizziness, or meets preoperative level
Minimal nausea and vomiting: successfully treated with PO medication
The patient should have minimal or no pain
Postoperative bleeding should be consistent with expected blood loss for the procedure</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Success of the Block</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes post block induction in the Operating Room</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Evaluated by the level of sedation necessary and the surgeon rating of the block. The block will be considered a success if the sedation did not exceed fentanyl 100mcg or propofol 80mcg/kg/min, and the surgeon rated the block as successful with no patient movement or acceptable with minimal patient movement. Conversion to general anesthesia will also be considered a block failure.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>POD 2 - 3 (48-72 hours after the surgical procedure)</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Patient satisfaction will be evaluated using an online survey. If the patient does not complete the survey in 2 days following discharge, the patient will receive a phone call and the survey will be completed over the phone. While the survey is not a validated measurement of patient satisfaction, it has successfully been used at our institution for other research projects (IRB # 11100).</description>

Hoarseness- The patient will subjectively state whether they sound hoarse
Horners- Will be evaluated post-operatively in the PACU</description>
