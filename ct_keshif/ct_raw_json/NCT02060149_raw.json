Health airway lining\n      fluid is mildly alkaline but airway acidification usually appears for the infection of\n      XDRAB. The hypothesis is offered that the biologic activity of XDRAB might be inhibited if\n      the circumstance including pH is changed. In the vitro study we observed that the inhibit\n      effect of antibiotics on XDRAB growth was improved significantly by alkaline solution within\n      the scope of physiology. So the aim of this clinical study is to explore the effects of\n      nebulization of alkaline Solution on C/S plus minocycline on the pneumonia with XDRAB."
