SU5416 may stop the growth of colorectal cancer by stopping\n      blood flow to the tumor. It is not yet known whether chemotherapy is more effective with or\n      without SU5416 in treating metastatic colorectal cancer.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of leucovorin and\n      fluorouracil with or without SU5416 in treating patients who have metastatic colorectal\n      cancer."

            "textblock": "OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the median survival in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer\n      treated with fluorouracil and leucovorin calcium with or without SU5416. II. Compare the\n      time to progression, duration of response, and objective response in these patients on these\n      two regimens. III. Compare the percentage 6 month, 9 month, and one year survival of these\n      patients on these two regimens. IV. Compare the time to treatment failure in these patients\n      on these two regimens. V. Determine the health related quality of life of these patients on\n      these two regimens. VI. Compare the palliative and biologic effects of SU5416 in these\n      patients. VII. Determine the safety and tolerability of fluorouracil and leucovorin calcium\n      plus SU5416 in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open label, multicenter study. Patients are stratified\n      according to performance status (ECOG 0 vs 1), site of primary disease (colon vs rectum),\n      measurable or evaluable disease, and prior fluorouracil adjuvant chemotherapy (none vs at\n      least 1 dose). Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms: Arm I: Patients receive\n      leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours and fluorouracil IV bolus 1 hour into leucovorin calcium\n      administration weekly for 6 weeks. Arm II: Patients receive leucovorin calcium IV over 2\n      hours and fluorouracil IV bolus 1 hour into leucovorin calcium administration weekly for 6\n      weeks, plus SU5416 twice weekly for 8 weeks. Treatment repeats every 8 weeks in the absence\n      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Quality of life is assessed prior to study,\n      at weeks 4 and 8 of each course, and then post study. Patients are followed post study at\n      one month and then every 2 months until death.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 710 patients (355 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this\n      study."
