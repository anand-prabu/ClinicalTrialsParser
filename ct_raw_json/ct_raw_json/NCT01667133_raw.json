The first will be\n      a dose escalation phase employing a modified 3+3 design with two dose cohorts (30mg and\n      45mg). After 6 patients complete the first cycle in a cohort, safety events will be\n      evaluated before opening the next dose cohort. Patients will continue on treatment as long\n      as it is tolerated and disease progression has not occurred. Phase 2 will occur at the\n      recommended dose determined in phase 1 in an additional 25 patients. Another 3 patients will\n      be dosed at 15mg for collection of pharmacokinetic data. These patients may also escalate to\n      the recommended dose and be assessed for efficacy and safety as phase 2 patients.\n\n      Efficacy measures include molecular, cytogenetic, and hematologic response rates at various\n      time points; time to response; duration of response; and survival follow-up. Safety measures\n      include routine physical and laboratory evaluations, adverse event monitoring, and ECGs.\n      Other measures include mutation testing and molecular genetic assessment. Accrual is\n      expected to take approximately 12 months, and patients will be followed for survival for up\n      to 60 months from the last dose of study drug; therefore, the estimated duration of the\n      trial is 72 months."
