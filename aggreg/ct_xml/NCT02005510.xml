  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to determine whether mailing in-home human papillomavirus (HPV)
      screening kits is effective in increasing uptake of cervical cancer screening and early
      detection and treatment of cervical neoplasia in underscreened women.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over half of all cervical cancers in the U.S. are diagnosed in unscreened or underscreened
      women. New national guidelines identify increasing screening uptake as the number one
      priority for reducing cervical cancer-related morbidity and mortality. Innovative screening
      strategies that eliminate the need for clinic-based screening could be highly effective in
      improving screening compliance while maintaining high-quality care. We propose a large,
      pragmatic randomized controlled trial within Group Health (a large integrated health care
      delivery system in Washington State) to compare effectiveness of two programmatic approaches
      to increasing cervical cancer screening among overdue women. The first approach (control
      arm) is usual care at Group Health, which consists of patient- and provider-level services
      to promote adherence to Pap screening, and the second approach (intervention arm) includes
      usual care plus a mailed in-home high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) screening kit. We
      will randomize eligible women to the in-home hrHPV screening arm or the usual care arm.
      Compared to usual care, we hypothesize that in-home hrHPV screening will enhance early
      detection and treatment of cervical neoplasia and improve compliance with screening. The
      trial will provide definitive evidence-based data on the impact of an in-home hrHPV
      screening program in a real-world clinical setting.
