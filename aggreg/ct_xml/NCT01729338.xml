  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to estimate the overall response rate (ORR), defined as
      partial response (PR) or better at any time during induction therapy. The success of the
      therapy will be determined by ORR with strong consideration given to the secondary endpoints
      of tolerability, duration of response, and quality of life (QOL).

      All patients will be treated with the same experimental regimen. Several novel features are
      being explored: the substitution of cyclophosphamide for melphalan; once weekly AND
      subcutaneous bortezomib instead of standard twice weekly, intravenous dosing; and
      alternating bortezomib and lenalidomide in maintenance.

      The investigators hypothesize that this regimen will prove to be tolerable and effective in
      inducing and maintaining remission in a patient population that is historically very
      difficult to treat, namely Multiple Myeloma (MM) patients who are too elderly or suffer
      comorbidities, such as renal insufficiency, that otherwise complicate aggressive therapies
      like autologous stem-cell transplantation (ASCT).  In short, the investigators view this as
      the &quot;Multiple Myeloma trial for non-trial candidates.&quot;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 35 patients will be accrued to this single arm, open label, phase II trial over a
      period of about 18 months, studying induction chemotherapy with VELCADE, cyclophosphamide
      and dexamethasone administered on an attenuated dosing schedule to accommodate
      non-candidates for high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplantation - an
      often frail patient population. Maintenance therapy will follow with alternating
      lenalidomide and VELCADE. All patients should receive antiviral (zoster) prophylaxis, and
      peptic ulcer prophylaxis is recommended.  Aspirin and/or anticoagulation are left to study
      physician discretion. All patients will be treated with the same experimental regimen.
      Several novel features are being explored: the substitution of cyclophosphamide for
      melphalan; once weekly AND subcutaneous bortezomib instead of standard twice weekly,
      intravenous dosing; and alternating bortezomib and lenalidomide in maintenance. The
      overarching aim is to preserve efficacy while minimizing toxicity and inconvenience to this
      often frail patient population.

          -  Age ≥18 years at the time of signing the informed consent form.

          -  Able to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol requirements.

          -  Multiple Myeloma (MM) diagnosed according to the following standard criteria (all
             three criteria must be met):

             before starting study drugs. Enrollment of subjects who require radiotherapy (which
             must be localized in its field size) should be deferred until the radiotherapy is
             completed and 3 weeks have elapsed since the last date of therapy.
