      The objective of this study is to evaluate the  usefulness of Tc-99m Sestamibi Molecular
      Breast Imaging as an imaging modality for breast cancer screening.

      Tc-MBI has shown significantly higher sensitivity and equivalent specificity in the
      detection of breast cancer among high risk women when compared to mammography. However,
      there is little published data comparing Tc-MBI to MRI for evaluating extent of disease in
      women with known breast cancer.

      The study will target twenty (20) women with newly diagnosed breast cancer  who are
      scheduled to undergo biopsy of additional suspicious lesions that were identified on
      standard of care contrast- enhanced breast MRI. Prior to the biopsy, these subjects will
      receive a Tc-MBI scan of the breast. The results from both imaging methods will be compared
      to histological findings. These results may be used to design larger and more comprehensive
      studies with an overarching goal to determine if there is a role for Tc-MBI in the
      pre-operative evaluation of patients with known breast cancer.
