We will randomize 360 patients to one of three commonly-used\n      crisis interventions delivered as routine care in the mental health triage system: (1)\n      Treatment As Usual (TAU); (2) Crisis Response Plan (CRP); or (3) Enhanced Crisis Response\n      Plan with Reasons For Living (E-CRP). The following hypotheses will be tested:\n\n        1. The enhanced crisis response plan (E-CRP) intervention will contribute to significantly\n           decreased risk for suicide attempts and hospitalization during follow-up relative to\n           the crisis response plan alone (CRP) and treatment as usual (TAU).\n\n        2. The E-CRP intervention will contribute to greater ambivalence about suicide and faster\n           recall of reasons for living relative to the CRP and TAU interventions.\n\n        3. Greater ambivalence about suicide and faster recall of reasons for living will mediate\n           the relationship between intervention and reduced risk for suicide attempt during\n           follow-up."
