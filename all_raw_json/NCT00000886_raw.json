To evaluate the humoral and cellular immune responses to the C4-V3 peptides as\n      measured by the induction of 1 or more of the following: neutralizing antibodies to HIV-1 MN\n      and RF, cross-neutralizing antibodies to primary isolates of HIV-1, HIV-1 antigen-specific\n      lymphoproliferation, CD8+ and CD4+ cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activity specific for HIV-1\n      gp120 or V3 peptides corresponding to the vaccine strains of HIV-1, induction of HLA-B7 and\n      HLA-A2 restricted CD8+CTLs, and induction of HIV-specific DTH responses.\n\n      The test immunogen (C4-V3 peptides) is constructed from 4 sequences of the HIV-1 V3  gp120\n      loop shared by approximately 80% of North American HIV-1 strains. Because of the critical\n      role that this region plays in generating anti-HIV sequences, it is hypothesized that the\n      test immunogen (C4-V3 peptides) will be capable of inducing a broad range of cross-reactive\n      neutralizing antibodies in the majority of recipients."
