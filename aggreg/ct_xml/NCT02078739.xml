  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The combined diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and heart failure
      (HF) is common but often missed because of similarities in clinical presentation, risk
      factors, and patient characteristics. The concurrent presence of both diseases worsens the
      limitations in exercise capacity and quality of life that patients experience with either
      disease alone. This pilot study will test the feasibility of a yoga program conducted in
      patients' homes using multi-point interactive videoconferencing (&quot;Tele- Yoga&quot;) for patients
      with combined COPD/HF diagnoses. The investigators hypothesize that patients who receive a
      yoga program at home, compared to an educational control group, will experience fewer
      physical symptoms and better quality of life.
