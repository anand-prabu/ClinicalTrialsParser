      The Synergy Trial will evaluate the safety and efficacy of a currently available medication
      (methylphenidate) combined with a CFS-specific dietary supplement (CFS Nutrient Formula) to
      treat Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS).

      The CFS Nutrient Formula to be used in this trial is a broad-spectrum micronutrient
      supplement that provides CFS patients with vitamins, minerals, and other cofactors (amino
      acids, antioxidants, and mitochondrial cofactors) to complement the low-dose Central Nervous
      System (CNS) stimulant (methylphenidate). In other words, therapeutic dosages of
      micronutrients are provided to support the functioning of the nervous, endocrine, and immune
      systems to a level at which a lower than customary dosage of methylphenidate can produce
      positive clinical effects on CFS symptoms and also be well tolerated.

      Methylphenidate is the generic form of Ritalin®. The dose being tested in this study is
      relatively low (5-10mg twice daily). This drug has been in clinical use for over 50 years
      for the treatment of Narcolepsy and Attention Deficit Disorder and has a well-described
      safety profile when used as recommended. Methylphenidate alone has been studied as a
      treatment for CFS in the past and has been shown to produce mild benefits and be
      well-tolerated. When provided as innovative therapy, methylphenidate plus this CFS Nutrient
      Formula has produced substantial improvements in CFS symptoms in a limited number of
      patients, and demonstrated excellent tolerability.

      Use of low dose methylphenidate hydrochloride coadministered with a CFS Nutrient Formula has
      not been previously evaluated in a controlled clinical study. The risk to patients using
      this combination is believed to be low, especially in the context of a well-controlled
      clinical study. Furthermore, this combination is not expected to increase the incidence or
      severity of adverse events associated with methylphenidate hydrochloride.
