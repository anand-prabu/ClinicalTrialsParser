A trial diet\n      is then prescribed, with adjustments made to achieve a steady state with normal serum\n      electrolytes.  Exercise tolerance and muscle function are evaluated at steady state.\n\n      Sodium and potassium are sequentially manipulated with diet, enalapril, and polystyrene\n      sulfonate.  Exercise tolerance is evaluated during each diet period.\n\n      A treatment plan to maintain electrolyte balance is developed.  The patient is followed\n      monthly for 3 to 6 months, then every 3 months for up to 3 years."
