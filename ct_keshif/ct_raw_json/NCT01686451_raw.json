            "textblock": "Individuals at risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) are often prescribed statins, which are\n      medications that reduce the amount of cholesterol in the blood. By lowering cholesterol\n      levels, these individuals have a lower incidence of coronary artery disease, ischemic\n      stroke, and peripheral arterial disease and so on. While statins are effective at lowering\n      cholesterol levels, their effect on fatigue is obvious and has been suggested by several\n      studies, including one randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. And\n      XueZhiKang may be not. The purpose of this study is to compare the effect of these two\n      medications on fatigue in persons who are at moderate to low CVD risk based on the risk\n      estimation system in ESC(European Society of Cardiology)/ESA(European Atherosclerosis\n      Society) guidelines (2011) for the management of dyslipidemias.\n\n      This study will enroll individuals who do not currently take cholesterol-lowering\n      medications. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive 600mg of XueZhiKang twice a\n      day, or 20mg of simvastatin daily for 4 weeks. Study visits will occur at baseline and Week\n      4. Blood will be collected for laboratory testing, and standardized psychological\n      questionnaires will assess fatigue scores and physical activity levels at baseline and week\n      4. Pill count will be used to assess adherence of XueZhiKang and simvastatin treatment at\n      week 4. At week 4, medication side effects will be monitored and tests of alanine\n      aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransaminase (AST) and creatine phosphate kinase\n      (CPK) will be performed. At week 4, medication efficacy will be assessed and test of\n      low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) will be performed."
