    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) that will rigorously evaluate the
      implementation, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a couple-based integrated HIV and
      drug abuse prevention intervention (Connect II) with drug-involved male offenders charged
      with misdemeanors and their primary female sexual partners, implemented by frontline
      providers in Criminal Court, Community Court or probation (CCP) sites in NYC, compared to
      CCP standard treatment of care services (TAU). The primary outcomes are to reduce sexually
      transmitted infections (STIs) and increase condom use.
