To determine the safety of intradermal administration of up to 3 escalating doses of\n      CD105/Yb-1/SOX2 CDH3/MDM2 multiplasmid vaccine (STEMVAC) in patients with HER2-negative\n      advanced stage breast cancer.\n\n      II. To determine the most immunogenic dose of STEMVAC in patients with HER2-negative\n      advanced stage breast cancer.\n\n      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. To determine whether a STEMVAC T helper 1 cells (Th1) polyepitope plasmid based vaccine\n      elicits a persistent memory T cell response and whether immunity can be further\n      enhanced/maintained by two additional STEMVAC vaccines (boosters) given 3 and 9 months after\n      the priming regimen.\n\n      II. To evaluate whether STEMVAC vaccination modulates T regulatory cells and myeloid-derived\n      suppressor cells (MDSC).\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.\n\n      Patients receive CD105/Yb-1/SOX2/CDH3/MDM2 multiplasmid vaccine with rhuGM-CSF intradermally\n      (ID) every 28 days for 3 months and booster vaccines at 6 and 12 months in the absence of\n      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up twice yearly for 5 years."
