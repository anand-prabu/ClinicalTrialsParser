Autologous grafts have a better side-effect\n      profile than non-autologous grafts. We believe this improved side-effect profile will result\n      in a decreased incidence of reoperation for post-operative infections and post-operative\n      fluid collections (pseudomeningoceles and seromas). Study is open to all non-pregnant minor\n      and adult subjects. Subjects must have symptomatic Chiari Malformation described as > or\n      equal to 6mm descent of the cerebellar tonsils below the foramen magnum with accompanying\n      headaches and/or neurologic findings (arm pain/weakness, myelopathy, etc.). After the\n      12-month follow-up is completed on the first 100 subjects there will be an interim analysis\n      of the results in order to determine whether one of the treatments has a statistically\n      superior outcome. If a statistically superior outcome is noted, the trial will stop after\n      being reviewed by a data monitoring committee. If no statistically significant difference is\n      seen at one year, the study will continue until the 12-month follow-up is completed on the\n      200th patient."
