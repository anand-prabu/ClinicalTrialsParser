In this phase II trial, 56 African American men and women with\n      established CHD will be randomly allocated either to standard cardiac rehabilitation with\n      formal stress reduction training using the Transcendental Meditation program or to standard\n      cardiac rehabilitation alone. The intervention period will be 12 weeks. At baseline and\n      posttest, subjects will be tested by quantitative Positron Emission Tomography (PET) for\n      myocardial perfusion and ischemia. Secondary outcomes comprise physiological, behavioral and\n      psychosocial risk factors for CHD. The field site will be Columbia University Medical Center\n      and the coordinating center will be MUMRI-Center for Natural Medicine and Prevention."
