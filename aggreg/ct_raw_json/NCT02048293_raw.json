The aim of this study was to investigate the pharmacodynamic profile of the\n      innovative molecule of remifentanil (group O = Ultiva\u00ae) and two unbranded molecules (group A\n      = Remifentanil Laboratorios Chalver de Colombia S.A. and group B =  Fada Remifentanilo)\n      registered in Colombia.\n\n      Methods. The investigators carried out a double-blind, randomized, controlled trial. The\n      branded molecule of remifentanil (group O, n=29) was compared against the two unbranded\n      molecules (group A, n=29; group B, n=32) during anesthetic induction and tracheal intubation\n      in adult patients American Society of Anesthesiology Physical Status Classification = I\n      without predictors for difficult airway. The target controlled infusion (TCI) doses\n      evaluated were 6, 8 and 10 ng/ml with the Minto model. Induction was complemented with\n      propofol 5 mg/ml (TCI) with the Schneider model and rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg. The primary\n      outcome was defined as the difference in mean arterial pressure and heart rate\n      pre-intubation (TCI equilibrium) and post-intubation (maximum measurement within 5 minutes)."
