This study will investigate the metabolism of\n      these amino acids in individuals with normal glucose metabolism compared to overweight or\n      obese pre-diabetic individuals.  The purpose of this study is to determine how elevated\n      levels of the branched-chain amino acids may contribute to the development of insulin\n      resistance and ultimately diabetes.  An additional purpose is to determine whether exercise\n      or gastric bypass (GBP) surgery intervention can correct aberrations in branched-chain amino\n      acid metabolism as insulin sensitivity improves.  This information will be used to further\n      our understanding of the development of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes in at-risk\n      populations and potentially improve clinical treatment of such conditions."
