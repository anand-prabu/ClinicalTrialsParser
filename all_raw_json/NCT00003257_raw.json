Evaluate the duration of response, time to\n      disease progression, and overall survival of these patients after this treatment. III.\n      Evaluate the effectiveness of Ad5CMV-p53 in reducing cancer morbidity (pain assessment,\n      analgesic consumption, and Karnofsky performance status). IV. Assess the quality of life of\n      these patients receiving this treatment.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, open label study. All patients receive direct intratumoral\n      injections of Ad5CMV-p53 on days 1, 2, and 3 of each 4-week treatment course. Patients are\n      treated for at least 2 courses barring local disease progression or unacceptable adverse\n      events; patients with responding or stable disease receive a maximum of 12 courses. Patients\n      are evaluated for safety 4 weeks from the completion of the last treatment. Quality of life\n      is assessed before, during, and after treatment. Patients are followed every 2 months for up\n      to 18 months or until death.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 39 patients will be accrued for this study."
