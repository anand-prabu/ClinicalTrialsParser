            "textblock": "Purpose:\n\n      The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility and safety of using small beads\n      (70-150 micron in place of 100-300 micron) to deliver chemotherapy into the liver to treat\n      patients with liver lesions from colorectal cancer. The beads (LC-Bead M1) will be loaded\n      with irinotecan (DEBIRI-M1), and used to administer transarterichemoembolization (TACE).\n\n      Eligibility:\n\n      Patients with liver cancer from colorectal cancer.\n\n      Study Overview/ Treatment:\n\n      DEBIRI, loaded with irinotecan, is a device that utilizes tiny beads (70-150 microns) to\n      deliver chemotherapy agents into liver tumor(s) via the hepatic artery. This device allows\n      for continuous release of irinotecan into the liver tumor tissue(s) causing necrosis of the\n      targeted tumor(s). The potential advantages of the smaller beads are deeper penetration into\n      the tumor bed, while avoiding premature proximal occlusion of vessels feeding the tumor, and\n      more consistent dosing.  Response to therapy will be evaluated monthly by clinic visits and\n      blood tests (to include assessment of liver function and tumor markers) and by imaging\n      (usually MRIs) every 1-2 months. Patients will be on study for 6 months after which they\n      will be exited from the study and followed for survival. Once exited from the study they\n      will continue to be eligible to receive DEBIRI, should it be recommended."
