  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a pedometer-based unsupervised exercise
      program is more effective than a general exercise recommendation to increase lifestyle
      physical activity in adult patients with asthma.

    <description>After baseline assessments, both groups will receive a educational session, regarding important aspects of asthma plus a unsupervised exercise prescription (walking, 5 times per week, for at least 30 minutes). Only the experimental group will receive a pedometer-based physical activity prescription, consisting of targets (steps per day) to be achieved. The initial target will be determined based on the average of steps per day assessed during the baseline assessments plus 1000 steps. The targets will be biweekly increased  up to the maximum of 12500 steps per day. Both groups will be contact once a week (by phone) and will be asked to return for asthma control assessments once a month.</description>
