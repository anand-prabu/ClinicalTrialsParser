To collect the data, a group was formed with\n      people trained as evaluators, responsible for election, randomization, filling of First\n      Assessment and Subsequent Assessment forms, recording of photo images and pain evaluation\n      before and after treatment with laser; and applicators, responsible for laser handling and\n      irradiation. Data collection followed the following order: filling of the first instrument,\n      breast image capture, suckling observation, identification of pain during the child's breast\n      sucking, laser irradiation and re-identification of pain during the child's breast sucking\n      after laser treatment. The collection of data of this form occurred continuously every\n      twelve hours until repair of the nipple trauma or patient discharge. A minimum of two and a\n      maximum of six assessments were carried out, from the inclusion of the patient in the study\n      (taken as zero hour) to 60 hours postpartum. Irradiation, in turn, was performed every 24\n      hours during the same period, including one to three irradiations per patient in each of the\n      breasts."
