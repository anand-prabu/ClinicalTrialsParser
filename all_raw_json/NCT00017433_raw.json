Determine the overall and\n      relapse-free survival rates of patients treated with this drug. III. Determine the safety\n      profile of this drug in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients receive arsenic trioxide IV on days 1-5 and 8-12. Treatment repeats every\n      4 weeks for up to 6 courses. Patients are followed at 4 weeks after the last treatment dose.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 55 patients will be accrued for this study."
