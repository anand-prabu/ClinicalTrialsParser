Among them, Low PEEP algorithm approach\n      and High PEEP algorithm approach. These approaches are characterized by a generalized\n      application of certain level of PEEP according to a predefined algorithm. However, these\n      algorithms fail to account for inter-individual variations between patients with different\n      diseases and with different severities of the same underlying process.    Therefore, we\n      advocate for an individualized application of PEEP.
