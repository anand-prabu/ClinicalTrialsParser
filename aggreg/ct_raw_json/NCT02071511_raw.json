The randomization in the study is done before ablation.\n\n      For the ablation, an arterial access is required in both groups.  During a 30 minutes\n      waiting time which will apply to both groups, renal denervation will be performed.\n\n      In this period of time operators and staff will be blinded for the procedure, thereby they\n      won't know if the patients will receive a renal denervation, in that way the investigators\n      are avoiding a bias of future treatment of the patients.\n\n      Follow up and repeat procedures:\n\n      All Patients will be followed for a period of 3, 6, 9, 12 and 18 months after the procedure.\n\n      Regular visits are done in the investigators office. The visit will include ICD\n      Interrogation, VT documentation in ICD Holter, 24-hour Holter ECG or Tele-ECGs,\n      echocardiography.\n\n      Re- VT ablations are allowed at any time. In case of renal artery stenosis, denervation will\n      not be performed. Drug therapy can be continued."
