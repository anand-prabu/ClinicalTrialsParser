Determine the response rates, duration of response, and survival in women\n      with advanced, recurrent, or inoperable cervical cancer treated with interleukin-12. II.\n      Determine the toxic effects of systemic interleukin-12 in these patients. III. Correlate\n      response to therapy and survival with the presence or absence of human papilloma virus\n      (HPV), and the specific subtype of HPV, in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to prior chemotherapy (yes vs no). Patients\n      receive induction interleukin-12 IV over 5-20 seconds on day -13 and then daily on days 1-5.\n      Treatment continues every 21 days in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease\n      progression. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years,\n      and then annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 78 patients (39 per stratum) will be accrued for this study\n      within 26 months."
