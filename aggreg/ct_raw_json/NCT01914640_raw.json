The populations of these 7 regions were obtained from the records of the 2000 census. The study sample included males and non-pregnant females aged between 20 and 83 years. The populations of city centers, districts, and villages were classified by using the stratified sampling method and then were selected from the data collected from the household identification forms by random sampling. The geography of Turkey was classified into three groups according to altitude. Sea level was accepted as zero. 0-300 m was taken as coastal, 300-900 m as moderate"

The World Health Organization (WHO) reported sex\n      specific WC cut off values for the Caucasian people, named as action levels 1 and 2, to\n      define the overweight or obese people. These cut off values, originally established in a\n      Dutch population, were later adopted by several medical organizations in order to define\n      Metabolic Syndrome. However, these cut off levels may not necessarily represent the\n      characteristics of the other populations. Therefore it is recommended that the sex specific\n      WC cut off points should be established for different ethnic groups.\n\n      The investigators aimed to investigate whether the suggested sex specific WC cut off points\n      for the Caucasian adults are appropriate for the Turkish adult population. The secondary aim\n      of the study is to search for better WC cut off points to predict obesity, metabolic\n      syndrome and increased cardiovascular risk in Turkish adult men and women."
