Sometimes postoperative sore throat affects patients' satisfaction and\n      daily activities. It can be correlated with dysphagia and may limit oral intake especially\n      in children.The incidence of postoperative sore throat after laryngeal mask airway insertion\n      varies from 5.8-34% in adult(13) and 17.5% in pediatric.Somehow, almost the studies of\n      postoperative sore throat after laryngeal mask airway removal were done in awake state. Our\n      study object to test that post operative sore throat after LMA removal in deep anesthetized\n      children is lower than awake children."

The patients who have the following problems: active airway disease, risk of\n      aspiration, intra-peritoneal or airway surgery will be excluded.\n\n      At the day of surgery, demographic data will be recorded by nurse anesthetist.
