    <textblock>
      The goal of this research study is to enhance smoking cessation rates for homeless smokers
      by testing effects of 1) an Intensive Smoking Intervention, and 2) integrating alcohol abuse
      treatment with smoking cessation. We will utilize a 3-group randomized design to test study
      hypotheses. The three study conditions are 1) Integrated Intensive Smoking plus Alcohol
      intervention using cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), CBT—(IS+A); 2) Intensive Smoking
      Intervention using CBT—(IS); or 3) Usual Care (brief smoking cessation and brief alcohol
      counseling both based on the United States Public Health Service's Guidelines)—(UC). All
      participants will receive 12-week treatment with nicotine patch plus nicotine gum/lozenge.
      Counseling will follow the protocol used in a recent study of alcohol dependent smokers and
      will include weekly individual sessions for 3 months followed by monthly booster group
      sessions for 3 months. As a strategy to integrate proposed project with existing programs at
      the shelters, all group counseling sessions will be co-facilitated by trained study staff
      and trained homeless shelter staff.  All 3 study conditions will have equal number of study
      contacts. Study staff will make retention contacts with participants in the community during
      weeks that do not have study visits scheduled. Primary smoking outcome is cotinine-verified
      7-day smoking abstinence at week 52 follow-up while secondary outcome is prolonged smoking
      abstinence at weeks 12, 24, and 52. Secondary alcohol outcome will be self-reported
      continuous alcohol abstinence for 90 days at week 52. Recruitment and retention will be
      enhanced by use of debit cards, bus passes, other non-monetary incentives, attractive
      intervention materials, collaboration with homeless shelters, and advice from a Community
      Advisory Board. Participants will be enrolled from homeless shelters and facilities in the
      7-county greater Minneapolis/St. Paul metro area. Our power calculation indicates that a
      sample size of 215 per study condition is needed to detect proposed treatment effects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To achieve the study goal, we have selected a 3-group randomized clinical trial (RCT) design
      that includes 1) Usual Care, 2) Intensive smoking cessation, and 3) Integrated Intensive
      Smoking and Alcohol Intervention. Having both a usual care and intensive smoking cessation
      conditions will enable us assess the added benefits of intensive smoking intervention which
      has been shown in the general population but has never been studied in homeless populations.
      Adding alcohol treatment to smoking intervention will enable us assess whether addressing
      alcohol abuse will result in improved smoking abstinence, an important scientific question
      that has never been studied in homeless populations.

      Study conditions: All three study conditions have identical number of contacts; the duration
      of counseling time is also identical in IS and IS+A conditions. We considered a design in
      which the duration of counseling in the UC will be identical to those in IS and IS+A
      conditions but decided against this because it will create a usual care condition that
      exceeds standard practice for brief interventions. We understand that testing hypothesis 3
      confounds contact time with treatment content, and hence we will not be able to determine
      that observed differences in outcome are due to specific treatment components. However,
      given the current state of knowledge about treating homeless alcohol abusing smokers, we
      believe it is sufficient to show that our intervention led to improved outcome in this group
      without knowing if the finding is due to specific intervention content. Subsequent research
      will be needed to disentangle various intervention components.

      All participants will receive 12-week treatment with nicotine patch plus nicotine
      gum/lozenge. Counseling will include weekly individual sessions for 3 months followed by
      monthly booster group sessions for 3 months. Each participant will be randomly assigned to a
      condition, which will dictate their treatment. Each participant will be asked to engage in
      the therapy assigned to their condition, and work to quit smoking and consuming alcohol over
      a period of one year.
