      The purpose of this study to assess 1)the efficacy of high definition endoscopy (HD) and
      i-Scan endoscopy (SE) in detecting esophageal minimal change erosions (MCL) in dyspeptic
      patients with or without GERD 2) the efficacy of GERD Q compared with 24 hour pH
      monitoring(PHM)in GERD diagnosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The GERD Q is a validated tool for GERD diagnosis and accepted in the western countries
      where the prevalnce of GERD is higher than in Asia.Minimal change lesions (MCL) is one of
      endoscopic finding in non erosive reflux disease ,but the association of MCL with GERD is
      controversy. i- Scan is a newly developed image-enhanced endoscopy that provides higher
      resolution images and modulated  images to improve the details of gastrointestinal
      epithelium and vascularity may improve the detection of the esophageal MCL in GERD.

    <description>All patients undergone endoscopy. The esophagus was examined by HD and SE with the TE-e mode sequentially. The captured images were independently evaluated for MCL (punctate erythema (PE), blurred vessels (BV), minute erosion (ME) and triangular lesion with elongated pit (TLE)) by three endoscopists. The agreement of &gt; 2 endoscopists was accepted as a final result.</description>
