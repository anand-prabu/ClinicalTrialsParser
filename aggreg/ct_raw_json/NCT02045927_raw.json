The\n      control group will labeled as the \"B\" group.  In the BIS-augmented group, sedation\n      requirement will be titrated according to an average of BIS reading in the 5 minute period\n      prior to assessment with a goal of maintaining a value of (60-70) in addition to a RASS\n      score goal of (-1 to -2), provided no noxious stimulation such as endotracheal suctioning\n      and/or wound dressing has occurred for at least 30 minutes, BIS values have been stable for\n      at least 5 minutes, signal quality index (>80%), minimal EMG interference (<50%), patient is\n      not shivering, and patient does not have warmer or other devices that may produce an\n      electric current on their body or nearby. In the RASS group, sedation requirements will be\n      titrated to maintain a RASS score of (-1 to -2), will be assessed via the nurse taking care\n      of the patient provided no noxious stimulation has occurred for at least 30 minutes prior to\n      assessment.\n\n      Both groups will have sedation assessment at least every 6 hours during a 12 hour shift and\n      as needed as per ICU RN and/or physician. Nurses will be free to exercise their judgment if\n      they deem that their patients require more or less sedation that is inconsistent with\n      patient's BIS or RASS score, they will, however, be required to provide a rationale for\n      their judgment and record such events on a special form created for this study."
