We evaluate the\n      success of treatment and the time required for titers of \u03b2-hCG to become negative. Methods:\n      A double-blind randomized study, held at the Department of Obstetrics UNIFESP. The patients\n      will be divided into two groups: in one patients will be administered a single intramuscular\n      dose of 50 mg/m2 of Methotrexate and in the other patients will be prescribed Placebo\n      intramuscularly. The monitoring will be done by measurement of \u03b2-hCG in the 4th and 7th day.\n      When the decline of beta-hCG titers was > 15% in this interval, the patient was followed\n      with weekly dosing of \u03b2-hCG until the titers become negative. The criterion of success is\n      when the \u03b2-hCG was negative. The treatment failure occurs when surgery was necessary."
