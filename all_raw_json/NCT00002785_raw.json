Combining more than one drug may kill more cancer cells. Bone\n      marrow transplantation may allow the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy and kill\n      more cancer cells. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage cancer cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy, bone marrow\n      transplantation, and radiation therapy in treating infants with acute lymphoblastic\n      leukemia."

Assess the feasibility and outcome of intensified induction/consolidation\n      followed by intensified re-induction/re-intensification in infants less than 1 year of age\n      with newly diagnosed acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). II. Evaluate the feasibility and\n      outcome of bone marrow transplantation using family or unrelated donors in infants with the\n      11q23 abnormality. III. Evaluate neuropsychologic outcome upon completion of protocol\n      therapy in patients who have reached the ages of 3 and 7 years, with special attention to\n      the outcome in infants who received total-body irradiation. IV. Study the biology of infant\n      ALL in samples of leukemic blood and bone marrow. V. Study the possible associations among\n      patient- and disease-specific factors and family sociodemographic characteristics that\n      mediate treatment outcome.\n\n      OUTLINE: Upon completion of Induction/Intensification and Re-Induction therapy, patients\n      with the 11q23 abnormality and with a matched or one-antigen mismatched related or unrelated\n      donor proceed immediately to Transplantation; all others proceed to Re-Intensification,\n      Consolidation, Intensified Maintenance, and Routine Maintenance.
