            "textblock": "Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is a chronic, autoimmune inflammatory disease that leads to\n      significant pain, joint destruction and functional decline, and has a substantial economic\n      impact both for sufferers and society. Although the etiology of RA is unknown, it is\n      generally accepted that it arises from an interplay of genetic predisposition (in\n      particular, HLA-DR allele subtypes and specific gene polymorphisms), immunological\n      deregulation (e. g. autoantibody production), and environmental factors. The prevalence and\n      incidence of RA in Norway is estimated to 0,4-0,5 % and 0,020-0,025 %, respectively, and\n      incidence rates are 2-4-fold higher in women. Synovitis and bone resorption are key\n      pathogenetic factors in RA and these patients have elevated cytokine levels in joints and\n      blood (i.e. TNF, IL-1, IL-6). RA is also associated with significant comorbidity; the most\n      important is premature cardiovascular disease that significantly contributes to increased\n      mortality. Compared with the general population, mortality in RA is from 1,57-2,0-fold\n      higher in Norway and Sweden, and their mean life expectancy is reduced by an average of 5-10\n      years. Medical treatment of RA consists of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, systemic\n      glucocorticosteroids, traditional disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (including\n      methotrexate) and biologic therapies (including anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) \u03b1, anti-IL\n      6 and anti-CD20 therapy). Also, a considerable portion of the patients are in need of joint\n      replacement surgery and in need of rehabilitation.\n\n      However, the treatment opportunities are still not optimal. In a large proportion of the\n      patients, full control of the disease is not possible due to limited effect of available\n      therapies and/or intolerance to these therapies. Therefore, there is a huge need to find new\n      therapeutic alternatives to treat RA.\n\n      Since studies on healthy volunteers and IBD-patients support that the mushroom extract\n      AndoSanTM exert an anti-inflammatory effect in vivo, the investigators wanted to examine in\n      a pilot study whether this effect also was evident in patients with RA. A potential\n      anti-inflammatory effect could prove beneficial in these seriously ill patients, who\n      accordingly could experience less side effects (edema, granulocytopenia, diminished tissue\n      repair) due to potential reduction number and dose of disease modifying drugs."
