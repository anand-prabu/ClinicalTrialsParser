  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In cystic fibrosis, there is a critical need for better predictors of treatment response.
      The investigators have identified a panel of white blood cell biomarkers which can be
      directly measured as a blood test in subjects with cystic fibrosis. These biomarkers predict
      reduction of airway inflammation and infection more accurately than lung function testing,
      in patients receiving intravenous antibiotic therapy. In the current study, we hypothesize
      that this panel of gene biomarkers which can be readily measured from peripheral blood will
      sensitively predict changes in inflammation when patients receive inhaled antibiotic
      therapy, specifically Cayston (or inhaled aztreonam lysine). Patients enrolled in the study
      will have blood drawn before and after a month of inhaled Cayston, in order to test whether
      genes predict response to Cayston therapy more robustly than do standard measures such as
      lung function tests.

        Enrolled subjects will include adults with cystic fibrosis, over the age of 18 years, who
        are at baseline health and colonized with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and who are newly
        prescribed Cayston (aztreonam lysine) for inhalation, or who are resuming use of this drug
        after a 6 month period off of Cayston.
