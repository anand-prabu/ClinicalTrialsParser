      The low level laser therapy is able to improve immediately and long term (after 4 weeks of
      treatment, 3 days per week resulting in 12 applications of low level laser therapy)
      isokinetic muscle performance of the quadriceps femoris muscle (peak torque, total muscular
      work , maximum power and fatigue index - normalized by body weight) pre-exercise concentric
      isokinetic quadriceps femoris muscle in subjects with diabetes mellitus
      non-insulin-dependent.

      The low level laser therapy is able to improve after 4 weeks of treatment, 3 days per week
      resulting in 12 applications of low level laser therapy, the indicators: The low level laser
      therapy is able to improve immediately and long term (after 4 weeks of treatment, 3 days per
      week resulting in 12 applications of low level laser therapy), the indirect blood markers
      for muscle damage that evaluate the enzymatic activity of creatine Kinase (CK) and Lactate
      Dehydrogenase (LDH) and the visual analog scale (VAS-F) for fatigue, improves indicators F
      2.2 point of the WHOQOL-100 for fatigue, improvement in functional indicators of the lower
      lower Extremity functional regarding Scale, functional improvement in performance in the
      execution of the test stand and sit and walk test six minutes, the indicators for quality
      improvement of life questionnaire for the Diabetes Quality of Life Measure and emotional
      states through the questionnaire Problems Areas in Diabetes Scale. Eligibility criteria:
      Diagnosis for Diabetes mellitus non-insulin-dependent confirmed by the individual physician,
      presenting between 30 to 70 years.Exclusion criteria: Diagnosis of cardiovascular disorders,
      diagnosis of diabetic neuropathy, which have a skin lesion or local infection (quadriceps),
      history of musculoskeletal injuries in the last 6 months or during the study, individuals
      unable to perform the assessment protocols / exercise so satisfactory, those who are doing
      some kind of regular physical activity and who underwent alcohol intake in the 24 hours
      before any of the stages of the study.
