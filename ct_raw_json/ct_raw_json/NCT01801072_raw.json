In other words, the\n      investigators cannot favor a decision to either administer or not administer this drug in\n      these patients based on the existing information. The utility of anti-epileptic prophlaxis\n      in the perioperative period for patients undergoing intracranial aneurysm repair remains a\n      common practice that is not supported by the current literature that includes retrospective\n      analyses as well as prospective trials for similar but not identical types of patients. The\n      investigators propose to settle this dilemma by performing a prospective randomized trial in\n      patients undergoing aneurysm repair in order to definitively determine if the common\n      practice of perioperative antiepileptic drug administration has any utility."
