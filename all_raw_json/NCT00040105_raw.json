            "textblock": "R115777 is a new drug that blocks the function of an enzyme that is important in making some\n      proteins work. One of the most important targets for this enzyme is a protein that can make\n      cells become cancer. Imatinib mesylate is a drug that blocks the function of the protein\n      that comes from the Philadelphia chromosome. The Philadelphia chromosome is an abnormality\n      in chromosomes 9 and 22 that changes blood cells into leukemia cells.\n\n      Before treatment starts, participants will have a physical exam, blood tests (About 3 tubes,\n      2 teaspoons each), and a bone marrow biopsy.  The bone marrow will be removed with a large\n      needle.\n\n      Participants in this study will take imatinib mesylate by mouth every day for as long as\n      they stay on study, which means as long as it works. Participants will also take R115777\n      twice a day for 2 weeks.  This will be repeated every 3 weeks. The amount of each of these\n      medications that participants take will depend on when they enter the study. The doses will\n      be slowly increased from participant to participant until the highest dose that does not\n      cause serious side effects is found.\n\n      Participants will be asked to visit their doctor for a physical exam and measurement of\n      vital signs. The frequency of doctor visits will vary depending on physical condition.\n      Blood tests (about 2 teaspoons each) will be done every week during the first 3 weeks of\n      treatment.  Blood tests will then be done every 8-12 weeks for the length of the study, as\n      needed.  The blood samples will be used for routine lab tests. A bone marrow sample will\n      also be taken to check and measure cells related to the disease every 3 months in the first\n      year and then every 6-12 months. Participants can stay on study for as long as the treatment\n      is considered to be beneficial. Participants will be taken off study if their disease gets\n      worse or intolerable side effects occur.\n\n      This is an investigational study.  The FDA has authorized the use of imatinib mesylate for\n      patients with CML. It is the combination of imatinib mesylate and R115777 that is\n      experimental.  R115777 has been authorized for investigational use only.  A maximum of 30\n      patients will take part in this study.  All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson."
