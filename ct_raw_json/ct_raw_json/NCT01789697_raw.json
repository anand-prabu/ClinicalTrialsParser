The outcomes that will be measured are anxiety,\n      pain, follow-up visits and received phone calls, and reporting signs of surgical site\n      infection. Participants will include Dr. Oren Gottfried's patients who underwent spine\n      surgery at Duke Hospital or at Duke Raleigh Hospital. Patients will be approached after\n      determination that the patient is going to undergo spinal surgery. All patients meeting\n      inclusion criteria will be approached to participate irrespective of race or ethnicity. A\n      total of 194 subjects will be recruited."
