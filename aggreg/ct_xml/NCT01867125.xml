    <textblock>
      This randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled. parallel-group study will
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of lebrikizumab in patients with asthma whose disease
      remains uncontrolled despite daily treatment with inhaled corticosteroid therapy and at
      least one second controller medication. Patients will be randomized 1:1:1 to receive
      double-blind treatment with either lebrikizumab (&quot;high&quot; or &quot;low&quot;) or placebo, administered
      subcutaneously every 4 weeks for 52 weeks, in addition to their standard-of-care therapy.
      This will be followed by a 52-week double-blind active treatment extension. The anticipated
      time on study treatment is 104 weeks. After study treatment, all patients will complete a 20
      week safety follow-up.
