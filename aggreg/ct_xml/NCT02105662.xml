      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of MK-5172 100 mg in
      combination with MK-8742 50 mg in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) in
      participants who are co-infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The primary
      hypothesis is that the percentage of participants who receive MK-5172 + MK-8742 and achieve
      Sustained Virologic Response after 12 weeks of therapy (SVR12) will be greater than 70%.
