  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PER977 monotherapy and co-administration following 60 mg edoxaban will have an acceptable
      safety and tolerability profile with no impact on pro-coagulant biomarkers.  A dose of
      PER977 that reverses the effects of edoxaban on the pharmacodynamic (PD) biomarkers (point
      of care prothrombin time [PoC-PT]), and/or secondary biomarkers (thromboelastography
      reaction time [TEG-R]) will be identified.

      Normal subjects will be dosed with PER977 alone and 1 week later, they will be given a
      single dose of edoxaban followed in 3 hours by a single IV dose of PER977.  The purpose is
      to show safety and tolerability of PER977 alone and when combined with a NOAC (edoxaban).
      The study will also provide some insight into the doses that may be required to reverse a
      steady state edoxaban.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Adults age 18 to 45 years, inclusive

          2. Laboratory values (chemistry, complete blood count coagulation assessments) and
             urinalysis performed during screening up to 21 days prior to administration of study
             treatment are within normal limits.

          3. No clinically significant findings on 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) performed
             during screening.

          4. Body mass index (BMI) 18 to  ≤32 kg/m2, inclusive

          5. Male subjects agree to use appropriate contraception (i.e., double barrier
             contraception such as a latex condom with spermicide with a female partner of
             child-bearing potential (a non-menopausal female who has not had one of the
             following: a) a hysterectomy (with or without oophorectomy), b) a bilateral
             oophorectomy without hysterectomy, or c) a medically documented ovarian failure)
             using a diaphragm or cervical cap or single barrier contraception if the female
             partner is using an intrauterine device or hormonal contraceptives or is sterilized;
             no barrier is required if the female partner has had a hysterectomy) when engaging in
             sexual activity during the course of the study. Moreover, male subjects should not
             donate sperm or attempt to impregnate a partner during the course of the study and
             for a period of 12 weeks following discharge from the study.

          6. Female subjects of non-childbearing potential (a menopausal female with the above 3
             definitions for menopause) agree to use two forms of non-hormonal contraceptive (e.g.
             barrier methods [condom or diaphragm]) or intrauterine device for the duration of the
             study and for 30 days following the completion of the study.  Women are considered
             post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have had 12 months of
             natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age
             appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral
             oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks ago.
             In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has
             been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she considered not of child
             bearing potential.

          7. Nonsmokers or nonusers of nicotine containing products within 3 months of dosing
             (occasional use of tobacco products within 30 days of dosing will be considered on a
             case-by-case basis)

          8. Subjects must understand and agree to comply with the requirements of the study and
             they must be willing to sign the informed consent form indicating voluntary consent
             to participate in the study prior to initiation of screening or study related
             activities.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History or current evidence of clinically significant cardiac, hepatic, renal,
             pulmonary, endocrine, neurologic, infectious, gastrointestinal, hematologic, or
             oncologic disease as determined by screening history, physical examination,
             laboratory test results or 12-lead ECG.  History or current evidence of liver
             function tests greater than the upper limit of normal.  History or current evidence
             of QTc Fridericia (QTcF) greater than normal (430±10 msec for males or 450±10 msec
             for females; average of three measurements).

          2. History of unexplained syncope

          3. Use of any drugs or substances known to be strong inhibitors or strong inducers of
             CYP3A4/5 transporters of p-glycoprotein within 28 days prior to the first dosing
             (Appendix 15.2 and Appendix 15.3)

          4. History of major bleeding, trauma, surgical procedure of any type, or vaginal
             delivery within six months prior to screening

             or platelet inhibitors

          8. Females with a history of dysfunctional uterine bleeding, including history of
             menorrhagia (heavy menstrual bleeding), metrorrhagia or polymenorrhea or current use
             of hormonal contraceptives.

             oral anticoagulants, or other agent known to interact with edoxaban

         15. Active drug, alcohol or nicotine use or dependence or any condition that, in the
             opinion of the Investigator, would interfere with adherence to study protocol
