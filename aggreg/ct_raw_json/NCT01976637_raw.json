There is one uncontrolled trial reporting improvement of\n      clinical symptoms when patients with SVT were treated with fixed compression bandages.\n\n      This study evaluates the efficacy of compression stockings (23-32 mmHg) in the treatment SVT\n      of the legs. The investigators hypothesis is that compression treatment is superior to no\n      compression in alleviating disease related clinical symptoms."
