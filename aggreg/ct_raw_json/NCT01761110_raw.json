Two groups of participants will be followed for 60 days, with 3 research visits.\n      One group will be enrolled prior to the CBBT intervention (pre-intervention), and one group\n      after the CBBT intervention (post-intervention). Data sources will include questionnaires,\n      urine toxicology tests, and medical record data. We hypothesize that compared to the\n      participants in the pre-intervention group, participants in the post-intervention group will\n      be more likely to initiate buprenorphine treatment, reduce opioid use, and reduce high-risk\n      HIV risk behaviors."
