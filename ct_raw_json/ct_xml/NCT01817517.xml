  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is being performed to try to understand if the use of deep brain stimulation
      or DBS can treat the symptoms of Tourette syndrome that do not respond well to current
      medications. In order to do this the investigators will place small stimulation leads on
      both sides of the brain in a region (a portion of the thalamus) that may alter the abnormal
      activity in the brain contributing to the symptoms of Tourette syndrome. This requires two
      surgical procedures, and several preoperative and postoperative visits for tuning the
      stimulation parameters and recording stimulation effects. The FDA has not approved DBS for
      use in people with Tourette syndrome, and Medtronic (the manufacturer of the device) has not
      conducted testing for the system in Tourette syndrome.  Therefore its use in this study is
      experimental.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Males and females who are &gt;= 25 years of age. There is no strict age cutoff at the
             upper limit of inclusion, however subjects may meet the exclusion criteria based on
             medical contraindications to deep brain stimulation surgery (Points 3. and 6. under
             the Exclusion Criteria).Non-English speakers will be included in the study.

          2. Subject has a diagnosis of TS as determined by a review of medical records,
             discussion with referring psychiatrist as well as the DSM-IV criteria.

          3. Subject determined to be treatment-resistant for at least one year prior to the
             Screening Visit as demonstrated by clinical evidence (determined by review of medical
             records and discussion with referring psychiatrist) of persistent disabling tics that
             have not responded to treatment with three adequate regimens of medication including
             two failed trials of at least one neuroleptic and one atypical neuroleptic
             medication, along with one failed trial of a first tier medication as defined as
             follows:

               1. Adequate trials of two different non-neuroleptic medications including drugs
                  from the following (first tier) list: clonidine, guanfacine, and topiramate.
                  Trial failure is defined as demonstrated lack of efficacy or severe side
                  effects.

               2. Two adequate trials of at least one typical neuroleptic medication (pimozide,
                  fluphenazine, haloperidol) and at least one typical neuroleptic medication
                  (risperidone, aripiprazole, ziprasidone, olanzapine, quetiapine). Trial failure
                  is defined as demonstrated lack of efficacy or severe side effects.

          4. A mandatory trial of behavioral interventions in an attempt to reduce the severity of
             the tics or comorbid symptoms must also be completed by the subject before offering
             participation in this trial. This may include habit reversal therapies, stress
             reduction therapies, or other behavioral therapies under investigation for tic
             suppression.

          5. Subject has a tic subscale score of at least 35 on the YGTSS (Yale Global Tic
             Severity Scale) at all three Baseline Visits prior to undergoing surgery.

          6. All other aspects of the subject's care must be optimized during the preceding 6
             months before admission to the study. This includes treatment for comorbid medical,
             neurological, and psychiatric disorders. Additionally, it includes psychological
             interventions for any ongoing psychosocial problems the subject may have during the
             preceding 6 months before study admission.

          7. Subject must be ambulatory.

          8. Females who are postmenopausal, physically incapable of childbearing, or practicing
             an acceptable method of birth control.  Acceptable methods of birth control include
             surgical sterilization, hormonal contraceptives, or double-barrier methods (condom or
             diaphragm with a spermicidal agent or intrauterine device [IUD]).  If practicing an
             acceptable method of birth control, a negative urine pregnancy test result has been
             obtained at baseline Visits 1 and 3.

          9. Subject is determined by an independent psychiatrist with expertise in capacity
             assessments to have decision-making capacity to provide informed consent.

         10. Subject is able to read English, understand and cooperate with study procedures, and
             has signed a written informed consent form prior to any study procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject has a positive urine drug screen at any of the three Baseline Visits.

          2. Subject had major surgery within three months prior to Baseline Visit 1 or has other
             surgery planned during the proposed study period.

          3. Subject is determined by medical consultant to have medical contraindications to
             undergoing surgery.

          4. Subject is pregnant or breast-feeding.

          5. Subject has a history of alcohol or drug abuse within the past 6 months and/or
             dependence within the past year.

          6. Subject has a medical illness/condition, and/or abnormal diagnostic finding that
             would interfere with the completion of the study, confound the results of the study,
             or pose risk to the patient.

          7. Subject has an untreated or uncontrolled Axis I disorder including major depression,
             bipolar disorder, or schizophrenia as determined by the screening psychiatrist.

          8. Subject has a past history of major psychiatric disorder (other than Tourette
             Syndrome with associated ADHD or OCD).

          9. Subject has either a current or past history of suicidal ideation and/or intent.

         10. Subject has a tic disorder or other movement disorder attributable to another
             medical, neurological, or psychiatric disorder other than Tourette Syndrome.

         11. Subject has a drug-induced tic disorder.

         12. Subject has significant psychosocial factors that might increase the risk of the DBS
             procedure or complicate recovery and outcome assessments. (Examples include - history
             of noncompliance with previous medical and psychosocial treatments, multiple failed
             medication treatments of inadequate dose or duration, a history of multiple other
             surgical procedures with poor outcome, unexplained medical history gaps, or pending
             lawsuits or other legal action.)

         13. Subject has metal in the head or any other type of implanted stimulator (i.e. cardiac
             pacemaker, deep brain stimulator for a different disease, spinal cord stimulator,
             cochlear implant, vagus nerve stimulator, etc.).

         14. Subject has participated in another investigational drug trial or therapeutic trial
             within 30 days of Baseline Visit 1.

         15. Subject has a diagnosis of mental retardation.

         16. Subject has a neurological condition, or a history of traumatic brain injury
             associated with loss of consciousness of &gt; 1 hour and/or
             intracranial/epidural/subdural bleeding.
