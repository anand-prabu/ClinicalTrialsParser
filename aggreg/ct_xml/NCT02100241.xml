  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether active stretching with low frequency
      currents are more effective than active stretching in the treatment of hamstring shortness
      syndrome in children.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In 2012 we studied 51 young footballers with Short Hamstring Syndrome in Spain. Three groups
      were formed:

        1. Stretching+Transcutaneous Electrical Nervous Stimulation (TENS);

        2. Active stretching;

        3. Conventional stretching.

      Parameters: straight leg raise test (SLR), popliteal angle with the passive knee extension
      test (PKE) and the toe-touch test (TT).

      The inter-group means were compared and clinically relevant parameters calculated [relative
      risk (RR), absolute risk reduction (ARR), relative risk reduction (RRR) and number needed to
      treat (NNT)].

    <description>The participants performed three specific exercises of static active stretching of the hamstring muscles, maintaining the maximum tightness that was tolerable without pain for 15 seconds. Each exercise were performed twice, with a total of six repetitions.</description>
