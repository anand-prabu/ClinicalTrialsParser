Infants with, or at high probability for, early onset sepsis (positive blood cultures\n             or with clinical/histological chorioamnionitis with the expectation of empirical\n             antimicrobial therapy for \u22655 days)\n\n          2. Infants with persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN)\n\n          3. Congenital or chromosomal anomalies\n\n          4. Congenital or acquired gastrointestinal pathology that preclude feeds soon after\n             birth (e.g. cleft lip is not an exclusion criterion, but a duodenal atresia is)\n\n          5. Infants in extremis to whom no further intensive care is offered by attending\n             neonatologist (e.g., infant being provided only hospice/comfort care)\n\n          6. Other conditions of the infant which, in the opinion of the attending neonatologist,\n             preclude participation\n\n          7. Positive maternal HIV status"
