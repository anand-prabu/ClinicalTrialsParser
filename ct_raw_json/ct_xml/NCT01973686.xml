  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study is to investigate the changes in body composition and the
      degree of compensation to exercise induced energy expenditure after 1 year of physical
      activity with either moderate or vigorous intensity in overweight and class 1 obese men and
      women. The present study is a sub study to main study &quot;Active Commuting To Improve
      Well-being and Health in Everyday Life&quot; (NCT 01962259)
