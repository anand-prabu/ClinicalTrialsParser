Patients will receive Abraxane  on Day 1 of each 1-week cycle\n      and T-DM1 on Day 1 of each 3-week cycle. Patients with take Lapatinib orally daily.\n      Anticipated time on study treatment is up to 12 cycles for patients metastatic breast\n      cancer, until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs.\n\n      The purpose of this study is to test the safety of Trastuzumab Emtansine in combination with\n      Abraxane and Lapatinib at different dose levels.  The investigators are proposing in this\n      phase Ib study to assess the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of Trastuzumab Emtansine in\n      combination with Lapatinib plus Abraxane in metastatic Her2 over-expressed breast cancer.\n\n      The investigators hypothesize that combining antibody-drug conjugate trastuzumab-emtansine\n      and lapatinib together with Abraxane will improve clinical efficacy by affecting both PI3K\n      and ERK1,2 MAPK pathways."
