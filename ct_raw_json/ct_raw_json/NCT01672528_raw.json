These, together with input from a multidisciplinary team, will aim to improve drafts\n      of disease specific questionnaires. This will be followed by Phase 2 which will trial the\n      questionnaires in a group of approximately 600 patients from three sites. In Phase 2\n      patients will be asked to complete a pre-procedure questionnaire relating to their symptoms,\n      quality of life and procedure expectations. They will also be sent post-procedure\n      questionnaires relating to procedural outcomes, symptoms and quality of life at 8-12 weeks\n      post procedure and at 1 and 5 years post-procedure.\n\n      The responses obtained from these PROMs will be used to undertake recommended statistical\n      tests of reliability and validity."
