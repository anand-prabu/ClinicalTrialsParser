            "textblock": "Recently, HDR brachytherapy delivering only a 19 Gy fraction was proposed as exclusive\n      treatment for low and intermediate risk prostate cancers. With a median 3-year follow-up,\n      the Spanish team reported a biochemical control rate of 100% and 87%, respectively, for low\n      risk and intermediate risk tumors. In parallel with these encouraging results regarding\n      biochemical control, the authors described excellent urinary and digestive tolerance,\n      notably the absence of grade > 2 complications. However, it should be noted, in this study,\n      that special protection was provided to the anterior aspect of the rectum by means of a 10\n      ml transperineal injection of hyaluronic acid into the prostate-rectal interspace.\n\n      The idea of using a single high dose (in one fraction) was proposed at the MSKCC by the team\n      of Fucks et al.  which, in 2008, following a median 18-month follow-up, published a a 90%\n      local control rate for spinal metastases after a single dose at 18 to 24 Gy.\n\n      The aim of the present study is to analyze acute urinary and digestive toxicity (< 180 days)\n      observed following interstitial high dose rate prostate brachytherapy delivering a total\n      dose of 20 Gy in one fraction."
