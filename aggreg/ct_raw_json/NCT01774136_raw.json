The intervention includes two\n      components: (1) a 2-week HIV/C-IMCI training for CCGs and their associated facilitators and\n      supervisors, and (2) continuous support and supervision following the continuous quality\n      improvement (CQI) framework, a  low-technology approach to management and supervision of\n      health programs. The primary objectives of the proposed evaluation are to measure the effect\n      of the intervention on key outcomes, including early uptake of antenatal care, facility\n      based delivery, postnatal visits, coverage of exclusive breastfeeding, and uptake of HIV PCR\n      testing in infants at 6 weeks. We will also examine the effects of the intervention on\n      immunization uptake up to 12 months and knowledge and practices of CCGs and mothers\n      pertaining to maternal, newborn and child health."
