This study will consist of screening phase (between 21 and 2 days\n      prior to dose administration), a double-blind treatment phase (Part A - 7 days and Part B -\n      13 days), and a follow-up phase (within 7 to 14 days after last dose administration).

In Part B of the study\n      approximately 48 elderly healthy male and female participants will be randomly allocated to\n      A, B, and C cohorts to receive single daily doses of either JNJ-39393406 or placebo for 13\n      consecutive days. Dose levels in Part B will be selected based on the PK data from Part A.\n      In both Part A and Part B of the study the dose levels will be increased only after\n      acceptable safety and tolerability data will be obtained. Safety evaluations will include\n      assessments of adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, 24-hour creatinine clearance,\n      Holter monitoring, telemetry, electrocardiogram, vital signs, physical examination, and\n      neurological examination.
