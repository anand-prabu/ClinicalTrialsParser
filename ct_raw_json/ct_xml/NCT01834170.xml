  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic cancer is the 11th most common type of cancer but it is the fourth leading cause
      of cancer death. The only effective treatment for pancreatic cancer includes surgery.
      However, only 20% of the patients have surgically treatable disease. Also, the 5-year
      survival for the surgically treated patients is only 15%.

      About 40% of the patients present with advanced disease with distant metastasis, and the
      remaining 40% present with locally advanced unresectable cancer with the tumor invaded into
      surrounding major vessels. For those with locally advanced disease, systemic chemotherapy
      with or without radiotherapy provides palliation of the symptoms but cannot cure the
      disorder. Systemic chemotherapy is given through peripheral vessels.

      The investigators hypothesized that direct injection of the chemotherapeutic drug into the
      tumor may help to boost the effect of systemic chemotherapy and radiotherapy in those with
      locally advanced pancreatic cancer.
