In addition, we will determine the effects of a single, modest session\n      of exercise on the body's ability to control blood sugar and regulate fat metabolism in\n      obese sedentary adults vs. obese adults who live a physically active lifestyle. Our study\n      focuses on identifying mechanisms responsible for improved insulin action related to regular\n      exercise and to provide novel targets for preventing and treating type 2 diabetes."
