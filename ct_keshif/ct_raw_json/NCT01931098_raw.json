Up to 34 participants will be enrolled in Group 1 and up to 32 participants will\n      be enrolled in Group 2.\n\n      Study Drug Administration:\n\n      Each cycle is 28 days.\n\n      You will take capsules of topotecan by mouth 1 time everyday at about the same time each\n      day.  You should swallow the capsules whole with at least 1 cup (8 ounces) of water, with or\n      without food.\n\n      You will take tablets of pazopanib by mouth 1 time every day at about the same time each\n      day.  They should be taken on an empty stomach (at least 1 hour before and 2 hour after\n      eating) with about 1 cup (8 ounces) of water.\n\n      If you vomit after taking the study drugs, you should not take a replacement dose on that\n      day.  You should resume taking the study drugs at the next scheduled dose on the following\n      day.  If vomiting continues, you should tell your doctor.\n\n      You will be given a study drug diary to record the times that you take the study drugs and\n      if you vomit.  You should bring the diary to each study visit.\n\n      Study Visits:\n\n      At Week 1, your blood pressure will be measured.\n\n      At Week 2, your blood pressure will be measured and blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn\n      for routine tests.\n\n      At Week 4, you will have an EKG.\n\n      Every 4 weeks:\n\n        -  You will have a physical exam.\n\n        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine and biomarker testing.\n\n        -  Urine will be collected to check your kidney function.\n\n      Every 8 weeks:\n\n        -  You will have a neurological exam.\n\n        -  Blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn to check thyroid function.\n\n        -  You will have an EKG.\n\n      If you are in Group A, you will have a brain MRI or CT scan at Week 4 of Cycle 2, and then\n      every other cycle after that (Cycles 4, 6, 8 and so on) to check the status of the disease.\n      You will also complete the symptom questionnaire at these visits.\n\n      If you are in Group B, you will have a brain MRI or CT scan at Week 4 of Cycles 1, 2, 3, and\n      then every other cycle after that (Cycles 5, 7, 9 and so on)  to check the status of  the\n      disease.  You will also complete the symptom questionnaire at these visits.\n\n      At any time during the study, extra tests may be performed if the doctor thinks they are\n      needed for your safety.  The study doctor will tell you more about any extra tests.\n\n      End-of-Treatment Visit:\n\n      Within 14 days after your last dose of the study drugs, you will have an end-of-treatment\n      visit.  The following tests and procedures will be performed:\n\n        -  You will have a physical exam.\n\n        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine and biomarker testing.  This blood\n           draw will also include a pregnancy test if you can become pregnant.\n\n      Length of Treatment:\n\n      You may take the study drugs for up to 1 year.  You will no longer be able to take the study\n      drugs if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to\n      follow study directions.\n\n      Your participation on the study will be over after the long-term follow-up phone calls.\n\n      Long-Term Follow-Up Calls:\n\n      After you have stopped taking the study drugs and completed your end-of-treatment visit, the\n      study staff will call you 1 time every 3 months from then on to check on how you are doing.\n      Each phone call should last about 5 minutes.\n\n      This is an investigational study.  Pazopanib is FDA approved and commercially available for\n      the treatment of renal cell cancer.  Topotecan is FDA approved and commercially available\n      for the treatment of lung cancer.  In this study, the combination of pazopanib and topotecan\n      is being used for research purposes only.\n\n      Up to 66 participants will be enrolled in this multicenter study.

                "textblock": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n          1. Patients with histologically proven intracranial glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) or\n             gliosarcoma (GS). Patients will be eligible if the original histology was low-grade\n             glioma and a subsequent histological diagnosis of a GBM or GS is made. Patients must\n             have evidence of progression of the GBM or GS on MRI or CT scan.\n\n          2. Patient must have failed prior chemoradiation with temozolomide and any other\n             therapies except BEV (group A), or must have failed primary chemoradiation and a\n             BEV-incorporating treatment (group B).\n\n          3. Patients may have had treatment for no more than 2 prior relapses. Relapse is defined\n             as progression following initial therapy (i.e. radiation+/- chemo if that was used as\n             initial therapy). The intent therefore is that patients had no more than 3 prior\n             therapies (initial and treatment for 2 relapses). If the patient had a surgical\n             resection for relapsed disease and no anti-cancer therapy was instituted for up to 12\n             weeks, and the patient undergoes another surgical resection, this is considered as 1\n             relapse. For patients who had prior therapy for a low-grade glioma, the surgical\n             diagnosis of a high-grade glioma will be considered the first relapse\n\n          4. Patients must be greater than 12 weeks following completion of chemoradiation or any\n             additional radiation to reduce the chance of pseudoprogression.\n\n          5. Measurable disease is required unless patient is post-operative and in that case\n             patient can have no evidence of disease.\n\n          6. All patients must sign an informed consent indicating that they are aware of the\n             investigational nature of this study. Patients must have signed an authorization for\n             the release of their protected health information. Patients must be registered in the\n             MD ANDERSON CANCER CENTER Office of Multicenter Clinical Research (OMCR) database\n             prior to treatment with study drugs.\n\n          7. Archived tumor tissue must be available for all subjects for biomarker analysis\n             before or during treatment. Samples must be provided within 4 weeks of enrollment.\n\n          8. Tissue to be analyzed for MGMT (if not already performed) and additional analyses\n             noted in correlative biomarker section(on hold).\n\n          9. Patients must be >/= 18 years old.\n\n         10. Patients must have a Karnofsky performance status of >/= 60.\n\n         11. At the time of registration: Patients must have recovered from the toxic effects of\n             prior therapy: >/= 28 days from any investigational agent, >/=28 days from prior\n             cytotoxic therapy, >/=14 days from vincristine, >/=42 days from nitrosoureas, >/=21\n             days from procarbazine administration, >21 days from bevacizumab administration and\n             >/=7 days for non-cytotoxic agents, e.g., interferon, tamoxifen, thalidomide,\n             cis-retinoic acid, etc. (radiosensitizer does not count). Any questions related to\n             the definition of non-cytotoxic agents should be directed to the Study Chair.\n\n         12. Patients must have adequate organ function: 1) Bone marrow function (WBC >/=3,000/\u00b5l,\n             ANC >/=1,500/mm3, platelet count of >/=100,000/mm3, and hemoglobin >/=10 gm/dl).\n             Eligibility level for hemoglobin may be reached by transfusion. 2) Liver function\n             (alanine amino transferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) <2.5XULN(upper\n             limit of normal), and total bilirubin <1.5XULN), prothrombin time (PT) or\n             international normalized ratio (INR), and activated partial thromboplastin time\n             (aPTT) </=1.2XULN. Concomitant elevations in bilirubin and AST/ALT above 1.0xULN are\n             not permitted. Subjects receiving anticoagulant therapy are eligible if their INR is\n             stable and within the recommended range for the desired level of anticoagulation. 3)\n             Renal function (creatinine </=1.5mg/dL (133 \u00b5mol/L), or if >1.5mg/dL, calculated\n             creatinine clearance >/=50cc/min), and urine protein to creatinine ratio of <1 before\n             starting therapy. 4) These tests must be performed within 14 days prior to\n             registration.\n\n         13. Patients must have shown unequivocal radiographic evidence for tumor progression by\n             MRI or CT scan. A scan should be performed within 14 days prior to registration and\n             on a steroid dose that has been stable or decreasing for at least 5 days. If the\n             steroid dose is increased between the date of imaging and registration a new baseline\n             MR/CT is required. The same type of scan, i.e., MRI or CT must be used throughout the\n             period of protocol treatment for tumor measurement.\n\n         14. Patients having undergone recent resection of recurrent or progressive tumor will be\n             eligible as long as all of the following conditions apply: 1) They have recovered\n             from the effects of surgery and be > 28 days from surgery. 2) Residual disease\n             following resection of recurrent GBM or GS is not mandated for eligibility into the\n             study. To best assess the extent of residual disease post-operatively, a CT/ MRI\n             should be done no later than 96 hours in the immediate post-operative period or at\n             least 4 weeks post-operatively, within 14 days prior to registration. If the 96-hour\n             scan is more than 14 days before registration, the scan needs to be repeated. If the\n             steroid dose is increased between the date of imaging and registration, a new\n             baseline MRI/CT is required on a stable steroid dosage for at least 5 days.\n\n         15. Patients must have failed prior radiation therapy and must have an interval of\n             greater than or equal to 12 weeks from the completion of radiation therapy to study\n             entry.\n\n         16. Patients with prior therapy that included interstitial brachytherapy or stereotactic\n             radiosurgery must have confirmation of true progressive disease rather than radiation\n             necrosis based upon either PET or Thallium scanning, MR spectroscopy or\n             surgical/pathological documentation of disease.\n\n         17.
