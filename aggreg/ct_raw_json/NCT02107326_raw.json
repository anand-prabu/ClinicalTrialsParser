Finally, software collecting\n      blood glucose values and merging values obtained on different devices easily permits\n      reviewing these values by the patient and sending them to the physician's office, thereby\n      avoiding consultations during which no blood glucose values are brought by the patient.\n\n      We hypothesize that the Webdia software, that will be tested in this randomized crossover\n      study, will increase treatment compliance and therefore will improve diabetes\n      self-management. We believe, the software will facilitate the adaptation of insulin schemes\n      by physicians and therefore will lead to improved HbA1C values. We also think that this\n      software will improve the patient's quality of life."
