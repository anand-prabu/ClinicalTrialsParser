Fecal Calprotectin can be utilized as an alternative to\n      colonoscopy in the management of patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease.\n\n      Objectives:\n\n      By means of a survey from the ordering physician we would assess:\n\n      Primary Endpoint\n\n      1. The Percentage of time that the Fecal Calprotectin result caused the physician to change\n      the management of a patient.\n\n      Secondary Endpoints\n\n        1. To determine if the Fecal Calprotectin result influenced the number of endoscopies\n           performed\n\n        2. To correlate how well the Fecal Calprotectin correlates with Endoscopic findings when\n           endoscopy was performed.\n\n        3. To assess the correlation between the Fecal Calprotectin level and symptoms as measured\n           by the Harvey Bradshaw index or the partial Mayo Score (or full Mayo Score depending if\n           endoscopy was performed)."
