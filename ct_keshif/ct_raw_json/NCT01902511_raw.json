The study will be\n      divided into two groups- Group A will comprise of patients with compensated cirrhosis and\n      Group B comprising of patients with decompensated cirrhosis. Patients not having any\n      exclusion criteria will undergo bone marrow examination and liver biopsy at the baseline.\n\n      50 patients each of compensated and decompensated cryptogenic cirrhosis will be randomised\n      into two limbs- limb A (25 patients) will receive G-CSF and erythropoietin while those on\n      limb B (25 patients) will receive G-CSF alone. The drugs will be given for 2 months and\n      patient will be followed for 1 year. G-CSF will be given at a dose of 5 \u00b5g/kg s/c at days 1,\n      2, 3, 4, 5 and then every 3rd day till day 60 (total 22 doses). Erythropoietin will be given\n      s/c at dose of 500 IU/Kg twice a week for 2 months.\n\n      Follow up will be done on days 0,3,7,14,28, day 42 (6 weeks), day 60 (2 months), day 90 (3\n      months), day 180 (6 months), day 270 (9 months); and day 360 (1 year)."
