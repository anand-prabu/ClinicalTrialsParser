        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Children aged 2 years to &lt;18 years with CKD stage 5 on dialysis (haemodialysis or
             peritoneal dialysis) for at least one month

          -  The subject has a documented diagnosis of hyperphosphataemia, as demonstrated by
             serum phosphorus(P) levels above the age-related upper limit of normal KDOQI Clinical
             Practice Guidelines for Nutrition in Children with CKD updated 2008)

          -  The subject has been taking CBPB prior to enrolment into the study (i.e., prior to
             the screening visit)

          -  The subject must have demonstrated serum P levels &gt;1.5 standard deviation (SD) above
             the KDOQI 2008 age-related mean value at any time during the wash-out period (this
             must be demonstrated after stopping treatment with CBPB)

          -  At the time of randomisation, the subject must have demonstrated an increase in serum
             P levels from his/her most recent P central laboratory measurement by at least 10%
             above the pre-wash-out level

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject has been diagnosed with hypocholesterolaemia (i.e., cholesterol levels
             below age-related normal ranges, per local practices)

          -  The subject has current clinically significant medical comorbidities, which may
             substantially compromise subject safety, or expose him/her to undue risk, or
             interfere significantly with study procedures and which, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, make the subject unsuitable for inclusion in the study (e.g., the
             subject currently has or has had a history of seizure disorders, dysphagia,
             swallowing disorders, predisposition to or current bowel obstruction, ileus or severe
             gastrointestinal [GI] disorders such as chronic or severe constipation [as judged by
             the Investigator], intestinal stenosis, intestinal diverticulum, sigmoid colitis, GI
             ulcers, current or a history of GI bleeding, or major GI tract surgery)

          -  The subject was treated with a combination of two or more phosphate binders within
             one month prior to screening

          -  The subject cannot stop treatment (prescription or over-the counter) of any of the
             following orally taken medications during the wash-out period: any product containing
             calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), aluminium compounds, sevelamer, lanthanum, ketosteril

          -  The subject is receiving immunosuppressant treatment for any medical condition at the
             time of randomisation or is expected to receive such treatment during the course of
             the study

          -  The subject is considered unstable on his/her current treatment for CKD within one
             month prior to screening (e.g., subjects starting treatment with vitamin D or its
             analogues, or other agents/procedures that may influence bone mineral metabolism
             [i.e., serum P and Ca levels])
