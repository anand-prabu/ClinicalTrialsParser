    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the efficacy of QGE031 compared to omalizumab in patients with
      allergic asthma. Each treatment's effect in changing the concentration of inhaled allergen
      that is required to elicit a 15% fall in the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1)
      at 12 weeks compared to baseline will be evaluated.

    <description>During the 10-week treatment period, participants will receive a dose of study drug subcutaneously once every two weeks (total of six doses). Three dose levels of QGE031 will be offered during the study: low, medium, and high. Participants will be randomized to receive one of these dose levels for all dosing visits.</description>

    <description>During the 10-week treatment period, participants will receive a dose of study drug subcutaneously once every two weeks (total of six doses) or once every four weeks (total of three doses). The dose that a participant receives will depend upon the participant's body weight and IgE level; dosage will be determined based upon local omalizumab dosing charts.</description>
