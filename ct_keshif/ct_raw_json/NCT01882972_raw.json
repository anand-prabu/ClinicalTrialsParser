However, concerns have\n      been raised about the potential for higher than tolerated adverse event rates during\n      resistance training, particularly that which is unsupervised, despite a history of safe use\n      of resistance training in other chronically diseased patient populations. The aim of this\n      pilot study is to demonstrate the feasibility, safety and quality of life benefit of a\n      home-based resistance-training program among colorectal cancer survivors. The investigators\n      will recruit n=30 men and women with stage I-III colon cancer. Participants will be\n      randomized to a home-based exercise intervention that combines aerobic and resistance\n      exercise. Control arm participants will receive a home-based meditation program."

Using an\n      electronic survey tool, patients will complete a baseline questionnaire on key outcomes\n      (quality of life, fatigue, side effects) and potential confounders and will consent to a\n      medical record review. These will also be assessed via at 4 weeks post randomization and 12\n      weeks post randomization. Participants in the intervention group will receive one-time in\n      person instruction in the exercises derived from the existing evidence base of home-based\n      resistance training programs for older adults and cancer survivors. They will be sent home\n      with a book demonstrating the exercises, a log and a set of appropriate resistance bands.\n      Weekly follow-up calls will occur for the duration of the intervention and updates on the\n      call results will be provided to the colon cancer clinic nurse so that care is integrated.\n      Participants in the attention control group will be mailed a meditation CD.
