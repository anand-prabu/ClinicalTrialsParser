  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Universal hearing screening at birth by use of otoacoustic emission (OAE) is now offered in
      most maternities in France to detect symptomatic hearing impairment at birth but screening
      of cCMV infection is not coupled with this screening. In this study, the feasibility of
      achieving before one month of age the diagnosis of congenital CMV diagnosis and as well as
      the confirmation of hearing loss in newborns who failed newborn hearing screening will be
      tested.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Congenital cytomegalovirus (cCMV) is the most frequent congenital infection in France.
      Around 90% of cCMV infected infants are asymptomatic at birth, of whom 7 to 20% develop
      sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). cCMV explains at least 10% of all hearing loss cases in
      young children. Early antiviral treatment (implemented before 1 month of age) with
      ganciclovir or valganciclovir improved hearing outcome. In the absence of universal
      screening, cCMV remains largely undetected because most infected neonates are asymptomatic
      or have non-specific symptoms. When symptoms become apparent or develop, it may be too late
      for confirmation that the infection is of congenital origin; diagnosis of congenital
      infection is based on the detection of CMV in samples collected within 2 to 3 weeks after
      birth. The presence of CMV in samples collected after this time may represent postnatal
      infection which does not carry the risk of hearing loss or neurodevelopmental sequelae.
      Universal hearing screening at birth by use of otoacoustic emission (OAE) is now offered in
      most maternities in France to detect symptomatic hearing impairment at birth but screening
      of cCMV infection is not coupled with this screening. In this study, the feasibility of
      achieving before one month of age the diagnosis of congenital CMV diagnosis and as well as
      the confirmation of hearing loss in newborns who failed newborn hearing screening will be
      tested.
