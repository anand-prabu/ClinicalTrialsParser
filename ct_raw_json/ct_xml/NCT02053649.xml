  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Perinatal depression (i.e., during pregnancy and/or the postpartum period) is a common and
      serious mood disorder that increases morbidity and mortality (including suicide) in new
      mothers, results in poor child outcomes, and has high economic costs. Expectant and new
      mothers who suffer from circadian rhythm disruption and sleep disturbance are at risk for
      perinatal depression. This study seeks to determine if Triple Chronotherapy (TC) - a
      multicomponent treatment consisting of bright light therapy, sleep phase advance, and sleep
      deprivation/restriction - can improve treatment outcomes for patients with perinatal
      depression.

      The investigators will assess the feasibility and efficacy of a TC intervention for
      perinatal depression by testing the treatment in first-time expectant mothers diagnosed with
      major depressive disorder during 3rd trimester of pregnancy (n = 16). The investigators will
      randomize patients to either:

        1. usual care (UC, n = 8), or

        2. TC+UC (n = 8).

      TC+UC will have pregnancy and postpartum components and will be administered via an
      individualized case formulation approach tailored to each patient. After a baseline
      assessment, TC will be taught and prescribed during 5 dedicated clinical visits- three
      during 3rd trimester of pregnancy and 2 in the postpartum period. UC will consist of
      medication administered by a perinatal psychiatrist and/or psychotherapy. UC will be
      measured in both groups to evaluate differences between TC+UC and UC groups in number of
      appointments, medication use, and use of hospital/emergency services. Mood will be measured
      in both groups by clinician interview and patient self-report. The investigators will assess
      the safety profile of the TC intervention with evaluation of side effects/adverse events,
      suicide assessments, and performance testing.

      Importantly, the study will also examine the putative mechanisms by which TC is hypothesized
      to work and the &quot;dose&quot; of TC received by patients in the TC+UC group. All participants will
      wear wrist actigraphy/light monitors continuously during weeks 28-40 of pregnancy and
      postpartum weeks 2-6 to assess light exposure and sleep duration and timing. Circadian phase
      (measured with salivary dim light melatonin onset) will be measured at baseline during
      pregnancy, at 36 weeks gestation, and at postpartum week 6.

      The investigators anticipate that patients in the TC+UC group will show greater/more rapid
      improvements in depression compared to UC alone. Furthermore, the investigators expect
      decreased depression to be associated with greater circadian/sleep advances and more light
      exposure. These data will support a proposal for a larger randomized controlled clinical
      trial for Perinatal TC.  Perinatal TC could have major public health impact due to the high
      prevalence of perinatal depression. TC may also work as a preventative strategy for at-risk
      pregnant women. Finally, TC may be an especially desirable treatment for depressed women who
      are reluctant to take medications during pregnancy or while lactating.
