Patients are stratified according to\n      whether they received prior primary surgery (yes vs no) and participating center.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients undergo mastectomy, lumpectomy, or quadrantectomy with axillary\n           clearance. Patients then receive oral tamoxifen for 5 years. Patients may also undergo\n           sentinel node biopsy.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients undergo surgery as in arm I without axillary clearance. Patients then\n           receive oral tamoxifen for 5 years.\n\n      Patients in both arms who undergo breast-conserving surgery may receive optional\n      radiotherapy for 5-6 weeks to the remaining breast tissue, chest, and lung. Upon recurrence\n      in the conserved breast, patients undergo total mastectomy; those in arm II who experience\n      ipsilateral axillary recurrence undergo surgical excision. Adjuvant tamoxifen and follow up\n      are continued.\n\n      Quality of life is assessed.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months while receiving tamoxifen,\n      and then annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 1,020 patients will be accrued for this study within\n      approximately 5 years."
