      The purpose of this study is to test a psychotherapeutic intervention that integrates
      cognitive therapy and mindfulness meditation techniques to prevent suicide in military
      veterans.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Every month the VA becomes aware of approximately 1,100 veterans in VA care who attempt
      suicide. While the VA has implemented a comprehensive, multifaceted suicide prevention
      approach, it has yet to implement nationally any evidence-based psychotherapies targeting
      suicide, a gap due largely to the dearth of evidence-based therapies for suicide. Primary
      aims of this proposal are to conduct a randomized controlled trial testing an adaptation of
      a cognitive-behavioral intervention, Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT), for
      veterans on the VA's High Risk for Suicide List. Our adapted version of MBCT for suicide
      (MBCT-S) integrates mindfulness meditation techniques with standard cognitive therapy into a
      low-intensity group therapy format and builds on the VA Safety Plan to enhance patients'
      awareness of suicide triggers and appropriate coping strategies. This study has the
      potential to increase the range of cost effective treatment alternatives for the large
      number of suicidal veterans for whom evidence-based therapies are severely limited.

    <description>We define &quot;event&quot; broadly as a range of suicidal behaviors defined according to the VA's Self-Directed Violence Classification System (SDVCS).  Based on the SDVCS, an event may include self-directed violence, with or without injury, in which evidence of intent is indeterminate or clear; preparatory behaviors; or suicidal ideation with suicidal intent, with or without a plan.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Veterans at risk of suicide receiving treatment at the VA New Jersey Health Care System
