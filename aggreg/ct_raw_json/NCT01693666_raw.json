Participants will meet with the study dietitian and exercise physiologist every 2-4 weeks to develop and maintain individualized nutrition and physical activity plans, reinforced by CM. When the subject meets with the interventionists at their regular appointments, they will review the diet and exercise requirements, and provide vouchers earned as reinforcement from the previous study period. Diet requirements include at least 5 days of food logs each week. Exercise requirements include objective verification of up to 5 exercise sessions per week (as prescribed)."

Preventing excessive gestational weight gain could reduce\n      adverse pregnancy outcomes and improve long-term health of mothers and offspring. Thirty\n      obese (BMI \u226530) pregnant women will be recruited for this pilot study and randomly assigned\n      to the Lifestyle Intervention ForEver (LIFE) program or routine care (RC). Participants will\n      be enrolled before 18 weeks gestation and will be followed until 12 weeks after delivery.\n      Women in the LIFE program will be given guidance on healthy eating and exercise at their\n      regularly scheduled obstetric visits. To increase adherence to the program, a contingency\n      management (CM) intervention offering incentives will be used to establish and maintain\n      healthy nutrition and physical activity habits, working towards the goal of restricted\n      weight gain (\u00b1 10lb) during their pregnancy. Three study testing visits will be scheduled\n      for all participants: at study entry, 34-36 weeks gestation, and 12 weeks after delivering.\n      Primary outcomes include adherence to the LIFE program, weight change in pregnancy and\n      postpartum, and objective measures of maternal and offspring health."
