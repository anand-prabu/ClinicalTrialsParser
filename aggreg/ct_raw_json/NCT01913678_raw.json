In\n      addition, the correlation between FIAF blood concentrations and resting energy expenditure,\n      blood lipid profile and gut microbiota composition will be investigated.\n\n      Furthermore, this study will investigate whether the source of FIAF can be determined. To\n      this end, adipose tissue biopsies will be analyzed and an in vitro experiment with fecal\n      water samples will be carried out.\n\n      The study is a crossover randomized controlled trials with 3 arms. Each arm has a duration\n      of 3 weeks. 20 overweight/obese subjects will be enrolled into the study and randomized to\n      the order of interventions. Before and after each intervention period, blood samples will be\n      collected and the participants will have their resting metabolic rate measured. At the end\n      of each intervention period, the participants will collect feces for 5 consecutive days. In\n      addition, adipose tissue biopsies will be taken after each intervention period."
