  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, multiple-dose, single-arm study in which subjects with secondary
      hyperparathyroidism currently receiving hemodialysis will be switched from oral cinacalcet
      HCl to intravenous AMG 416.

      The study will estimate the subject incidence of serum corrected calcium (cCa) values &lt; 7.5
      mg/dL during the 4-week treatment period after initiating of AMG 416 three times per week
      (TIW) with hemodialysis, 7 days following the discontinuation of daily oral cinacalcet.

        Inclusion Criteria

          -  Subject is 18 years of age or older at the time of informed consent.

          -  Subject must be receiving maintenance hemodialysis 3 times weekly for at least 8
             weeks.

          -  Subject must have SHPT as defined by having a mean of 3 consecutive central
             laboratory screening predialysis serum PTH values ≥ 200 pg/mL, with measurements
             obtained from 3 different calendar weeks in the 4-week screening period while
             receiving cinacalcet.

          -  Subject must have a mean of 3 consecutive central laboratory screening predialysis
             serum cCa values ≥ 7.5 mg/dL, with measurements obtained from 3 different calendar
             weeks in the 4-week screening period while receiving cinacalcet.

          -  Subject must be on a stable dose of cinacalcet before screening (defined as no dose
             change within the 4 weeks prior to screening).

          -  Other Inclusion Criteria may apply.

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  Currently receiving treatment in another investigational device or drug study, or
             less than 30 days since ending treatment on another investigational device or drug
             study(s).

          -  Subject has received AMG 416 in a prior clinical trial of AMG 416 (also known as
             KAI-4169).

          -  Subject has known sensitivity to any of the products or components of AMG 416 to be
             administered during dosing.

          -  Subject is unwilling to use effective contraception during the study, and for women,
             up to a period of up to 3 months after the last dose of AMG 416.

          -  Subject is pregnant or nursing.

          -  Anticipated or scheduled parathyroidectomy during the study period.

          -  Subject has received a parathyroidectomy within 6 months prior to dosing.

          -  Other Exclusion Criteria may apply.
