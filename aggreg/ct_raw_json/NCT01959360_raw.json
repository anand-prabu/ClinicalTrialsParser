Patients in the MIS group will also be more active and maintain\n      muscular strength and hip joint functionality/mobilisation better than patients in the\n      lateral group."

            "textblock": "With total hip replacement surgery, the orthopaedic surgeon's aim is not only pain relief\n      for the patient, but also restoration of hip joint biomechanics resulting in a minimal\n      functional deficit and maximal longevity of the implant. It is not exceptional that these\n      patients still experience mild to moderate long-term impairments postoperatively. These\n      impairments include pain, muscle weakness of the hip abductors, contracture of the hip, gait\n      disorders, as well as weakness of hip extensors and flexors. These problems may in turn lead\n      to complications such as joint instability and loosening of the implant. When the lateral\n      surgical approach is used, major concerns after total hip replacement surgery are muscle\n      abductor weakness/atrophy, tendon defects of the gluteus minimus muscle, and unsuccessful\n      reattachment or denervation of the anterior gluteal flap.\n\n      Minimal incision/invasive surgery (MIS) is defined as a surgical approach performed through\n      a short skin and muscle incision to avoid injury to muscles and tendons. Following minimally\n      invasive approach reduced muscle trauma has been found. Moreover clinical outcome improved,\n      as the gluteus medius muscle can be spared more successfully. However, it is debated whether\n      or not the overall results of MIS are superior, or even as good as the traditional hip\n      replacement surgery in terms of component placing and time to revision of the prosthesis."
