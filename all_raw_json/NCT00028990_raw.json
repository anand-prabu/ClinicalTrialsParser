Monoclonal antibodies, such as\n      bevacizumab, can block cancer growth in different ways. Some block the ability of cancer\n      cells to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and help kill them or deliver\n      cancer-killing substances to them. It is not yet known whether paclitaxel works better with\n      or without bevacizumab in treating breast cancer.\n\n      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is to see if paclitaxel works better with or\n      without bevacizumab in treating patients who have locally recurrent or metastatic breast\n      cancer."

Patients are stratified\n      according to disease-free interval (no more than 24 months vs more than 24 months), number\n      of metastatic sites (less than 3 vs 3 or more), treatment with prior adjuvant chemotherapy\n      (yes vs no), and estrogen receptor status (positive vs negative vs unknown). Patients are\n      randomized to one of two treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15 followed by\n           bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1 and 15.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive paclitaxel as in arm I. In both arms, courses repeat every 4\n           weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Quality of life is assessed at baseline and on day 1 of weeks 17 and 33.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then\n      annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 316-650 patients (158-325 per treatment arm) will be accrued\n      for this study within 31 months."
