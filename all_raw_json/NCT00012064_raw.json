Patients with multiple persistent sites of metastatic\n      disease after harvest may receive systemic therapy (biologic therapy and/or chemotherapy)\n      during tumor cell line expansion over approximately 4 months. The tumor cell line is\n      expanded, irradiated, and treated with interferon gamma.\n\n      Patients undergo leukapheresis to collect peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) to\n      obtain dendritic cells (DC). The PBMC are treated with sargramostim (GM-CSF) and\n      interleukin-4 for 7 days to produce DC. The DC are then cultured with the treated tumor\n      cells for 18 hours.\n\n      Patients undergo delayed tumor hypersensitivity tests intradermally 1 week prior to\n      vaccination and again at week 4. Patients receive vaccine therapy comprising autologous\n      treated tumor cells and dendritic cells suspended in GM-CSF subcutaneously weekly for 3\n      weeks. Vaccine therapy continues monthly for an additional 5 months in the absence of\n      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed every 2 months for 1 year and then every 3 months for 4 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30-80 patients will be accrued for this study."
