This\n      expectation is based on the fact that bupivacaine produces pre-emptive analgesia and BT will\n      produce muscle relaxation, the combination of which will target different sites of pain\n      generation, thus producing better analgesia. We also hypothesize that additional benefits\n      may accrue from this regimen including decreased nausea and vomiting, sedation and\n      constipation as a result of diminished opioid use1."
