  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study aims to compare the relative therapeutic efficacy of prism adaptation
      therapy combined with real versus sham tDCS. The investigators will test the hypothesis that
      the magnitude and duration of neglect improvement will be increased when prism therapy is
      combined with real tDCS compared to sham tDCS.

      A second objective is to test whether individual differences in baseline clinical or brain
      imaging measures can predict: 1) neglect severity or 2) inter-individual differences in
      patients' therapeutic response.

      A third goal is to use brain imaging to characterize the patterns of neural change induced
      by the intervention to identify brain structures that mediate therapeutic response.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      'Neglect' is a common neurological syndrome that affects approximately 50% of
      right-hemisphere stroke patients.  It is a complex multi-faceted syndrome, but its core
      defining feature is that patients lose the capacity to voluntarily control attention in the
      left half of space. Neglect has a significant debilitating effect on patients' functional
      independence and everyday life and indicates a poor prognosis for long-term functional
      recovery.

      To date, there is no effective rehabilitation intervention available for routine clinical
      use. One of the most promising experimental strategies for neglect rehabilitation is prism
      adaptation, a form of motor training that induces short-lived improvements in a variety of
      cognitive domains. However, its major limitation is that the benefits are transient. The
      investigators aim to test the hypothesis that by combining prism therapy with transcranial
      direct current stimulation (tDCS), this will boost learning/memory processes, resulting in
      larger and longer-lasting therapeutic effects.

      The investigators will conduct a randomized controlled clinical trial to test the efficacy
      of multi-session prism therapy combined with real versus sham tDCS for the rehabilitation of
      chronic post-stroke neglect. Baseline neuroimaging data will be used as predictor variables
      to explain inter-individual variation in therapeutic response. Contrasts between pre- and
      post-intervention imaging data will be performed to identify neural structures that mediate
      therapeutic effects.

             study.

          -  Male or Female, aged 18-80.

          -  At least one month post first ever ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke to the right
             hemisphere.

          -  Diagnosis of neglect confirmed by a score &lt; 129 on the conventional BIT sub-tests,
             and/or a score of &lt; 67 on the behavioural BIT sub-tests (as measured during the
             Recruitment Interview in week 0).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Anyone who does not have adequate understanding of English, sufficient to give
             informed consent.

          -  Anyone who has a previous history of epilepsy, febrile convulsions as a child or
             recurrent fainting fits. Likewise, anyone who has a significant family history of
             epilepsy would be excluded as all these conditions carry a theoretical risk of
             increasing susceptibility to seizures.

          -  Any person who has a history of drug abuse or a previous history of a neurological or
             psychiatric illness, or has a history of neurosurgical procedure is excluded as they
             may be at increased risk of epilepsy and data collected may be influenced by their
             condition.

          -  Patients on some prescription medications such as anti-depressants may be excluded as
             they may be at an increased risk of seizures.

          -  Patients who have had more than one stroke.

          -  Limited verbal communication in the form of dysphasia

          -  A history of dementia.

          -  Anyone who is currently taking or who has taken anti-malarial treatment in the last
             72 hours.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded as a precaution as there is no data on the effect on
             maternal cranial stimulation on the fetus.

          -  Any metallic implant in the neck, head, or eye and anyone with any implanted
             electrical devices would be excluded as there is a risk of heating with tDCS.

          -  Anyone with any metal implants or implantable device would be excluded as indicated
             by the MRI safety screening form.

          -  People who suffer from claustrophobia are excluded as they are unable to tolerate the
             scanner.
