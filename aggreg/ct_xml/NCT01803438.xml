  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of Pulmonary Vein Isolation (PVI)
      performed with the Arctic Front™ Advance Cardiac CryoAblation Catheter System as first-line
      therapy in comparison with antiarrhythmic drugs (AAD) in patients with paroxysmal atrial
      fibrillation (AF).
