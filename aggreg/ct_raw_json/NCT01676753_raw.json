Any number of prior\n      therapies is allowed. Prior treatment with paclitaxel is allowed. Paclitaxel will be\n      administered weekly by 1-hour intravenous infusion at a fixed dose of 80 mg/m2 during a\n      28-day repeating cycle. Dinaciclib will be administered weekly by 2-hour intravenous\n      infusion 24 hours later. Dinaciclib is the investigational agent and will be dose escalated\n      using a 3+3 design. Only 2 cohorts are planned, although additional cohorts exploring\n      intermediate doses or specific patient subsets may be added. The starting dinaciclib dose is\n      7 mg/m2. The primary objective is to define the maximum tolerated dose of dinaciclib when\n      given weekly in this combination and schedule. The primary endpoint is safety and\n      tolerability. Secondary objectives include evaluation of the preliminary efficacy of this\n      combination and determination of pharmacokinetic interactions between dinaciclib and\n      paclitaxel. Exploratory studies characterizing and correlating the biomarkers relevant to\n      dinaciclib activity and MYC overexpression with clinical response will be performed."
