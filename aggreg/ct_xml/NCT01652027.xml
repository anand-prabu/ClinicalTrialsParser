  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hemophilia A is a congenital bleeding disorder caused by deficiency of factor VIII (FVIII)
      and is treated by replacement therapy with FVIII concentrate.  Approximately 30% of people
      with severe hemophilia A develop neutralizing antibodies, called FVIII inhibitors, which
      interfere with the function of FVIII concentrates.  The reason that some, but not all,
      people with severe hemophilia A develop inhibitors is incompletely understood.
      Understanding individual and environmental risk factors is important to be able to prevent
      and possibly treat inhibitors.  This study will look at individual and treatment
      characteristics in babies with severe hemophilia A who have not yet received treatment with
      FVIII (called Previously Untreated Patients, or PUPS).  Subjects in the study will be asked
      to provide diaries of treatments, medications, and illnesses. Treatment will be directed by
      the subjects' physician, but all subjects will receive Advate, a third-generation
      recombinant FVIII product.  Subjects will have blood drawn for laboratory tests, which
      include studies of the immune system and genetic studies of the FVIII mutation, before and
      7-9 days after the first treatment with FVIII, and 5 days (+/-2 days) after the 5th, 10th,
      20th, 30th, 40th, and 50th days of treatment with FVIII (exposure days). The duration of the
      study will be first 50 treatments or 3 years, whichever comes first.
