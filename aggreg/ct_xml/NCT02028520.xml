  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypothesis: Higher levels of perfusion on indocyanine green (ICG) fluoroscopy indicate
      higher likelihood of burns healing whole lower levels of perfusion correlate with lower
      likelihood of healing

      Consented patients with burn injuries will be evaluated daily and along with continued wound
      care will receive 5 mg of ICG (FDA approved dose) and their burns assessed fluoroscopically.
      Perfusion will be quantified numerically as a percentage of normally perfused skin. No
      changes to the actual care of the burn patient will be made as a result of the fluoroscopic
      examination.
