  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One in three Americans dies in a nursing home (NH) or in a hospital, shortly following
      transfer from a long-term care facility. The proportion of deaths occurring in NHs is
      projected to increase to 40% by 2020. Excellence in palliative and end-of-life (EOL) care
      must become a priority for these long-term care institutions. However, findings from NHs
      point to high incidence of pain and poor management of other symptoms and excessive reliance
      on hospitalizations, indicating inadequate EOL care quality. Expert opinion and research
      have suggested that poor EOL quality in NHs may be due to lack of palliative care training
      among staff and absence of EOL care protocols or guidelines, but research demonstrating that
      attention to these factors improves outcomes is absent. While dedicated care teams have been
      shown to improve outcomes for NH residents in need of specialized care, the impact of
      palliative care teams in improving resident outcomes has remained largely unstudied and
      untested. This will be the first randomized controlled trial to evaluate the impact of
      palliative care teams (PCTeam) on resident and staff outcomes, and care processes, in NHs.

      Our objective is to demonstrate, using a randomized controlled trial design and a difference
      in difference analytic approach, that nursing home-based palliative care practice guidelines
      implemented through PCTeams will improve quality of care processes and outcomes for
      residents at the end of life.

      We will adapt existing palliative care guidelines for EOL care, endorsed by the National
      Quality Forum (NQF), to the NH environment, deploy the adapted practice guidelines through a
      PCTeam model, and evaluate the effectiveness of this intervention on resident EOL outcomes
      and staff care processes and outcomes. The specific aims (SA) will address the following
      questions:

      SA 1: Is PCTeam intervention effective in improving NH residents' EOL outcomes?

      SA 2: Is PCTeam intervention effective in improving NH staff EOL care processes and
      outcomes?

      In the context of these specific aims we will test the following hypotheses:

      H1: Residents in NHs in the intervention arm, compared to the control, will achieve better
      EOL risk-adjusted outcomes and care processes with regard to:

        -  Pain

        -  Dyspnea

        -  Depression

        -  In-hospital deaths

        -  Hospitalizations

        -  Advance directives

      H2:  Direct care staff in NHs in the intervention arm, compared to the control, will achieve
      better EOL processes and outcomes measured by:

        -  Assessment of EOL symptoms

        -  Delivery of EOL care

        -  Communication/coordination among providers

        -  Communication with residents/families

        -  Teamwork effectiveness

        -  Staff satisfaction

      H3: Family caregivers of decedent residents in the intervention NHs, compared to the
      control, will report receiving more patient and family centered care as measured by higher
      levels of satisfaction with:

        -  Shared decision making between providers, the patient and the family

        -  Care that is respectful of the patient wishes and dignity

        -  Attention to the emotional and spiritual needs of the family.

           31 NHs in upstate New York have been recruited for the study (letters of support).
           Stakeholders include residents, family members, staff, policy makers, and others. The
           intervention will deploy theTeamSTEPPS, a team development model created by the
           Department of Defense and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.
