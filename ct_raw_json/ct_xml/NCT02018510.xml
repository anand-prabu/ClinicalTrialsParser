  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a first-in-man phase I study that aims to evaluate the safety,
      tolerability and pharmacokinetics of 3BNC117 in HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected subjects,
      and its antiretroviral activity in HIV-infected subjects.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In preclinical studies carried out in humanized mice and non-human primates, 3BNC117 alone
      or in combination with other neutralizing antibodies led to protection from HIV-1 or SHIV
      infection and also to sustained suppression of HIV-1 plasma viremia. The aims of this
      protocol are to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics profile of 3BNC117 in
      both HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected subjects,and its antiretroviral activity in
      HIV-infected subjects.
