High intensity\n      interval training (HIT) is time-efficient exercise consisting of repeated bouts of short\n      duration high intensive workloads. The aim of this study is to determine the effect of HIT\n      in patients with type 2 diabetes, and to clarify the mechanisms of a possible positive\n      effect of HIT.\n\n      Exercise is performed as 2 weeks one-legged training on an ergometer bicycle. Thus one leg\n      serves as a control leg. Insulin sensitivity in trained and non-trained muscle will be\n      measured after completion of the overall training program by euglycemic hyperinsulinemic\n      clamp method and a-v catheterization of both legs. Muscle biopsies will be obtained during\n      training period for measuring of muscle glycogen content, and muscle biopsies for further\n      analysis obtained during the experimental day."
