            "textblock": "Adhesive capsulitis (also termed frozen shoulder, stiff painful shoulder, or periarthritis)\n      is a common cause of shoulder pain estimated to affect 2-5% of the general population.\n\n      The disorder is characterized by spontaneous onset of shoulder pain and progressive global\n      stiffness of the glenohumeral joint accompanied by significant disability. Most studies have\n      suggested a self-limiting condition lasting an average of two to three years, although\n      significant numbers of people have residual clinically detectable restriction of movement\n      beyond three years, and smaller numbers have residual disability.\n\n      Many interventions have been advocated for the treatment of adhesive capsulitis, although\n      only limited data from randomised controlled trials are available. In addition, there are\n      not enough data to either support or refute the efficacy of any of the commonly used\n      interventions for this condition, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,\n      corticosteroid injections, and physiotherapy. Oral steroids were first advocated in the\n      1950s, with claims that they expedited recovery and reduced the need for manipulation under\n      anaesthesia. However, these medications are associated with many adverse reactions.\n\n      The aims of this study are to determine whether three weeks' treatment with quantum spectrum\n      radiation emitter in patients with adhesive capsulitis is effective for improving pain,\n      function, and range of motion."
