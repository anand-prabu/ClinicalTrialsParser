  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine the activity, to assess the safety and tolerance of
      BKM120 in adult patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer progressive under
      patin and cetuximab-based chemotherapy.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      BKM120 is a PI3K inhibitor. The PI3K/AKT signalling pathway deregulation is frequently
      observed in Head and neck cancer. In addition to its role in tumor genesis, the PI3K/AKT
      pathway seems to be involved in resistance to cetuximab.

      In this context, the study proposal is to evaluate the clinical interest of a monotherapy
      with a PI3K inhibitor (BKM120, Novartis) in patients with metastatic head and neck cancers
      refractory or relapsing under platin and cetuximab based- chemotherapy. Since resistance to
      cetuximab can result from PIK3CA mutation, PIK3CA amplification or mutation upstream in the
      PI3K pathway, BKM120 activity will be evaluated in two parallel independent cohorts of
      patients: patients presenting a PI3KCA mutation and patients without a PI3KCA mutation.
