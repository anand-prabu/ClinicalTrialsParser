Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of oral topotecan\n      combined with a fixed dose of paclitaxel in patients with advanced non-small lung cancer\n      (NSCLC) and other advanced solid tumors. II. Determine the response rate of NSCLC patients\n      treated at the MTD of oral topotecan combined with intravenous paclitaxel. III. Determine\n      the dose limiting toxicities of this drug combination in this patient population. Phase II:\n      IV. Determine the toxicities of this regimen at its MTD in patients with NSCLC. V. Determine\n      time to response, response duration, survival, time to progression, and rate of stable\n      disease of patients with NSCLC treated with this regimen at the MTD. VI. Assess changes in\n      well-being of patients with NSCLC treated with this regimen at the MTD.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of topotecan. Patients receive oral topotecan on\n      days 1-5 and paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 1. Treatment continues every 21 days in the\n      absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive\n      escalating doses of topotecan until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD\n      is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose\n      limiting toxicities. Once the MTD is determined, additional patients with non-small cell\n      lung cancer are accrued to receive treatment with topotecan and paclitaxel at the\n      recommended phase II dose. Quality of life is assessed in the phase II portion of the study\n      at baseline, before each treatment course, and at the end of the study. Patients are\n      followed at 3 weeks.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-24 patients will be accrued for the phase I dose escalation\n      portion of this study. A total of 14-40 additional non-small cell lung cancer patients will\n      be accrued to the phase II portion of this study."
