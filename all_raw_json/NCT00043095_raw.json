The order of chemotherapy drug administration on day 8 is reversed\n      during the second course only. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 6 courses in the absence\n      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of BMS-247550 until the maximum tolerated\n      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2\n      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, 9 patients\n      total are treated at the MTD.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 40 patients will be accrued for this study."
