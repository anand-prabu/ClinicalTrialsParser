  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of IDN-6556 compared to
      placebo in patients with diagnosed fat deposits in their liver (not caused by alcohol) and
      with abnormal liver tests

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, randomized study to evaluate the effects of IDN-6556 on serum
      transaminases and pharmacodynamics of IDN-6556 in subjects with non-alcoholic fatty liver
      disease with elevated alanine aminotransferase.

             understand and comply with the requirements of the study

          -  Diagnosis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) as evidenced by imaging or
             other diagnostic assessments

          -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels ≥1.5 x ULN on at least two occasions, seven or
             more days apart, during the Screening period

          -  alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) ≤ 100 ng/mL

          -  Hemoglobin ≥10 g/dL, a platelet count ≥ 100 x 109/L, and a white blood cell count ≥
             3.0 x 109/L

          -  If on metformin, sulfonylureas, statins, or fibrates, subjects must be on a stable
             dose of these drugs for at least three months prior to Screening and during the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known infection with HIV, HCV, or HBV

          -  Decompensated or severe liver disease as evidenced by one or more of the following:

               1. Confirmed cirrhosis or suspicion of cirrhosis

               2. Esophageal varices

               3. Ascites

               4. Suspicion of portal hypertension

               5. Hospitalization for liver disease within 60 days of screening

               6. Bilirubin &gt;2 x ULN, or  ALT or AST &gt; 10 x ULN

          -  Inflammatory bowel disease

          -  Significant systemic or major illness other than liver disease, including coronary
             artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, pulmonary disease, renal insufficiency,
             and/or serious psychiatric disease, that, in the opinion of the Investigator would
             preclude the subject from participating in and completing the study

          -  History or presence of alcohol abuse, defined as consumption of more than 210 mL of
             alcohol per week (the equivalent of 14 4-ounce glasses of wine or 14 12-ounce
