            "textblock": "Aerobic exercise holds great promise for treating cognitive impairment, the hallmark symptom\n      of Alzheimer's disease (AD), because it may attenuate brain atrophy. AD currently affects\n      more than 5 million Americans, costing $203 billion in 2013 and causing poor outcomes such\n      as loss of independence, low quality of life, and nursing home placement. Available drugs\n      have only modest short-term effects on reducing or slowing cognitive impairment in AD.\n      Hence, there is a pressing need to develop and test aerobic exercise interventions for AD.\n      This randomized controlled trial (RCT) will investigate the effects of a 6-month,\n      individualized, moderate-intensity cycling intervention on cognition and hippocampal volume\n      in AD with three aims:\n\n        -  Determine the immediate effect of the cycling intervention on cognition in AD.\n\n        -  Examine if the cycling intervention slows cognitive decline in AD from baseline to 12\n           months.\n\n        -  Assess the effect of aerobic exercise on hippocampal volume in AD over 12 months using\n           MRI.\n\n      The investigators will randomize 90 participants to the 6-month cycling or stretching/range\n      of motion exercise (20-50-minute, 3 times a week).  Participants will then be followed for\n      another 6 months. Cognition will be assessed at baseline, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months and\n      hippocampal volume will be measured using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at baseline, 6,\n      and 12 months. Transportation will be provided to participants for all study-related\n      activities including exercises. Participants who could not undergo MRI can still\n      participate."
