    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the efficacy of home telemonitoring as an intervention to decrease
      hospital readmissions in patients at high risk for readmission.  The overall readmission
      rate for high-risk MCF hospital patients is approximately 20%.  Currently a system is in
      place to identify and score all MCF patients for their risk of readmission.  This score is
      based on multiple variables including but not limited to: co-morbid conditions, patient's
      health literacy, whether they are a Medicare/Medicaid patient, their in-home social support,
      and whether they have had prior hospital admissions within the previous year.  The
      literature shows that home telemonitoring of patients has had mixed results for
      effectiveness at preventing hospitalizations and emergency department visits. Many of these
      reports have restricted studies to patients with specific diseases or general
      characteristics; some have shown improved results while others have not.  No study has
      examined patients who are high risk for readmission to determine if home telemonitoring for
      30 days post-discharge reduces the risk for 30-day readmission.
