Patients also receive IV or oral dexamethasone on days\n      1-4 every 4 weeks. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable\n      toxicity. Disease assessments are conducted every 4 weeks. Patients achieving complete\n      response (CR) receive 2 additional courses of therapy after initial determination of CR.\n\n      Final assessments are conducted 4 weeks after the last study treatment and then annually\n      thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 55 patients will be accrued for this study."
