  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this randomized study the investigators aim to determine the effects of a whole-food
      plant-based vegan diet on markers of inflammation and glucometabolic profile in patients
      with cardiovascular disease. The investigators hypothesize that a whole-food plant-based
      vegan diet will reduce markers of inflammation and improve glucometabolic profile compared
      with the American Heart Association (AHA)- recommended diet at 2 months follow-up in
      patients after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The investigators are also
      evaluating endothelial function using the EndoPAT device and stool microbiome.
