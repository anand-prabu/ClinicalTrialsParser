Several strategies may be implemented to prevent SSI. Among these, the use\n      of local antimicrobial agents seems successful.\n\n      The primary aim of the present trial was to evaluate the efficacy of a surgical suture,\n      coated with Triclosan a synthetic soluble antimicrobial agent, in reducing the SSI rate\n      after colorectal operations."
