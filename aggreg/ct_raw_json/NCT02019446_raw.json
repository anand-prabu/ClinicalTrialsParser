Laser energy will be delivered by maintaining the tip of the optical fibre 3 mm from the treatment area to achieve around 1-1.5 mm diameter spot size (25.5 J/cm2 fluence per pulse; 10-pulse pulse-train to each spot in 0.5 seconds). Multiple treatment spots will be delivered to cover the entire area of involvement."
