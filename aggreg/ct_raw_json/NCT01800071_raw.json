The virus is\n      called Epstein Barr virus or EBV. EBV is sometimes found inside cancer cells and is commonly\n      found in nasopharyngeal cancer cells."

Patients will receive up to four vaccinations with the MVA-EBNA1/LMP2 vaccine.\n      The first three vaccines will be given at 3 weekly intervals, followed by a fourth vaccine\n      12 weeks later. The vaccine will be given by intradermal injection with the dose divided\n      across multiple injection sites on the arm, or on the thigh.\n\n      Patients will participate in the study for approximately 12 months from first vaccination\n      and attend hospital approximately 11 times during this period. Standard safety assessments\n      will be performed throughout the trial and at each clinic visit patients will be asked to\n      provide research blood samples. These samples will be used to monitor the effects of the\n      vaccine on the patient's immune system."

Ongoing toxic manifestations of previous treatments.

Men with\n             pregnant or lactating partners should be advised to use barrier method contraception\n             (for example, condom plus spermicidal gel) to prevent exposure to the foetus or\n             neonate.\n\n         12.
