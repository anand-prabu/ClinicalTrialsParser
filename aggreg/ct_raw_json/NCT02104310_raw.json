In this study, information from a special scan, called a Positron Emission\n      Tomography/ Computed Tomography (PET/CT) scan using an amino acid called\n      Fluorine-18-L-dihydroxyphenylalanine (18F-DOPA) will also be used to image the tumor and\n      guide your radiation oncologist in determining locations to treat with radiation.  This type\n      of scan has shown promise in being able to better distinguish tumor from normal brain tissue\n      and may help to more accurately plan radiation treatment.  This type of scan can also assist\n      the radiation oncologist in identifying the most aggressive regions of the tumor.  The goal\n      of this study is to use the 18F-DOPA PET/CT scan to help determine where the disease is that\n      needs to be treated with radiation, in order to improve the effectiveness of radiation in\n      this tumor."
