Determine whether adjuvant chemotherapy with a platinum-containing regimen\n      (e.g., carboplatin or CAP: cyclophosphamide/doxorubicin/cisplatin) prolongs survival in\n      patients with early stage ovarian cancer compared to those receiving no adjuvant treatment.\n\n      OUTLINE: Randomized study. Patients are randomized to Arm I or II; treatment should begin\n      within 6 weeks of surgery. Regimens listed in Arm I are recommended, but other\n      platinum-containing regimens are allowed provided the doses at a minimum meet those listed\n      below. Arm I: Single-agent Chemotherapy or 3-Drug Combination Chemotherapy. Carboplatin,\n      CBDCA, NSC-241240; or CAP: Cyclophosphamide, CTX, NSC-26271; Doxorubicin, DOX, NSC-123127;\n      Cisplatin, CDDP, NSC-119875. Arm II: Observation. No adjuvant therapy.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 2,000 patients will be randomized."
