  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will attempt to determine whether having gastric bypass surgery changes the way
      that the gut absorbs hormones from birth control pills. It is believed that, because gastric
      bypass surgery causes malabsorption of nutrients and some medications, the levels of birth
      control hormones after the surgery will be lower than in women before they have the surgery.
      The investigators will ask several women to take a pack of birth control pills before having
      bypass surgery, and then another pack several months after surgery. The investigators will
      measure hormone levels in the blood. The investigators will also measure outcomes that may
      tell us how well the birth control pills are working, such as ultrasounds of the uterus and
      ovaries, and examination of the cervix.

    <description>This is a before-and-after comparison. Women will enroll prior to planned gastric bypass surgery and complete one cycle of oral contraceptive use and evaluation. There will then be no more study procedures/interventions until 3-4 months after surgery. At that time, women will complete the second cycle of OC use and evaluation. Study participation is then complete.

    <intervention_name>ethinyl estradiol-levonorgestrel</intervention_name>
    <description>Women will be asked to take a daily ethinyl estradiol-levonorgestrel combined oral contraceptive (COC) for 21 days, beginning 2-3 months pre-operatively, so as to stop at least 30 days before planned surgery date. Then, approximately 3-4 months after surgery, they will again be asked to take a daily pill for 21 days. During these pill cycles, we will collect serum samples and perform ultrasound and cervical mucus assessments on a twice-weekly basis, culminating in an inpatient stay of up to 48 hours in order to obtain more frequent sampling at the end of the pill pack.</description>
