If patients do not want to participate\n      in the home program, they will be offered referral to a facility-based cardiac\n      rehabilitation (usual care). Facility-based and home-based cardiac rehabilitation programs\n      are equally effective.\n\n      Our new home-based program is based on a cardiac rehabilitation program endorsed by the\n      American Heart Association (AHA) using the workbook and DVD, \"An Active Partnership for the\n      Health of Your Heart\". Patients will receive worksheets for recording exercise and food\n      intake, written instructions for equipment, and other materials to supplement the Active\n      Partnership book. After hospitalization, patients will be instructed on use of the study\n      equipment (portable exercise peddler, pedometer, heart rate monitor, and blood pressure\n      cuff) and given an individualized exercise prescription by an exercise physiologist."
