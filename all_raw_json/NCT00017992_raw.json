They receive baseline evaluations. Antiretroviral-naive patients receive\n      emtricitabine plus stavudine plus lopinavir/ritonavir. Antiretroviral-experienced patients\n      replace lamivudine with emtricitabine. Patients return to the clinic for follow-up visits at\n       Weeks 2 and 4 and then every 4 weeks until Week 48. Safety is evaluated using adverse\n      events, which are reviewed at every clinic visit. Clinical laboratory data and full-profile\n      pharmacokinetics of emtricitabine are evaluated at some visits. After the Week 48 study\n      evaluations are completed, individual patients may continue to receive study medication (as\n      provided by the sponsor) until commercially available, if certain criteria are met."
