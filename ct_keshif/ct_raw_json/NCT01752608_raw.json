The\n      study will involve 100 patients with mild to moderate MDD randomly assigned to daily use of\n      either a CBT application focused on depression ('eCBT Mood'; MindApps, llc) or a\n      comparator-controlled group using a mood monitoring application ('Mood Tracker'; GP\n      International).  This study design and duration of the study is consistent with other\n      studies employing comparator-controlled designs in the study of CBT interventions, including\n      computerized CBT interventions, among patients with MDD (e.g., Andrews et al., 2010;\n      McKendree-Smith et al., 2003).\n\n      After being screened to ensure that the patients meet the required diagnostic, depression\n      severity, and other inclusion criteria, patients will be randomly assigned (1:1) to use\n      either eCBT Mood, a computer application running on the Apple\u00ae iPhone\u2122 or iPod Touch\u00ae\n      handheld computer platforms.  The application includes: (1) a psychoeducation module on the\n      relationships among thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, (2) a 6-item daily depression\n      assessment with the option to e-mail the summary score and suicidal ideation assessment\n      response to a 3rd party, (3) a negative automatic thought identification module, (4) a\n      feelings and thoughts log, (5) a module enabling the user to challenge their negative\n      automatic thoughts, (6) an assessment and challenge module regarding core beliefs which\n      underlie many automatic thoughts, (7) optional compliance reminders to use the application\n      or take medicines, and (8) links to behavioral science-based online content regarding MDD\n      from PsychCentral (see www.psychcentral.com).  In contrast, the comparator control condition\n      will use Mood Tracker, which is also a a computer application running on the Apple iPhone or\n      iPod Touch handheld computer platforms.  This application enables users to rate their mood\n      using expressive faces on a daily basis, log about their daily feelings, and also has an\n      option enabling an e-mail to be sent to a 3rd party regarding their daily mood ratings.\n\n      Throughout the 8-week study period, patients will complete both in-person and\n      telephone-based assessments of their depression severity, mood, frequency of negative\n      automatic thoughts, and safety assessments."
