  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is conducted to determine if treatment with this new product may affect to
      electrical activity of the heart. If such risk exists an appropriate evaluation of
      risk/benefit will be needed. This testing is commonly conducted to assess safety of new
      products. The active ingredient in this product (diclofenac) has been available for several
      decades

      This is a randomized, single-dose, comparative, positive and placebo controlled, four-way
      crossover study evaluating the effect of HPβCD-diclofenac on QTc intervals in healthy
      subjects. Two doses of HPβCD-diclofenac are tested and include moxifloxicin as a positive
      control and normal saline as the placebo arm. On four separate occasions separated by at
      least 72 hours, subjects are given single IV or oral (moxifloxicin) treatments. ECGs are
      acquired from a continuous Holter monitor and selected timepoints will be evaluated. These
      ECGs will be 15 seconds in duration and extracted in triplicate. Monitoring will continue
      for 24 hours with each treatment. The primary ECG endpoint is the baseline-adjusted QTc
      using the Fridericia correction (QTcF). Secondary endpoints include the baseline-adjusted
      QTc using the Bazett correction formula (QTcB). In addition, a population-specific
      regression model will be constructed with QT plotted against RR (the time elapsed between
      two consecutive R-waves). Finally, QT parameters are explored graphically in relation to PK
      variables Cmax, Tmax and AUC.

    <description>The primary ECG endpoint is the time-matched active drug-placebo difference in baseline-adjusted QTc interval using the Fridericia correction formula (QTcF). The QTcF is evaluated at the timepoint where the maximal baseline and placebo-adjusted value is observed. These measurements are consistent with ICH E14 guidance.</description>
