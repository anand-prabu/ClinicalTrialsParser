Determine the safety and toxicity of sequential dose intensive adjuvant\n      systemic therapy consisting of gemcitabine, then doxorubin, followed by paclitaxel and\n      cisplatin with filgrastim (granulocyte colony stimulating factor; G-CSF) for patients with\n      completely resected, locally advanced transitional cell carcinoma of the urothelium. II.\n      Assess the disease free and overall survival of these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients receive gemcitabine IV on weeks 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7 for a total of 6\n      doses. A 1 week rest period occurs after the third dose of gemcitabine. At least 14 days\n      after the last dose of gemcitabine, during the ninth week, patients receive doxorubicin at 2\n      week intervals (weeks 9, 11, 13, and 15) for a total of 4 doses. Filgrastim (granulocyte\n      colony stimulating factor; G-CSF) is administered subcutaneously on days 3-10 of each cycle\n      of doxorubicin. At least 14 days after the last dose of doxorubicin, during week 17,\n      patients receive the combination of paclitaxel IV (3 hour infusion) and cisplatin, at 2 week\n      intervals (weeks 17, 19, 21, and 23) for a total of 4 doses. G-CSF is again administered on\n      days 3-10 of each of these cycles. Patients are followed every 3 months for the first 2\n      years, every 6 months for the next 3 years, then annually until death.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: This study will accrue 25-30 patients in 1.5-2 years."
