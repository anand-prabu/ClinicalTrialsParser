This study will be double-blinded for treatment with\n      placebo and JNJ-40411813; however, it will be open label (all people know the identity of\n      the intervention) for treatment with citalopram.

Each sequence consists of 3 treatment\n      periods (Period 1, Period 2, and Period 3) and each subsequent treatment period will be\n      separated by a wash out period (no treatment) of at least 7 days. Approximately, 18\n      participants will be enrolled in this study (3 participants in each sequence). Safety will\n      be evaluated by the assessment of adverse events, clinical laboratory tests,\n      electrocardiogram, vital signs, and physical examination which will be evaluated throughout\n      the study duration. The total duration of study participation for a participant will be\n      approximately 10 Weeks."
