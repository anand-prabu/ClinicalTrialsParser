  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      About one third of patients with hormone-receptor (HR)-positive, HER2-normal breast cancer
      and residual disease after neoadjuvant chemotherapy have a substantial risk of relapse. The
      clinical-pathologic stage - estrogen/grade (CPS-EG)  combining clinical stage before
      neoadjuvant treatment, pathological stage after neoadjuvant treatment, grading and
      estrogen-receptor status can be used to identify these high-risk patients. The CPS-EG score
      was additionally validated in 2453 patients with HR-positive/HER2-normal tumors from the
      German neoadjuvant studies' meta-database. 24% of these patients had a score of 3 or higher
      and showed a 3-years DFS of 74% despite adequate local therapy and adjuvant endocrine
      treatment.

      Cyclin dependent kinases (CDK), a group of serine/threonine kinases, play a key role in
      regulating cell cycle progression by interacting with specific cyclin proteins in
      luminal-type tumors. , PD-0332991 (palbociclib) is an oral, highly selective inhibitor of
      CDK4/6 kinase activity that prevents cellular DNA synthesis by prohibiting progression of
      the cell cycle from G1 to S phase through blocking retinoblastoma (Rb) phosphorylation.
      Preclinical studies identified luminal ER subtype, elevated expression of cyclin D1 and Rb
      protein, and reduced p16 expression as being associated with sensitivity to palbociclib.

      The PENELOPEB study is designed to demonstrate that in the background of standard
      anti-hormonal therapy palbociclib provides superior invasive disease-free survival (iDFS)
      compared to placebo in pre- and postmenopausal women with HR-positive/HER2-normal early
      breast cancer at high risk of relapse after showing less than pathological complete response
      to neoadjuvant taxane- containing chemotherapy. Considering the high risk of recurrence in
      patients after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and a high CPS-EG score, palbociclib appears to be
      an attractive option with a favourable safety profile for these patients.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Written informed consent prior to beginning specific protocol procedures, including
             expected cooperation of the patients for the treatment and follow-up, must be
             obtained and documented according to the local regulatory requirements.

          2. Willingness and ability to provide archived formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue
             block or a partial block from surgery after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and from
             core-biopsy before start of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, which will be used for
             centralized retrospective confirmation of hormone- and HER2-status and to evaluate
             correlation between genes, proteins, and mRNAs relevant to the endocrine and cell
             cycle pathways and sensitivity/resistance to the investigational agents.

          3. Histologically confirmed unilateral or bilateral primary invasive carcinoma of the
             breast.

          4. Residual invasive disease post-neoadjuvant either in the breast or as residual nodal
             invasion.

          5. Centrally confirmed hormone-receptor-positive (&gt;=1% positive stained cells) and
             HER2-normal (IHC score 0-1 or FISH negative (in-situ hybridization (ISH) ratio &lt;=2.0
             status assessed preferably on tissue from post-neoadjuvant residual invasive disease
             of the breast, or if not possible, of residual nodal invasion. In case of bilateral
             breast cancer status has to be confirmed for both sides.

          6. Centrally assessed Ki-67, pRB, and Cyclin D1 status assessed preferably on
             post-neoadjuvant residual invasive disease of the breast, or if not possible, of
             residual nodal invasion.

          7. Patients must have received neoadjuvant chemotherapy of at least 16 weeks. This
             period must include 6 weeks of a taxane-containing neoadjuvant therapy. (Exception:
             For patients with progressive disease that occurred after at least 6 weeks of
             taxane-containing neoadjuvant treatment, a total treatment period of less than 16
             weeks is also eligible).

          8. Adequate surgical treatment including resection of all clinically evident disease and
             ipsilateral axillary lymphnode dissection. Histologically complete resection (R0) of
             the invasive and ductal in situ tumor is required in case of breast conserving
             surgery as the final treatment. No evidence of gross residual disease (R2) is
             required after total mastectomy (R1 resection is acceptable).  Axillary dissection is
             not required in patients with a negative sentinel-node biopsy before (pN0, pN+(mic))
             or after (ypN0, ypN+(mic) neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

          9. Less than 16 weeks interval since the date of final surgery and date of randomization
             (including the radiotherapy period).

         10. Completion of adjuvant radiotherapy. Radiotherapy is indicated to the breast in all
             patients treated with breast conserving surgery and to chest wall in all patients
             with cT3/cT4, R1 or ypN+ disease treated by mastectomy.

         11. No clinical evidence for locoregional or distant relapse during or after preoperative
             chemotherapy. Local progression during chemotherapy is not an exclusion criterion.

         12. A clinical-pathologic stage - estrogen/grade (CPS-EG) score of &gt;=3 calculated using
             local estrogen receptor status and grade assessed on core biopsies taken before start
             of neoadjuvant treatment

         13. Age at diagnosis at least 18 years.

         14. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) 0 or 1.

         15. Resolution of all acute toxic effects of prior anti cancer therapy or surgical
             procedures to NCI CTCAE version 4.0 Grade ≤1 (except alopecia or other toxicities not
             considered a safety risk for the patient at investigator's discretion).

         16. Estimated life expectancy of at least 5 years irrespective of the diagnosis of breast
             cancer.

         17. The patient must be accessible for scheduled visits, treatment and follow-up.
             Patients registered on this trial must be treated at the participating center which

             palbociclib/placebo excipients or to endocrine treatments.

          2. Inadequate organ function immediate prior to randomization including: Hemoglobin
             &lt;10g/dL (100g/L) ANC &lt; 2,000/mm³ (&lt; 2.0 x 109/L); Platelets &lt;100,000/mm³ (&lt; 100 x
             109/L); AST and/or ALT &gt; 1.5 x upper normal limits (UNL); alkaline phosphatase &gt; 2.5
             x UNL, total serum bilirubin &gt; 1.25 x UNL; serum creatinine &gt;1.25 x ULN or estimated
             creatinine clearance &lt; 60 mL/min as calculated using the method standard for the
             institution; severe and relevant co-morbidity that would interact with the

             prior to randomization, except curatively treated basal cell carcinoma of the skin
             and carcinoma in situ of the cervix.

         10. Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory
             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or
             investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of
             study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the patient
             inappropriate for entry into this study.
