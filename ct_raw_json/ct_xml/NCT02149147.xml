  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the variety of physical activity, a
      cross-sectional design will be used. The data collected will provide descriptive details
      about how people are engaging in physical activity, as well details about the environment
      they are in while engaging in physical activity.

      Many individuals, particularly those who are obese, are inactive and increasing physical
      activity continues to be a challenge, thus, developing strategies that assist individuals in
      engaging and sustaining high levels of physical activity is imperative.1,2  Incorporating a
      variety of activities into a physical activity program is a strategy that may be promising
      for increasing physical activity levels.3  Data from the National Health and Nutrition
      Examination Survey (NHANES) showed that individuals who reported engaging in a variety of
      activities (i.e., walking + other leisure-time activities) were more likely to meet national
      physical activity recommendations compared to those who reported no variety (i.e., only
      walking).4  In another study, the investigators found that overweight participants in an
      18-month behavioral lifestyle intervention who reported physical activity variety (i.e., ≥ 2
      activities) at 6 months had higher self-reported physical activity-related energy
      expenditure and a lower body mass index (BMI) at 18 months than those who reported no
      physical activity variety (i.e., only 1 activity).5  Additionally, the investigators have
      also found that performing a variety of activities is related to greater engagement in
      objectively measured moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity in both successful
      weight loss maintainers and normal weight individuals.6 Based on the literature available,
      it appears that increasing the number of activities in a physical activity regimen can
      assist with increasing engagement of physical activity. However, physical activity variety
      has primarily been examined by summing the number of different activities a person engages
      in (i.e., walking + other leisure-time activities). Other environmental factors, including
      location, visual and auditory stimuli, and the number and types of people engaging in
      physical activity in close proximity, may impact on the degree of variety of differing
      physical activities that people engage in. Thus, the purpose of this study is to collect
      more information about physical activity variety.

      Specific Aims:

      Specific Aim 1. To determine the average minutes of moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical
      activity participants engage in.

      Specific Aim 2. To determine  if environmental factors  influence the degree of variety of
      physical activities that participants engage in.

      Specific Aim 3.  To determine if the average number of minutes of moderate- to
      vigorous-intensity physical activity increases as the variety of physical activities
      increases.

    <description>participants will complete the Self-Efficacy questionnaire, the Physical Activity Enjoyment Scale,  the Behavioral Regulation in Exercise-2 questionnaire, and an Outcome Expectations questionnaire. Participants will be instructed to wear the SenseWear® armband which will measure physical activity-related energy expenditure for the course of the study. The armband will be worn every day for at least 10 hours per day. In addition, participants will be asked to complete a physical activity diary to record their physical activity as well as additional information about the environment in which the physical activity was conducted. Participants will be instructed to engage in their normal physical activity regimen, wear the armband, and complete the physical activity diary for 3 weeks.</description>
