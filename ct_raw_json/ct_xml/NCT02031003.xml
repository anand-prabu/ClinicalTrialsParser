  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      -  The primary objective of the study was to compare stool composition (stool soap and
           non-soap fatty acids, total fatty acids, minerals, and other stool constituents) of
           infants randomized to receive either standard formula, or 1 of 2 innovative formulas
           containing a new fat blend or the new fat blend plus fiber.

        -  The secondary objectives were to evaluate among the feeding groups, stool
           characteristics (stool consistency and frequency), GI tolerance assessed by the Infant
           Gastrointestinal Symptom Questionnaire (IGSQ), and urinary markers (F2-isoprostanes and
           8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine [8-OHdG], and urine osmolality and specific gravity).

        -  The primary safety objective was to describe the frequency of adverse events (AEs)
           among the formula-fed (FF) groups.

        -  The secondary safety objective was to describe anthropometric measures (weight, length,
           and head circumference) among the feeding groups.
