These images are evaluated by utilizing the WMMS\n      ImageReview measuring and monitoring software. WMMS ImageReview software allows for LxW\n      (length by width) and surface area (cm squared),as well as perimeter (cm) external wound\n      measurements of the visual image. WMMS ImageReview software also allows for the display of\n      thermal intensity variation data for the associated body surface of the corresponding\n      thermal image.\n\n      This study is primarily designed to utilize the Coefficients of Individual Agreement (CIA)as\n      a means of establishing the equivalence of area measurements utilizing the WMMS ImageReview\n      software LxW technique and the current \"gold standard\" LxW manual ruler technique.\n\n      A secondary objective measures the thermal intensity variation data of the external wound\n      bed by overlaying the corresponding \"Visual External Wound Trace\"from the visual image onto\n      the thermal wound bed."
