Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. It is\n      not yet known which combination chemotherapy regimen is most effective for extensive-stage\n      small cell lung cancer.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of two combination\n      chemotherapy regimens in treating patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer."

Patients are stratified according to institute and\n      performance status (0-1 vs 2-3).\n\n      Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV and doxorubicin IV on day 1, and etoposide\n           IV on days 1-3 every 3 weeks.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive carboplatin IV followed by paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 1\n           every 3 weeks.\n\n      Patients with stable or responding disease are treated for up to 5 courses.\n\n      Patients are followed every 4 weeks.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 250 patients (125 per treatment arm) will be accrued within 24\n      months for this study."
