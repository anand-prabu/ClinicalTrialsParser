In addition, G proteins binding to GPCRs either directly\n      or permissively determine the efficacy of lifestyle interventions and drugs aiming at weight\n      management and diabetes treatment. Polymor-phisms of the fat mass and obesity-related\n      protein (FTO) gene have been also well characterised and linked to energy intake, body fat\n      mass as well as CVD risk and the susceptibility to weight-reducing interventions.\n      Stratifying patients according to G protein and FTO-related genotyping may enable a more\n      accurate prediction of individual disease courses and responses to therapeutic interventions\n      in terms of safety and tolerability as well as efficacy. Although the objectives primarily\n      refer to the analysis of G pro-tein and FTO-related genotypes, also other genes of potential\n      relevance for the evolution of obesity and/ or diabetes and the response to lifestyle and\n      pharmacological interventions may be analysed."
