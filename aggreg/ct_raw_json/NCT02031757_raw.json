One of the consequences of such deficit is an increased risk of fall and\n      injury.  A gait training regime that incorporates controlled perturbation has been found to\n      reduce falls in elderly population but the effectiveness of such training has yet to be\n      studied.\n\n      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of specific controlled dynamic\n      perturbation training, during gait, on gait rehabilitation, fear of falling and falling with\n      gait impaired individuals. Perturbation will be performed using a specifically designed\n      system that provides small, controlled and unpredictable perturbations during treadmill\n      walking."
