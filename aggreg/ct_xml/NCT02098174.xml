      The purpose of this study is to investigate the pharmacokinetics of MP-3180 administered in
      a single dose.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-dose study to investigate the pharmacokinetics of MP-3180.
      Iohexol will also be administered followed by saline.  Blood samples will be collected at
      pre-dose and defined intervals post-dose. The collected blood samples will be cooled in an
      ice bath or sample cooling rack and centrifuged under refrigeration as soon as possible.
      Urine will be collected at defined intervals post-dose. For the determination of the
      pharmacokinetic disposition of the MP-3180 and iohexol, there will be blood samples
      collected from each subject provided the individual completes all blood collections in the
      study. The pharmacokinetics of MP-3180 and iohexol will be assessed by statistical
      comparison of pharmacokinetic parameters derived from plasma concentration-time curves and
      urine recovery data.

    <time_frame>pre-dose and the following times after dosing: 5, 10, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240, 300, 360, 480 and 720 minutes post-dose</time_frame>

    <description>Single-dose pharmacokinetic parameters for MP-3180 and iohexol will be calculated using compartmental and non-compartmental techniques.  The maximum concentration and the time at which it occurred relative to the administered dose will be determined from the observed plasma concentration-time profile over the sampling time interval.  The elimination rate constant will be determined by linear regression of the terminal linear phase of the log plasma concentration-time profile.  Area under the plasma concentration-time curve is the sum of the linear trapezoidal estimation of the areas from the time of dosing to the time of the last quantifiable concentration.  Area under the plasma concentration-time curve from zero to infinity will be calculated.  The elimination half-life (HALFLIFE) will be calculated. Total plasma clearance (CLp) will be calculated.</description>

    <time_frame>up to 2 weeks of the final study dose</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>Yes</safety_issue>
    <description>The assessment of safety will be based primarily on the frequency of adverse events and on the number of laboratory values that fall outside of pre-specified normal ranges. The clinical significance of any abnormal findings will be determined by the principal investigator and medical sub-investigator. All safety data including Adverse Events (AEs), vital signs, electrocardiograms (ECGs), and physical examinations will be listed by subject.</description>

    <description>Observed plasma and urine concentrations will be summarized descriptively by time point and agent (MP-3180 or Iohexol) for all subjects included in the pharmacokinetic analysis.  In addition, plots of mean concentrations over time will be provided by agent, including standard error bars around the mean values.</description>
