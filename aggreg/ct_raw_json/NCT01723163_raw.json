            "textblock": "The addition of contingency management (CM) to existing evidenced-based tele-health smoking\n      cessation interventions is expected to be a cost-effective way to increase the reach of\n      intensive smoking cessation treatment. CM is an intensive behavioral therapy that provides\n      positive reinforcers (e.g., money, vouchers) to individuals misusing substances contingent\n      upon objective evidence of abstinence from drug use. Implementation of CM has been limited\n      because of the need to verify abstinence multiple times daily with a clinic based carbon\n      monoxide (CO) monitor. As a result, CM approaches have largely been relegated to inpatient\n      and day treatment programs. The application of emerging smart-phone technology, however, can\n      overcome this barrier. Investigators have developed a smart-phone application which allows a\n      participant to video themselves several times daily while using a small CO monitor and to\n      transmit the data to a secure server. This innovation has made the use of CM for outpatient\n      smoking cessation portable and feasible, i.e., mobile CM (mCM). Thus, the primary goal of\n      the current study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a combined tele-health and CM\n      intervention that investigators are calling Abstinence Reinforcement Therapy (ART). Proposed\n      is a comparative effectiveness trial with a two-group design in which 300 Veteran smokers\n      will be randomized to either:\n\n      ABSTINENCE REINFORCEMENT THERAPY (ART) a proactive tele-health intervention that combines\n      guideline based cognitive-behavioral telephone counseling (TC), a tele-medicine clinic for\n      access to nicotine replacement (NRT), and intensive behavioral therapy through mobile\n      contingency management.\n\n      TELE-HEALTH FOR SMOKING CESSATION a proactive tele-health intervention that will provide\n      controls for therapist, medication, time and attention effects. The tele-health intervention\n      provides the same guideline based cognitive-behavioral smoking cessation telephone\n      counseling (TC), and tele-medicine clinic for access to NRT as in the ART intervention.\n\n      Both of the proposed interventions are designed in accordance with national smoking\n      cessation guidelines. Tele-health smoking cessation interventions are typically less\n      intensive than clinic based specialty care, but increase reach of services through bypassing\n      barriers to participation such as geographical distance from VA care. The addition of mCM to\n      an evidence-based tele-health smoking intervention will significantly increase the intensity\n      of the intervention and is predicted to increase efficacy. If cessation programs are to have\n      significant impact (Impact = Reach X Efficacy) 4 on changing health behavior at the\n      population level, investigators must identify new and innovative strategies to increase\n      treatment intensity, access, and participation.\n\n      Specific aims are to:\n\n      AIM 1: Evaluate the impact of ART on rates of abstinence from cigarettes as measured by\n      bio-verified, self-reported prolonged abstinence at 3-month, 6-month, and 12 month\n      post-randomization follow-ups.\n\n      Hypothesis 1: Abstinence rates will be significantly higher among Veterans randomized to the\n      ART-based intervention than those randomized to the Tele-health alone intervention (primary\n      end-point; self-reported and bio-verified prolonged abstinence at the 6-month follow-up)\n\n      AIM 2: Evaluate the relative cost-effectiveness of the ART intervention in quality adjusted\n      life years (QALY).\n\n      Hypothesis 2: ART based treatment will result in greater cost-effectiveness compared to the\n      control condition as measured by the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio.\n\n      AIM 3: Evaluate potential treatment mediators including self-efficacy-related mechanisms.\n\n      Hypothesis 3: Increased abstinence associated with ART will be partially mediated by\n      increased self-efficacy compared to the contact-control condition.\n\n      Supplementary AIM: To evaluate the impact of psychiatric (i.e., PTSD, depression, alcohol\n      abuse) and pain symptoms on treatment outcome across the two conditions."
