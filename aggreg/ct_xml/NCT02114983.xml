  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Numerous studies have demonstrated excellent diagnostic accuracy of Compression
      Ultrasonography (CUS) performed by hospitals doctors, skilled and unskilled in Radiology.

      Recently, it was demonstrated that adequately ultrasonography-trained General Practitioners
      (GP) can perform reliable ultrasound to increase the speed and improve the quality of
      clinical management of various clinical conditions. To date, in the medical literature there
      are no studies that demonstrate the diagnostic accuracy of GP in performing CUS for the
      diagnosis of Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT). Therefore, we plan to perform a prospective,
      multicenter, cohort study in which a large number of consecutive outpatients with symptoms
      or signs of DVT are subject to the CUS by the GP with the aim of evaluating the precision
      and the diagnostic accuracy compared to specialists in vascular ultrasound, which in this
      case will be the standard of reference.

        All outpatients evaluated at home or at office by the GP with a first episode of suspected
        DVT of the lower limbs will be screened with CUS. GP may use his/her own ultrasound, or
        take advantage of the equipment of the Vascular Service of the Hospital. Shortly
        afterward, (i.e., within 2 hours), all outpatients will be re-evaluated by a doctor with
        expertize in vascular ultrasound
