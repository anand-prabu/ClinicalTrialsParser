            "textblock": "MUCIPLIQ is a nanopolymer engineered to mimic glycosaminoglycans such as heparan sulfates.\n      Glycosaminoglycans are involved 1) in the stabilization of cells micro-environment, known as\n      extracellular matrix, by binding to structural proteins, and 2) in cells communication\n      process by protecting growth factors. At the site of a lesion, glycosaminoglycans are\n      degraded, thereby the extracellular matrix is disorganized and the tissue is destroyed. By\n      replacing damaged glycosaminoglycans, MUCIPLIQ provides a protection, and restores the\n      matrix scaffold and cells communication, a process known as Matrix Therapy.\n\n      The purpose of this new controlled study is to determine whether MUCIPLIQ can decrease the\n      incidence and the severity of radio-chemotherapy-induced mucositis in patients suffering of\n      upper aerodigestive tract cancers, when used as a preventive agent.\n\n      The study's main hypothesis is that MUCIPLIQ mouthwash applications before radiotherapy\n      would protect the healthy oral tissue against cytotoxic effect of chemotherapy and\n      radiations."
