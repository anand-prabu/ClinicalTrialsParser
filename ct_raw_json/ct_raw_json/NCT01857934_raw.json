Mesna will be given prior to and after cyclophosphamide infusion. Peripheral blood stem cell harvest (PBSC) and surgical resection of primary tumor will be performed, if feasible.  Intensification therapy includes busulfan, melphalan, and levetiracetam with peripheral blood stem cell transplantation.

            "textblock": "Neuroblastoma is the most common extracranial solid tumor in childhood, with nearly 50% of\n      patients presenting with widespread metastatic disease. The current treatment for this group\n      of high-risk patients includes intensive multi-agent chemotherapy (induction) followed by\n      myeloablative therapy with stem-cell rescue (consolidation) and then treatment of minimal\n      residual disease (MRD) with isotretinoin.  Recently a new standard of care was established\n      by enhancing the treatment of MRD with the addition of a monoclonal antibody (ch14.18) which\n      targets a tumor-associated antigen, the disialoganglioside GD2, which is uniformly expressed\n      by neuroblasts.  Despite improvement in 2-year event-free survival (EFS) of 20%, more than\n      one-third of children with high-risk neuroblastoma (HR defined in) still cannot be cured by\n      this approach.  Therefore, novel therapeutic approaches are needed for this subset of\n      patients.  This study will be a pilot Phase II study of a unique anti-disialoganglioside\n      (anti-GD2) monoclonal antibody (mAb) called hu14.18K322A, given with induction chemotherapy.\n\n      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\n        -  To study the efficacy [response: complete remission + partial remission (CR+PR)] to two\n           initial courses of cyclophosphamide and topotecan combined with hu14.18K322A (4\n           doses/course followed by GM-CSF) in previously untreated children with high-risk\n           neuroblastoma.\n\n      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n        -  To study the feasibility of delivering hu14.18K322A to 6 cycles induction chemotherapy\n           and describe the antitumor activity (CR+PR) of this 6 course induction therapy.\n\n        -  To estimate local control and pattern of failure associated with intensity modulated\n           radiation therapy dose delivery in high-risk abdominal neuroblastoma.\n\n        -  To describe the tolerability of four doses of hu14.18K322A with allogeneic natural\n           killer (NK) cells from an acceptable parent, in the immediate post-transplant period\n           [day +2 - +5 after peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) infusion] in consenting\n           participants.\n\n        -  To describe the tolerability of hu14.18K322A with interleukin-2 and GM-CSF as treatment\n           for minimal residual disease (MRD)."
