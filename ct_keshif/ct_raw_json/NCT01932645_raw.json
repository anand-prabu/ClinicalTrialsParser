Although\n      the etiology of prostatitis is still not clear, it is mainly thought to be due to infection\n      of bacteria or other microorganisms. Traditional techniques to identify bacteria (e.g. on\n      agar petri plates) are limited in what they can identify. Although HMP (Human Microbiome\n      Project) has turned many mysteries into common sense, little is done on the relationship of\n      bacteria in the prostate for prostatitis. Up to now, there is still no research being done\n      on the microbiome (bacterial species) of the prostate. The objective of this study is to\n      look at the etiology of chronic prostatitis (bacteria or non-bacteria prostatitis), mainly\n      focusing on the effect of bacteria in the prostate. Modern sequencing methods, such as 16s\n      rRNA amplification, cloning and sequencing will be used to evaluate the role of bacteria in\n      prostatitis. The basic idea is to survey the microbes present in expressed prostatic fluid\n      using 16s sequencing to compare healthy men and prostatitis patients in a small cohort to\n      see if there are correlations between microbes found and symptoms."
