    <textblock>
      Post-traumatic stress Disorder (PTSD) is a chronic and debilitating disorder that affects
      millions of people each year (Kessler et al., 2005). Although effective psychosocial and
      pharmacological treatments exist for this disorder, as many as 50 percent of individuals
      still experience symptoms after treatment (Schottenbaeur et al., 2008). Empirical literature
      suggests that cognitive deficits may play a role in maintaining symptoms in individuals with
      PTSD through a variety of mechanisms, including decreased cognitive control over intrusive
      thoughts (Verwoerd et al., in press) and dysregulation in neural circuitry linking
      prefrontal cognitive control functions and amygdala activity (McNally, 2007). The goals of
      the proposed research are to improve the candidate's understanding of cognitive mechanisms
      of PTSD symptoms while building skills in conducting treatment research. The application
      aims to test a novel methodology for approaching PTSD treatment based on modification of
      underlying cognitive mechanisms of the disorder. To this end, 50 participants with PTSD will
      be randomly assigned to an 8-session executive control training condition designed to
      improve working memory functioning or a control condition. The aims of this study are 1) To
      test the effect of a working memory training program on working memory performance and 2) To
      examine the effects of this program on PTSD symptoms. The research plan is complemented by a
      set of training goals for the candidate to achieve over the proposed award period. These
      include 1) training in the use of fMRI and neuropsychological assessment 2) additional
      coursework and seminars in cognitive science and biostatistics for use in future work, 3)
      experience with teaching in the undergraduate and graduate setting and presenting original
      work for publication in preparation for a career in academic research. Taken together, the
      research and training components of this grant application will facilitate the candidate's
      long-term goal of conducting treatment outcome and basic mechanism research in PTSD.
      Moreover, as per the strategic plan outlined by NIMH, this application is designed develop
      an innovative intervention based on prior clinical research and knowledge of cognitive and
      neurobiological features of the disorder, and will advance knowledge of mechanisms of fear
      learning. It is designed to target core cognitive features of the disorder in an effort to
      reduce symptoms. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Post-traumatic stress disorder impacts millions of
      Americans, and is associated with significant personal distress as well as societal cost.
      The current application is designed to examine the effect of a novel working memory training
      program on PTSD symptoms. This approach is promising in that it may be a cost- effective and
      accessible method for decreasing symptoms associate with this disorder.
