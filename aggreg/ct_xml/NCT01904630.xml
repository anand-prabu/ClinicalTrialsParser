  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The project will use exome sequencing to search for genetic predispositions for familial
      colorectal cancer (CRC). Except for certain syndromes there is today no good method for
      identifying individuals with a hereditary high risk for CRC (about 25% of the cases). There
      is currently no routine screening of the population in Norway for CRC today. Coloscopy,
      which is the most reliable method, is demanding with respect to resources, it can be
      painful, and may have complications. This project will attempt to find genetic determinants
      for identification of individuals with increased risk for familial CRC. Such methods will
      reduce unnecessary medical examination of unaffected family members, and will make it easier
      to focus health services on individuals with increased risk. This will represent a
      significant contribution towards improved health reduced death rate caused by CRC. The
      project includes research on the ethical aspects, in particular challenges related to how
      feedback to donors is handled.
