            "textblock": "Anorexia nervosa is a chronic mental health condition characterized by maladaptive food\n      consumption (i.e., hypophagia) and distorted body image. There is substantial evidence of a\n      phenotypic overlap between anorexia nervosa and anxiety disorders, as well as data\n      suggesting the two share a common genetic pathway. Despite these findings, little research\n      has examined fear conditioning among individuals with anorexia nervosa, and no research has\n      examined whether individuals with anorexia nervosa have a propensity to overgeneralize\n      conditioned fear stimuli, one of the more robust fear-conditioning markers of anxiety\n      disorders. The current study assesses generalization of conditioned fear with\n      fear-potentiated startle: the cross-species enhancement of the startle reflex when an\n      organism is in a state of fear. Animal data, as well as an emerging literature in humans,\n      tightly links fear-potentiated startle to the amygdala-based fear circuit. Thus, evidence of\n      overgeneralized fear-potentiated startle in anorexia nervosa would link this eating disorder\n      to hypersensitivity of the fear circuit and could inform the development of novel\n      pharmacologic and psychological treatments for anorexia nervosa based on treatment models\n      used in the anxiety disorders literature."

The specific aim will be to examine whether conditioned-fear\n      generalization gradients in anorexia nervosa participants differ from those in healthy\n      controls. It is hypothesized that anorexia nervosa participants will display stronger\n      generalization as indicated by less quadratic generalization gradients (i.e., a more gradual\n      decline in conditioned fear as the generalization stimuli deviate from the conditioned\n      fearful stimuli), which is indicative of a heightened sensitivity, or lower thresholds of\n      activation, in the fear circuit (i.e., less danger information necessary to trigger the\n      fear)."
