  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Due to advances and increased practice of interventional therapy for coronary artery
      disease, the rate of high-risk patients with severe coronary disease and reduced left
      ventricular function among patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting surgery
      (CABG) is increasing. The perioperative mortality in these patients is ≥ 5%. The
      perioperative and operative management for these patients has to be optimized in order to
      reduce their perioperative morbidity and mortality. One of the central aspects is
      perioperative maintenance of hemodynamic stability. The use of prophylactic IABP is a partly
      established, but not sufficiently evidence-based measure to reduce ventricular afterload and
      improve coronary perfusion pre-, intra- and postoperatively. Yet, it is an invasive
      procedure with potential complications. The planned trial should give an explicit answer,
      whether preoperative prophylactic IABP decreases 30-day all-cause mortality (primary
      endpoint) and long-term mortality (3, 6, 12 months; secondary endpoints) compared to
      preoperative conservative treatment in high-risk patients undergoing CABG.
