  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators conducted an intervention based in proprioceptive exercises and balance
      tasks. The investigators also carried out a brief intervention in manual dexterity.

      The study hypothesis is that a brief intervention in upper extremities and a exercise
      program can increase functionality in Parkinson.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Motor symptoms in Parkinson frequently affect upper extremities. This has been associated in
      previous studies with limitation in the performance of activities of daily living and,
      consequently, with a decrease in quality of life. The possibility that a brief intervention
      improves eye-hand dexterity in Parkinson's, may be a therapeutic option to improve the
      performance of activities of daily living. The investigators also conducted an intervention
      based in proprioceptive exercises and balance tasks to improve functionality.

    <time_frame>baseline, 6 months</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>Yes</safety_issue>
    <description>Change from baseline to postintervention in dexterity. This is assessed using the Purdue Pegboard Test.
The Purdue pegboard test is a timed physical test used to measure manual dexterity. Test subjects are asked to place small pins into holes in the pegboard using a specific hand and following a specific process.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Grip strength</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6 months</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>Yes</safety_issue>
    <description>Grip strength is measured using a Jamar dynamometer with a standard protocol allowing three attempts on each side. During each measurement, patients were sitting with their shoulder adducted and elbow flexed to 90°. The maximum value achieved from all six attempts was used in analyses.

    <measure>Pressure pain measure</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6 months.</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>Yes</safety_issue>
    <description>The pressure pain threshold for each site (three points in upper extremities) is assessed using the pressure algometer. All assessments were made by the same investigator. All the subjects were trained to familiarize the subjects with the pressure algometry procedure before the measures in an anatomical site different from the chosen sites for this study.</description>

    <measure>Nervous assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6 months.</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>Yes</safety_issue>
    <description>Neurodynamic tests are used in upper extremities. It moves most of the nerves between the neck and hand, including the median nerve, radial and ulnar, brachial plexus, spinal nerves and cervical nerve roots.
The patient is placed supine position. It is measured with a goniometer.</description>

    <measure>Risk of falls.</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6 months.</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>Yes</safety_issue>
    <description>The risk of falls is measured with the timed up and go. It measures in seconds, the time taken by an individual to stand up from a standard arm chair,walk a distance of 3 meters, turn, walk back to the chair, and sit down.</description>

    <description>Exercise program An exercise program including proprioceptive and balance activities during 6 weeks, 3 times per week is conducted by a physical therapist in patients with parkinson.
A brief intervention with a plaster of resistance is also developed according to a protocol of exercises. It takes 20 minutes. After the intervention, grip strength, pressure pain measure, dexterity and neurodynamics.</description>
