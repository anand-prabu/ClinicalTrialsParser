    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot evaluation is to help determine the feasibility and power needed
      to prospectively evaluate relative effectiveness of high dose influenza vaccine in
      preventing influenza mortality and hospitalization in a nursing home population in the U.S.,
      compared to the standard dose influenza vaccine.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lower respiratory tract infection (LRI), which includes pneumonia, bronchitis, and
      tracheobronchitis, is the leading cause of mortality and hospitalization in older adults and
      nursing home (NH) residents. Often, the signs and symptoms of pneumonia, in particular, are
      not apparent in elderly patients, making diagnosis more complicated. In addition, clinician
      visits to these residents are few and sporadic and radiological facilities are not readily
      available.  LRI may or may not directly lead to hospitalization, but LRIs are associated
      with considerable other morbidity than can result in hospitalization.  Hospitalization rates
      for NH residents vary considerably between facilities, but the majority of hospitalizations
      occur during the 12 weeks during which influenza peaks each year.

      Influenza vaccination has been associated with reduced hospitalization, strokes, heart
      attacks and death in non-institutional older adult populations, but the benefit of influenza
      vaccine for the oldest population has been questioned. The new HD influenza vaccine is
      considerably more immunogenic in older adults, and has recently been approved for use in
      individuals aged 65 years and older.  No clinical data yet confirm whether the improved
      immunogenicity translates into added clinical benefit, such as further reduction in
      hospitalization or death.

      The primary objective is to:

        1. estimate the differences in all-cause hospitalization rates during flu season
           experienced by long stay nursing home residents, in facilities using the HD vaccine vs.
           facilities using the SD vaccine, as pilot data to inform feasibility, design and power
           calculation for a subsequent larger study.

        2. To develop estimates, at the nursing home resident level, about the relationship
           between influenza vaccination status (none, SD, HD) and Medicare Minimum Data Set (MDS)
           coded claims for all-cause hospitalization and overall mortality among the long-stay
           residents from a single season 2012-2013, for use in a subsequent longitudinal
           evaluation of national nursing home data and regional publicly reported influenza
           severity.
