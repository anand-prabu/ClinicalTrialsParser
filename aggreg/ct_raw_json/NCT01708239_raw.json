            "textblock": "In pregnant women with suspected DVT, a sure diagnosis is mandatory. Indeed, false positive\n      tests lead to inappropriate anticoagulant treatment, which increases the risk of bleeding.\n      Conversely, false negative tests might lead to a life-threatening thromboembolic event.\n      Thus, accuracy of diagnostic methods used in pregnant women is crucial [1].\n\n      In non-pregnant patients, sequential diagnostic strategies based on 1) the assessment of\n      clinical probability, 2) D-dimer measurement and 3) compression ultrasonography (CUS) have\n      been widely validated [2, 3].\n\n      Clinical probability assessment by clinical prediction rules (CPRs) is a crucial step in the\n      management of suspected DVT. However, the most commonly used CPR for DVT, the Wells' score,\n      has never been validated in pregnant women [3]. Recently, the 'LEFt' clinical prediction\n      rule was derived and internally validated by Chan et al. among 194 pregnant women\n      investigated for suspected DVT[4]. This rule combines three variables: symptoms in the left\n      leg (\"L\"), calf circumference difference equal or greater than 2 centimeters (\"E\" for edema)\n      and first trimester presentation (\"Ft\") [4].\n\n      We performed an external validation of this rule on a recently published prospective cohort\n      of pregnant patients with suspected DVT (submitted to JTH). This external validation showed\n      that a negative \"LEFt\" rule accurately identified pregnant women in whom the proportion of\n      confirmed DVT appears to be very low. A prospective validation of this rule is now\n      warranted, and we plan to use it in our prospective study.\n\n      The second step used in the diagnostic strategy including non-pregnant patients is D-dimer\n      measurement. The test has been widely validated in non-pregnant patients and, in association\n      with a non-high clinical probability, it allows to safely rule out DVT [5].\n\n      As D-dimer level raise steadily during pregnancy, the specificity of the test decreases and\n      it is less useful in pregnant women. A recent study suggested that the currently available\n      sensitive D-dimer assays that are used for the exclusion in symptomatic non-pregnant women\n      have the potential to exclude DVT in symptomatic pregnant women with the application of\n      higher cut-points [6]. Even if this data arises from a small study, it clearly suggests that\n      the usual cut-off set a 500 ng/ml would safely rule out DVT in pregnant women [6]. As the\n      usual cut-off has never been prospectively validated in pregnant women with suspected DVT,\n      we would like, as a first step, to use it in our study.\n\n      In pregnant patients, limited data is available on the use of complete compression\n      ultrasonography to rule out DVT. In a recent prospective management study, we included 226\n      pregnant and post-partum women with suspected lower limb DVT. We observed a 1.1% (95%\n      CI:0.3-4.0) three-month thromboembolic event rate in those left untreated on the basis of a\n      negative single complete CUS [7]. This result is in line with what was reported after a\n      normal phlebography, the gold standard test [8].\n\n      Even if complete CUS is safe to rule out DVT in pregnant women, current diagnostic\n      strategies for suspected DVT in non-pregnant patients rely on the use of clinical\n      probability and D-Dimer prior to leg veins imaging [5]. However, no management outcome study\n      on the safety and usefulness of D-Dimer to rule out DVT in pregnant women is available to\n      date. Another limitation of the strategies based on a single unique complete CUS, is that\n      every woman has to undergo complete CUS. However, this test is not always available.\n      Therefore, a strategy in which the association of clinical probability assessment and\n      D-dimer measurement would allow to safely rule out DVT in a significant proportion of\n      patients without performing a complete CUS, would be of great help in everyday clinical\n      practice and would probably be cost-effective.\n\n      Therefore, we plan a prospective study to assess the safety of a sequential diagnostic\n      strategy based on the assessment of clinical probability with the LEFt rule, D-dimer\n      measurement and complete CUS in pregnant women with suspected DVT."
