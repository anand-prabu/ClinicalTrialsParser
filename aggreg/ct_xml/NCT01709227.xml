    <textblock>
      Acute kidney injury (AKI) after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) in infants is common and
      associated with poor outcomes. Peritoneal dialysis (PD) and furosemide have been used to
      attain negative fluid balance due to AKI induced oliguria, but have not been compared
      prospectively.  The investigators will prospectively compare outcomes of infants with
      oliguria after CPB randomized to PD vs. furosemide with the hypothesis that infants
      receiving PD have superior outcomes.

      Background: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common postoperative complication after heart
      surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Multiple studies have demonstrated that patients
      with AKI have worse clinical outcomes, such as longer ventilation times and increased length
      of stay, which is thought to be secondary to associated oliguria and subsequent fluid
      overload. Studies suggest that early renal replacement therapy (RRT) via peritoneal dialysis
      (PD) may prevent fluid overload and therefore be a superior management to diuretic (i.e.
      furosemide) administration. However, there is no published evidence to suggest superiority
      or laboratory data available to guide decision making.

      Objective: Our primary objective is to determine if early institution of PD improves
      clinical outcomes compared to administration of furosemide in post-operative cardiac infants
      with acute kidney injury.  We hypothesize that early initiation of PD will improve clinical
      outcomes.  We will determine if these clinical outcomes will be better among good responders
      of furosemide compared to poor responders. We will determine if postoperative NGAL
      concentrations are predictive of poor response to furosemide.

      Design / Methods: The study will be a single-center randomized clinical trial among neonates
      undergoing cardiac surgery with CPB with planned placement of a PD catheter due to risk of
      AKI.  If patients demonstrate oliguria within the first postoperative day, they will be
      randomized to early PD or trial of furosemide. Clinical and laboratory data will be
      collected and compared between groups.

    <description>Patients randomized to the furosemide arm will be given 1 mg/kg intravenously every 6 hours for 2 doses and then as directed by CICU attending to augment urine output. Patients within this arm who have urine output &lt;1 ml/kg/hr over 16 hours after the first dose of Lasix will be considered poor responders. These patients may be started on PD if clinically indicated.  Those who show good response (urine output &gt;1 ml/kg/hr over subsequent 16 hours) will continue furosemide as needed to augment urine output. If they subsequently develop oliguria or fluid overload unresponsive to diuretic therapy, these patients may later be started on PD at discretion of CICU attending with consultation of nephrology service.</description>
