Determine whether intervention with a low-fat balanced diet will prolong the\n      disease-free survival time in patients presenting with nonmelanomatous skin cancer and\n      having a history of not more than two previous skin cancers. II. Assess the effect of this\n      intervention on numbers of tumors during the two year follow-up period. III. Determine the\n      incidence of new skin cancer in the control, nonintervention population.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are randomized into the Dietary Intervention\n      or Nonintervention groups. The control group has initial and follow up assessment of eating\n      habits. The dietary intervention group also has initial and follow up assessment of eating\n      habits that have been changed to reduce fat intake to one-half of the amount in the average\n      American diet with a subsequent increase of carbohydrates to compensate for total caloric\n      intake. Both groups have assessment of clinical status of skin cancer at 4 month intervals\n      for 24 months. Patients are followed for two years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 175 patients will be accrued in the first 3 years of this\n      study."
