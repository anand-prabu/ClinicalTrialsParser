The design will be a prospective and cluster randomized\n      multicenter trial, but mixed-methods will be used to target different outcomes. The study\n      population will be elderly (age above 65) at day care centers diagnosed with dementia, or\n      having a cognitive deficit. The intervention will consist of 30 minutes sessions with\n      animal-assisted activity or animal-assisted therapy two times a week for 12 weeks in groups\n      of 4-6 participants. Control groups will receive treatment as usual. Research questions:\n\n        1. Is there an effect in use of ordinary and optional medication among elderly persons\n           with dementia at day care centers participating in animal-assisted interventions\n           compared to a control group?\n\n        2. Is there an effect on social interaction, quality of life, activeness and wellbeing\n           among elderly persons with dementia at day care centers participating in\n           animal-assisted interventions compared to a control group?\n\n        3. Is there an effect on balance among elderly persons with dementia at day care centers\n           participating in animal-assisted therapy compared to animal-assisted activity or a\n           control group?\n\n        4. Do relatives of elderly persons with dementia at day care centers experience a change\n           in their own and the elderly's situation after the intervention compared with before\n           the intervention started?"
