      The purpose of this study is to estimate the incidence of dengue infection in children and
      adults in geographically distinct locations of Brazil.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to generate dengue disease burden data including estimates of
      incidence rates, prevalence data and the clinical presentation of dengue across different
      age groups.

      The study will be conducted in at least three cities: Rio de Janeiro, Salvador, and Manaus.
      This study will also prepare potential sites for future clinical trials, by setting up the
      logistics and training staff on site to enroll a cohort of subjects perform dengue
      surveillance and other study procedures.

      Households will be randomly selected from communities where a registry system is
      implemented. All individuals in the household will be eligible for participating in the
      study.  This study will be sponsored by GSK and co-funded by GSK and Fiocruz. As study
      sponsor, GSK will delegate some activities to Fiocruz, according to the provisions in their
      Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA).

    <description>Blood samples will be collected at each of the three scheduled study visits (Day 0, Month 6 and Month 12) and any time during the study that dengue is suspected. Samples collected at scheduled visits will be tested for anti-dengue antibodies. Samples collected at visits for dengue suspicion will be tested for dengue infection diagnosis.</description>

          -  Subject who plans, at the time of enrollment, to remain at same residence/study area
             during the one year study period.

        Exclusion Criteria:
