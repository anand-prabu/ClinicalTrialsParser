In Phase II, to determine trends in\n      efficacy of isotretinoin alone or in combination with IFN alfa-2a as chemoprevention\n      (preventing progression or recurrence) of anal intraepithelial neoplasia ( AIN ) / squamous\n      intraepithelial lesions ( SIL ) in patients with HIV infection.\n\n      SECONDARY: To evaluate the effects of isotretinoin alone or in combination with IFN alfa-2a\n      on immune function markers, human papillomavirus (HPV) type, and HPV DNA levels.\n\n      Patients with HIV infection have a significant risk of recurrence following local ablation\n      of intraepithelial neoplasia; thus, anogenital epithelial may become an increasingly\n      important cause of morbidity, and possibly mortality, as the HIV epidemic matures. Clinical\n      studies of non-HIV-infected subjects have established that synthetic retinoids inhibit the\n      progression of epithelial preneoplastic conditions and some neoplastic states."

Clinical\n      studies of non-HIV-infected subjects have established that synthetic retinoids inhibit the\n      progression of epithelial preneoplastic conditions and some neoplastic states.\n\n      In the Phase I portion of the study, 20 patients per site each receive isotretinoin in\n      escalating doses.  If a patient experiences grade 2 or worse toxicity (or grade 3 or worse\n      hypertriglyceridemia), dose is reduced to the previously tolerated dose for the remainder of\n      the 6 week period. Patients are then reassessed for anal neoplasia; those with no\n      progression and no grade 2 or worse toxicity receive an additional 6 weeks of isotretinoin\n      in combination with interferon alfa-2a. For Phase II of the study, a separate group of\n      patients who have undergone ablative therapy are randomized to one of three arms (26\n      patients/arm): isotretinoin alone at the dose tolerated by at least 60 percent of patients\n      in Phase I; isotretinoin plus interferon alfa-2a; or observation only. Treatment continues\n      for 48 weeks."
