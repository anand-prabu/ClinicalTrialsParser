            "textblock": "Stroke is the leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Given the increasing average\n      lifespan worldwide, the incidence and prevalence of patients with stroke will dramatically\n      increase in the future. One of the most frequent and devastating conditions after stroke is\n      aphasia, which affects language production and comprehension. High-frequent intensive\n      speech-and-language therapy is currently the treatment of choice in chronic aphasia.\n      However, despite its general effectiveness, treatment effect sizes are only low to moderate.\n      Thus, there is a pressing need to explore novel training-adjuvant therapies to enhance\n      treatment efficacy. Moreover, very little is known about the neurobiology of\n      treatment-induced recovery in chronic aphasia. This is the prerequisite to improve existing\n      and/or develop new treatment paradigms.\n\n      Thus, in the present project the investigators aim to assess whether the outcome of\n      intensive language training can be enhanced by adjuvant non-invasive brain stimulation. They\n      will be using anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (atDCS) that has previously\n      been shown to enhance (a) language and motor learning in healthy subjects and (b) motor\n      recovery in stroke patients. Specifically, in a longitudinal group comparison design, two\n      matched groups of patients with chronic anomia will receive two weeks of intensive language\n      training with or without atDCS. Treatment effects will be assessed immediately after the two\n      week intervention period and several months after the end of the training. The Investigators\n      will also use functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to elucidate\n      language network changes in the two groups."
