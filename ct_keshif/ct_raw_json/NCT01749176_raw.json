Two\n      community clinic organizations that provide services to a large proportion of Latino\n      patients with type 2 diabetes will participate to randomize 200 patients into one of 2 arms:\n      standard diabetes management care (control) only or text messaging and standard care.\n      Comparisons between groups will evaluate clinical, behavioral and psychosocial outcomes.\n\n      Intervention: Standard Care and Text Messaging.  All participants will receive standard\n      diabetes care provided by primary care providers at the clinic.  Of the 100 that are\n      randomized to the intervention arm will be given instructions on how the text messaging\n      component will be addressed throughout the duration of the study."
