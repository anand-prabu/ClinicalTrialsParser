            "textblock": "Nowadays, one in six couples consults for fertility problems. If the standard examination\n      and tests do not reveal any cause of infertility, the woman may undergo a laparoscopic\n      exploration which reveals endometriosis in more than 50% of cases.\n\n      Endometriosis is an inflammatory disease defined as the presence of endometrial tissue out\n      of the uterine cavity. It is frequent (1 in 10 women) and associated with a high economic\n      burden  (22 billion dollars in 2002 in the USA) and important decrease in quality of life.\n      Physiopathological mechanisms and risk factors for endometriosis are not well identified.\n\n      A woman with endometriosis is 20 times more at risk of infertility. Fecundity rate of a\n      25-year-old couple is about 15 to 20% in the general population and only 2 to 10% in case of\n      endometriosis.\n\n      There are many manifestations of this disease (infertility, pelvic pain) and the\n      anatomo-clinical correlation is not good. The presently used international classification\n      (American Fertility Society revised in 1985, AFSr) does not predict the chance of pregnancy.\n      New scores such as the Endometriosis Fertility Index (EFI) have been proposed to do so,  but\n      need to be validated. Treatment for endometriosis-related infertility is not consensual.\n\n      A prospective cohort study would give access to clinical data of patients followed in our\n      center, so as to identify clinical factors predicting pregnancy and to help treatment\n      decision for women with endometriosis suffering from infertility."
