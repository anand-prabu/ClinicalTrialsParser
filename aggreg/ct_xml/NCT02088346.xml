      The objective is to evaluate whether decision making of intravenous thrombolysis within 4.5
      hours after stroke onset via telemedicine consultation system can elevate the percentage of
      patients treated with intravenous thrombolysis, and improve the clinical outcomes at 3
      months for acute ischemic stroke patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For patients with ischemic stroke, the use of intravenous thrombolysis with recombinant
      tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) within 3 hours was approved by the US FDA in 1996,
      and now has been widely accepted. Based on the evidences from a few trials, the European
      Medicines Agency has expanded the time window of intravenous rt-PA to 4.5 hours, and the
      guideline from the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association has also given
      such a recommendation, although the US FDA declined to do so. In China, besides the use of
      rt-PA, intravenous urokinase within 6 hours has also been approved by China Food and Drug
      Administration (CFDA), and been recommended by &quot;2010 Chinese Guidelines for the Management
      of Acute Ischemic Stroke&quot;, supported by the evidence from a series of trials about
      intravenous urokinase thrombolysis. And urokinase is used more frequently than rt-PA, mainly
      because urokinase is cheaper, and rt-PA is not included in the drug catalogue of medical
      insurance in China. Therefore, in our trial, urokinase also can be used for eligible
      ischemic stroke patients depended on the patients' choice, and its time window for treatment
      will also be restricted within 4.5 hours after stroke onset.

      Until now, the rate of intravenous thrombolysis with rt-PA or urokinase is still very low.
      Usually, these stroke patients would be translated to the local hospital firstly. However,
      for lack of local expertise and infrastructure, intravenous thrombolysis was not always
      conducted even if the patients met the criteria. There is good evidence that telemedicine
      may help resolve the shortage of local expertise in neurology and improve the stroke care
      quality in the remote regions. Another main challenge is the narrow time window for
      fibrinolytic therapy. For stroke patients, it is extremely important to restore blood flow
      of the ischemic area as soon as possible. And it has also been approved that telemedicine
      may significantly shorten the time to initiate specific treatment. Until now, there's still
      no study evaluating the efficacy and reliability of telestroke in China. Thus, we introduced
      this telemedicine model into the nonspecialized hospitals in the remote areas in China. The
      objective is to evaluate whether decision making of intravenous thrombolysis via
      telemedicine consultation system can elevate the percentage of patients treated with
      intravenous thrombolysis, and improve the clinical outcomes at 3 months for acute ischemic
      stroke patients.

      This trial network consists of one hub hospital (Xijing Hospital) and 14 spoke hospitals in
      the remote area of Shanxi Province. The telemedicine consultation system is an interactive,
      2-way, wireless, audiovisual system based on portable clients--tablet computer or
      smartphone, which is designed by School of Biomedical Engineering in the Fourth Military
      Medical University. Before this study, we have been investigating the usual stroke care
      quality in the spoke hospitals without the guidance from the hub hospital, which will be
      used as the historical control of this trial. After that, the teleconsultation system will
      be introduced. Once the physician in one of the spoke hospitals judged his patient as acute
      ischemic stroke, he will call the telemedicine consultation system. Then one expert in the
      hub hospitals will ensure the diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke, assess the conditions of
      the patient and determine whether intravenous thrombolysis should be conducted; and will
      also give recommendations for other treatments. During the 9 months study period, about 300
      ischemic stroke patients may potentially be included.
