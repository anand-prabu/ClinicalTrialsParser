Each question is scored from 0 to 2 (0=never, 1=occasionally, 2=usually). In questions 1 to 8, the lower participant attention ability rated the higher score (AQS1), In questions 9 to 15, the higher participant attention ability rated the higher score (AQS2). The total score is calculated by the formula: 16-AQS1+AQS2 and the range is from 0 to 30. Higher score means better attention ability of participant.",
