They\n      are undifferentiated \"blank\" cells that do not yet have a specific function. Under proper\n      conditions, they begin to develop into specialized tissue and organs. They are\n      self-sustaining and can replicate themselves for long periods of time. They have the\n      remarkable potential to develop into many different cell types in the body. They serves as a\n      sort of repair system for the body, they can theoretically divide without limit to replenish\n      other cells as long as the person  is still alive. Premature ovarian failure (POF) is the\n      loss of ovarian function in women less than 40 years. It is associated with sex steroid\n      deficiency, amenorrhea, infertility and elevated serum gonadotropins. POF occurs in 1 % of\n      women. In majority of cases the underlying cause is not identified. Management essentially\n      involves hormone replacement and infertility treatment. This work aimed to evaluate the\n      therapeutic potential of Autologous MSC transplantation in women suffering from Premature\n      Ovarian Failure."
