      This is an open-label, multi center, two-tier, phase II study to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of oral selinexor (KPT-330) in patients with grade IV glioma (glioblastoma and
      subvariants) who have failed prior treatment with radiation therapy and temozolomide.

      This is an open-label, multi center, two-tier, phase II study to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of oral Selinexor in patients with grade IV glioma (glioblastoma and subvariants) who
      have failed prior treatment with radiation therapy and temozolomide.

      At the time of screening the patient will be is evaluated to determine if their brain tumor
      requires surgery as standard of care. If so, the patient will be assigned to Arm A. The
      patient will receive 2 or 3 doses of the study drug and then undergo surgery on Day 3 or Day
      8.  After recovery from surgery treatment with the study drug will resume.

      If the patient does not require surgery on their brain tumor they will be assigned to Arm B
      (non-surgical arm).

      Selinexor will be taken orally twice weekly on days 1 and 3 of each week (Monday and
      Wednesday or Tuesday and Thursday). One cycle is 28 days (4 weeks) and includes 8 doses of
      selinexor.

      Patients may continue to receive treatment with selinexor until either progression of
      disease is demonstrated by brain MRI according to RANO criteria, unacceptable toxicities,
      subject's consent is withdrawn, or the investigator believes it is in the best interest of
      the patient.
