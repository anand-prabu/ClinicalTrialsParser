  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test whether using the Biodex BioStep Semi Recumbent Elliptical for the
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patient with arthritic limitations will improve
      participation in a pulmonary rehab program compared to the Nustep elliptical. The main
      outcome of participation will be measured by the number of exercise sessions the patient is
      able to complete during their pulmonary rehabilitation program. In addition, distance walked
      in six minutes, dyspnea score, rate of perceived exertion (RPE) score, Pain Scale Index
      score, and finally, the Dartmouth Quality of Life index (DQL) will be assessed in both
      groups. It is believed that the new machine will provide better overall outcomes compared to
      the traditional machine.

      A Prospective cohort study of 25 COPD patients with osteoarthritis undergoing an exercise
      plan in a pulmonary rehab program. Patient pain level, clinical outcomes, and ultimately,
      quality of life outcomes will be assessed in order to assess whether future compliance for
      COPD arthritic patients will occur in an exercise rehabilitation program.

    <description>Patients attend exercise 80 minute exercise sessions of which 30 minutes includes aerobic exercise on a  NuStep and Biodex elliptical machine. Patients pain levels are scored when using the NuStep then when using the Biodex and these scores are compared to determine which machine give the best outcome for pain management</description>
