  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nearly all children with autism spectrum disorders engage in non-functional repetitive vocal
      and motor behaviours commonly referred to as stereotypy. These repetitive behaviours may
      considerably interfere with the child's daily functioning, learning, and social inclusion.
      As such, stereotypy generally has a negative impact on the child and family's health and
      quality of life. Several behavioural interventions have been developed to reduce engagement
      in stereotypy in children with autism spectrum disorders, but the limited number of
      specialists available, the long waiting lists associated with public health services in
      Canada, and the high costs of private services have considerably restricted accessibility.
      One potential solution to the limited availability and high costs of services is using a
      mobile application to recommend, teach, and monitor interventions designed to reduce
      engagement in stereotypy. To this end, the purpose of the study is to evaluate the effects
      of the iSTIM (i.e., individualized Stereotypy Treatment Integrated Modules), a mobile
      application designed to assist parents in reducing stereotypy in children with autism
      spectrum disorders. Specifically, we will assess whether the iSTIM correctly estimates the
      frequency or duration of stereotypy, offers suggestions consistent with recommended clinical
      practices, effectively reduces engagement in stereotypy, and is socially acceptable, safe,
      and easy to use for parents of children with autism spectrum disorders. The results of the
      study will allow us to determine whether the mobile application may be used to treat this
      core symptom in children with autism spectrum disorders, which could potentially reduce
      waiting times and costs of providing health services to this population. By reducing
      engagement in stereotypy, the iSTIM may also promote and facilitate the social participation
      as well as improve the quality of life and health of children with autism spectrum disorders
      and their families.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinical diagnosis of autism spectrum disorders

          -  Must engage in at least one form of stereotypy

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Stereotypy occurs less than 12 times per hour (or less than 20% of time)

          -  The form of stereotypy is potentially dangerous for the person (e.g., head banging,
             self-biting)

          -  The form of stereotypy is maintained by social consequences (e.g., attention, task
             avoidance)
