  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Pilot study is a Multicenter, Randomized Trial comparing autologous platelet rich
      plasma (PRP) versus autologous whole blood versus dry needle tendon fenestration on pain and
      quality of life in patients with lateral epicondylitis (tennis elbow).  We want to find out
      if pain and mobility are improved in people whjo receive an injection of platelet rich
      plasma(PRP)compared to a group of people wo receive an injection of whole blood, a group of
      people who receive dry needle tendon fenestration and a group of people who receive no
      injection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Platlet rich plasma deserves study because it is more expensive than the other treatments.
      If we find out that platelet rich plasma is better compared to the other treatments, it
      would justify the high cost and growing industry associated with the procedure.  If we find
      out that platelet rich plasma is not better compared to the other treatments, there is the
      potential to save the health care system millions of dollars.

      We hope to show that we can recruit eligible participants and complete the treatment and
      tests we plan to use to answer the questions regarding the effectiveness of platelet rich
      plasma for patients with tennis elbow.

    <description>Local anesthetic (lidocaine)will be infiltrated into the subcutaneous tissue of the lateral elbow, after which a needle will then be placed into the tendon followed by 10-12 gentle strokes of dry needling in which the needle pierces the tendon at multiple sites. Whole blood will be drawn from the patient's unaffected arm using a butterfly needle. The blood will be centrifuged and then a dose of the platelet rich plasma will be placed into the common extensor tendon, and the remaining platelet rich plasma will be sent for analysis of platelet, white blood and red blood count concentrations.</description>
