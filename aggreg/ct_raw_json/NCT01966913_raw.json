            "textblock": "High-dose chemotherapy with autologous hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation is a standard\n      salvage treatment used in adults with germ cell tumors (Einhorn et al, J Clin Oncol 2007).\n\n      Disease prognosis following 1 to 2 intensified combinations of etoposide - carboplatin +/-\n      ifosfamide depends on the patient's performance status (PS) at inclusion and the prior\n      sensitivity of the disease to cisplatin. A poor PS and/or being refractory to cisplatin\n      suggest a higher toxicity and a bad prognosis.\n\n      However, predictive factors of response to high-dose chemotherapy do not include a\n      chemo-sensitivity phase with a semi-intensive chemotherapy excluding a platinum compound\n      (epirubicin - paclitaxel), which still allows stem-cell harvest. The use of this\n      chemotherapy combination induced a response in more than one third of the patients treated\n      during disease progression in the TAXIF I study. The same strategy was tested in the TAXIF\n      II study, which completed the inclusion of 45 patients and was closed in May 2008. Results\n      of the TAXIF II study, are currently being analyzed; they support the hypothesis to\n      prioritarily treat patients with a sensitive relapsed disease at the time of the high-dose\n      administration.\n\n      A combination of a semi-intensive sequential ICE type chemotherapy plus bevacizumab was used\n      on a highly refractory patient. A 5 months nearly complete response was achieved.  Indeed,\n      the overexpression of VEGF (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor) has been identified as an\n      independent risk factor in patients with germ cell tumor. Therefore, a treatment strategy\n      using an inductive chemotherapy followed, in case of response, by a double intensification\n      therapy in combination with a VEGF treatment, could be an interesting approach in patients\n      with poor prognosis germ cell tumors.\n\n      The aim of this phase I/II trial is to assess the feasibility of a Bevacizumab - ICE\n      (Ifosfamide-Carboplatin-Etoposide) high dose combination with the support of autologous\n      hematopoietic stem cell for two intensive consecutive cycles (\"tandem\" intensification) in\n      patients with a poor prognosis germ cell tumor non refractory to a front-line mobilization\n      chemotherapy using two half intensified consecutive combinations of Epirubicin-Paclitaxel."
