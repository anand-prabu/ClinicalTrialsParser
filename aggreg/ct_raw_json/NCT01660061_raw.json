It ist also known that\n      antiphospholipid antibodies can interfere with phospholipid-dependent tests (e.g.\n      prothrombin time and INR).\n\n      The primary objective of this study is to determine the prevalence of interfering\n      antiphospholipid antibodies. The intensity of anticoagulant therapy was assessed by\n      measuring the INR using different thromboplastins and the CoaguChek system for INR\n      self-assessment. Test results were compared to measurements of the phospholipid-independent\n      chromogenic factor X.\n\n      The second objective of this study is to evaluate the incidence of recurrent thrombotic\n      events during 1-year follow-up."
