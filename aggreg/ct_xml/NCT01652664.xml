    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate that the IOP-lowering efficacy of
      Travoprost ophthalmic solution, 0.004% (new formulation) is noninferior to Timolol
      ophthalmic solution (0.5% or 0.25%) in pediatric glaucoma patients.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  2 months to &lt;18 years of age.

          -  Diagnosis of pediatric glaucoma.

          -  Qualifying mean IOP at the Eligibility Visit in at least one eye.

          -  Written informed consent, including assent when applicable, MUST be obtained from the
             parent or legally authorized representative prior to any procedure specified in the
             protocol,including screening procedures.

          -  Other protocol-defined inclusion criteria may apply.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Females of childbearing potential who are pregnant, intend to become pregnant during
             the study period, are breast feeding, or are not using any form of birth control
             measures.

          -  History of chronic, recurrent or severe inflammatory eye disease.

          -  Ocular trauma requiring medical attention within the past 3 months prior to the
             Screening Visit.

          -  Ocular infection or ocular inflammation within the past 30 days prior to the
             Screening Visit.

          -  Clinically significant or progressive retinal disease.

          -  Severe ocular pathology (including severe dry eye) in the opinion of the Investigator
             that would preclude the administration of a topical prostaglandin analog or a topical
             beta-blocker.

          -  Intraocular surgery within the past 30 days in the study eye prior to the Screening
             Visit.

          -  Any abnormality preventing reliable applanation tonometry.

          -  Other protocol-defined exclusion criteria may apply.
