  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Advances in intensive care and mechanical ventilation (MV) in the past two decades have
      increased critically ill patient survival. However, some patients require prolonged MV (PMV)
      and are deconditioned due to respiratory insufficiency caused by underlying disease, adverse
      effects of medications, and prolonged immobilization. Patients in the intensive care unit
      (ICU) are often confined to their beds, which results in inactivity, immobility, and severe
      osteomyoarticular system dysfunction. Our hypothesis is that an early mobilization protocol
      improves peripheral muscle strength, perceived functional status, duration of mechanical
      ventilation, ICU length of stay of the critically ill patient.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of implementation an early mobilization
      protocol in critically ill patients in the Intensive Care Unit of the University Hospital of
      Santa Maria.

    <description>Early Mobilization protocol: Patients in the treatment group additionally received a cycling exercise session 5 days a week, using a bedside cycle ergometer (MOTOmed Letto 2, RECK-Technik GmbH &amp; Co. KG, Betzenweiler, Germany). The device offers the possibility to conduct passive or active cycling at six levels of increasing resistance. The aim of each session was to have the patient cycle for 20 mins at an individually adjusted intensity level. Patients were placed in a comfortable position in between the supine and the semirecumbent position. In sedated patients, cycling was performed in a passive manner for 20 consecutive minutes at a ﬁxed pedaling rate of 20 cycles/min.</description>
