  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Given large absolute numbers of individuals with sickle cell disease in Nigeria, hydroxyurea
      therapy for all individuals with sickle cell disease may not be initially feasible; however,
      a targeted strategy of hydroxyurea use for primary prevention of strokes is an alternative
      to the standard therapy (observation) for high-risk individuals. The investigators propose a
      feasibility study, Sickle Cell Disease - Stroke Prevention in Nigeria (SPIN) Trial, to
      determine whether hydroxyurea can be used for primary prevention of strokes in Nigerian
      children with sickle cell anemia.

    <description>We will evaluate the use of a standard safety protocol, non-dose escalating, for hydroxyurea in children with sickle cell anemia using a protocol similar to the recently completed National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Baby HUG study, published in Lancet.(1) We expect the proportion of serious adverse reactions, as well as hydroxyurea-related morbidity and mortality, to be very small compared to the benefits.  We will compare the frequency of severe adverse events and hydroxyurea toxicity related events that are associated with hospitalization in those receiving hydroxyurea (n= 40) to those who had normal transcranial Doppler measurements (n= 210) over the course of one year.</description>

    <description>During the course of the current study, we will prepare a manual of operations and case report forms for the proposed trial. We will also solidify working relationships with our colleagues and collaborators at Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital in Kano, Nigeria; and develop and organize all committees, collaborators and study procedures necessary for initiation of a successful, definitive, Phase III Trial.</description>

    <description>We propose to enroll 40 children with SCA and an elevated TCD measurement between 5 and 12 years of age in this one arm feasibility study of hydroxyurea therapy, with follow-up of at least 12 months per subject.  Hydroxyurea will be prescribed as an investigational therapy by the treating physician.  Recommended guidelines for titration of hydroxyurea to maximal tolerated dose are below.  The study intervention will include hydroxyurea to begin at ~ 20 mg/kg/day(range 17.5 - 26 mg/kg/day).  No dose escalation will occur as this dose was shown to have some efficacy in infants with SCA and was associated with rare myelosuppression.(1)</description>

        Inclusion Criteria for Screening:

          -  Patients with hemoglobin SS or S beta zero thalassemia confirmed by hemoglobin
             electrophoresis;

          -  Informed consent from a parent or legal guardian and assent of participant ages 5
             through 12;

          -  Successful completion of screening procedures: cerebral blood flow velocity â‰¥ 200
             cm/sec in the terminal portion of internal carotid or middle cerebral artery;

          -  Patient must be 5 through 12 years of age (i.e., must have attained their 5th but not
             their 13th birthday when the consent is signed).

        Exclusion Criteria for Screening:

          -  Prior overt stroke (a focal neurological deficit of acute onset) by history, focal
             neurological deficit on standardized neurological examination, or concern for
             moderate or severe neurological deficit (which could be due to stroke) based on a
             positive &quot;10 questions&quot; screening (an established tool in resource poor
             countries).(2,3) A &quot;positive&quot; screening is defined as answering yes to any one of the
             10 questions. The negative predictive value (child does not have moderate or several
             neurological impairment) of the &quot;10 questions&quot; is greater than 94% in children (2);

          -  Other exclusions: significant cytopenias [absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &lt;1500/ul,
             platelets &lt;150,000/ul, reticulocytes &lt;80,000/ul, unless Hb is &gt; 9 g/dl], renal
             insufficiency (creatinine &gt; 0.8 mg/dl); other significant organ system dysfunction,
             or other contraindication to hydroxyurea therapy; and history of seizures or
             diagnosis of epilepsy;

          -  Patients for whom hydroxyurea therapy is under consideration prior to study
             consent/education;

          -  Patients who have previously been treated with hydroxyurea and are being considered
             to restart hydroxyurea therapy;

          -  Other significant organ system dysfunction;

          -  Any other condition or chronic illness, which in the opinion of the site's Principal
             Investigator (PI) makes participation ill-advised or unsafe.

          -  Participants of child bearing age who are pregnant or may become pregnant should not
             take hydroxyurea.  If a participant becomes pregnant during the study, their
             hydroxyurea treatment will be stopped immediately.  The onsite will notify the
             clinical coordinating center and the principal investigators of the case.  The site
             principal investigator and study principal investigators will determine what therapy
             the participant should receive during pregnancy that is of standard care.

        Inclusion Criteria for Study Therapy:

          -  Successful completion of screening procedures inclusive of cerebral blood flow
             velocity greater than or equal to 200 cm/sec measured twice or at least one
             measurement greater than or equal to 220 cm/sec in the terminal portion of internal
             carotid and middle cerebral artery;

          -  Informed consent from a parent or legal guardian for study therapy and assent of the
             participant completed;

          -  Participant is able to swallow a capsule as observed by study personnel;

          -  Acceptance of hydroxyurea therapy for one year.

        Exclusion Criteria for Treatment Group:

        - Unable to commit to follow up visits for the course of the study.

        Inclusion Criteria for participants that are not eligible to receive hydroxyurea therapy,
        but will be followed for one year (control group):

          -  Successful completion of screening procedures inclusive of cerebral blood flow
             velocity less than or equal to 199 cm/sec in the terminal portion of internal carotid
             middle cerebral artery;

          -  Informed consent from a parent or legal guardian and assent from the participant;

          -  Acceptance to be followed for one year in the study. Hydroxyurea may be given for
             other reasons as part of the participant's ongoing care, but it will not be given as
             part of the study.

        Exclusion Criteria for the treatment and control groups:

        -  Unable to commit to follow up visits for the course of the study.
