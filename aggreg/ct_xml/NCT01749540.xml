      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of ACE-536 in patients with
      beta-thalassemia.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of ACE-536 in beta-thalassemia patients
      with anemia and the ability of ACE-536 to generate an erythroid response in these patients.
      An erythroid response in this study is defined as: 1) a hemoglobin increase of ≥ 1.5 g/dL
      from baseline for ≥ 14 days (in the absence of red blood cell [RBC] transfusions) in
      non-transfusion dependent patients, or 2) ≥ 20% reduction in RBC transfusion burden compared
      to pretreatment in transfusion dependent patients

        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Documented diagnosis of beta-thalassemia intermedia, with anemia requiring at least
             1, but no more than 6 transfusion events in the last year, with no transfusion events
             for 56 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1.

          -  Prior splenectomy or spleen size &lt; 18 cm in the longest diameter by abdominal
             ultrasound.

          -  Mean hemoglobin concentration &lt; 10.0 g/dL of 2 measurements (one performed within one
             day prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 and the other performed 7-28 days prior, not influenced by
             RBC transfusion within 7 days of measurement).

          -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &lt; 3 x upper limit
             of normal (ULN).

          -  Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN.

          -  Females of child bearing potential (defined as sexually mature women who have not
             undergone hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy, or are not naturally postmenopausal
             ≥ 24 consecutive months) must have negative urine or blood pregnancy test prior to
             enrollment and use adequate birth control methods (abstinence, oral contraceptives,
             barrier method with spermicide, or surgical sterilization) during study
             participation. Males must agree to use a latex condom during any sexual contact with
             females of child-bearing potential while participating in the study and for 12 weeks
             following the last dose of ACE 536, even if he has undergone a successful vasectomy.
             Patients must be counseled concerning measures to be used to prevent pregnancy and
