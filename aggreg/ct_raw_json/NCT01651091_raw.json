            "textblock": "In Western practitioner settings, Buddhist principles are increasingly being used in the\n      treatment of a wide range of mental health issues. However, there is a dearth of high\n      quality research examining the effects of Buddhist-derived interventions (BDIs) on mental\n      health in forensic settings. The purpose of this study is to assess the salutary effects and\n      acceptability of a secularised group-based eight-week BDI known as Meditation Awareness\n      Training (MAT) against relevant predictors of adaptive psychosocial functioning and mental\n      health in violent offenders. A randomized controlled trial (RCT) design will be employed\n      structured with reference to CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) 2010\n      guidelines. English speaking adult males (aged 18-65 years) serving indeterminate prison\n      sentences for offences of instrumental violence at a category B prison will be invited to\n      receive MAT on a voluntary basis. Computer-generated numbers will be used to randomly\n      allocate prison participants (n=102 - based on statistical power calculations) to either an\n      intervention or 'treatment as usual' (TAU) control condition.  Measures will be taken pre-\n      and post-intervention and at three-month follow-up to assess maintenance effects."
