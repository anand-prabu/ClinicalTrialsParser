The reconstruction will be performed using two 3-0 Poliglecaprone sutures (on RB-1 needles) tied together, with each individual length being 12-15 cm. seven - Ten knots will be placed when tying the sutures to provide a bolster. The free edge of the remaining Denonvillier's fascia will be identified after the prostatectomy and approximated to the posterior aspect of the rhabdosphincter and the posterior median raphe using one arm of the continuous suture. As a rule, four passes will be taken from the right to the left and the suture is locked. The second layer of the reconstruction will be then performed with the other arm of the suture approximating the posterior lip of the bladder neck (full thickness) and the vesicoprostatic muscle to the posterior urethral edge and to the already reconstructed median raphe .This suture will be then tied to the end of the first suture arm."
