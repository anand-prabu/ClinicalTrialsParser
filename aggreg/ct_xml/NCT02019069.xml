      This phase II clinical trial studies how well liposomal cytarabine-daunorubicin CPX-351
      (CPX-351) works in treating patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia or
      myelodysplastic syndrome. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as liposomal
      cytarabine-daunorubicin CPX-35, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells,
      either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the efficacy and safety profile of the use of CPX-351 in older patients (age 60
      and older) with: higher risk of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) who are refractory/relapsed
      after prior hypomethylating (HMA) therapy; subjects greater than 75 years old with higher
      risk MDS who are HMA relapsed/refractory who have progressed to acute myeloid leukemia
      (AML)); AML with refractory/relapsed disease after prior HMA therapy for AML.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the duration of remission following induction therapy with CPX-351.

      II. Determine overall survival at 12 months. III. Determine the early induction mortality
      (at 60 days) following CPX-351 in this cohort following induction therapy.

      OUTLINE:

      INDUCTION: Patients receive liposomal cytarabine-daunorubicin CPX-351 intravenously (IV)
      over 90 minutes on days 1, 3, and 5. Patients with reduced blast count not achieving a
      morphological leukemia free state (&lt; 5% blasts) receive a second course of induction
      therapy. Patients achieving a complete remission (CR) or a CR with incomplete blood count
      recovery (CRi) at day 14 or after a second course of induction therapy proceed to
      consolidation therapy.

      SECOND INDUCTION: Patients receive liposomal cytarabine-daunorubicin CPX-351 IV over 90
      minutes on days 1 and 3.

      CONSOLIDATION: Beginning on day 28, patients receive liposomal cytarabine-daunorubicin
      CPX-351 IV over 90 minutes on days 1 and 3. Patients may receive a second course after 28-75
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for up to 1 year.
