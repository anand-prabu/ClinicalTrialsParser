      This is a Phase 0/1 open-label, non-randomized, biomarker and pharmacodynamic study in
      patients with advanced B-cell lymphoid malignancies, including B-cell chronic lymphocytic
      leukemia (CLL), small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), multiple
      myeloma (MM), Waldenström's macroglobulinemia (WM), mantle cell lymphoma, follicular
      lymphoma, or diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who have failed at least one prior
      therapy and for whom no standard curative therapy exists.  Patients with advanced stage
      disease are those whose disease is resistant or refractory to standard chemotherapy or
      biological therapies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study will evaluate whether the administration of roflumilast inhibits the
      activity of PDE4 and results in the modulation of AKT/mTOR pathways in patients with B-cell
      hematologic malignancies.  Peripheral blood samples will be collected for the purpose of
      determining the pharmacodynamics of roflumilast on PDE4 activity and on biomarkers as
      related to GC resistance.  Samples are obtained at baseline prior to starting study
      treatment, on Day 8 before the administration of the Day 8 study drugs (prednisone and
      roflumilast), and on Day 15.  If a bone marrow biopsy is also performed prior to study
      treatment or at any time during treatment, a sample will be sent for analysis.  Normal PBMC
      (and bone marrow when it is obtained) will be examined for changes in key targets related to
      the inhibition of PDE4 and potential reversal of glucocorticoid resistance.  Biomarker blood
      samples will be analyzed in order to characterize the pharmacodynamics of roflumilast alone
      and in combination with prednisone on PDE4 activity and on biomarkers, such as phospho-AKT,
      phosphorylation levels of mTOR targets.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Signed informed consent.

          -  Men and women &gt; 18 years of age

          -  Diagnosed with relapsed or refractory (per investigator assessment) B-cell
             hematologic malignancy, including CLL, SLL, ALL, MM, WM, mantle cell lymphoma,

             must be refractory to or intolerant of established therapy known to provide clinical
             benefit for their condition.  The original diagnostic biopsy and/or other diagnostic
             data (e.g., cell marker data) will suffice.

             refractory disease following most recent prior treatment.

          -  ECOG performance status of ≤ 2 and a life expectancy of at least 3 months.

          -  Ability to swallow oral tablets without difficulty.

          -  All subjects with preserved reproductive potential must agree to practice abstinence

          -  Has recovered from adverse, toxic effects of prior therapies to ≤ Grade 1(NCI-CTCAE
             v4) except for alopecia and peripheral neuropathy. This requirement will be
             subordinate to specific clinical and laboratory criteria that are otherwise
             specifically addressed in these inclusion/exclusion criteria. Peripheral neuropathy
             must have recovered to ≤ Grade 2 except for patients with WM, who may enroll with
             Grade 3 peripheral neuropathy if due to the underlying WM.

          -  Meet the following clinical laboratory requirements:

        All patients, except ALL:

          -  Creatinine clearance by Cockcroft-Gault formula of ≥30 ml/min

             syndrome or hemolysis)

          -  Aspartate aminotransaminase (AST) and alanine aminotransaminase (ALT) ≤ 3 × ULN

          -  Platelet count ≥ 50,000/uL, patients may be transfused to this value.

          -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1000/uL, with or without chronic granulocyte growth
             factor support

          -  Hemoglobin ≥8 g/dL, patients may be transfused to this value

          -  Is receiving concurrent high doses of systemic corticosteroids. High dose is
             considered as &gt;20 mg of dexamethasone a day (or equivalent) for &gt;7 consecutive days.

          -  Uncontrolled illness including but not limited to: symptomatic congestive heart
             failure (New York Heart Association [NYHA] Class III or IV heart failure), unstable

             placement of vascular access device.

          -  Other medical or psychiatric illness or organ dysfunction, which in the opinion of
             the investigator, would either compromise the subject's safety or interfere with the
             evaluation of the safety of the study agent.
