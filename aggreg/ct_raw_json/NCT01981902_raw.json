These\n      methods will include taking weight and temperature before and after run, skin-fold\n      measurements pre and post run, and obtaining saliva samples from  before and after run.\n\n      The researchers can determined the study wuse non-invasive, laser light technology measure\n      tissue water concentrations, as an indicator of dehydration."
