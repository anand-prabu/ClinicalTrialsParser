In\n      different cancer models in animals, OTX008 reduced tumor growing and metastases spreading\n      and it was observed a blood vessels architecture normalization.\n\n      Thus, OTX008 appears to be an innovating approach to treat cancers and this clinical phase I\n      study aims to evaluate OTX008 therapy in patients with advanced solid tumors."
