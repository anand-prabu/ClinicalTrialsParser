  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study which will assess the feasibility of a follow on main study.  This
      study will examine the impact of inspiratory muscle training on quality of life, rescue drug
      medication usage, and other markers of asthma in adult asthmatics in the UK.

    <description>Two weeks at the start of the study (post informed consent) will be required for diary completion (asthma control diary; Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire with Standardised Activities).
One week for pre-intervention testing (body plethysmography, exhaled nitric oxide, blood immunoglobulin G, respiratory muscle strength).
Six weeks of inspiratory muscle training (details provided elsewhere).
One week for post-intervention testing (plethysmography, exhaled nitric oxide, blood immunoglobulin G, respiratory muscle strength).
Two weeks will be required towards the end of inspiratory muscle training for diary completion (asthma control diary; Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire with Standardised Activities).  This two week period will coincide with the final week of inspiratory muscle training and the first week following it.</description>

    <description>Both groups will undertake six weeks of inspiratory muscle training (POWERbreathe, H&amp;B International Ltd, UK), six days per week, with the only difference being the load set on the inspiratory muscle training device.  For the real inspiratory muscle training group this load will be set to around 50% of maximal inspiratory mouth pressure and for the sham inspiratory muscle training group this load will be set to around 5% of maximal inspiratory mouth pressure.</description>
