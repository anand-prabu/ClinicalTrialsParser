  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The gastric carcinoma is one of the four most common tumors occurring worldwide. The
      advanced phase is characterized by metastasis and poses a very poor prognosis for survival.
      In 20%-30% of gastric carcinomas the tumor spreads into the abdominal cavity, which leads to
      metastases in the wall of the peritoneal cavity. This is known as peritoneal carcinomatosis
      and its five-year survival rate is less than 2%. Even after R0 resection of a localized
      gastric carcinoma the five-year survival rate is only 40%, not least of all because relapses
      in the form of peritoneal metastases are a common occurrence.

      Patients with gastric carcinoma and not yet diagnosed with metastases, but who show free
      tumor cells in cytology in preoperative laparoscopy before neoadjuvant chemotherapy and
      gastrectomy, have an 80% risk of developing peritoneal carcinomatosis within one year, which
      stands in strong contrast to the 40% risk for patients with negative cytology.

      In the study presented here (group A) therapeutic hyperthermic intraperitoneal
      chemoperfusion (HIPEC, in the literature also known as HIIC (heated intraoperative
      intraperitoneal chemotherapy) or IPHC (intraperitoneal chemohyperthermia)) with mitomycin c
      and cisplatin will be administered following gastrectomy in patients with a gastric
      carcinoma with free tumor cells in cytology diagnosed in the preoperative laparoscopy in
      comparison to (group B) solely gastrectomy in patients with a gastric carcinoma and also
      with free tumor cells diagnosed in cytology in the preoperative laparoscopy.

      A randomization will be performed between group A and B. Patients with gastric carcinoma
      (TNM Stage ≥ T2&lt;T4) without proven metastases (TNM stage M0), with and without involved
      regional lymph nodes (TNM stage +N/-N) and positive cytology in preoperative abdominal
      lavage will be included. Exclusion criteria are extended disease or inoperable tumor.

      This study is already permitted by the local ethic commission and the German Federal
      Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices (BfArM) (EudraCT-Nr.: 2011-004405-25 / Study code:
      HIPEC_Stomach) and was initiated in August 2012.
