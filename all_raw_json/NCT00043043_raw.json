Patients with no adenomas of 5 mm or greater receive no further treatment.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral celecoxib twice daily.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo twice daily. In both arms, treatment continues\n           for 6 months in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      All patients undergo an endoscopic exam of the colorectum at completion of study.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 100 patients will be accrued for the baseline biomarker\n      assessment and a total of 40 patients (20 per arm) will be accrued for the chemoprevention\n      study within 1 year."
