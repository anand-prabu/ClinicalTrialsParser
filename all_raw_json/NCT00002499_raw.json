Evaluate the efficacy\n      of induction with vincristine/daunorubicin/asparaginase/prednisone in producing a second\n      complete remission in these patients, and evaluate the toxicity of this regimen. III.\n      Evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of the Capizzi I regimen\n      (vincristine/asparaginase/methotrexate) and Capizzi II regimen\n      (cytarabine/asparaginase/daunorubicin) when given to maintain and prolong complete\n      remission. IV. Offer the option of bone marrow transplantation to those patients who are in\n      second remission and who have a histocompatible donor, and compare outcome of these patients\n      with those on chemotherapy alone.\n\n      OUTLINE: Nonrandomized study. Patients achieving remission on Induction proceed to Interim\n      Maintenance, then to Continued Maintenance; those failing to achieve remission receive\n      Salvage Re-induction, followed, if remission is achieved, by Interim Maintenance, then\n      Continued Maintenance. Induction: 4-Drug Combination Chemotherapy with CNS\n      Prophylaxis/Therapy. Vincristine, VCR, NSC-67574; Prednisone, PRED, NSC-10023; Asparaginase,\n      ASP, NSC-109229; Daunorubicin, DNR, NSC-82151; with Intrathecal Cytarabine, IT ARA-C,\n      NSC-63878; Intrathecal Dexamethasone, IT DM, NSC-34521. Interim Maintenance: 3-Drug\n      Combination Chemotherapy with, as indicated, Radiotherapy. VCR; ASP; Methotrexate, MTX,\n      NSC-740; with, as indicated, testicular irradiation (equipment not specified). Continued\n      Maintenance: 3-Drug Combination Chemotherapy followed by 3-Drug Combination Chemotherapy\n      with CNS Prophylaxis and, as indicated, Radiotherapy. Capizzi II: ARA-C; ASP; DNR; followed\n      by Capizzi I: VCR; ASP; MTX; with IT ARA-C; IT DM; and, as indicated, cranial irradiation\n      (equipment not specified). Salvage Re-induction: 2-Drug Combination Chemotherapy. ARA-C;\n      ASP.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: At least 72 evaluable patients will be entered. Accrual is expected to be\n      completed in 3 years."
