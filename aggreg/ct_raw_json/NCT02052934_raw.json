The study subject\n      population is 52 healthy adult male and female subjects, ages 18 to 45. Subject\n      participation duration is approximately 8 months with study duration of approximately 1.5-2\n      years, including 6-7 months of follow-up. Potential risks include subjects could develop\n      varying degrees of diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms (such as nausea, abdominal\n      pain or cramping, gas, and decreased appetite). Blood drawing may be associated with pain\n      and bruising at the site and rarely, with fainting or seizure. There is no direct benefit to\n      subjects from participating in this study but the potential benefits to children and adults\n      who may receive a future beneficial vaccine based on the results of this trial justify the\n      more than minimal risk of the subjects who will participate in this trial. The primary\n      objective is to assess the safety and tolerability of dmLT vaccine when administered in\n      three doses sublingually over a range of dosages in healthy adult subjects.
