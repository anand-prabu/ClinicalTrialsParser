  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Soluble Beta-Glucan (SBG) is a compound prepared from commercial active dry Baker's yeast
      which is then proceeded through a multi-step laboratory processes invented  by  Prof.
      Rapepun  Wititsuwannakul, Faculty of Science, Prince of Songkla University, Thailand. Based
      upon pre-clinical data, SBG has been shown to inhibit angiogenesis and probably enhance
      immune function, leading to shrinkage of tumor size in athymic nude mice injected by
      hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HepG2) and cervical cancer cells. Therefore, the
      investigators expect to see the safety and anti-cancer property of SBG in patients with
      advanced cancer whom no available therapy can be offered.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of histologically or cytologically documented, advanced-stage, primary or
             metastatic solid tumors that are refractory to standard therapy or for which no
             available standard therapy exists.

          -  Evidence of measurable or evaluable disease.

          -  Age must be at least 18 years.

          -  ECOG performance status must be 0 or 2.

          -  Received only best supportive care.

          -  Patient must meet protocol-specified laboratory values.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Second primary cancer diagnosed within 5 years, except cervical carcinoma in situ,
             basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma which completed curative treatment.

          -  Concurrent therapy with any other investigational agent.

          -  Severe, acute, or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory abnormality
             that may increase the risk associated with study participation or study-drug
             administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the
             judgment of the investigator, make the subject inappropriate for this study.

          -  Allergy to study drug.
