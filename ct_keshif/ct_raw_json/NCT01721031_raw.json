According to\n      the previous study, i.v. tramadol 1.5 mg/kg administered 30 min before extubation results in\n      reduction in the incidence and severity of CRBD. In clinical practice, tramadol is\n      associated with side effects including nausea, vomiting, sedation, etc. Clinically, dorsal\n      penile nerve block (DPNB) plus ring block (RB) was applied in penile surgery, and got\n      satisfactory pain relief effect postoperatively without side effects related to tramadol.\n      Besides, we observed patients underwent urethra surgery with urinary catheter left in situ\n      seldom complained of CRBD if DPNB and RB performed at the end of operation. We hypothesized\n      that DPNB plus RB could relieve DPNB for male patient with indwelling urinary catheter\n      insertion after induction of general anesthesia.\n\n      In this study we compare the efficacy of dorsal penile nerve block (DPNB) plus ring block\n      (RB) with 0.33% ropivacaine and intravenous tramadol 1.5mg/kg in prevention of CRBD, as well\n      as the incidences of side effects postoperatively."
