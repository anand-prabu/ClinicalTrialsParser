    <textblock>
      Prometheus's Onco dX assay platform provides technological breakthrough for immunoassay by
      obtaining a level of sensitivity down to single tumor cells without compromising
      specificity. This allows assessment of multiple TKI treatment targets, their activation
      status, as well as down stream signaling proteins using very tiny amount of tissue that can
      be obtained by FNA or CTCs.

      We planned this study to explore biomarkers predictive of clinical response to
      cetuximab-based treatment in metastatic colorectal cancer using the Prometheus Platform. We
      will also elucidate signal transduction pathway attributable to cetuximab resistance,
      monitor changes in the RTK activation status during cetuximab treatment using circulating
      tumor cells and analyze correlation between the quantity of circulating tumor cells and
      treatment response to cetuximab.
