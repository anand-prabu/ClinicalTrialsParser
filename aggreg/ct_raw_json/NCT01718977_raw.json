            "textblock": "1. Purpose To determine whether body weight-supported treadmill training (BWSTT) has\n           beneficial effects, over and above arm-cycle ergometry training (ACET), on arterial\n           stiffness (aortic pulse wave velocity, aPWV) and secondary health outcomes\n           (cardiovascular, autonomic and metabolic indices, fitness, body composition, and\n           quality of life) in individuals with chronic (\u2265 2 years post-injury) motor-complete\n           cervical and high-thoracic SCI.\n\n        2. Hypothesis Through large muscle mass involvement and postural challenge, the physical\n           and metabolic stimuli of BWSTT will reduce aortic pulse wave velocity (aPWV) by 1 m/s\n           in individuals with established risk (i.e. aPWV \u2265 13 m/s).\n\n        3. Justification for the study Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is leading cause of morbidity\n           and mortality in the SCI population. It is most commonly attributed to decreased\n           physical activity levels; therefore strategies for decreasing CVD risk are centred on\n           increasing physical activity. Unfortunately, the exercise-training literature in\n           populations with SCI is limited, making it difficult to design evidence-based exercise\n           prescriptions. ACET is widely used by individuals with SCI, but there is limited\n           evidence on its ability to improve cardiovascular health. Given the evidence linking\n           cardiovascular measures, specifically aPWV, and CVD risk, an exercise prescription,\n           which is capable of eliciting both acute cardiovascular responses and chronic\n           cardiovascular adaptations, is crucial. BWSTT has demonstrated favorable cardiovascular\n           adaptations, but is primarily employed in individuals with incomplete SCI due to the\n           nature of the exercise. While preliminary evidence in individuals with complete SCI\n           suggest it may have favorable training effects, its effectiveness in a large sample of\n           individuals with chronic, motor-complete, severe SCI has yet to be established.\n\n        4. Objectives Cardiovascular adaptations in individuals with SCI predispose them to\n           complex secondary health problems. This study will use a comprehensive assessment of\n           cardiovascular risk factors and two different exercise interventions to assist in\n           developing cardiovascular risk profiles and determining if BWSTT has greater efficacy\n           than traditional exercise interventions (ACET) for decreasing cardiovascular risk in\n           individuals with high, severe SCI.\n\n        5. Research Method This study will employ a prospective, multi-centre, randomized,\n           controlled, single-blinded clinical trial. A total of 60 participants (20 per site)\n           between 18-60 years of age who have sustained a motor-complete (i.e., C4-T6, AIS A or\n           B) traumatic SCI \u2265 2 years prior will be recruited. Only individuals with aPWV \u2265 13 m/s\n           will be eligible to participate. The primary outcome measure (aPWV), and secondary\n           cardiovascular and autonomic parameters will be assessed using a combination of\n           electrocardiography, ultrasound, blood pressure, and applanation tonometry techniques.\n           Fitness will be determined using a peak oxygen consumption test on a arm-cycle\n           ergometer. Body composition will be determined using a dual energy x-ray\n           absorbitrometry (DXA) scan. Metabolic indices will be determined from blood sampling.\n           Lastly, quality of life and physical activity levels will be assessed using\n           questionnaires. Measurements will take place at baseline (via participation in Study\n           1), and 3 and 6-months of exercise training, and following the completion of 6-months\n           of exercise training. Training will involve 3, 60-minute exercise sessions per week,\n           for 24 weeks. Both BWSTT and ACET sessions will take place at the Blusson Spinal Cord\n           Centre at International Collaboration On Repair Discoveries (ICORD)."
