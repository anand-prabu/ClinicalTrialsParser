  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Residents of nursing homes are endangered by malnutrition and vitamin D deficiency. Our
      study checks compliance with Swiss federal recommendations on vitamin D and calcium
      supplementation among residents of a Swiss nursing home.  A peer physician-applied
      recommendation on compliance with the federal recommendations with individual evaluation of
      the residents will be sent to the physicians in care. After one year, data will be collected
      again.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators plan to get a complete sample of all inhabitants, so the only inclusion
      criterion is to get an informed consent either from the residents or from their relatives.
      The following data will be recorded: Year of birth, gender, height, weight, blood pressure
      and heart rate, daily calcium intake from diet, nursing home scales on pain, depression,
      dementia and activities of daily life, date of entry to the home, diagnosis and medication
      lists. From a venous blood sample the investigators get: calcium, phosphate, albumin,
      creatinin, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, parathormone (intact).

      Primary endpoint: Proportion of medication lists of residents complying with federal
      recommendation on vitamin D and calcium supplementation.

      Secondary endpoints: 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels, effect of an intervention with a nursing
      home-applied recommendation to the physicians.
