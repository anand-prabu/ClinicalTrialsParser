  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 1</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>UCVA (ie, without spectacles) will be performed at a distance of four meters. UCVA is measured in logMAR (minimum angle of resolution), with a lower logMAR indicating better visual acuity.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Corneal flap thickness as assessed by ocular coherence tomography (OCT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Month 6</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The thickness of the corneal flap will be assessed by OCT (ie, an imaging method using light to capture three-dimensional images). Corneal flap thickness is measured in microns.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Manifest refraction per standard of care</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Month 6</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>A series of test lenses in graded powers will be used to determine which corrective lenses provide the sharpest, clearest vision. Manifest refraction is measured in diopters.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Total treatment time as documented in the log files</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 (surgery)</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Total treatment time with Excimer EX500 and Femtosecond FS200 lasers will be measured in seconds and minutes.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Spectacle independence as reported on the RSVP Questionnaire for Quality of Life and Retreatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Month 6</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The Refractive Status and Vision Profile (RSVP) Questionnaire measures self-reported vision-related health status in persons with refractive error.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Contrast Acuity</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Month 6</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Contrast acuity (ie, a measurement of the ability to see between different shades of gray from the background) will be assessed in accordance with the manufacturer's guidelines. Contrast acuity is measured in logMAR, with a lower logMAR indicating better contrast acuity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Total root square mean (RMS) as determined by wavefront aberrometry</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Month 6</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Wavefront aberrometry measures the eye's image-forming quality and optical abnormalities and how visual acuity is affected. Total RMS (ie, the overall magnitude of all the eye's refractive errors) will be assessed using a commercially available system. Total RMS is measured in 0.01 microns.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Corneal curvature as measured by keratometry</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Month 6</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Corneal curvature will be assessed using a commercially available system. Corneal curvature is measured in diopters.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Wavefront optimization profile (WFO) as determined by wavefront aberrometry</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Month 6</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Wavefront aberrometry measures the eye's image-forming quality and optical abnormalities and how visual acuity is affected. WFO profile will be assessed using a commercially available system.</description>
