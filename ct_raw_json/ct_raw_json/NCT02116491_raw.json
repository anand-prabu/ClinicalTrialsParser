The investigators compare the weight of secretions collected, vital signs, and\n      tracheal wall injury between two groups of patients randomized to have VSSS combined with\n      closed system suction (CSC) suction and patients having CSC suction alone.\n\n      HYPOTHESIS: The investigators theorized that the VSSS collected more sputum and caused less\n      change of vital signs than conventional CSC."

            "textblock": "Study design: This is a randomized controlled trial study, including patients ventilated in\n      one respiratory intensive care unit (RICU). Two suction systems (The novel VSSS and\n      conventional CSS alone) will be compared at time point before (baseline), immediately after,\n      3 min after, and 5 min after suctioning.\n\n      Background: Sputum suctioning is a routine clinical procedure that is crucial for keeping\n      the airway open, to reduce the incidence of respiratory-tract infections. In most\n      circumstances, a conventional catheter with a single-lumen channel is used for sputum\n      suctioning. However, this procedure Involves blind manipulation of the catheter on the part\n      of the clinician and thus depends largely on the clinician's skills and experience.\n      Therefore, complications occur in some patients, especially on the changes of the parameters\n      of the heart-lung system. In addition, because clinicians cannot directly target sputum in\n      the trachea, the efficiency of the procedure may be reduced.\n\n      Recently, a visual sputum suctioning system (VSSS) was developed in our research group. It\n      integrates a 0.9-mm micro-imaging fiber into a 3.7-mm double-lumen catheter.\n\n      In vitro tests investigators found that the ability to visualize the airway allows targeting\n      of sputum, which compensates for the smaller lumen and makes the suctioning procedure more\n      efficient overall. In addition, in animal tests investigators found that the VSSS collected\n      more sputum and caused less tracheal mucosa damage than conventional suctioning.\n\n      Purpose: The present study investigated the safety and efficacy of sputum suctioning system\n      with this double-lumen catheter in mechanical ventilated patients in respiratory intensive\n      care unit (RICU). The purpose of this study was to compare the weight of secretions\n      collected, vital signs, and tracheal wall injury between two groups of patients randomized\n      to have VSSS combined with closed system suction (CSC) suction and patients having CSC\n      suction alone. investigators theorized that the VSSS collected more sputum and caused less\n      change of vital signs than conventional CSC.\n\n      Registry procedure: All requested information will be recorded on case report forms and\n      explanation will be reported for any missing data. False data will be clearly corrected, and\n      signed by investigator or authorized person.\n\n      Monitoring will be realized by the co-investigator in association with the clinical research\n      associate.\n\n      Sample size assessment: Number of subjects: 40 patients. Three months should be necessary to\n      include these patients.\n\n      Statistical analysis: Investigators determined that 20 patients per group would provide a\n      power of 95%, with a \u03b1 level of 5%.\n\n      Results will be expressed as means \u00b1 Standard Deviation. SPSS 10.0 (Chicago, Illinois, USA)\n      for the statistical calculation was used. P values < 0.05 were considered statistically\n      significant. Investigators used the nonparametric t test for normally distributed data, and\n      the nonparametric Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney rank test for other data.Investigators used\n      repeated-measures analysis of variance at four time points (before suctioning, immediately\n      after suctioning, 3 min after suctioning, and 5 min after suctioning) to analyze changes and\n      differences in PaO2, heart rate, and mean arterial pressure."
