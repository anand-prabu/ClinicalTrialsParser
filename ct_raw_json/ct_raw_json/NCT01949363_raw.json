Stage 3(Cohort E) will evaluate the highest tolerated dose of\n      cefixime co-administered with a single oral dose of azithromycin 1 gram orally once in order\n      to determine the tolerability of the regimen and whether there are significant changes in\n      cefixime pharmacokinetics when the drugs are administered together.

            "textblock": "This study is a Phase I, open label, non-randomized, dose-frequency escalation\n      pharmacokinetics study among 30 healthy male and female subjects, aged 18 to 45 years to\n      determine the pharmacokinetics and safety of high-, multi-dose cefixime for the treatment of\n      reduced susceptibility gonorrhea. The study will occur in three stages as described below.\n      Stage 1: Confirm/establish the pharmacokinetics (PK) of 400mg and 800mg doses of cefixime\n      tablet. Stage 2: Define dosing frequency necessary to achieve total serum cefixime levels\n      that exceed 2.0 mcg/mL for over 20 hours. Stage 3: Evaluate whether co-administration of\n      azithromycin with a high, multi-dose cefixime regimen changes the pharmacokinetics of\n      cefixime. Stage 1 (Cohorts A and B): Six subjects will be admitted to the Johns Hopkins\n      Bayview Clinic Trials Unit to assess each dosing regimen, for a total of 12 subjects. At\n      time=0, subjects will undergo baseline serum cefixime levels, followed by ingestion of\n      cefixime. Serum collections will occur at times 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 hours.\n      Cohort B will have the same serum collection time points as Cohort A. Cohorts A & B will be\n      run nearly simultaneously as logistically feasible. Stage 2 (Cohorts C and D): After\n      determining the PK parameters of single dose 800mg, the PK simulation model will be\n      repeated, adjusting the model as needed based on findings from study Stage 1. Assuming there\n      are no major discrepancies between Figure 2 (above) and the new PK simulations, the\n      following regimens will be tested, beginning with Cohort C. Six subjects per dosing regimen,\n      Cohorts C and D, will be admitted to the Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center, for a total\n      of 12 subjects. The 800mg q12 hour x 2 regimen (Cohort C) will be tested first. For Cohort\n      C, serum cefixime levels will be drawn at 12, 16, and 26 hours.  If the q12 regimen is\n      deemed safe and tolerable after review by the SMC, Cohort D will commence with the 800mg q8\n      hour x 3 regimen. Total serum cefixime levels will be drawn for Cohort D at 8, 16, 20 and 26\n      hours (see Section 7.2).  Stage 3 (Cohort E): After establishing a safe, tolerable and\n      effective treatment regimen in Stage 2, Stage 3 will determine if cefixime levels change\n      with the addition of azithromycin. Six subjects will be admitted to the Johns Hopkins\n      Bayview Medical Center. Cefixime serum levels will be measured following administration of a\n      1-gram dose of azithromycin with the chosen cefixime drug regimen established in Stage 2.\n      Serum specimen collection times will be determined based on the dosing regimen chosen. All\n      Stages, All Cohorts: All samples collected for PK analysis will be shipped to the University\n      of Toledo, Dr. Jeffrey Blumer's HPLC lab for processing.  Specimens will be analyzed by high\n      performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) for total cefixime concentration levels. Targeted\n      clinical evaluations will be used to monitor for subject reported side effects. Subjects\n      will be asked about specific symptoms they may have experienced, including abdominal pain,\n      nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, flatulence, headache, and rash, or any other symptoms.\n      Additionally, subjects will be asked to maintain a Subject Diary (Appendix E) from Study Day\n      0 through Day 7 to record information about any symptoms experienced or medications taken.\n      Study duration is approximately 49 weeks."
