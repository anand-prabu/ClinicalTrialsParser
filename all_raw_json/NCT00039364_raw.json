Patients are stratified according to glioma\n      (glioblastoma multiforme vs anaplastic oligodendroglioma or mixed oligoastrocytoma vs\n      anaplastic astrocytoma or recurrent low-grade astrocytoma).\n\n      Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate once or twice daily. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks\n      for up to 9 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed every 2 months for 6 months and then every 3 months thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 77 patients (29 patients with glioblastoma multiforme, 24\n      patients with anaplastic oligodendroglioma or mixed oligoastrocytoma, and 24 patients with\n      anaplastic astrocytoma or recurrent low-grade astrocytoma) will be accrued for this study."
