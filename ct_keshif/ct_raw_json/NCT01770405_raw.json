The fundamental technology, as well as the principle of operation of\n      nCLE, is substantially similar to pCLE.\n\n      endoscopic fine needles are used during EUS-FNA procedures to puncture solid organs such as\n      the pancreas, in order to get tissue or fluid for diagnostic purposes. There are different\n      calibers of endoscopic nee-dles used. The most commonly used calibers for EUS-FNA procedures\n      are 22G, 19G, and 25G needles. The nCLE Confocal Miniprobe is compatible with the 19G-type\n      needle only. It is expected to help to differentiate the different types of lesions,\n      especially for cysts, leading to better patient management. Microscopic tissue information\n      in real-time in vivo during an EUS-FNA procedure may allow better differentiation between\n      mucinous and non-mucinous cysts for instance."
