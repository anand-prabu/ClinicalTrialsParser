      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the serum concentration of tabalumab after the
      administration using either prefilled syringe or auto-injector after the initial loading
      dose and after 12 weeks of treatment. Treatment period is followed by 40 weeks optional
      safety extension.

          -  Active RA (at least 8/68 tender and at least 8/66 swollen joints)

          -  Screening C-reactive protein &gt;1.2 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) or a
             screening erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) &gt;28 millimeters per hour (mm/hr)

          -  Documented history of, or current, positive rheumatoid factor (RF) and/or anti-cyclic
             citrullinated peptide antibody (anti-CCP Ab) test

          -  Regular use of methotrexate (MTX) for at least 12 weeks and stable dose (10 to 25
             mg/week) for at least 8 weeks prior to baseline

          -  American College of Rheumatology (ACR) functional class I, II, or III

          -  Able and willing to inject tabalumab by themselves (or have an assistant who will
             inject tabalumab) and able and willing to complete all study procedures

          -  Able and willing to have blood drawn for pharmacokinetic (PK) sampling

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Use of oral corticosteroids at average daily doses of &gt;10 mg/day of prednisone or its
             equivalent within 6 weeks prior to baseline

          -  Injection of any parenteral (including intraarticular) corticosteroid within 6 weeks
             of baseline

          -  Have previously discontinued treatment with a biologic disease-modifying
             antirheumatic drug (DMARD) or a novel drug that interrupts cytokine signaling (eg,
             Janus kinase [JAK] inhibitors) due to insufficient efficacy

          -  Participants who had discontinued biologic DMARDS for reasons other than efficacy
             will not be excluded but must have done so prior to baseline

          -  Participants who discontinued a JAK inhibitor for lack of efficacy

          -  Participants who discontinued a JAK inhibitor for reasons other than efficacy will
             not be excluded, but must have done so prior to baseline for 21 days

          -  Previous severe reaction to any biologic therapy that, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, would pose an unacceptable risk to the participant if participating in
             the study

          -  Have had an inadequate response to treatment with 3 or more of the following DMARDs
             prescribed alone or in combination at approved doses for a minimum of 90 days:
             leflunomide, azathioprine, cyclosporine, and/or sulfasalazine

          -  Use of other DMARDs (eg, gold salts, cyclosporin, azathioprine, or any other
             immunosuppressives) other than MTX, hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, or
             sulfasalazine, or the use of a JAK inhibitor in the 8 weeks prior to baseline
