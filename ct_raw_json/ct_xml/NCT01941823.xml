  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Carnitine is a nutrient that is usually obtained from the diet, and it is needed for
      providing energy to the heart and the other muscles in the body. Carnitine is often given to
      adults and children with kidney failure who receive chronic dialysis three times a week,
      however there is no published information on how carnitine affects children receiving
      continuous dialysis (CRRT). We hypothesize that children receiving CRRT quickly become
      deficient in carnitine because it is continuously removed during dialysis. The aim of this
      study to determine if giving daily carnitine to children on CRRT will help improve their
      cardiac function, as assessed by echocardiography, in comparison to a control group.
