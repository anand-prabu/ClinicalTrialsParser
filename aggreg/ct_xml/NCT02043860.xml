    <textblock>
      In this phase I trial, patients with multiple myeloma will receive standard high dose
      melphalan with autologous stem cell rescue. In addition the pre-transplant conditioning will
      include targeted total marrow irradiation (TMI). This conventional 3+3 phase I trial will
      increase the dose of TMI until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is reached. Initial patients
      enrolled will receive the lowest possible dose of 3Gy. Maximum dose will be 12Gy.
