Efficacy will be determined by a reduction in the number of sweat glands from\n      baseline to 90-days post-treatment, as evidenced by histological analysis. Subject\n      Gravimetric results, Starch iodine results, and HDSS scores at all follow-ups compared to\n      baseline will also be analyzed as secondary outcomes."
