Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 1\n      and capecitabine orally twice daily on days 1-14. Treatment repeats every 21 days in the\n      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed for survival\n      status every 3 months upon completion of treatment.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients will be accrued for this study."
