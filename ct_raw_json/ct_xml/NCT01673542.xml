      Prospective Study, monocentric, controlled, randomized study. Evaluating the effectiveness
      of dermal analgesia provided by the application of Lidocaine and Prilocaine Cream 5% on the
      puncture site of axillary blocks.Our study includes 70 patients. Number of subjects required
      for a 50% difference with the standard deviation of the control group, a significance level
      of 5% for a 80% power, it takes 23 people per group. Objective power of 90% obtained with 35
      patients per group.

      The expected benefit is the reduction of pain at the skin puncture during the realization of
      BAX.

      Improving professional practice and quality care
