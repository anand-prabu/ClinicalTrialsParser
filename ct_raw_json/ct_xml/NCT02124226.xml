  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with chronic severe asthma (CSA) have a crippling disease and current available
      treatments are not satisfactory. Thus, management of CSA remains a major unmet need.
      Although the evidence from existing randomized controlled trials fails to support a definite
      role for immunomodulatory drugs in these patients due to major methodologic drawbacks,
      findings with low-dose methotrexate (MTX) are encouraging. However,  larger and well
      designed clinical trials are required to establish the beneficial role of MTX in CSA and for
      the detection of the key characteristics of those who are going to respond to this drug.

      This study will be the first multi-centre RCT investigating the role of an add-on
      immunological modifier as a clinically useful therapeutic strategy in patients with
      well-phenotyped chronic severe asthma. As such, this study does not overlap with any other
      research currently ongoing.

    <textblock>
      Patients will be recruited from the accessible asthmatic patients lists of tertiary referral
      centers. All patients will meet the stringent diagnostic criteria for CSA, including the
      requirement for the regular use of Step 5 medications (i.e. oral prednisone and/or
      omalizumab). The experimental design of the proposed study will take the form of a
      double-blind parallel-randomized placebo-controlled trial consisting of a total of eight
      visits including run-in and run-out periods. Patients will be randomly allocated to receive
      either MTX or matched placebo once a week as add-on therapy to their existing medication
      after run-in. Physiological, laboratory and clinical assessments will be measured regularly
      throughout the study and compared with baseline assessments.

      We expect that MTX will reduce Step 5 medications dosage in patients with CSA without
      compromising the overall disease control. Improvement in several indicators of asthma
      severity and control will be also investigated
