            "textblock": "When patients are dying they become unable to take oral medication and if they develop\n      symptoms (e.g. pain or agitation) they need to be given a subcutaneous injection of\n      medication. If they are at home this requires that a District Nurse is called and it can\n      take a long time (sometimes hours) for the Nurse to arrive. This can be a very stressful\n      time for the patient and family.\n\n      There are 2 drug preparations which could potentially be given by family members in the\n      home:\n\n      Nasal fentanyl (PecFent) Buccal midazolam (Epistatus) If these preparations helped symptoms\n      this would give much quicker symptom control for patients and might mean the District Nurse\n      visit was not needed.\n\n      In advance of a community based randomised trial of these modes of administration, it is\n      important to assess the feasibility of such an approach in terms of carer acceptability and\n      patient tolerability as well as determine appropriate sample sizes and sampling methods.\n      There are 2 work packages which would help assess feasibility of a community trial:\n\n        1. An open label randomised controlled trial comparing the use of PecFent with or without\n           Epistatus versus standard subcutaneous breakthrough medication for the management of\n           breakthrough pain (with or without agitation) in dying hospice patients who either\n           remain in the hospice or go home.\n\n        2. A qualitative interview study to capture the thoughts of relatives of these patients\n           about the use of these preparations."

The pilot is only recruiting 20 patients and\n             Gloucestershire has a only a very small percentage of people who are not English\n             speaking. It has been decided that it is not cost effective to fund translation for\n             this pilot although this information will have to be taken into account when planning\n             a larger study. We will capture information on the numbers of patients that may have\n             been excluded and the languages that might have been needed.\n\n          6.
