  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anxiety disorders are highly prevalent among those with substance use disorders, but the
      majority of addictions treatment centers provide little to no evidence-based treatment for
      anxiety disorders. Furthermore, tension reduction models suggest that treating anxiety
      should also improve substance use outcomes. This study is aimed at improving symptoms for
      people who have substance use and anxiety problems. The study is comparing regular Intensive
      Outpatient treatment for addiction to Intensive Outpatient treatment for addiction plus
      treatment for anxiety disorders. Clinicians at a community addictions clinic will
      participate by receiving training in delivering cognitive behavioral therapy for anxiety
      disorders and will deliver the treatment to the patient participants. They will also
      complete some questionnaires. Patient participants will be asked to complete a baseline
      assessment. Those who are eligible will be randomly assigned to one of the two treatment
      groups. Those who are assigned to addiction treatment as usual will continue their regular
      care at the Matrix Institute. Participants who are assigned to also receive the anxiety
      treatment will be asked to participate in 6, 90-min treatment sessions and an orientation
      session. All participants will be asked to complete post-treatment and follow-up
      assessments. The assessments should take approximately 1 hour, and the follow-up assessment
      will be completed 6 months after treatment is over. It is hypothesized that those who get
      the additional anxiety disorder treatment will show greater improvement in anxiety and
      substance use outcomes than those who get Intensive Outpatient Program without the anxiety
      disorder treatment.

    <description>Participants receive the adaptation of the Coordinated Anxiety Learning and Management (CALM) protocol that demonstrated effectiveness in a large primary care sample. CALM will be adapted for those with anxiety and substance use disorder comorbidity, and will consist of an orientation session and 6 group treatment sessions.
