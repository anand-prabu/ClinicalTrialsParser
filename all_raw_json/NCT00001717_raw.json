Subjects will be HIV infected individuals participating in or\n      being screened for participation in intramural HIV studies being conducted by the NIAID,\n      CCMD, and NCI.  Willing subjects will be recruited from studies that offer payment and\n      comparable studies that do not pay.  The primary methodology is an interview via a survey\n      schedule.  Use of the interview schedule will be preceded by a focus group of about 7-10\n      individuals and pretesting of the survey instrument.  Paid and unpaid subjects will be\n      compared with respect to motivations, understanding, willingness to withdraw, and\n      sociodemographics."
