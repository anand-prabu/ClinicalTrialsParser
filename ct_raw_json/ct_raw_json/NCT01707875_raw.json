Abnormal\n      development of the fetal brain may cause unilateral or bilateral ventriculomegaly. Fetal\n      cerebral ventricle measurement is one of the most  frequently used sonographic tool for the\n      evaluation of brain development. It is easier to evaluate and measure the distal cerebral\n      ventricle, and therefore data concerning the normal range of asymmetry and the normal\n      progress of the asymmetry are limited.\n\n      The objective of the study is  to follow up the incidental finding of fetal ventricle brain\n      asymmetry between 19-30 weeks of pregnancy."
