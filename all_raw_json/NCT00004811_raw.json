Determine levels of itraconazole in serum and other body fluids. III.  Assess the\n      course of illness during itraconazole therapy. IV.  Determine the dosage of itraconazole\n      that is safe and well tolerated by 80%-90% of patients and estimate the potential of this\n      dosage for use in future comparative trials."

Patients with progressive disease may be\n      treated at the next higher dose; there may be only 1 such increase.  Concurrent systemic and\n      topical antifungals are prohibited.\n\n      Patients are followed at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months."
