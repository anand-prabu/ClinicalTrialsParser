It is not yet\n      known if prolonged tamoxifen is more effective than shorter tamoxifen therapy following\n      curative treatment for breast cancer.\n\n      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying giving tamoxifen over a prolonged\n      period of time to see how well it works compared to giving tamoxifen over a shorter period\n      of time in treating patients who have had a breast tumor removed."

After about 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen,\n      recurrence-free patients are randomized to stop tamoxifen treatment immediately or to\n      continue tamoxifen treatment for at least 5 more years.\n\n      Patients are followed annually.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 20,000 patients will be accrued for this study."
