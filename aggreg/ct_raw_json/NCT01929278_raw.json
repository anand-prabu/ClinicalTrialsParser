This was a single-center, evaluator-blinded, randomized, placebo\n      (vehicle)-controlled phase 1 study to evaluate the phototoxic potential of CT Gel using 24\n      hour single applications of 3 sets of 3 study patches.  The study expected to enroll\n      approximately 40 healthy adult volunteers.  Each set of study patches consisted of a CT Gel\n      patch, a vehicle gel patch, and a blank patch (did not contain CT Gel or vehicle gel).\n\n      After concurrent 24-hour single applications of all 9 patches, 1 set of patches (set A) was\n      removed, and those sites were irradiated with 16 joules/cm2 of ultraviolet A light (UVA) and\n      0.75 minimal erythema dose (MED) with UVA/ultraviolet B light (UVB).  The second set of\n      patches (set B) was removed, and those sites were irradiated with 16 joules/cm2 of UVA, 0.75\n      MED with UVB/UVA, followed by 15 joules/cm2 of visible light (VIS).  The third set of\n      patches (set C) was then removed, and those sites served as a non irradiated control.\n      Inflammatory responses and other cutaneous effects were scored 1 hour after patch removal\n      and during follow-up visits at 24, 48, and 72 hours after patch removal."
