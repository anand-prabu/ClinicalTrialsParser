  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glaucoma is a major cause of blindness. The inability to predict a patient's IOP response to
      medications is a critical barrier for the clinician to consistently provide highly effective
      IOP-based treatments. Current trial-and error approaches to glaucoma management are
      inefficient and have not addressed this barrier as there are no predictive factors for drug
      response. Our long-term goal is to improve outcomes by identifying biomarkers and
      environmental factors that profile a patient at risk for glaucoma by age-of-onset, rate of
      disease progression, &quot;poor response&quot; to treatment, and large IOP fluctuation. Our purpose of
      this research project is to address this critical barrier by focusing on physiological
      factors that predict IOP response to drugs.

    <description>Eye pressure is a steady state quantitative trait that is measured in mm Hg.  Eye pressure is determined by the following physiological factors (units of measure): eye fluid or aqueous humor production (microliters/minute), aqueous humor outflow (microliters/minute), outflow resistance (microliters/minute/mm Hg) and venous pressure (mm Hg) of the eye.  All of these physiological factors will be determined under baseline condition and under glaucoma drug treatment.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Either gender.

          -  Any self-declared ethnoracial category.

          -  Greater than or equal to 40 years.

          -  Healthy eyes with the crystalline lens, without glaucoma (cup:disc ratio &lt; 0.8 both
             eyes; asymmetry of cup:disc ratio between eyes &lt; 0.2).

          -  Open angles.

          -  Ability to cooperate for aqueous humor dynamic studies.

          -  Nonprescription and prescription topical ophthalmic products and systemic medications
             other than those mentioned in the exclusion criteria will be allowed during the
             study.

          -  Contact lenses removed prior to topical fluorescein instillation, and not used until
             the end of each fluorophotometry session.

          -  Able to participate on site over the multi-visit study period.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Women who are pregnant due to IOP changes.

          -  Any form of glaucoma, including extremely narrow angle with complete or partial
             closure.

          -  Current use of any glaucoma medication, either topically or orally.

          -  Chronic or recurrent inflammatory eye disease.

          -  Ocular trauma within the past 6 months.

          -  Ocular infection or ocular inflammation in the past 3 months.

          -  Clinically significant retinal disease.

          -  Any abnormality preventing reliable fluorophotometry of either eye, such as corneal
             scarring or severe dry eye that results in punctate fluorescein staining of the
             cornea.

          -  Intraocular surgery within 6 months.

          -  Serious hypersensitivity to any components of the study medications or risk from
             treatment with glaucoma medications, such as severe asthma or emphysema.

          -  Subjects must be on a stable regimen for at least 30 days prior to the Visit 1
             regarding a chronic systemic medication that may affect IOP (i.e., sympathomimetic
             agents, beta-blockers, alpha-adrenergic agonists, alpha-adrenergic blockers, calcium
             channel blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, etc.).  Any change of
             such medication during the study period will result in exclusion.

          -  Use of any glucocorticoid by any route.  Subject must be washed out of the
             glucocorticoid for at least 2 weeks before study entry.
