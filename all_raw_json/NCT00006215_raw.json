Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.\n      Colony-stimulating factors such as filgrastim may increase the number of immune cells found\n      in bone marrow or peripheral blood and may help a person's immune system recover from the\n      side effects of chemotherapy.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy plus\n      filgrastim in treating patients who have stage IIIB or stage IV non-small cell lung cancer."

Determine the\n      toxicity of this regimen in these patients. III. Determine the overall survival and time to\n      tumor progression in patients treated with this regimen.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive vinorelbine IV over 6-10 minutes and\n      docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 1 and filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously daily on days 2-12\n      or until blood counts recover. Treatment continues every 2 weeks in the absence of disease\n      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year."
