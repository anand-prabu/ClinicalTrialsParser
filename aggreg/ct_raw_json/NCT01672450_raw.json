Note: Chronic use is\n             defined as requiring corticosteroids for greater than one month prior to enrollment\n             on study.  Corticosteroid use for less than 1 month prior to enrollment is allowed,\n             but use must stop prior to starting study treatment.\n\n          -  Clinically significant cardiovascular disease (e.g., uncontrolled hypertension [BP\n             >150/100], myocardial infarction or stroke within 6 months, unstable angina), New\n             York Heart Association (NYHA) Grade II or greater congestive heart failure, or\n             serious cardiac arrhythmia requiring medication\n\n          -  Currently active systemic infection\n\n          -  Known history of HIV infection or chronic hepatitis B or C.\n\n          -  The presence of any other medical or psychiatric disorder that, in the opinion of the\n             treating physician, would contraindicate the use of the drugs in this protocol or\n             place the subject at undue risk for treatment complications\n\n          -  Pregnancy or breast feeding\n\n          -  A history of a severe hypersensitivity reaction to ipilimumab or interleukin-2\n\n          -  Any reason why, in the opinion of the investigator, the patient should not\n             participate"
