  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are group of immune system disorders characterized by a
      chronic course with remission and relapses. Canada is one of the countries with the highest
      prevalence and incidence rates of IBD with 25% of patients present in children and
      adolescents.

      As with any chronic illness, IBD diagnosed early in life has a significant impact on the
      physical, emotional and social development of those affected. Consequently, it is logical to
      speculate that patients with IBD may not do as well in education levels or employment status
      attained compared to their peers without IBD. If this were the case, then interventions
      could begin in childhood to better prepare patients with IBD for the challenges of living
      with a chronic disease. Alternatively, if it is shown that they reach comparable social or
      employment milestones as adults compared to unaffected peers then this would be enormously
      reassuring to children and their parents.

      Properly designed studies to help in defining more appropriate interventions to these
      patients are needed.

      The proposed study includes circulating a survey to evaluate the functioning level of adult
      patients with IBD who were diagnosed during their childhood. The participants will be asked
      a series of questions regarding their highest level of educational achievement, the nature
      of their current employment, and their current marital status. The question format will
      parallel that of the Canadian Community Health Survey from which data from an age matched
      healthy adult Manitobans will be extracted and used as another control group. Responses will
      be analysed for any possible differences between these groups.

        The participant population will be comprised of adult patients who were initially
        diagnosed with IBD in childhood or adolescence (diagnosis was made &lt; age of 18 years) and
        who were followed by the Section of Pediatric Gastroenterology at the Winnipeg Children's
        Hospital from 1974 - 2009.

        Controls: age and sex-matched control group will be generated using the Canadian Community
        Health Survey (CCHS) 2012 (16) with access through the local Research and Data Centre
        (RDC).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients in whom the diagnosis of IBD was not fully established following the current
             North American Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition
             (NASPGHAN) guidelines for diagnosing IBD i.e. had clinical, radiologic and endoscopic
             evidence of IBD (2).

          -  Control participants with other chronic debilitating diseases (e.g. malignancy,
             rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, etc..) that may affect quality of life and
