  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of the Lumbar Image Reporting with Epidemiology (LIRE) is to perform a
      large, pragmatic, cluster randomized controlled trial to determine the effectiveness of a
      simple, inexpensive and easy to deploy intervention - insertion of epidemiological
      benchmarks into lumbar spine imaging reports - at reducing subsequent tests and treatments.
       The investigator's main hypothesis is that for patients referred from primary care
      providers, inserting epidemiological evidence in lumbar spine imaging reports will reduce
      subsequent diagnostic and therapeutic interventions, including cross-sectional imaging
      (MR/CT), opioid prescriptions, spinal injections and surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The long-term public health significance is that a simple, inexpensive intervention has the
      potential to substantially reduce unnecessary and expensive care for back pain patients.
      Importantly, this approach could be applied to a wide range of other conditions and other
      diagnostic tests (e.g. other imaging tests, laboratory tests, genetic testing). If this
      study is positive, adding epidemiologic benchmarks to diagnostic test reporting could become
      the dominant paradigm for communicating all diagnostic information.

      To test this hypothesis, the investigators propose to conduct a pragmatic cluster,
      randomized controlled trial, randomly assigning primary care clinics at four large health
      systems to receive either standard lumbar spine imaging reports or reports containing
      epidemiological benchmarks for common imaging findings. The investigators will use a novel
      stepped wedge randomization scheme that temporally randomizes sites, allowing within-site
      before/after comparisons in addition to between-site comparisons, while assuring that all
      sites will eventually receive the intervention. The primary outcome will be a metric of
      back-related intervention intensity. The primary analysis will occur at the clinic level and
      not the patient level.

      This pragmatic trial will demonstrate both the feasibility of randomly assigning clinics
      within large health systems as well as the feasibility of passively collecting outcomes data
      up to two years after enrollment using the robust electronic medical records systems
      available at each health system.
