The first method, microfracture, is the standard of care and\n      is routinely used to recruit cells from the subchondral bone marrow to the site of cartilage\n      loss. The second method is the application of adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) to the\n      defect site. In theory, ADSCs on a collagen scaffold should enable the delivery of more\n      specific progenitor cells to the site of injury, resulting in better regeneration and\n      integration of articular cartilage at the site of a defect as compared to the microfracture\n      method."

Fat will be collected in a sterile Aquavage Collection System\n      (AV1200, MD Resources, Livermore, CA) and kept sealed until processing. Fat will then\n      immediately be processed in the Emcyte Secquire 2 Concentrating Device (Emcyte Corporation,\n      Fort Myers, FL, USA) to separate a population of ADSCs. This system concentrates an average\n      of 5 x 105 cells/ml 15. All specimens will be processed using routine sterile procedures\n      within the operating room; cells destined for implantation will not leave the operating\n      room. Peripheral venipuncture (30cc draw) will also be performed for preparation of\n      platelet-poor plasma (PPP) fibrin clot using the Emcyte ProPlaz system (Emcyte Corporation,\n      Fort Myers, FL, USA). Concurrently, patients will undergo arthroscopy and similar\n      preparation of the chondral defect and removal of the calcified cartilage layer. However, no\n      puncture of the subchondral bone will be performed. A layer of autologous fibrin glue will\n      be created using PPP from the Emcyte ProPlaz system (Emcyte Corporation, Fort Myers, FL,\n      USA) activated with calcium chloride. The fibrin glue will be placed at the base of the\n      defect to seal off any bleeding from the subchondral plate followed by the application of\n      the acellular dermal matrix (Allopatch HD, MTF Corporation, Edison, NJ, USA)and ADSCs. An\n      additional layer of autologous PPP will be applied over the cells and matrix. No additional\n      fixation will be applied. The matrix and cells will be recessed below the articular surface\n      by an average of 1mm.\n\n      They will then complete outcome questionnaires and additional MRI scans at 6, 12, and 24\n      months post-operatively."
