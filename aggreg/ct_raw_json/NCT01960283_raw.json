The quality of life of patients is usually strongly spoiled. The\n      gold standard treatment consist of anti-H1 molecules. In severe cases, which are refractory\n      to anti-H1, few therapeutic alternatives exist. Two studies have shown a benefit when adding\n      to anti-H1, montelukast, anti-leukotriene, or cyclosporine. Methotrexate, which is another\n      immunosuppressive drug, cheap and commonly prescribed by dermatologists, has been efficient\n      in severe chronic urticaria, in an open study and in few case reports.\n\n      Methotrexate, an anti-metabolite drug which inhibits dihydrofolate reductase, is indicated\n      in hematologic malignancies and in autoimmune diseases. It may be given by oral or\n      parenteral administration, once a week, and requires regular monitoring of renal and hepatic\n      function, and blood count."
