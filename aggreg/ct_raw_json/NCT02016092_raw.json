            "textblock": "There are approximately one million Americans who live with Parkinson's disease with 50,000\n      new cases per year and this rate is expected to rise with an aging population. The\n      underlying pathophysiology and disease understanding of PD still remains elusive due to a\n      combination of disease complexity and lack of predictive capability of existing models.\n\n      The Berg Interrogative Biology\u2122 discovery platform has demonstrated a unique capability in\n      producing drug targets and biomarkers that truly represent a disease phenotype. It has been\n      able to catalyze molecules now in late stage clinical trials in cancer and many pre-clinical\n      candidate therapeutics and biomarkers in endocrinology and central nervous system (CNS)\n      diseases. The platform is able to decipher normal versus disease signatures by integration\n      of data sets from the genome, metabolome, proteome, and lipidome in an agnostic manner that\n      is subjected to Bayesian Artificial Intelligence informatics. The resulting nodes are then\n      put back into wet-lab validation before proceeding to proof-of-principle pre-clinical\n      testing.\n\n      By utilizing clinical data and specimens obtained by the medical specialists at The\n      Parkinson's Institute, along with Berg's Interrogative Biology\u2122, this study aims to discover\n      a disease biomarker enabling the creation of a diagnostic test for Parkinson's disease."
