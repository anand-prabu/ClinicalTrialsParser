Compare the overall survival, progression free survival, symptomatic\n      progression free survival, and one year survival of patients with metastatic or recurrent\n      non-small cell lung cancer treated with prinomastat (AG3340) or placebo in combination with\n      gemcitabine and cisplatin. II. Compare the disease response and duration of response in\n      these patients on these regimens. III. Compare the quality of life of these patients on\n      these regimens. IV. Evaluate the safety of these regimens in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, multicenter study. Patients\n      receive oral prinomastat or placebo twice daily beginning on day 1, followed by gemcitabine\n      IV on days 1 and 8 and cisplatin IV on day 1. Courses repeat every 3 weeks.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 420 patients will be accrued for this study."
