  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: COPD exacerbations add considerably to patients' burden because they: (1) cause
      frequent hospital admissions and relapses or readmissions, (2) contribute directly to the
      death of many patients, either during hospitalization or shortly thereafter, (3) cause
      patients significant stress, prolonged physical discomfort, disability and dramatically
      reduced quality of life, (4) consume the majority of the resources available to manage this
      chronic condition, (5) frequently progress to a severe stage warranting hospitalization
      before any abortive treatment is instituted, and (6) may hasten the progressive loss of lung
      function, a steady decline that is a cardinal feature of COPD itself. Hence, investigations
      of new therapies to treat COPD patients who are hospitalized with a severe exacerbation are
      desperately needed.

      Objective: To test the feasibility of roflumilast to decrease all cause readmission and
      mortality 180 days after hospitalization for acute COPD exacerbation.

      Methods: Parallel-group, prospective, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial of
      roflumilast 500 ug daily vs. placebo in approximately 100 hospitalized AECOPD patients.
      Inclusion Criteria. Primary diagnosis of AECOPD; admission to the hospital &lt;12 hours;
      patient age &gt;40, &lt; 80 years old; cigarette smoking &gt; 10 pack-years. Exclusion Criteria.
      Prior diagnosis or high suspicion for asthma; pulmonary edema, pneumonia, interstitial lung
      disease or significant bronchiectasis; intubated and mechanically ventilated at the time of
      evaluation; active liver disease, or transaminase elevations (&gt; 3xULN); history of heavy
      ethanol use; history of suicidal behavior ≤ 2 years or suicidal ideation ≤ 6 months prior to
      enrollment; pregnant or lactating females. Those on the following excluded medications: P450
      inducers and CYP3A4 inhibitors or dual inhibitors that inhibit both CYP3A4 and CYP1A2
      simultaneously
