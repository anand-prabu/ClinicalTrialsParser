            "textblock": "One postoperative complication following unilateral or bilateral total knee replacement is\n      thrombosis (blood clot formation). In this prospective, double-blinded randomized controlled\n      clinical trial, researchers are investigating the effect of steroids on biochemical markers\n      of thrombosis. Furthermore, elevated cellular markers of thrombosis (specifically IL-6) have\n      been linked to postoperative depression following total knee replacement surgery. Hence the\n      investigators are also checking if use of hydrocortisone, a steroid, may help reduce the\n      incidence of postoperative depression.\n\n      Other studies have shown that surgery causes some reaction in the body that is consistent\n      with inflammation.  When the inflammation is extensive, it may affect different parts of the\n      body. It may also lead to clotting disorders and result in blood clots. In a previous study\n      by this principal investigator (see reference 22, \"Use of low-dose steroids in decreasing\n      cytokine release during bilateral total knee replacement\"), hydrocortisone was administered\n      over 24 hours following surgery to patients who underwent bilateral total knee replacements.\n      The investigator found lower levels of cellular markers consistent with inflammation\n      (specifically the protein, IL-6). Steroid use also showed additional benefits, such as\n      decreased pain and better range of motion at the knee.\n\n      In this study, investigators recruit patients undergoing total knee replacement surgery.\n      Patients are randomized to receive three 100 mg doses of hydrocortisone or three doses of a\n      saline placebo. In addition to analyzing patients' blood samples for hydrocortisone's effect\n      on clotting factors (i.e. IL-6), investigators record patients' pain scores and patients'\n      oral analgesic use. To assess patients' well-being, patients are contacted one month and 3\n      months following their surgeries and administered the Patient Health Questionnaire (see\n      reference 23, \"The PHQ-9: validity of a brief depression severity measure.\")"
