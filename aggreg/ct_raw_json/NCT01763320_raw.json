            "textblock": "SAMMPRIS (Stenting vs. Aggressive Medical Management for Preventing Recurrent Stroke in\n      Intracranial Stenosis) hasn't received the expected results; however, it does not mean that\n      clinical exploration on intracranial treatment come to a full stop. On the contrary, a\n      discrepancy on reported data between multi-centre RCT and most single center studies urges\n      us for thorough investigation in future.\n\n      CASSISS is an investigator-initiated, government-funded RCT that will determine whether\n      intracranial stenting and best medical therapy is superior to aggressive medical therapy\n      alone for preventing stroke during a mean follow-up of three years in patients with\n      symptomatic stenosis of a major intracranial artery (MCA, carotid, vertebral, basilar). This\n      trial was launched by Xuanwu Hospital, Capital University of Medical Science, with 10\n      collaborators participating. Enrollment will begin in 2013, and it aims to have a sample\n      size of 520 subjects (PTAS, 260; medication, 260) in 3 years. The trial is scheduled to\n      complete in 2015.\n\n      SAMMPRIS is flawed with defect in design, heterogeneity in experience and credentials of\n      operators and high rate of complication; some questions have been raised, and remained\n      resolved. CASSISS has been modified based on SAMMPRIS in order to acquire the data for\n      China:\n\n      Technique, experience, and credential of the operators are closely related with\n      perioperative complications in PTAS. The investigators select 10 representatives from 40\n      large-scale medical centers for participation on the basis of geographical distribution. All\n      the participants are ranked as top in China. They have the most experienced surgeons or\n      interventionist in China, and are fully qualified for this trial. This will guarantee the\n      success and safety of technique, maintain the continuity of operator's experience, and make\n      the complication rate as low as possible.\n\n      Pre-CASSISS registry trial:\n\n      A registry pilot trial will be performed prior to CASSISS. It aims to test the credentialing\n      of interventionists and participating centers. As for the candidate centers, the following\n      aspects will be considered: PTAS experiences, peri-operative complications, and the number\n      of accumulated PTAS cases in each center. Centers are required to have a team consisting of\n      a neurologist, an interventionist, a neurosurgeon, and a research coordinator. All the\n      centers involved are required to to perform a competitive registration study of recruiting a\n      consecutive 100 PTAS as a pool together as a registration trial within duration of 6 months.\n      Certification was achieved by participating centers, whose clinical results are audited by\n      means of a validated selection process documenting that they have performed more than 5\n      procedures within this period and that the rates of complications (morbidity and mortality)\n      are less than 15%. Those who will not satisfy the certification criterion will be excluded\n      from the final trial.\n\n      The 3rd-party company is employed to provide trial design, management, supervision, and\n      quality control service.\n\n      The 30-day rate of stroke or death associated with stenting in the SAMMPRIS trial (14.7%) is\n      nearly 2.5 times as high as CREST, one third of which is symptomatic intracranial\n      hemorrhage. It was thought because of reperfusion hemorrhage since the median time from\n      qualifying event to randomization in SAMMPRIS is one week only. The investigators modify one\n      of inclusion criteria that all the recruited patients routinely undergo MRI plus DWI\n      (diffusion-weighted imaging) scans to exclude any possible new lesions. In case of new\n      infarction identified on DWI (diffusion-weighted imaging) or qualifying event confirmed by\n      neurologist, the patient will be rescheduled for randomization one month later.\n\n      SAMMPRIS was stopped ahead of schedule due to the safety concern. More than half of the PTAS\n      patients were lost for follow-up at 1 year, and the remaining were followed up with a mean\n      duration less than 1 year. It leaves the question of long-time follow-up data open. Base on\n      SAMMPRIS, the investigators' trial will conduct a systematic follow-up system. Upon\n      recruitment, all the patients' neurological and imaging examination will be determined at\n      baseline, 1 week, 1 month, 1 year, and 2 year after surgery, respectively."
