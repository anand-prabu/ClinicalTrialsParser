Then, the patients will be followed with clinical, laboratory\n      and microbiological assessments every four months for 1 year.\n\n      Patients will be deblinded at the end of the treatment trial follow-up (1 year after the\n      recruitment).\n\n      Patients who will develop a true GAS infection or who otherwise need to be prescribed\n      antibiotics for any clinical reason during the follow-up will be withdrawn from the study\n      and immediately deblinded. Data of such patients would, however, remain part of the study\n      analyses, following the intention-to-treat principle."

            "textblock": "Following the few studies performed on this topic, children affected by tic disorder show a\n      rate of Group A Streptococcus (GAS) colonization similar or slightly higher than that\n      reported in the normal population.\n\n      However, several studies have documented high rates of elevated anti-streptolysin O titers\n      (ASOT) in children affected by tic disorders. One study reported a significantly higher ASOT\n      in 150 children with tics compared to 150 healthy children, documenting a direct\n      relationship between ASOT and tic severity. In this study, however, throat swab culture\n      analyses on a subsample of patients failed to detect a predominant GAS serotype associated\n      with tics. An American cohort of 81 patients with TS also exhibited higher ASOT than\n      age-matched healthy volunteers and a mixed group of patients with autoimmune diseases.\n      Increased ASOT, anti-deoxyribonuclease B (DNAse B), anti- streptococcal M12 and M19 titres\n      were also observed in a smaller German sample of patients with TS. In a British cohort of\n      100 patients with TS (50% children), ASOT was raised in 64% of children and in 68% of adults\n      with TS; this was significantly higher than in neurological disease and healthy control\n      subjects. Two other reports from British and Italian cohorts confirmed these findings.\n      However, a subsequent study failed to find a significant association with ASOT and\n      anti-DNAse B titres using the same cross-sectional approach. More recently, a study on a\n      large service-based cohort of TS patients confirmed the significant elevated rate of the\n      high ASOT, but evidenced also that, on prospective analysis, ASOT were persistently elevated\n      in 57% of patients with TS. Moreover, in tic patients the enhanced immune response is not\n      limited to ASOT but it involves a broad range of GAS antigens.\n\n      Taken together, these observations lead to hypothesize that TS patients colonized by GAS are\n      not merely carriers and that this colonization may promote a sustained anti-streptococcal\n      immune response contributing to the persistence of tic symptoms.\n\n      If this hypothesis is true, the antibiotic treatment of GAS colonization in patients\n      affected by a chronic tic disorder could modify their symptoms in term of severity and\n      number of exacerbations.\n\n      Up to now, only tic patients diagnosed as Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders\n      Associated with Streptococcal infection (PANDAS) underwent a controlled antibiotic\n      treatment: two trials, aimed to study the efficacy of different preventive regimens on\n      number of tic exacerbations, obtained however mixed results, mainly due to poor compliance.\n\n      Investigators here designed a placebo-controlled trial with amoxicilline/clavulanic acid in\n      tic patients showing GAS colonization. This drug is the first line therapy for streptococcal\n      pharyngo-tonsillitis. Some previous studies have shown a superiority of amoxicillin versus\n      penicillin in the treatment of GAS infections. A 10-day course of amoxicillin is considered\n      sufficient and efficient in the treatment of GAS tonsillo-pharyngitis. Moreover, oral\n      amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and oral clindamycin for 10 days achieved comparable rates of\n      bacteriologic eradication at 12 days and 3 months. Furthermore, amoxicilline/clavulanic acid\n      has been demonstrated to be efficacious in the treatment of GAS colonization. A few\n      antibiotic regimens - evaluated prospectively in randomized, controlled trials- have\n      demonstrated efficacy for termination of GAS carriage: among these, a regimen of 10 days of\n      amoxicillin/ clavulanic acid was more effective than repeat penicillin in patients with\n      treatment failure. Thus, the 10-days regimen of amoxicilline/clavulanic acid should be\n      efficient in GAS eradication and, on the other hand, the shortness of the treatment should\n      avert problems in patient's compliance."
