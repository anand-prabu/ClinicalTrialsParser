            "textblock": "Obesity is perhaps the most urgent public health crisis in pediatrics. Thus, managing\n      childhood obesity is a top priority among pediatricians in primary care settings. However,\n      effective treatment typically is multidisciplinary, and most practices currently do not have\n      the infrastructure for coordinating integrated care. With the advent of the Affordable Care\n      Act (ACA), innovative systems for building multidisciplinary teams to provide integrated\n      care through a patient-centered medical home will be at a strategic advantage. The use of\n      electronic technologies for delivering health-related information or services, known as\n      telehealth, is an innovation with the potential to streamline integrated care and transform\n      interventions for chronic diseases. We propose a pilot study to evaluate telehealth for\n      treating pediatric obesity in collaboration with a community practice (Wareham Pediatrics).\n\n      Patients aged 10 to 17 years who participate in the telehealth intervention study (N=40)\n      will be randomly assigned to an \"immediate\" intervention group or a \"wait list\" control\n      group. Subjects in the \"immediate\" intervention group will begin the 6-month telehealth\n      intervention at the time of enrollment in the study and then receive general patient/family\n      counseling from their primary care providers (PCPs) at routine office visits during a\n      6-month follow-up period. Those in the \"wait list\" control group will receive general\n      patient/family counseling from their PCPs for 6 months followed by the telehealth\n      intervention for 6 months. Thus, the total duration of participation in the study for each\n      subject will be 12 months. The telehealth intervention will include dietary, physical\n      activity, and behavioral management counseling provided by videoconferencing from the OWL\n      clinical providers at Boston Children's Hospital to children in their homes, or at a\n      telehealth station at Wareham Pediatrics."
