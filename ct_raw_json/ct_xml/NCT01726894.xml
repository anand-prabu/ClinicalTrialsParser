        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically proven prostate cancer, Gleason Score &lt;/=7

          -  An anterior visible lesion on mpMRI, that is accessible to IRE treatment

          -  Transperineal prostate biopsies (template mapping and/or limited     targeted)
             correlating with clinically significant lesion in the area of the MR-visible lesion
             (within 2 Barzell zones)

          -  Absence of clinically significant disease outside of the planned treatment zone, from
             histopathology and/or mpMRI findings

          -  Stage radiologicalT1-T2cN0M0 disease, as determined by local guidelines

          -  Serum PSA &lt;/=15 ng/ml

          -  Life expectancy of &gt;/= 10 years

          -  Signed informed consent by patient

          -  An understanding of the English language sufficient to understand written and verbal
             information about the trial and consent process

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Men who have had previous radiation therapy

          -  Men who have had androgen suppression/hormone treatment within the previous 12 months
             for their prostate cancer

          -  Men with evidence of metastatic disease or nodal disease outside the prostate on bone
             scan or cross-sectional imaging

          -  Men with a non-visible tumour on mpMRI

          -  Men with an inability to tolerate a transrectal ultrasound

          -  Men with latex allergies

          -  Men who have undergone prior significant rectal surgery preventing insertion of the
             TRUS probe (decided on the type of surgery in individual cases)

          -  Men who have had previous IRE, HIFU, cryosurgery, thermal or microwave therapy to the
             prostate.

          -  Men who have undergone a Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP) for
             symptomatic lower urinary tract symptoms within 6 months. These patients may be
             included within the trial if deferred from consenting and screening until at least 6
             months following the TURP.

          -  Men not fit for major surgery as assessed by a Consultant Anaesthetist

          -  Men unable to have pelvic MRI scanning (severe claustrophobia, permanent cardiac
             pacemaker, metallic implant etc likely to contribute significant artefact to images)

          -  Presence of metal implants/stents in the urethra

          -  Men with renal impairment with a GFR of &lt;35ml/min (unable to tolerate Gadolinium
             dynamic contrast enhanced MRI).
