      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of mebendazole compared
      with placebo in pediatric participants with Helminth infections.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a double-blind (neither physician nor participant knows the treatment that the
      participant receives), randomized (the study drug is assigned by chance), multi-center,
      parallel-group study (each group of participants will be treated at the same time) to
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of mebendazole (a drug currently being investigated for
      Helminth gastrointestinal infections) compared with placebo (an inactive substance that is
      compared with a drug to test whether the drug has a real effect in a clinical trial) in
      children (including pre-school and school-aged children) with Helminth infections.  The
      study will consist of 3 phases: a screening phase, a double-blind treatment phase, and a
      post-treatment (or follow-up) phase.  A pharmacokinetic (explores what a drug does to the
      body) open-label substudy (asks a separate research question from the parent study while
      using the same participant population but does not contribute to the parent study's
      objectives) will be included in the parent study to measure the level of mebendazole in the
      blood. Safety assessments will be performed throughout the study. Each participant will take
      part in the study for approximately 30 days.

    <description>Mebendazole will be administered as a single-dose 500 mg chewable tablet. For children 1 year to &lt;36 months of age, the tablet will be placed in a teaspoon and bottled water will be poured into the remaining volume of the teaspoon. The tablet will then be allowed to absorb all water (absorption time has been observed to take less than 1 minute) to become a soft semi-solid mass without any hard particles. This semi-solid form can then be easily ingested by the child.</description>
