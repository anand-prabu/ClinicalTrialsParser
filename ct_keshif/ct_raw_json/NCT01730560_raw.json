            "textblock": "Cortical Visual Field Defects (CFVD) are common after acquired brain injury. They often\n      cause problems with reading and visual exploration which impact on patients' quality of\n      life. Apart from the substitutive method that uses prisms directly placed on glasses, two\n      main rehabilitative methods have been explored previously: one restorative and one\n      compensatory. The most effective methods seem to be based on compensatory training paradigms\n      that target eye movements. They rely on voluntary mass-practice that induces changes in\n      exploratory saccadic behaviour, particularly into the blind hemifield. Previous studies\n      using this method have shown changes in visual scanning patterns but with only a marginal\n      profit in terms of functional benefit.\n\n      In the present study, the investigators developed a new approach to the compensatory visual\n      field training based solely on a bottom-up mechanism. It does not require the patients'\n      ability to voluntarily maintain attention oriented to the affected field, which may be\n      difficult for brain-damaged patients. As previously reported in other pathological contexts\n      (e.g. use of prism adaptation or sensory stimulation in neglect patients), bypassing\n      voluntary and conscious implication of the patient can produce improvements by a more\n      automatic process.\n\n      The investigators hypotheses are: 1) that a novel ramp-step search paradigm can be used by\n      hemianopic patients to automatically improve targeted eye movements into their blind visual\n      field; and 2) that this will lead to behavioural improvements on ecologically valid tests of\n      visual search."

Subjects  are asked to pursue the stimulus (ramp phase) and then saccade to find its location when it suddenly jumps (step phase). The stimulus is an open spinning circle. At the end of each movement, the gap can be located at the top or at the bottom, and patients are asked to indicate this location by pushing the response button as quickly as possible.\nThe starting point will alternate between left and right. The training task includes 3 sessions with 100 movements each. Reaction Times and errors will be monitored online to ensure that the patient performs the task correctly.\nEach treatment phase has the same pattern:\ntwo visits in pre-tests evaluation (V1 and V2),\none visit to perform treatment (A or B) and to assess immediate and 2h post-effects (V3),\ntwo visits after treatment (V4 at one week and V5 at one month).",
