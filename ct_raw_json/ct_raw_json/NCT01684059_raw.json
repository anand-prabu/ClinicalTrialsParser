            "textblock": "The ability of spermatozoa to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) has been respected since\n      the 1940's. Oxidative stress limits the functional competence of mammalian spermatozoa via\n      lipid peroxidation, the induction of oxidative DNA damage and the formation of protein\n      adducts. Nitric oxide (NO) is a free radical generated from the oxidation of L-arginine to\n      L-citrulline by reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)-dependent NO\n      synthases. Several studies suggest that the overproduction of this free radical and the\n      subsequent excessive exposure to oxidative conditions have a potential pathogenetic\n      implication, which due to the reduction of sperm motility. The present study was conducted\n      to study the effect of Zn supplementation on the levels of NO synthase and arginase in semen\n      of patients with asthenozoospmia."

These studies reported that NO may react with\n      superoxide or hydrogen peroxide, resulting in the production of peroxinitrite, hydroxyl\n      radical, or singlet oxygen, which cause oxidation of sperm membrane lipids and thiol\n      proteins. NO also may inhibit cellular respiration by nitro-sylation of heme in\n      mitochondrial enzymes, aconitase, and glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase, leading to a\n      reduction of adenosine triphosphate and that is due to loss of motility of spermatozoa."
