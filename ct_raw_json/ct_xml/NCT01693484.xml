  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers in the Orthopaedic surgery department at LSU Medical Center-Shreveport hope to
      learn if patterns of blood-flow around the incision site of patients undergoing surgery for
      heel-bone fractures can help predict whether complications will arise after a specific type
      of operation.The goals of this research study are to effectively answer as many of the
      following research questions as possible:

        1. Can a drug normally used to evaluate adequate blood flow in plastic surgery and tissue
           transfer be used to identify altered patterns of blood flow at the operative site of
           Calcaneus fractures, when compared to the uninjured extremity?

        2. Are changes in blood flow identifiable at the operative site post operatively?

        3. Are there certain patterns of blood flow present preoperatively or postoperatively that
           can predict wound complication?

        4. Can certain patterns of blood flow predict the location of slough or dehiscence after
           surgery?

        5. Does the incision site and its proximity to specific patterns of blood flow possibly
           predict wound complication?

      The hypothesis is that the study drug will show a correlation between certain patterns of
      blood flow and whatever post-operative complications may arise.

      Fractures of the calcaneus comprise 2% of all adult fractures. These fractures make up 60%
      of all tarsal injuries, the majority of which are closed, displaced intra-articular
      fractures. Despite the injury's prevalence, dispute over the appropriate method of treatment
      remains ongoing. Several studies have shown that an open, surgical approach is superior to
      either a non-surgical or percutaneous approach with regard to restoring proper alignment and
      structure of the hindfoot, depending on the severity of the displacement, and provided that
      certain patient conditions do not preclude surgery. Adequately restoring hindfoot structure
      is paramount to good clinical outcome; not only is proper alignment integral for fully
      recovering physiological functionality, but also in preventing further complications such as
      subtalar arthritis that present commonly in malunited calcaneal fractures.

      Though literature may show that open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) techniques
      provide a better long term outcome of severely displaced intra-articular fractures,
      proponents of both non surgical and percutaneous approaches argue that the superiority of
      the outcome may be mitigated by the fact that open surgical procedures are laden post
      operatively with numerous wound complications. These complications include, but are not
      limited to, both deep and superficial infections resulting in slough, dehiscence, necrosis,
      and erythema in and around the surgical site. Managing infections of the surrounding soft
      tissue and vasculature of the calcaneus following operative treatment indeed seems to
      present a great challenge to treating physicians, with wound healing complications present
      in 2-25% of cases.

      A necessity for surgical wound repair is adequately vascularized tissue, which can be
      difficult to come by during closure of the wound due to the undermining and displacement of
      soft tissue during surgery. Sufficiently perfused soft tissue can also be difficult to
      differentiate from tissues that are inadequately vascular based on traditional clinical
      criteria such as color, warmth, and dermal bleeding. The degree of this avascularity can
      depend on many factors relating to the patient, necessitating studies be conducted
      identifying what factors place a prospective patient at a higher risk for developing wound
      healing problems post operatively. Studies of this nature thus far have noted that factors
      such as age, sex, height, weight, Bohler's angle, tobacco usage, and pre-existing conditions
      such as diabetes, vascular disease, and immune deficiencies may be indicative of increased
      likelihood for developing post surgical complications. Another risk factor of particular
      interest is the timing of surgery after the incidence of injury. Current literature
      regarding treatment of hindfoot injuries shows a moderate degree of uniformity, advocating a
      delay in operative measures until the soft tissue swelling around the injury has had time to
      subside: a window of approximately 7-14 days after injury. Additionally, in their
      investigation of Bohler's angle as a predictor for wound healing complications, Shuler and
      colleagues noted the pre and post operative Bohler's angle differential to be a significant
      predictor of developing infections, postulating that the increase in heel height during
      surgery may concomitantly increase soft tissue tension substantially enough to disrupt
      proper blood supply to the surgical site during healing.  These findings lend tremendous
      support to the idea that blood perfusion in soft tissue plays a significant role in
      predicting wound healing complications. However, to our knowledge, the use of angiography to
      correlate pre and post operative soft tissue perfusion patterns with post operative
      complication in patients undergoing ORIF of fractured calcanei has never been investigated.

      Indocyanine green (ICG) angiography has been utilized in a myriad of other fields of
      medicine to evaluate perfusion in different tissues. It has been used in cardiac surgery to
      asses bypass patency, in microsurgery to assist in free tissue transfers, and in plastic
      surgery to assess areas of future necrosis during mastectomy operations. Recently, ICG
      angiography has been used in general surgery to detect ischemic tissues and aid surgeons in
      determining the appropriate extent of debridement necessary prior to wound closure in
      laparotomy procedures. Though its utility in other disciplines of medicine are currently
      being further developed and understood, the implications of ICG angiography in orthopaedic
      surgery have gone unrecognized. We postulate that soft-tissue perfusion patterns elucidated
      by ICG angiography in the heels of patients that have incurred calcaneal fractures may be
      predictive of wound healing complications that develop after surgery.  This information
      could allow surgeons to greatly reduce the complication rate of open reduction procedures on
      calcaneus fractures by early utilization of appropriate, patient specific prophylactic
      measures, and could provide an additional contraindication to this operation for patients
      whom otherwise were not aware they are at an elevated risk.
