The 10 patient treatment modules will incorporate exercise, behavioral activation, thought monitoring and restructuring, relaxation training, worry control, and sleep hygiene.  The four caregiver educational modules will provide caregivers with the skills needed to facilitate patients' practice of treatment techniques learned in session.  For example, caregivers will be taught to help patients identify negative thoughts and replace them with more balanced alternatives and will be given tools to assist patients complete therapy goals (i.e., exercise, socializing)."

We will\n      pilot-test the guided self-help treatment on 20 people with PD and their caregivers.  The\n      manual will be revised based on participant feedback.  Several feasibility measures\n      regarding the guided self-help program (i.e., recruitment, retention, enjoyment,\n      helpfulness, adherence) will also be assessed.  Moreover, preliminary estimates of effect\n      size for this guided self-help program will be calculated and used in future research. We\n      hypothesize that  people with PD will report decreases in depression, anxiety, and negative\n      thoughts and improvements in quality life and sleep and that caregivers will report\n      decreases in burden after participating in the guided self-help program"
