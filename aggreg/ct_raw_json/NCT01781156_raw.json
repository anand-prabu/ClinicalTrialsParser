Elevated\n      cardiac biomarkers have been observed in patients with various degrees of renal failure.\n      However, the majority of those CKD patients are in the absence of acute coronary syndrome.\n      So far, it is still unclear the mechanisms of the increased biomarkers in CKD patients.\n      Meanwhile, hyperphosphatemia is one of the major features of CKD, particularly of end stage\n      renal disease(ESRD). Lots of evidences have shown that high levels of serum phosphorus and\n      an elevation of the serum calcium \u00d7 phosphorus product can lead to cardiovascular\n      calcifications and subsequent cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with CKD.it\n      is tempting to hypothesize that hyperphosphatemia may be responsible for the rise of cardiac\n      biomarkers in CKD patients.So we use one phosphate binder to reduce phosphorus absorption in\n      hemodialysis patients for one year and observe the change of cardiac biomarkers of those\n      patients."
