      The primary objectives of this study are to assess the safety profile, characterize
      pharmacokinetics (PK) and determine the dosing schedule, maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and
      the recommended phase two dose (RPTD) of ABT-199 when administered in subjects with relapsed
      /refactory multiple myeloma who are receiving bortezomib and dexamethasone as their standard
      therapy.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance score less than or equal to 1

          -  Diagnosis of multiple myeloma previously treated with at least 1 prior line of
             therapy (dose escalation only) or less than 4 separate lines of therapy (Safety
             Expansion only) including a proteasome inhibitor and an IMiD(r) or immunomodulatory
             agent (e.g., thalidomide, lenalidomide).  Induction therapy and following stem cell
             transplant are considered a single line of therapy.

          -  Measurable disease at Screening: Serum monoclonal protein greater than or equal to 1
             g by protein electrophoresis, or greater than or equal to 200 mg monoclonal protein
             in the urine on 24-hr electrophoresis, or serum immunoglobulin free light chain
             greater than or equal to 10 mg/dL and abnormal serum immunoglobulin kappa to lambda
             free light chain ratio.

          -  Subject has a history of autologous or allogenic stem cell transplant, have adequate
             bone marrow independent of any growth factor support, and have recovered from any
             transplant related toxicity(s); and either greater than 100 days post-autologous
             transplant (prior to first dose of study drug) or greater than or equal to 6 months
             post-allogenic transplant (prior to first dose of study drug) and not have active
             graft-versus-host disease (i.e., requiring treatment).

          -  Subject must have adequate coagulation, renal, and hepatic function, per laboratory
             reference range at Screening.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Exhibits evidence of other clinically significant uncontrolled condition(s),
             including, but not limited to: uncontrolled systemic infection (viral, bacterial, or
             fungal), diagnosis of fever and neutropenia within 1 week prior to first dose of
             study drug

          -  Cardiovascular disability status of New York Heart Association Class greater than 2.
             Class 2 is defined as cardiac disease in which patients are comfortable at rest but
             ordinary physical activity results in fatigue, palpitations, dyspnea or anginal pain.

          -  Significant history of renal, neurologic, psychiatric, endocrinologic, metabolic,
             immunologic, cardiovascular, pulmonary or hepatic disease, that in the opinion of the
             investigator, would adversely affect his/her participation in the study.

          -  History of other active malignancies other than multiple myeloma within the past 3
             years prior to study entry, with the following exceptions: adequately treated in situ
             carcinoma of the cervix uteri, basal cell carcinoma of the skin or localized squamous
             cell carcinoma of the skin, previous malignancy confined and surgically resected (or
             treated with other modalities) with curative intent.

          -  Tested positive for HIV or hepatitis.
