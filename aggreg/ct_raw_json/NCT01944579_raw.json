This study aims to investigate absorption of blackberry\n      polyphenols, their impact on intestinal bacteria, polyphenol metabolites formed by\n      intestinal bacteria, and how these processes differ for obese and lean individuals.  It is\n      hypothesized that polyphenol absorption and metabolism will differ between obese and lean\n      individuals and that differences in intestinal microbiota may play a role."
