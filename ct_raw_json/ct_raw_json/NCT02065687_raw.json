Drugs used in chemotherapy,\n      such as paclitaxel and carboplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor\n      cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Metformin\n      hydrochloride may help paclitaxel and carboplatin work better by making cancer cells more\n      sensitive to the drugs. It is not yet known whether paclitaxel and carboplatin is more\n      effective with or without metformin hydrochloride in treating endometrial cancer."

To determine if the addition of metformin (metformin hydrochloride) to the standard\n      regimen of carboplatin and paclitaxel prolongs progression-free survival (PFS) in women with\n      advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer. (Phase II) II. To determine if the addition of\n      metformin to the standard regimen of carboplatin and paclitaxel prolongs overall survival\n      (OS) in the same population if a phase III study is conducted. Both clinical trials (phase\n      II and III) will utilize OS as a primary endpoint if a phase III trial is opened.\n\n      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. To estimate the proportion of patients with objective response (response rate [RR]) in\n      the population of patients with measurable disease by treatment.\n\n      II. To estimate the duration of response in the population of patients with measurable\n      disease who respond by treatment.\n\n      III. To estimate overall survival (OS) and relative hazards of death for each treatment arm\n      if the study stops after the phase II trial is completed. If the study continues with a\n      phase III clinical trial, then PFS will be a secondary endpoint.\n\n      IV. To determine the nature, frequency and degree of toxicity as assessed by Common\n      Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) for each treatment arm.\n\n      V. To estimate possible differences in RR, PFS, OS, and toxicity rates for the treatment\n      regimens by the patients' level of obesity.\n\n      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. To explore the association of metabolic factors (i.e. body mass index [BMI], hip-to-waist\n      ratio, diabetes status, hemoglobin A1c [HgbA1C], fasting insulin and glucose levels,\n      homeostatic model assessment [HOMA] scores) with treatment response to\n      metformin/paclitaxel/carboplatin.\n\n      II. To correlate expression of the metformin transporter proteins (i.e., organic cation\n      transporters [OCT] 1-3, multidrug and toxin extrusion [MATE] 1/2 and plasma membrane\n      monoamine transporter [PMAT]) and key targets of the metformin/mammalian target of rapamycin\n      (mTOR) signaling pathway with treatment response to metformin/paclitaxel/carboplatin.\n\n      III. To estimate differences in physical functioning, physical activity, and fatigue between\n      treatment arms.\n\n      IV. To explore the association between metabolic factors (i.e., BMI, hip-to-waist ratio,\n      diabetes status, HgbA1C, fasting insulin and glucose levels, HOMA scores) and physical\n      functioning, physical activity, and fatigue.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\n      ARM I: Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 3 hours, carboplatin IV over 30\n      minutes on day 1, and metformin hydrochloride orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-21\n      (once daily [QD] in course 1). Treatment repeats every 21 days for 6 courses in the absence\n      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then receive maintenance therapy\n      comprising metformin hydrochloride PO BID on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 21 days in the\n      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      ARM II: Patients receive paclitaxel IV and carboplatin IV as in Arm I. Patients also receive\n      placebo PO BID on days 1-21 (QD in course 1). Treatment repeats every 21 days for 6 courses\n      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then receive\n      maintenance therapy comprising placebo PO BID on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 21 days in\n      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and\n      then every 6 months for 3 years."
