Dose raging (aim 1): 3 oromandibular Dystonia (OMD) groups undergoing 3 different\n           Dysport\u00ae dosages with a step-wise approach based on safety response. 6 weeks duration\n           for the 3 groups.\n\n        2. Efficacy & safety assessment of Dysport\u00ae selected dose from study part 1 (aim 2): 1\n           single arm with OMD subjects. 12 weeks duration.\n\n      Study Specific Aims:\n\n      Aim 1: To determine the best dose range for Dysport\u00ae for the treatment of OMD\n\n      In order to address Aim 1, patients with OMD who have been previously treated with Botox\u00ae\n      (onabotulinumtoxinA) and responded will be recruited into this study.  The muscles to be\n      injected will be tailored to the individual's presentation and up to the injector's\n      discretion, but if a muscle is chosen it will be given a set amount of Dysport\u00ae\n      (abobotulinumtoxinA )(see table 2).  The subject will be injected with Dysport\u00ae only, with\n      an unblinded open-label disclosure.  There will be three dose levels and three subjects will\n      be injected in each (OMD type for each group: 2 jaw opening + 1 jaw closing).\n\n      This optimal dosage will be the safest dosage that provides adequate efficacy. This will be\n      based on the Clinical Global Impression Scale's Efficacy Index.  Subjects from Aim 1 will be\n      offered enrollment into Aim 2.\n\n      Aim 2: To determine the efficacy and safety of Dysport\u00ae for the treatment of oromandibular\n      dystonia\n\n      20 subjects will be included in the second part of the study and will be injected with the\n      determined optimal dosage found at the end of the first study part.  They would be injected\n      for Aim 2 after at least 12 weeks have passed, given that the effect from the prior\n      injection had either completely abated or at least declined significantly.  The 9 subjects\n      from Aim 1 will be offered to enter study part 2 unless they have severe adverse event (AE),\n      ongoing AE or AE considered inappropriate for study continuation.  Their previous injections\n      with Dysport\u00ae should not confound the results of Aim 2 since both Botox\u00ae and Dysport\u00ae should\n      both have minimal clinical effect at 12 weeks out from injection.  Since the local\n      population suffering from OMD is small, the inclusion of the Aim 1 subjects into Aim 2 would\n      lead to a much more rapid completion of recruitment.\n\n      In both Aim 1 and Aim 2, the safety and efficacy will be recorded for all subjects that\n      undergo injection.  All subjects will be examined and videotaped at the injection visit,\n      then at 6 and 12 weeks after injection with a standardized protocol.  The primary outcome\n      will be blinded examination scores of the videos performed after the study is complete. The\n      evaluators will be  two different movement disorders experts, not otherwise involved in the\n      study, who will review the videotaped examinations, presented in a random order, using the\n      Global Dystonia Rating scale (GDS).  They will rate the dystonia at baseline (injection\n      visit) and 6 weeks after injection.  The change in GDS score from baseline to 6 weeks after\n      injection is the best objective measure of efficacy and will serve as the study's primary\n      endpoint.  The investigators chose the GDS over other dystonia scales because of its ease of\n      use, sensitivity to clinical changes because of its continuous rating system, internal\n      consistency, and inter-rater reliability."
