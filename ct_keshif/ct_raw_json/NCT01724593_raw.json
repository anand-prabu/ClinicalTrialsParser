            "textblock": "Intensive Care Unit-acquired weakness (ICU-AW) is a well-recognized, important and\n      preventable sequelae of critical illness, affecting up to 60% of adult ICU patient. ICU-AW\n      is associated with increased mortality and length of stay, and negatively impacts long-term\n      functional outcomes and quality of life in affected patients and their caregivers. While\n      delayed mobilization adversely affects clinical outcomes, early rehabilitation in the\n      critically ill adult population is safe, feasible, cost effective, results in more\n      ventilator free-days and better functional outcomes at hospital discharge. In contrast,\n      there is a paucity of this research in pediatrics. Our research suggests that immobilization\n      is common in critically ill children, and rehabilitation is delayed particularly in the\n      sickest children who are arguably at highest risk of morbidity.  It is unclear however,\n      whether delayed rehabilitation leads to adverse outcomes in critically ill children, as has\n      been demonstrated in adults. Our objectives of this study are to evaluate if immobilization\n      and delayed rehabilitation negatively impacts short-term clinical outcomes and the time to\n      functional recovery in critically ill children. The investigators hypothesize that the\n      following factors may influence functional recovery and morbidity in critically ill\n      children:\n\n        -  Pre-morbid condition\n\n        -  Age\n\n        -  Time-to-initiation of acute rehabilitation\n\n        -  Critical illness disease severity"
