            "textblock": "Chronic kidney failure, also called chronic kidney disease, describes the gradual loss of\n      kidney function. Kidney failure is a medical condition in which kidneys fail to filter\n      metabolic wastes and toxins out of the body and a series of symptoms will be developed  .It\n      is common, frequently un recognised and often exists together with other conditions (for\n      example, cardiovascular disease and diabetes). When advanced, it also carries a higher risk\n      of mortality.  The risk of developing CKD(Chronic Kidney diseases )  increases with\n      increasing age, and some conditions that coexist with CKD become more severe as kidney\n      dysfunction advances CKD can progress to established renal failure in a small but\n      significant percentage of people. This classification divides CKD into five stages. Stages\n      3-5 may be defined by glomerular filtration rate (GFR) alone, whereas stages 1 and 2 also\n      require the presence of persistent proteinuria, albuminuria or haematuria, or structural\n      abnormalities.\n\n      Mesenchymal Stem cells  have two important characteristics that distinguish them from other\n      types of cells. First, they are unspecialized cells that renew themselves for long periods\n      through cell division. The second is that under certain physiologic or experimental\n      conditions, they can be induced to become cells with special function such as the beating\n      cells of heart muscle or the insulin- producing cells of the pancreas as well as the neurons\n      of brain.So our approach is to prove safety and efficacy of stem cell in CRF"
