At present, the\n      widely used G-CSF products are of such short-acting G-CSF product in  China. However, there\n      existed some shortcoming about short-acting G-CSF, such as shorter half-life, continuous\n      monitoring of the patient's blood neutrophil count and so on.\n\n      Nowadays,long-acting G-CSF product,such as Neulasta\u00ae, has become the mainstream of the\n      foreign G-CSF market for its superiority of long half-life and absence of monitoring of the\n      patient's blood neutrophil count. The new drug Recombinant(Expressed by Pichia pastoris)\n      Human Serum Albumin/Human Granulocyte-Colony Stimulating Factor(I)Fusion Protein(GW003) is a\n      long-acting G-CSF.Preclinical studies have shown that GW003 has accelerated neutrophil\n      recovery and can shorten the duration of neutropenia symptoms, also reduce its extent,\n      therefore minimize the likelihood of serious infections, reflecting a better efficacy and\n      more long half-life.\n\n      Phase I was performed as two parts, Ia and Ib. Ia was a sequential dose escalation to\n      observe the dose-limiting toxicity(DLT) and Maximum Tolerated Dose of GW003 given\n      subcutaneously to patients without receiving chemotherapy,6 dose cohorts(50\u3001150\u3001300\u3001400\u3001500\n      and 600\u03bcg/kg) with 2-3 subjects in the 50\u3001150\u03bcg/kg cohorts and 3-6 subjects\uff08depend on the\n      Dose-limiting toxicity\uff09 in the 300\u3001400\u3001500 and 600\u03bcg/kg cohorts, to evaluate safety and\n      pharmacokinetics prior to the \u2160b.\n\n      Ib proposed two arms (150 and 300\u03bcg/kg\uff1bn=6-8/arm), and to determine whether to continue to\n      increase other dose arm based on the safety and efficacy assessment. Subjects need to\n      receive two cycles treatment of AT chemotherapy. In cycle 1, subjects received AT\n      chemotherapy only; in cycle 2, subjects were administered subcutaneously GW003 24 hours\n      after chemotherapy drugs."
