        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject voluntarily agrees to participate in this study and signs an Institutional
             Review Board (IRB)-approved informed consent prior to performing any of the screening
             procedures and in the opinion of the PI complies with all the requirements of the
             study.

          -  Subject is healthy, determined at the screening medical evaluation (including but not
             limited to medical history, physical examination and clinical laboratory
             evaluations).

          -  Subject is Caucasian.

          -  Female subject must be of non-childbearing potential (surgically sterile
             [hysterectomy or bilateral tubal ligation] or post-menopausal â‰¥ 1 year with follicle
             stimulating hormone [FSH] &gt; 40 U/L).  Women receiving hormone replacement therapy
             (HRT) are eligible to enroll.

          -  Male subject must agree to use condoms and refrain from sperm donation from Day 1
             until 30 days post last dose or have documentation of vasectomy.

          -  Subject has a body weight &gt; 50 kg and BMI between 19.5 and 32 kg/m2, inclusive, at
             screening.

          -  Subject has no clinically significant abnormal findings  related to their systolic or
             diastolic BP, per the investigator's judgment, at screening or Day  1.

          -  Subject has no clinically significant abnormal findings in 12 lead ECG, per the
             investigator's judgment, at screening.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has clinically significant history or evidence of cardiovascular,
             respiratory, hepatic, renal, gastrointestinal, endocrine, neurological,
             immunological, or psychiatric disorder(s) as determined by the investigator or
             designee.

          -  Subject has clinically significant abnormalities on a 12 lead ECG done at screening

          -  Subject has clinically significant abnormalities on a 48-hour ambulatory ECG done at
             screening

          -  Subject has any disorder that would interfere with the absorption, distribution,
             metabolism, or excretion of drugs.

          -  Subject has any concurrent disease or condition that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, would make the subject unsuitable for participation in the clinical
             study.

          -  Subject is unlikely to comply with the protocol requirements, instructions, and study
             related restrictions; e.g., uncooperative attitude, unavailable for follow-up call,
             and/or improbability of completing the clinical study.
