  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One of the most important debates in the field of disease prevention is whether financial
      incentives should be contingent on participation in evidence-based programs for smoking
      cessation or on actual outcomes, like prolonged abstinence.  This study can fill a major
      knowledge gap in this debate, which is the lack of any population trial that compared the
      impacts of outcomes- and participation-based incentives in a population of smokers.  This
      research can help policy makers and health service providers choose the incentives approach
      that provides the most effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and cost-savings for entire
      populations of smokers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This population-based randomized clinical trial is designed to compare long-term abstinence
      rates in three groups of smokers:  1. Those incentivized for participation in an
      evidence-based treatment designed for smokers at each stage of change; 2. Those incentivized
      for biologically validated prolonged abstinence at 6 and 12 months who could also choose to
      participate in the TTM (Transtheoretical Model)-tailored intervention; and 3. An assessment
      only control condition.

      The Specific Aims are:

        1. To assess whether the treatment group incentivized for participation outperforms the
           control group at 12, 24 and 36 months as hypothesized;

        2. To assess whether the treatment group incentivized for prolonged abstinence at 6 and 12
           months outperforms the control group at each follow-up as hypothesized;

        3. To assess whether the treatment group incentivized for participation outperforms the
           treatment group incentivized for outcomes at 36 months as hypothesized.

        4. To compare the cost-effectiveness of each treatment in a population of mostly
           unmotivated smokers;

      The Secondary Aims are:

        1. To assess the long-term treatment trajectories of each treatment compared to controls
           with hypothesized increasing trajectory in the participation contingent incentives and
           decreasing trajectory in the outcome contingent incentives.

        2. To identify mediators of long-term outcomes in each treatment, such as amount of
           treatment participation, income, severity of smoking, stage of change, self-efficacy,
           perceived health and intrinsic and extrinsic motivation to quit.

        3. To compare cost-savings of each treatment by modeling all additional costs of smoking
           for employers and smokers.
