The use of sulindac may be an effective way to prevent\n      colon cancer. Eating a diet rich in fruits and vegetables appears to reduce the risk of some\n      types of cancer. Curcumin, rutin, and quercetin are compounds found in plants that may\n      prevent the development of colon cancer.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized clinical trial to study the effectiveness of sulindac, curcumin, rutin,\n      and quercetin in preventing colon cancer."

Patients in\n      Part B are randomized by gender.\n\n      All patients undergo flexible sigmoidoscopic exam.\n\n        -  Part A: Patients, in cohorts of 5-10, receive one of the following five treatments in\n           addition to the control diet: nothing (arm I), oral sulindac twice a day (arm II), oral\n           rutin at 1 of 3 doses twice a day (arms III, IV, and V), oral quercetin at 1 of 3 doses\n           twice a day (arms V, VI, and VII), or at 1 of 3 doses oral curcumin twice a day (arms\n           VIII, IX, and X). Patients are first randomized to the highest doses of rutin,\n           quercetin, and curcumin and then lower doses may be given in order to determine the\n           minimally effective dose. Treatment is continued for 6-10 weeks.\n\n        -  Part B: Patients are randomized to receive the control diet only (arm I) or the control\n           diet plus oral curcumin twice a day (arm II) for 6-10 weeks.\n\n      Patients are followed every 2 weeks.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: There will be 130 patients (110 in Part A and 20 in Part B) accrued into\n      this study."
