  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is aimed at assessing whether performing a paravertebral block (a type of
      regional pain relief) can reduce the pain and anxiety patients experience during
      radiological procedures on the liver.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or non-pregnant female subjects, between the ages of 18 and 80 at the time of
             enrollment.

        Subjects referred for liver/biliary interventions to the angiography department.

        Written informed consent to participate in the study. Ability to comply with the
        requirements of the study procedures

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who participated in an active stage of any drug, intervention or treatment
             trial within 30 days of enrollment.

        Subjects with preexisting conditions, which, in the opinion of the investigator, interfere
        with the conduct of the study. Patients will only be excluded on this basis following
        discussion with another interventional radiologist.

        Subjects who are uncooperative or cannot follow instructions. Mental state that may
        preclude completion of the study procedure or ability to obtain informed consent.

        Pregnant or nursing female subjects. Patient who are to undergo liver biopsy or routine
        biliary tube exchange. Patients with neurological/spinal conditions, or a BMI over 40,
        that would prevent safe/effective or well-targeted paravertebral blockade.

        Patient unable to tolerate the paravertebral block procedure, for example due to inability
        to lie prone
