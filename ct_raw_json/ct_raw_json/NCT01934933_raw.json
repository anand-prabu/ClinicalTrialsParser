Clinical response\n      assessment, laboratory assessment and radiology assessment will be recorded. Primary\n      endpoints are the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) Spondyloarthritis Research Consortium of\n      Canada (SPARCC) score and the modified Stoke Ankylosing Spondylitis Spinal Score (mSASSS) of\n      spine and sacroiliac(SI) joint, as well as the Assessment of SpondyloArthritis International\n      Society (ASAS)20 response rate. Secondary Endpoints include ASAS20, ASAS40, ASAS70 and\n      ASAS5/6 response rate on each visit and other clinical indexes."
