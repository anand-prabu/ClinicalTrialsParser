After written consent is\n      obtained from the parent or guardian, the subject will be enrolled and will receive three\n      intravenous doses of IVIG at designated intervals over the first 60 days following HPE and\n      will be followed for 360 days after enrollment. Blood will also be obtained during this\n      study to assess potential mechanisms by which the IVIG may alter or reduce bile duct\n      inflammation and injury and improve bile flow. All infants in this trial will also be\n      treated with standardized doses of other routine standard-of-care treatments for BA during\n      this trial (ursodeoxycholic acid, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxasole, and fat-soluble vitamin\n      supplements). This routine clinical care will not be modified by participation in this\n      study.  Subjects in this study will not receive corticosteroid therapy for treatment of\n      biliary atresia, as this is of unproven benefit at the present time."
