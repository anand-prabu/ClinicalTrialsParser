COPD can get worse, making people sick enough to need hospitalization.\n      Corticosteroids are very effective and are almost always used, but nobody knows the right\n      dose. High doses may work better but could cause more side effects than low doses. Typical\n      treatment lengths last at least one week. This study will be comparing two common regimens:\n      either 40mg of corticosteroids daily (low dose), or 80mg of corticosteroids daily (high\n      dose). It is unknown which regimen works better.."

Our\n      hypothesis is that high-dose corticosteroids is associated with a decreased rate of\n      treatment failure, shorter length of hospital stay, and improved quality of life with\n      similar risk of adverse effects. The study population includes patients \u2265 40 years-old with\n      a \u2265 10 pack-years smoking history and a diagnosis of COPD, emphysema, or chronic bronchitis\n      who present to the emergency room with increased dyspnea, increased sputum, or increased\n      cough that requires admission to the hospital. We will perform a prospective, randomized,\n      double-blinded study to determine if a high-dose corticosteroid regimen, which is already in\n      use in clinical practice, decreases treatment failure compared to a low-dose corticosteroid\n      regimen that is based on national consensus guidelines."
