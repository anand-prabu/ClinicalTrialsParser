The investigators hypothesize that\n      long-term SMA use would strengthen the connections between the motor areas of the brain and\n      the lower limbs. Specifically, individuals in the SMA group will show higher corticospinal\n      excitability of the lower limb muscles compared to those in the IPT group."

Participants between the\n      ages of 18-80 and who are 30 days or greater post stroke will be included.\n\n      This SMA robotic device assists hip flexion and extension, for each side independently. It\n      is controlled through software run on a tablet. The device weighs 2.8 kgs, and has 2\n      brushless direct current motors running on a rechargeable lithium ion battery. It comes in 3\n      sizes (small, medium and large). It is worn around like a belt with the motors near the hips\n      and straps on the thighs. The SMA device allows users to increase their stride length by\n      providing assist with the motors in flexion and extension. This device is 1) simple to use\n      in the clinical setting; 2) easily adjustable to alter according to the requirements of each\n      subject; and, 3) can quantify the amount of assistance required to facilitate walking\n      patterns.\n\n      Participants post stroke 30 days or greater will be recruited from inpatient, day\n      rehabilitation and outpatient clinics. Participants will be scheduled for 18 Sessions of\n      outpatient physical therapy plus 3 sessions of  testing. The amount of sessions provided\n      will be dependent upon compatibility with the device and ability to tolerate the device. A\n      participant will continue with each session of the study as deemed appropriate by research\n      staff.\n\n        -  A. Phase I. (session 0): After consenting, subjects will undergo a physical evaluation\n           and screening exam by a licensed physical therapist. If they meet study criteria, they\n           will be randomly placed into either the SMA group or the IPT group using a random\n           number generator and they will be entered into the study. Once they are enrolled,\n           baseline outcome measures will be assessed by a blinded research physical therapist.\n\n        -  B. Phase II.  (sessions 1-9):\n\n             -  Stride Management Assist Group: Treatment consists of 30 minutes high intensity\n                gait training with device, 15 minutes functional mobility with device.\n\n             -  Impairment Based Physical Therapy Group: Treatment will be divided into: 15 min\n                balance training, 15 minutes functional mobility (transfers, strength or\n                flexibility training) and 15 min high intensity gait training\n\n        -  C. Phase III.  (session 10): Mid treatment assessment. Outcome measures will be\n           assessed by a blinded research physical therapist.\n\n        -  D. Phase II.  (sessions 11-19):\n\n             -  Stride Management Assist Group: Treatment consists of 30 minutes high intensity\n                gait training with device, 15 minutes functional mobility with device.\n\n             -  Impairment Based Physical Therapy Group: Treatment will be divided into: 15 min\n                balance training, 15 minutes functional mobility (transfers, strength or\n                flexibility training) and 15 min high intensity gait training\n\n        -  E. Phase IV.  (session 20): Post Testing. Outcome measures will be assessed by a\n           blinded research physical therapist.\n\n      All testing and training sessions will be under the supervision of a licensed physical\n      therapist. All subjects will be permitted to stop physical activity or rest at any time\n      during the study. Adverse events will be recorded.\n\n      The investigators anticipate this study will help determine if the Stride Management Assist\n      is a practical option to better strengthen the connections between the brain and the lower\n      limbs. The investigators do not foresee any potential pitfalls."
