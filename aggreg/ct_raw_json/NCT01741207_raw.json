            "textblock": "Percutaneous coronary intervention(PCI) is one of the standard therapies for acute coronary\n      syndrome. Despite major advances in PCI procedure, impaired myocardial perfusion frequently\n      occurred after primary PCI and resulted in a larger infarct size and increased morbidity and\n      mortality.Reperfusion injury process can be resulted  in additional death of cardiomyocytes\n      and it is suggested that oxidative stress is a contributing factor to induce reperfusion\n      injury.During PCI,trauma occurs to the arterial endothelium, causes the activation and\n      aggregation of platelets.\n\n      It is estimated that approximately 25% of patients undergoing PCI have significant\n      postprocedural creatinine kinase (CK)/creatinine kinase myocardial band (CK-MB) elevations\n      and approximately 50% of patients have significant post-procedural troponin elevations. The\n      most  common  complication of PCI is a cell  damage  to cardiomyocyte that can be  diagnosed\n       by postprocedure elevation  of  cardiac  markers. N-acetylcystein have several positive\n      effect on platelet and vascular function and infarct size.\n\n      This study is a randomized clinical trial (RCT) evaluating the effect of N-acetylcystein on\n      biomarkers of platelet activation and coronary reperfusion in patients undergoing\n      percutaneous coronary intervention. Double blind randomized clinical trial on 100 patients\n      in 2 groups (intervention & control) is conducted. Patients with confirmed ST-elevation\n      myocardial infarction included in this study. Patients were excluded if they had: emergency\n      for cardiac bypass; cardiogenic shock and rescue percutaneous coronary intervention.\n      Patients in Intervention group were administered 100 mg/kg Iv bolus N-acetylcystein and then\n      480mg intracoronary and 10mg/kg/h over 12 hours after percutaneous coronary intervention and\n      patients in control group received standard regimens. Primary outcome was platelet\n      activation biomarkers assessment before and 24 hours after percutaneous coronary\n      intervention and secondary outcome was effect of N-acetylcystein on CK-MB and high sensitive\n      Troponin T, 6 and 12 hours after percutaneous coronary intervention.Patients were assessed\n      for coronary blood flow after percutaneous coronary intervention with the use of TIMI flow\n      and myocardial blush grade.\n\n      Major adverse cardiac events (MACE) will be evaluated as a secondary endpoint after 30 days."
