Regarding the history of ingestion of oral bisphosphonates: After assessment of\n        adequate adherence (compliance greater than 75%), if the patient received six months of\n        treatment, she should have a bisphosphonate-free period of six months. If she took more\n        than six months, the bisphosphonate-free period must be 12 months.\n\n        XIV. Current  or within the last 3 months before study entry estrogen use, selective\n        estrogen receptor modulators use or calcitonin use in therapeutic doses.\n\n        XV.

Vaginal estrogen and isoflavones are permitted .\n\n        XVI.Current or previous use of teriparatide, other PTH analogues as patches or\n        injectables, strontium, fluorine or any intravenous bisphosphonate therapeutic dose, XVII.\n        Known hypersensitivity to pharmaceuticals derived from bacterial cells. XVIII.\n        Hypersensitivity to teriparatide or to any of its excipients.

Treatment with androgens or anabolic steroids in the 6 months prior to randomization.\n\n        XXII. Any medical condition that in the investigator opinion would contraindicate\n        treatment with an investigational drug.\n\n        XXIII. Treatment with coumarin and indandione derivatives in the 3 months prior to\n        randomization or treatment with heparins (at doses> 10,000 U / day) for more than 30 days\n        in the 6 months prior to randomization.\n\n        XXIV.Treatment with any other drug known to affect bone metabolism, in  therapeutic\n        doses,in the 6 months prior to randomization.\n\n        XXV.Treatment with an investigational drug during the month prior to randomization. -"
