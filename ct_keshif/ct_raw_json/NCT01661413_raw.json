            "textblock": "Chemotherapy induced nausea is a common side effect for children undergoing chemotherapy.\n      Furthermore, chemotherapy-induced vomiting is a major factor limiting quality of life during\n      treatment reported by paediatric cancer survivors. Complete prevention of both nausea and\n      vomiting is the goal of anti-vomiting and nausea medications. It is important to understand\n      whether or not certain chemotherapeutic treatments are more or less likely to cause these\n      symptoms. Acute leukemia is the most common cancer diagnosed in children.  Intrathecal\n      methotrexate is an important part of chemotherapy for the prevention and treatment of\n      central nervous system leukemia over the 2.5 to 3.5 years of the treatment program for\n      leukemia.  The likelihood that intrathecal methotrexate administered as monotherapy will\n      cause nausea and vomiting has not yet been described in children. Knowledge of the\n      likelihood that intrathecal methotrexate will cause nausea and vomiting will therefore be\n      important to optimize treatment for these side-effects of chemotherapy. The primary aim of\n      this prospective study is to evaluate the potential of intrathecal methotrexate to cause\n      nausea and vomiting in paediatric cancer patients."
