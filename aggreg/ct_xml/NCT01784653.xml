  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the effects of a computerized, self-directed
      Motivational Enhancement Therapy program for adolescent substance use (iMET), in comparison
      to clinician-delivered MET and Treatment As Usual (TAU), on treatment engagement and
      substance use. The investigators hypothesize that both iMET and MET  will be more effective
      than TAU in engaging/retaining patients in treatment and in reducing substance use during a
      12-month follow-up period. The investigators also hypothesize that Self-directed iMET will
      be as effective as the clinician-guided MET in increasing treatment engagement and
      abstinence during the 12-months follow-up period.
