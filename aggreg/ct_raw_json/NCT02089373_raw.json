Although the endoscopy with biopsy has been a gold standard for\n      diagnosing gastric cancer, percentage of cancer cells in biopsy samples is usually 30% or\n      less. Recently, confocal laser endomicroscopy has been introduced for real-time\n      histopathologic diagnosis in various cancers. The investigators aim to evaluate that biopsy\n      using probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy will increase the percentage of cancer cells\n      in biopsy samples."
