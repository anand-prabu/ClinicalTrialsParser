The estimated overall\n      incidence of the disease in the western world is approximately 1 in 100,000 live births that\n      varies by geographic location. There are no approved therapies for MLD.\n\n      This study is a multicenter open-label study designed to evaluate safety and efficacy\n      outcomes of HGT-1110 administered intrathecally in children with MLD who have participated\n      in the dose escalation study, HGT-MLD-070, through Week 40 and are receiving study drug\n      every other week (EOW). In this study patients will receive HGT-1110 at the same dose as the\n      cohort to which they were previously assigned in Study HGT-MLD-070 (10, 30, or 100 mg)."
