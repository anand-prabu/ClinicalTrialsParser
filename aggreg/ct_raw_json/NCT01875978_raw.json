Adipose tissue secrete adipocytes\n      accumulate in the liver result in fatty liver. Excess fat become low density\n      lipoprotein-cholesterol(LDL-C) from liver. Oxidized- LDL-C adherence in the vessel result in\n      atherosclerosis via inflammation and immune response.\n\n      Phytosterols are present in the nuts, plant oil, broccoli and so on. The structure of\n      phytosterols are similar with cholesterols. After the competition, the smaller absorption of\n      cholesterols. Studies showed the average consumptions of phytosterols were 200mg daily but\n      the enough amount for cardiovascular protection of phytosterols were 2000mg daily.\n\n      Daily 2000mg phytosterols inhibit the absorption of intestine, reduce the LDL-C about 7-10%.\n      Besides, phytosterols have the effect of anti-inflammation and anti-immune response. The\n      anti-inflammation effect obvious inhibit the monocyte to transform to macrophage, inhibit\n      the formation of foam cell.\n\n      Clinical studies divided into two groups: 20/20 patients and 4 weeks follow up with\n      cross-over test.First group: Phytosterols 1800mg/day for 4 weeks then placebo. Another\n      group: placebo 4 weeks then phytosterols 4 weeks.Cross-over, double bland study.\n\n      Investigators check the possible benefits of LDL-C, Total\n      -cholesterol/HDL-cholesterol,anti-oxidant capacity,high sensitivity C reactive\n      protein,IGF-1,EPCs and hemoblogubin-A1C; the possible side effect markers including liver\n      function,muscle enzyme and ,hemolysis enzyme."
