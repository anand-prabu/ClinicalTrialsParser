Participants will also have electrocardiogram (ECG) waveform performed in\n      order to gate the MRI scan. The MRI scan of the heart, for which the participant has been\n      referred will last approximately 1 hour. Participants will have an additional 5-10 minutes\n      of scans performed, none of which require additional infusions.\n\n      If the participant is a healthy volunteer, they will have an ECG waveform performed in order\n      to gate your MRI scan, and they will have approximately 30-45 minutes of scanning performed\n      on their heart. Participants will not receive an infusion of gadolinium.\n\n      Arm 2:  Only participants who are already participating in a study being conducted by Dr.\n      Harmut Malluche at the University of Kentucky, Department of Nephrology or, if you are a\n      healthy volunteer, will be enrolled into this arm.\n\n      In this arm participants will receive an MRI of their heart, lasting 30-45 minutes.\n      Participants will not receive an infusion of gadolinium."
