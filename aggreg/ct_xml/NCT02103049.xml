  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In kidney transplant patients atherosclerosis process is accelerated even in asymptomatic
      patients. This is mainly the consequence of immunosuppressive therapy. Dyslipidemia is
      treated with statins in low doses only as high doses can lead to rhabdomyolysis and are
      therefore contraindicated. As second lipid lowering agent most commonly ezetimibe is used.
      The investigators hypothesise that ezetimibe as a second lipid lowering drug in kidney
      transplant patients lowers LDL cholesterol for additional 10 per cent.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In addition to observing the lipid profile the investigators intend to look for other
      pathophysiological effects of ezetimibe, such as its influence on oxidative stress,
      endothelial function and inflammatory biochemical markers.
