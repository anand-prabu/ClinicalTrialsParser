A secondary objective of the trial is to measure the effect of\n      adult ADHD and methylphenidate on cerebral perfusion.

In a more applied perspective, the investigators hope this trial will contribute to the\n      development of tools for improved diagnosis and treatment monitoring of ADHD. Diagnostic\n      tools should be based on the understanding of cognitive and brain mechanisms contributing to\n      the symptom manifestation of ADHD. The study aims at using a double-blinded, placebo\n      controlled cross-over withdrawal design to study the effects of ADHD and MPH in both a\n      behavioural study investigating cognitive effects on DM and instrumental learning, and an\n      fMRI study investigating the effects on brain mechanisms during DM alone. The results of the\n      behavioural DM task from the fMRI experiment will be pooled with the data from the\n      behavioural study to achieve higher statistical power in the analysis of the behavioural\n      data.\n\n      A distinctive characteristic of this proposal is to gain insight into differences between\n      ADHD-patients and healthy controls and the effects of methylphenidate (MPH) medication with\n      an approach termed \"computational psychiatry\" (Maia and Frank, 2011). In this approach, the\n      investigators apply mathematical models of cognition to observed behaviour in order to\n      derive latent decision variables characterizing the DM- and instrumental learning processes.\n      When combined with neuroimaging methods, computational models allow identification of\n      differences in affective and cognitive processes together with the neurobiological processes\n      that underlie these differences (Frank et al., 2004). Such insights should be the foundation\n      of new tools for diagnosis and therapeutic treatment of ADHD."
