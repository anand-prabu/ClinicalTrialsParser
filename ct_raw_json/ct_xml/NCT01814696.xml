  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this pilot study to evaluate the effect of the MedSentry system, a multi-faceted
      medication adherence device and reminder system, on medication adherence and clinical
      outcomes in heart-failure (HF) patients. We will also evaluate the usability and
      satisfaction derived from using this system.

      We hypothesize that:

        1. The use of the MedSentry system will improve medication adherence in patients with a
           discharge diagnosis of HF.

        2. The improvement in adherence correlates with fewer inpatient hospitalizations.

        3. The improvement in adherence correlates with better health-related quality of life.
