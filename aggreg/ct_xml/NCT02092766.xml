  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Delayed anaemia has been reported in European travellers with malaria cured by artesunate.
      Although no deaths related to this delayed anaemia have been reported so far, blood
      transfusion has been necessary in some affected patients.  Recent observations suggest that
      this episodes of anaemia also occurs in endemic countries. The aim of this trial is to
      assess the incidence of late onset anaemia after treatment with intravenous artesunate
      compared to intravenous quinine, to identify patients at risk and to clarify the causes of
      this delayed anaemia.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age &gt; 6 months and ≤ 14 years

          -  Haemoglobin ≥5.0 g/dL

          -  Parents/guardians agree to hospitalize the child for the length of treatment (3 days)
             and bring the patient for planned follow-up visits at day 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42

          -  Signed consent from the guardian/parents

        Exclusion Criteria:

             drugs expected to be effective

          -  Presence of intercurrent illness or any condition which in the judgement of the
             investigator would place the subject at undue risk or interfere with the patient
             treatment or results of the study
