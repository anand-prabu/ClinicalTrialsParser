Over 50% of\n      persons with MS suffer a fall over a 6-month periodwith the majority of falls resulting in\n      medical attention for injuries (i.e., lacerations, bone fractures, & head injuries). The\n      effects of a fall are often compounded as it can lead to activity curtailment, physiological\n      deconditioning, and institutionalization. Despite the importance of falls in persons with\n      MS, the appropriate prevention strategies (i.e. rehabilitation approaches) are not clear.\n\n      It is well known that causes of falls are multifactorial with over 400 risk factors\n      identified.  However, it is believed that these factors can be divided into two main\n      classes: intrinsic (e.g. physiological factors) and extrinsic factors. For instance balance\n      dysfunction, spasticity and muscle weakness are physiological risk factors for falls in MS .\n      Behavioral fall risk factors in MS include choosing appropriate footwear, lighting and\n      utilizing appropriate assistive device.  There is evidence that both types of risk factors\n      can be minimized with appropriately designed interventions in persons with MS  and have been\n      shown to reduce fall risk and incidence in other clinical populations. This has led to calls\n      for the combination of exercise training program that targets specific, modifiable\n      physiological risk factors and educational interventions targeting modifiable behavioral\n      risk factors in persons with MS.  However, there is minimal evidence that these\n      interventions in isolation or combination actually reduce fall incidence or risk in persons\n      with MS. This proposal seeks to determine the effectiveness of a combined exercise and\n      educational rehabilitation strategy to prevent falls in persons with MS."
