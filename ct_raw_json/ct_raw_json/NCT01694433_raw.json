Each group will have 24 subjects as\n      calculated by power analysis.

Primary\n      endpoint (lesion count) and secondary endpoints described in aims 3.2-3.4 will be\n      determined. Lesion counts will be assessed by one of the investigator physicians or nurse\n      practitioner. Adverse effects including irritation, dry skin, inflammation and worsening of\n      the lesions will be noted at each visit. Photographs will be taken to aid in assessing the\n      clinical changes."
