            "textblock": "In management of deep caries in primary teeth, the partial caries removal approach favored\n      the arrest of dentin carious lesions, reduced cariogenic micro-organisms and the risk of\n      pulp exposure. The carious tissue at the lateral walls of the cavity at the enamel dentin\n      junction (EDJ) was removed by a spoon excavator without carious tissue removal at the pulpal\n      site. After caries removal, restoration using glass ionomer cement (GIC)(GC Fuji IX\u2122GP\n      extra) was completed. Such an approach is called SMART restoration. The serial radiographs\n      of each restoration consisted of three radiographs; immediately after restoration, at the\n      6-month follow-up and at the 12-month follow-ups. Digital subtraction radiography(DSR) was\n      used to evaluate dentin remineralization following partial caries removal. Image-Pro Plus\n      software was used to evaluate DSR. For evaluating the changes in DSR, areas with increase\n      density show higher radiopacity, whereas areas with decreased density show higher\n      radiolucency. The 6-month and 12-month follow-up radiographs were subtracted from the\n      baseline radiograph."
