This study will also determine whether the participation of male\n      partners will have additional positive impact on PMTCT uptake. The intervention will utilize\n      a combination of both gender-concordant groups and individual or couples counseling\n      strategies, before and after birth. During antenatal care, the intervention will use a\n      gender-concordant group format to address PMTCT information, HIV disclosure, coping with\n      stigma, intimate partner violence, and adherence to the overall PMTCT protocol. Just prior\n      to birth and following birth, the intervention will shift to individual or couples-based\n      counseling, targeting medication adherence, safer infant feeding, and family planning. It is\n      hypothesized that women attending the intervention will be more likely to properly take HIV\n      medication before birth and provide it to their infants. Additionally, it is hypothesized\n      that male partner involvement will further increase the likelihood that mothers will take\n      their HIV medication as prescribed and provide it to their infants."
