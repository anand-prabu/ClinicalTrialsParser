Since the introduction of\n      laparoscopy, the frequency of PH is even higher than in open surgery. This type of hernia\n      remains a surgical problem of considerable importance, requiring significant consumption of\n      public health and economic resources, and representing a major alteration of the quality of\n      life of these patients.\n\n      Objective: to evaluate the effectiveness of the insertion of a prosthesis to prevent PH in\n      elective surgery for laparoscopic abdominoperineal resection.\n\n      Methodology: prospective, multidisciplinary, multi-center randomized controlled study.\n      Control group: Rectal neoplasms undergoing elective surgery for laparoscopic\n      abdominoperineal resection. Study group: Rectal neoplasms undergoing elective surgery for\n      laparoscopic abdominoperineal resection with a lightweight mesh (polypropylene and\n      poliglecaprone 25). Sample size was calculated based on a proportion of parastomal hernia of\n      65% in the control group and 15% in the study group. With an \u03b1 risk =0.05 and 1- \u03b2= 0.8, 28\n      patients are required, 14 per group. Estimating a drop-out rate of 10%, the final number\n      will be 32 patients. The efficacy will be evaluated clinically at six months and abdominal\n      CT will be performed at 12 months along with another clinical evaluation."
