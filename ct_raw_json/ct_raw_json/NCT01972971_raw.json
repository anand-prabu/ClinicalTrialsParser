            "textblock": "Warfarin, the major oral anticoagulant currently available in Taiwan, is used for the\n      prevention and treatment of a variety of thromboembolic disorders.  Under dosing of warfarin\n      may cause treatment failure and over dosing may cause bleeding because of its narrow\n      therapeutic index.  Therefore, it is important to monitor prothrombin time (PT) and\n      international normalize ratio (INR) periodically in order to evaluate the appropriateness of\n      warfarin dosing.\n\n      Lots of factors influencing warfarin anticoagulation effects include polymorphisms of\n      Cytochrome P450 2C9(CYP2C9)and Vitamin K epoxide reductase complex subunit 1(VKORC1)genes,\n      age, weight, diet and concurrent medications.  Taking into consideration of physicians' work\n      load, pharmacist-managed anticoagulation clinics were set up to help strengthen patient care\n      in US to ensure patient medication safety.  In addition, differences in genetic\n      polymorphisms between Chinese and Caucasian have great impacts on warfarin dosage, and there\n      is still no consensus on warfarin utilization guideline in Taiwan.  Pharmacist-managed\n      anticoagulation clinics provide individualized care, consistent monitoring and patient\n      education.  Through this service, physicians can get the latest integrated information about\n      their patients, patients themselves are more familiar with their medication, and adherence\n      can be improved.  Therefore, those who take warfarin will get better INR control, less\n      adverse drug-related events and treatment failure.\n\n      This is the first prototype of pharmacist clinic for a specific medication in our hospital.\n      The adverse drug events and coagulation function data collected through this program can be\n      used for the implementation of warfarin treatment guideline in Taiwan in the future.  The\n      impact of pharmacist clinic can be evaluated by questionnaire of satisfaction and knowledge\n      survey.  It can be used as a model for implementing other pharmacist-managed clinics and\n      improving patient medication safety."
