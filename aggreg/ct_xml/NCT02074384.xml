      International Diabetes Center (IDC) proposes a preference and usability study of glucose
      data acquisition and reporting, evaluating streamlined standardized cloud-based glucose
      reporting including work flow as well as patient and clinician preference at Type 1 Diabetes
       (T1D) Exchange sites to enhance standard Ambulatory Glucose Profile (AGP) reporting.  This
      phase 2 project assesses the efficacy of standardized glucose data report generation and
      preferred report presentation format; both are necessary to increase use of continuous
      glucose monitoring (CGM) data to improve care processes and outcomes for Type 1 diabetes.

    <textblock>
      Patient participation in diabetes treatment has relied upon episodic self-monitoring of
      blood glucose (SMBG). SMBG assists patients and clinicians with adjustments of insulin,
      identification of hypoglycemia, nutritional intake and activity in order to optimize
      diabetes control. SMBG however is subject to bias dependent upon the testing frequency and
      timing. In contrast, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems capture continuous 24-hour
      glucose data uninterrupted and unbiased. It provides valuable information about
      daily/nightly alterations in glucose patterns. Unfortunately SMBG, CGM and insulin pump
      devices have proprietary software with unique data standards, acquisition methods, reports,
      and graphic displays. These differences make evaluation and comparison of SMBG or CGM data
      difficult for clinicians and patients. IDC created an Ambulatory Glucose Profile (AGP)
      report to reduce challenges of device specific reports through a standardized report which
      is produced from any device with streamlined graphic displays of glucose trends.

      The phase 1 project (2012), gathered expert stakeholders (clinical, research, industry,
      patients) who validated data standards and recommended changes to the CGM-AGP reports. These
      changes are now integrated into a secure cloud-based infrastructure for AGP reporting.

      Phase 2 of this project is a usability and preference study of glucose reporting systems. It
      will include an in depth study of 6 T1D Ex clinical sites. The T1D Exchange Clinic Network
      was formed to support the development of a large registry of adults and children with type 1
      diabetes for the purpose of conducting multiple studies proposed by T1D Exchange
      investigators, and other researchers, patients, and companies.

      The 6 sites will be selected for an in-depth study utilizing middleware data collection
      services (Diasend or SweetSpot) to facilitate efficient collection of data from diverse
      devices. These middleware solutions integrate with the captÅ«rAGP system to automatically
      produce an AGP report. These sites will test the feasibility of AGP cloud reporting while
      collecting patient and clinician opinions on report preference. All 6 sites participating in
      phase 2 will collect patient and clinician preference measures. Two study sites will undergo
      time in motion (TIM) measurement and workflow mapping of current process. This TIM sub-study
      includes workflow mapping of current and cloud-based processes utilizing Toyota Lean
      (Kaizen) methodology. Sites 3 - 6 will receive enhanced designs through the adaptive trial
      method with learnings applied from sites 1 and 2.

      A key deliverable of this study is patient and clinician insight into their utilization of
      CGM reporting technologies. Recognizing that adoption of technology is often stymied by time
      constraints, report reliability and ease of interpretation, these variables will be
      examined. The goal of phase 2 is to analyze the viability of standard reporting and to
      evaluate preference (patient and clinicians) for and perceived value of different types of
      glucose pattern reports (AGP vs. device) including clinical practice time saved.
