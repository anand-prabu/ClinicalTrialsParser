  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is a complex and multifactorial disease representing a major public health
      challenge. Indeed, overweight and obese people carry a major risk of developing insulin
      resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus. It has been demonstrated that polyphenols could be
      used to counteract some of the mechanisms involved in the generation of insulin resistance.
      The model of overfeeding represents a very good study model of the metabolic complications
      of obesity, since it has been shown to induce a transient state of insulin resistance in the
      human.

      The purpose of this research is to study the effects of a overfeeding (+50% of daily caloric
      needs over 31 days) with or without polyphenols supplementation (2g/days over 31 days) on
      insulin sensitivity measured in the setting of a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp and on
      post prandial partitioning of exogenous lipids after a test meal.

      During 31 days, the volunteers will consume chocolate bars, chips, chocolate breads and cola
      in addition to their usual diet and will be supplemented with 2g of grape polyphenols
      extract or with placebo.
