The one group perform traditional PD procedure\n      (G1), and the other group will utilize disposable mini-exchange-room group (G2). Two groups\n      will be followed for 6 months. Biochemistry data, types of space for bag exchange, physical\n      activity and quality of life will also be collected for all subjects at the 3rd and 6th\n      month. During the study period, peritonitis episode, acute comorbidity and hospitalization\n      will be recorded. The change of physical activity, quality of life and peritonitis rate will\n      be compared between the two groups."
