However, existing methods of intramedullary fixation could not be restored the\n      integrated interior support, and it will occur early hip varus. Meanwhile, the varus\n      deformity will no longer develop if the two ends contact with wach other. This new\n      intramedullary fixation device can overcome the existing shortage of intramedullary fixation\n      devices and supporting the inside of the problem. It can prompting the fracture site to\n      obtain a stronger initial stability, improve fracture healing rate, reduce the incidence of\n      varus and allow patients with early weight-bearing walking."
