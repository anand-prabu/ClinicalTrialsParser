The study hypothesizes are: a) Based on the results of literature review which\n      does not reveal a clear difference between group and individual treatments' outcomes for\n      LBP, it is hypothesized that no difference will be found in treatment results for the two\n      types of group treatments in the present study also, b) The assumption is that different\n      distribution of therapeutic factors will be found in the two types of treatments\n      (individual, group), C) Patients' sensation of how they have been helped will be connected\n      to treatment results."

In the present study, patients will be asked to fill the LFSQ again, 6 months\n      after treatment completion. In two weeks from treatment completion, patients will be\n      interviewed on the telephone. The interview will focuse on their sensation of how they have\n      been helped. It will include an open-ended question and 18 closed questions.\n\n      The main study variables will include: participants' perception of functional status, level\n      pain, level of fear avoidance of physical activity, patient-therapist bonding, and helpful\n      therapeutic impacts (client's sense of how she or he has been helped)."
