(The regimen in this Treatment Referral Center protocol is one that\n           was found to be superior in a recent national intergroup study.)\n\n        -  Further determine the safety of this regimen in these patients.\n\n        -  Further determine the anti-tumor activity of this regimen, defined as the rate of\n           time-to-treatment failure, time to progression, and survival, in these patients.\n\n        -  Capture data on subsequent salvage therapy administered to patients treated with this\n           protocol.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study.\n\n      Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1, leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours on\n      days 1 and 2, and fluorouracil IV over 22 hours on days 1 and 2. Courses repeat every 14\n      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with clinical\n      evidence of benefit from this treatment, defined as stable disease, partial response, or\n      complete response as well as no increase in size of any measurable or evaluable lesion and\n      no new sites of disease, may be eligible for additional courses.\n\n      Patients are followed until death.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 300 patients per month will be accrued for this study."
