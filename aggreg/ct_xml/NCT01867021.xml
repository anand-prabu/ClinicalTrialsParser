      Demonstrate non-inferiority of the post-vaccination (Day22) hemagglutination (HI) geometric
      mean titers (GMTs) of TIV over the corresponding GMTs of the comparator vaccine for all
      three strains, in healthy adults aged 50 years and above.

      Demonstrate non-inferiority of the percentages of subjects achieving seroconversion in
      antibody titers at Day22 in the TIV group over the corresponding percentages of subjects in
      the comparator group for all three strains, in healthy adults aged 50 years and above.
