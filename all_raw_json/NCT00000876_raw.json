            "textblock": "CD4-IgG2 is a special man-made protein that was built to block the entrance of HIV into CD4\n      cells (cells of the immune system that fight infection). The purpose of this study is to see\n      if giving CD4-IgG2 to HIV-infected children is safe and effective.\n\n      HIV attaches to CD4 cells and enters them. Inside, HIV makes copies of itself that will help\n      the virus invade the body. CD4 cells are killed or disabled during this process of HIV\n      replication. Decreases in CD4 cells lead to a weakened immune system. When CD4 cell counts\n      become very low, the body is unable to defend itself, and HIV infection develops into AIDS.\n      The protein used in this study, CD4-IgG2, may be able to attach to HIV and inactivate it so\n      that it cannot enter CD4 cells. This is an early study to examine CD4-IgG2 as a possible\n      treatment for HIV in children."

            "textblock": "Since CD4 is the high-affinity receptor for HIV-1, molecules such as CD4-IgG2, which\n      incorporate the gp120 binding region of CD4, have the potential to bind and neutralize all\n      strains of the virus. [AS PER AMENDMENT 4/25/00: Study results have demonstrated that the\n      product is safe in children, well tolerated, and may have antiviral properties.  With these\n      encouraging results in hand, an extra cohort has been added using twice the dose of\n      rCD4-IgG2 as in Cohort I.]\n\n      The study is conducted in two parts. In Part 1 patients receive a single dose of CD4-IgG2\n      intravenously at 1 of 4 dose levels. A minimum of 3 patients are treated at a given dose\n      level. If none of these 3 patients experience Grade 3 or 4 toxicity, patients are escalated\n      to the next dose level. If any of these 3 patients have life-threatening toxicities or if\n      more than 1 of these 3 patients experience non-life-threatening Grade 3 or 4 toxicities,\n      escalation stops and the prior dose (if any) is considered the maximum tolerated dose (MTD).\n      If 1 of these 3 patients experiences non-life-threatening Grade 3 or 4 toxicities, 3\n      additional patients are treated at this dose level. If 1 or more of these 3 additional\n      patients has Grade 3 or 4 toxicity, escalation stops. If none of these 3 additional patients\n      has Grade 3 or 4 toxicity, patients are escalated to the next dose level.\n\n      Part 2 provides additional data on the safety, toxicity and pharmacokinetics of CD4-IgG2\n      when given in multiple doses. Patients receive the highest safe dose (MTD) as established in\n      Part 1. Treatment is given intravenously once weekly at Weeks 0, 1, 2, and 3. If\n      insufficient activity is seen at this dose level, 6 additional patients will be enrolled at\n      a higher dose level. Patients who participate in Part 1 may enroll in Part 2 provided they\n      are followed for at least 3 months and meet inclusion criteria for Part 2. If any patient\n      experiences a life-threatening condition due to CD4-IgG2, the study will stop. [AS PER\n      AMENDMENT 4/25/00: Cohort II receives twice the dose of Cohort I intravenously once weekly\n      at Weeks 0, 1, 2 and 3. Pharmacokinetic samples are obtained at pre-dose and 1 hour after\n      the doses are administered at Weeks 0, 1, and 2; and pre-dose, 1 hour, 24 hours, and Days 3,\n      7, and 14 after the dose are administered at Week 3.  An overnight stay in the hospital is\n      recommended for the first 24 hours. At Weeks 0, 1, 2, and 3, virology testing including\n      HIV-1 RNA is performed with each infusion of CD4-IgG. Follow-up monitoring of patients is\n      done once a month for 4 months for patients in Cohort II.]"
