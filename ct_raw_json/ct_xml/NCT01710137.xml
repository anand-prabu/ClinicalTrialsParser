  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Among people diagnosed with HIV/AIDS, the widespread use of highly active antiretroviral
      therapy (HAART) has greatly improved survival rates and changed the leading causes of death,
      from AIDS-related diseases to cardiovascular disease and lung cancer. Rates of tobacco use
      among individuals with HIV/AIDS are very high and varenicline may be particularly
      efficacious for treating nicotine dependence among individuals with HIV/AIDS. Through this
      trial, 310 smokers with HIV/AIDS will be randomized to varenicline plus 9 weeks of smoking
      cessation counseling or placebo plus 9 weeks of smoking cessation counseling. The
      investigators hypothesize that 1) varenicline and counseling will significantly increase
      end-of-treatment (week 12) and 24-week biochemically-confirmed abstinence, versus placebo
      and counseling; 2) quality of life will be rated higher in the varenicline and counseling
      group versus the placebo and counseling group, and there will be no significant differences
      between treatment arms in terms of the frequency of severe varenicline-related side effects;
      and 3) improved affect and reduced cognitive impairment will mediate the effect of
      varenicline therapy on quit rates.

    <textblock>
      Among people diagnosed with HIV/AIDS, the widespread use of highly active antiretroviral
      therapy (HAART) has greatly improved survival rates and changed the leading causes of death,
      from AIDS-related diseases (e.g., non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Kaposi sarcoma), to cardiovascular
      disease and lung cancer. As such, addressing modifiable risk factors for disease mortality
      among those with HIV/AIDS, including tobacco use, has become a critical priority. To date,
      only three smoking cessation clinical trials have been conducted with those with HIV/AIDS
      none of which investigated the efficacy of FDA-approved medications for nicotine dependence.
      Varenicline is an α4β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor partial agonist with greater
      efficacy for treating nicotine dependence than bupropion or nicotine patch. Varenicline may
      be particularly efficacious for treating nicotine dependence among individuals with HIV/AIDS
      given that depression symptoms and cognitive impairment are common in this population,
      increase during smoking abstinence and predict smoking relapse, and are significantly
      reduced by varenicline. Therefore, the investigators will conduct a randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of varenicline with smokers with HIV/AIDS.
      Specifically, 310 smokers with HIV/AIDS will be randomized to varenicline plus 9 weeks of
      smoking cessation counseling or placebo plus 9 weeks of smoking cessation counseling. The
      primary outcome variable for this study will be 7-day biochemically confirmed tobacco
      abstinence at weeks 12 and 24. Secondary outcomes include: prolonged abstinence to week 12,
      18, and 24 (relapse defined as 7 consecutive days of self-reported smoking, after a 2-week
      grace period), continuous abstinence at weeks 12 and 24 (e.g., no smoking between quit day
      and follow-up), time to 7-day relapse (no grace period), and lapse and recovery events. The
      trial results may support the use of varenicline for the treatment of nicotine dependence
      among those with HIV/AIDS, thereby reducing tobacco-related morbidity and mortality in this
      population.

                  should refrain from using any nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) for the
                  duration of the study.  If a subject reports an isolated (non-daily) instance of

             period, they will not be provided with/able to continue on medication unless the
             study physician grants approval.

          -  History of kidney or liver failure.

          -  Abnormal ECG (unless approved by study physician).
