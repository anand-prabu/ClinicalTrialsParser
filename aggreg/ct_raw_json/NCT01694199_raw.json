The study\n      hypothesis is that, over the first 72 hours (3 days) after the initial test device\n      treatment, subjects treated with an active test device will show a statistically significant\n      difference (reduction) in pain intensity scores when compared with subjects treated with a\n      sham (placebo) device. Treatment with the test device will continue through the 168 hour (7\n      day) timepoint. Safety will be followed through 28 days."
