Evaluate the separate and combined skeletal effects of recombinant human\n      growth hormone (GH) and calcitriol in patients with adynamic renal osteodystrophy.\n\n      II.  Assess whether calcium-regulated changes in parathyroid hormone secretion predict\n      changes in bone formation.\n\n      III.
