The nutrient biomarkers (phospholipid [PL] eicosapentaenoic acid\n      [EPA], PL docosahexaenoic acid [DHA], PL trans fatty acids, phylloquinone,\n      dihydrophylloquinone) and foods (fish, dark fish and tuna, vegetables, fruits, and whole\n      grains, and unsaturated fat rich foods) targeted have previously been either directly or\n      indirectly associated with CVD risk.  We propose to test our overall objective by conducting\n      a nested case-control study using plasma samples and food frequency data from the\n      observational cohort of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI).  Our cases (n=1200) will be\n      selected from the subset of women who did not report dietary supplement use and who died of\n      CHD or MI (collectively referred to as WHI CHD cases).  The control subjects (n=1200) will\n      be selected from the subset that were free of CHD or MI events and matched with cases for\n      standard National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) risk factors (WHI controls).\n      Nutrient biomarker data will be newly generated using stored specimens whereas the selected\n      food intake data have previously been collected by the WHI investigators."
