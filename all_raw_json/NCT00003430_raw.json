            "textblock": "OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of L-778,123 in patients with recurrent\n      or refractory solid tumors. II. Evaluate the safety and tolerability of L-778,123 including\n      qualitative, quantitative, and dose limiting toxicity in these patients. III. Assess the\n      pharmacokinetic profile of this regimen in these patients. IV. Evaluate the radiologic or\n      tumor marker responses to treatment in these patients. V. Evaluate the relationship between\n      ras mutations and response to treatment in these patients. VI. Determine the relationship\n      between plasma drug levels and farnesylation assay results.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive continuous infusions of L-778,123\n      over 7 days every 3 weeks. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or\n      unacceptable toxic effects. All patients are observed for at least 1 week after the 7 day\n      infusion of L-778,123 prior to subsequent dose escalation. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive\n      escalating doses of L-778,123 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is reached. MTD is\n      defined as the dose at which no more than 2 of 6 patients experiences dose limiting\n      toxicities. Patients are followed until death.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study."
