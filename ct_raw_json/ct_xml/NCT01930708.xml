  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to estimate the annualized relapse rate (ARR) in
      subjects with Relapsing Remitting Multiple Sclerosis (RRMS) who are treated with dimethyl
      fumarate (DMF) over a 12-month period.

      The secondary objectives of this study in this population are to assess the impact of DMF
      over a 12-month period on patient-reported health-related quality of life (HRQoL) outcomes,
      additional clinical effectiveness outcomes, and health economics-related outcomes, and to
      characterize patient-reported adherence to DMF.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have a diagnosis of Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis (RRMS) and satisfy the
             approved therapeutic indication for DMF (per the local DMF product information).

          -  Must be naïve to DMF, Fumaderm®, and other compounded fumarates, and to MS therapies
             that are primarily prescribed second-line (e.g., natalizumab, fingolimod) and to
             alemtuzumab.

          -  Have a recent complete blood count (CBC) that does not preclude the subject's
             participation in the study, in the judgment of the Investigator.

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Are unwilling or unable to comply with study requirements, or are deemed unsuitable
             for study participation as determined by the Investigator.

          -  Have major comorbid conditions that preclude participation in the study, as
             determined by the Investigator.

          -  Are pregnant, unless DMF is clearly needed and the potential benefit of DMF to the
             subjects justifies the potential risk to the fetus, in the judgment of the
             Investigator (in all countries except Austria). In Austria, pregnant subjects are
             excluded from participation in the study.

          -  Are women of childbearing potential and are not using appropriate contraception (per
             the local DMF product information) as determined by the Investigator.

          -  Women who are breastfeeding may be excluded (per the local DMF product information)
             at the discretion of the Investigator.

          -  Have previously received or are receiving treatment with MS therapies primarily used
             second-line (e.g., natalizumab, fingolimod) or alemtuzumab, or are currently
             receiving and planning to continue on other disease-modifying therapies for RRMS.

          -  Are hypersensitive to the active ingredient in the DMF drug product (i.e., DMF) or to
             any of the excipients listed in the local DMF product information.

          -  Current enrollment in any clinical trial except for the Biogen Idec DMF Pregnancy
             Exposure Registry or other studies that, according to the study Medical Director, do
             not conflict with this study (e.g., health economics studies or local registries).

        Other protocol-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.
