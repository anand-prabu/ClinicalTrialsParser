      The treatment outcomes in the treatment without brace would be non-inferior to those in use
      of rigid or soft brace.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bracing has been considered as a landmark step in conservative management for osteoporotic
      compression fractures.  However, no prospective, randomized, and controlled clinical trials
      are available to document for the efficacy of wearing of the rigid or soft brace for the
      management of osteoporotic compression fracture.  Therefore, the current trial was therefore
      designed to compare the outcome for improvement of disability and pain in patients with
      osteoporotic compression fracture using rigid, soft, or no brace.

    <description>The VAS for back pain comprised a 10-cm line with &quot;none&quot; (0) on one end and &quot;disabled pain&quot; (10) on the other.  Participants were asked to place a mark on the 10-cm line, which represented his or her perceived level of back pain, and the measured distance (cm) from the mark to the zero point was considered the score.</description>

    <description>Patients in the rigid brace immobilization group were strictly maintained on bed rest until fitted a thoraco-lumbo-sacral orthosis.

    <description>Because soft back brace was a custom-made, it began to be worn when enrollment for the study.   Brace is required to be worn at all times except when lying.  All patients were instructed to wear the soft brace for a total of 8 weeks.</description>
