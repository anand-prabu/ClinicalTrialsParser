  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the most common cancer and the second cause of cancer mortality in women.
      There are approximately 200,000 new cases of breast cancer a year1. Classically, breast
      cancers are divided into two groups, invasive and non-invasive. A mainstay of the treatment
      of both of these types is surgical resection not only for therapeutic purposes but also for
      diagnostic purposes. Breast conserving therapy includes surgical lumpectomy and
      post-operative radiation. However, despite best surgical practices, when patients undergo
      BCT anywhere from 20 - 40% of these patients have margins positive for cancer. This leads to
      increased rates of reoperation which are quoted to be as high as 30% and increased local
      recurrences.

      The folate receptor located on these nodules is well known to be overexpressed on the
      surface of many human carcinomas. Specifically for breast cancer up to 33% of all breast
      cancers over express the receptor7. Also, breast cancers are also known to have specific
      hormone receptor profiles. Breast cancers can overexpress the estrogen, progesterone or
      epidermal growth factor cell surface receptors. Breast cancers that do not overexpress any
      of these receptors are called triple negative breast cancers (TNBC). These cancers that
      represent about 15% of all breast cancer have an aggressive phenotype and carry a poor
      prognosis. Also, greater than 80-90% of all TNBC's over express the folate receptor.

      Folate-fluorescein isothiocyanate, or folate-FITC, also identified as EC-17, has been shown
      to be sensitive to folate receptors and therefore improve on negative margins. Because of
      its sensitivity, the drug is given at a low dose for diagnostic purpose only.
