GSK2586184 in patients with moderate to severe, active ulcerative\n      colitis (UC). Study medication will be administered orally (as tablets), twice daily, for up\n      to 8 weeks (56 days).  Study medication will be taken with food.  Each subject will have 6\n      out-patient visits:  Screening (Day -30 to -1); Baseline and Start of treatment (Day 1);\n      Week 2 (Day 14); Week 4 (Day 28); Week 8 (Day 56); and Follow-up (Week 12; Day 84). Visit\n      windows for weeks 2, 4 and 8 will be + 2 days. The primary objective of this study is to\n      assess the safety and tolerability of GSK2586184.  The primary endpoints to measure safety\n      are laboratory tests (including haematology, clinical chemistry and serum creatinine), vital\n      signs, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), physical examination, and adverse event reporting.\n      These are standard measurements to evaluate safety."

A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory\n             parameters outside the reference range for the population being studied may be\n             included only if the investigator agrees that the finding is unlikely to introduce\n             additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures\n\n          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of: Non-childbearing potential\n             defined as: pre-menopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy;\n             or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea.\n\n        In questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH)\n        >40 milliinternational units (MlU)/milliliter (mL) and estradiol <40 picograms (pg)/mL\n        (<147 picomole [pmol]/liter [L]) is confirmatory). Females on hormone replacement therapy\n        (HRT) must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of post-menopausal status before study\n        enrollment.  For most forms of HRT, at least 2 to 4 weeks should elapse between the\n        cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends on the type and dosage of\n        HRT.  Following confirmation of their post-menopausal status, they can resume use of HRT\n        during the study without use of a contraceptive method.\n\n          -  Male subjects with female partners of child-bearing potential must agree to use\n             acceptable contraception methods.
