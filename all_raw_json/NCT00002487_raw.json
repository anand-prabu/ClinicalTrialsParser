Dipyridamole may increase the effectiveness of methotrexate and\n      kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining methotrexate and\n      dipyridamole in treating patients with advanced ovarian cancer that is recurrent after or\n      refractory to cisplatin-based chemotherapy."

Determine the clinical complete and partial response rate, pathological\n      complete response rate, disease-free survival, and duration of response produced by\n      intraperitoneal dipyridamole/methotrexate (DP/MTX) administered as a 7-day continuous\n      infusion in patients with advanced ovarian carcinoma that is recurrent following or\n      refractory to cisplatin-based chemotherapy. II. Determine the peritoneal and systemic\n      toxicity of DP/MTX.\n\n      OUTLINE: Nonrandomized study. Single-Agent Chemotherapy with Chemopotentiation.\n      Methotrexate, MTX, NSC-740; with Dipyridamole, DP, NSC-515776.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Up to 40 evaluable patients in each category (prior intraperitoneal vs.\n      prior intravenous platinum-based chemotherapy) will be studied. If no responses are seen in\n      the first 20 patients in either category, accrual to that category will cease. An accrual\n      rate of 15 patients/year is anticipated."
