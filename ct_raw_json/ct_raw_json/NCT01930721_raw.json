Although seven types of episiotomy have been described in\n      the literature , the most frequently performed types are the mediolateral and median\n      episiotomies, with the former being the most common one. Despite being a common obstetric\n      practice, the exact definition of a \"mediolateral\" episiotomy is often unclear. Several\n      studies and reports, however, stated that a significant proportion of the so-claimed\n      mediolateral episiotomy were not actually mediolateral. The current trial  compares two\n      angles of mediolateral episiotomy , regarding the risk of third- and fourth-degree perineal\n      tearing, episiotomy-related pain and dyspareunia in primiparous women at a large tertiary\n      maternity center, namely Ain Shams University Maternity Hospital, Cairo, Egypt."
