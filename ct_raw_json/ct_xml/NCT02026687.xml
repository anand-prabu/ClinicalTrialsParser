    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to compare epidural analgesia and intrathecal analgesia for
      explorative laparotomy through a middle-line incision for gynecological cancer in a fast
      track program to se if there is any difference in recovery. Length of stay is analyzed
      together with self-rate quality of life.

    <description>The questionnaire EuroQual with 5 Dimensions &quot;EQ-5D&quot; will be used preoperatively and daily the first week after surgery, then once a week until 6 weeks after surgery. The questionnaire Short Form with 36 questions &quot;SF-36&quot; will be used preoperatively and at 6 weeks after surgery.</description>

    <description>Pain at rest and at mobilization will be assessed using a numeric rating scale from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst imaginable pain). Pain is documented on the day of surgery, 3 times daily postoperative day 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35 and 42.</description>

    <description>The epidural anesthesia is applied at a low thoracic level, primarily Th10-Th11. A bolus dose of fentanyl together with a continuous infusion of  bupivacain 2.5 mg/ml, fentanyl 1.8 µg/ml and epinephrine 2.5 µg/ml is used during surgery. Infusion rate is chosen by the attending anesthetist. Postoperatively the epidural anesthesia is continued until the morning of the third postoperative day  using bupivacain 1 mg/ml, fentanyl 2 µg/ml and epinephrine 2µg/ml. Infusion rate is set by the responsible physician, maximum rate is 10 ml/hour.</description>

    <description>The patient is given one intrathecal dose of plain bupivacaine  (Marcain® spinal) 5 mg/ml, 15 mg together with morphine (Morphine Special®) 0,4 mg/ml, 0.2 mg and clonidine (Catapresan®) 150 µg/ml, 75 µg. The intrathecal mixture is given through a lumbal puncture at level L2/3,  L3/4 or L4/5 before the induction of general anesthesia.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Women with gynecological cancer (suspected or verified) planned for explorative
             laparotomy through a middle-line incision with a curative purpose.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Women where surgery is expected to include part/s, other than the abdominal surgery,

          -  Women with contra indications for intrathecal or epidural anesthesia.

          -  Women who are physically disabled and therefore nor expected to be mobilized on the
             day after surgery in the same way as non-disabled.

          -  Women with a mental retardation that makes it impossible to fill in the relevant
             questionnaires or makes it impossible to understand the meaning of participation, or
