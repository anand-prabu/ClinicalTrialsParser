  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overarching goal of the research proposed here is to test the hypothesis (i) that the
      pathophysiological mechanisms of OSA lead to deterioration in sleep-dependent memory
      consolidation across memory systems, with the genetic marker APOε4 as a modulator, and (ii)
      that CPAP can reverse some or all of these measured memory deficits.

      In addition, we are exploring which aspects of OSA (e.g., changes in sleep architecture,
      measures of hypoxemia, or the EEG power spectrum) most likely impact sleep-dependent memory
      processing.To this end, we are using specific cognitive tasks for which sleep-dependent
      memory consolidation processes have previously been demonstrated by our group and others. In
      addition, we are carrying out quantitative EEG power spectral analyses, to delineate
      abnormal functioning of brain regions with more precision.

        Subject selection

        General inclusion criteria:

          -  Men and women ages 18 to 80 years old

          -  Good health as determined by a medical and psychiatric history and physical
             examination

          -  An absence of any medical or psychiatric disorders (other than OSA and treated
             hypertension) that could influence excessive daytime sleepiness

          -  The ability to complete self-rating scales and computer-based testing

          -  Beck Depression Inventory score ≤16

          -  Healthy controls will be excluded with and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) score &gt;
             10/24, OSA patients will be excluded from randomization with an ESS score &gt;18/24.

          -  Subjects must agree to abstain from alcohol consumption from the day before and
             throughout Session 1 and Session 2.

        Criteria for OSA patients:

          -  Newly diagnosed with OSA and with no prior exposure to CPAP

          -  Quantified apnea-hypopnea index greater than 5/hr (AHI, defined as the number of
             apneas and/or hypopneas per hour of sleep)

          -  Subjects must agree to limit alcohol use between Session 1 and Session 2  to one or
             fewer alcoholic drinks daily or up to 4 drinks weekly

        Criteria for Healthy control group:

        • Subjects will be matched to the obstructive sleep apnea patient group for age, race,
        body mass index, education and intelligence (WAIS - full scale)

        Subgroup selection:

        An additional subgroup of OSA patients and controls, who are taking antidepressants, will
        be recruited. Except for the current treatment with antidepressants all other exclusion
        and exclusion criteria will be applied.

        The following classes of antidepressants will be eligible:

          -  Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors

          -  Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors

          -  Noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressants

          -  Norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitors

        Exclusion criteria

        ALL PARTICIPANTS:

        Potential participants (OSA patients and controls) are excluded if one or more of the
        following conditions are found:

          -  Any history of clinically significant, uncontrolled medical or psychiatric condition
             (treated or untreated), other than OSA and hypertension (self-report)

          -  History of head injury (self-report)

          -  Inability to type (e.g., physical disability, arthritis) or to exercise

          -  Use of medications, over-the counter drugs or nutritional supplements known to have
             an effect on sleep, cognition and/or daytime vigilance (self-report)

          -  Female subjects who are pregnant cannot take part in the study. If a female subject
             becomes pregnant during the study, she will have to stop participation

          -  Presence of any of the following sleep disorders:

               -  Cheyne-Stokes breathing or central sleep apnea (&gt; 10% of events central)
                  (screening sleep study)

               -  REM sleep without atonia or REM behavior disorder (structured interview and
                  screening sleep study )
