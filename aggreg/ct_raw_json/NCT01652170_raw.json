The blood sample will be tested for the WBC value, as well\n      as processed into plasma in order to compute the APPY1 Test result, which is based on a\n      combination of the WBC value and the plasma MRP 8/14 and CRP concentrations received from\n      the APPY1 Test cassette. There will be a 2-week (14 days +/- 3) follow-up telephone call for\n      those subjects that were discharged from the ED without an appendectomy or diagnosis of\n      acute appendicitis. Use of the APPY1 Test to help identify low risk patients could\n      significantly reduce the use of CT scans in diagnosis of AA, thereby reducing the exposure\n      to ionizing radiation in children, adolescents, and young adults."
