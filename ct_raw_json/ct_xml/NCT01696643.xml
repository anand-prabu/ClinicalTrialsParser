      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of CB-5945
      for the treatment of opioid-induced constipation (OIC) in adults taking opioid therapy for
      chronic non-cancer pain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study in subjects
      with OIC taking opioid therapy for chronic non-cancer pain. Approximately 1,400 subjects
      (approximately 700 subjects per treatment group) with OIC will be randomized at
      approximately 225 study centers to receive either 0.25 mg CB-5945 BID or a matching placebo
      BID for the 52-week double-blind treatment period, followed by a 4-week follow-up period.
      All randomized subjects will be evaluated for safety, tolerability, and quality of life from
      the first dose of study medication through Week 56.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Is taking a stable daily dose of opioids of â‰¥ 30-mg morphine-equivalent total daily
             dose (METDD) for chronic non-cancer pain

          2. Has constipation that is caused by the chronic use of opioids

          3. Is willing to use only the study-provided laxative(s) and to discontinue use of all
             other laxatives, enemas, stool softeners, and other medications to treat constipation
             (e.g., lubiprostone) during the study period (from Screening until the last study
             assessment).

          4. Is able and willing to refrain from facilitating defecation via manual maneuvers
             (e.g., digital evacuation, support of the pelvic floor) from Screening to the last
             study assessment

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Has gastrointestinal (GI) or pelvic disorders known to affect bowel transit (e.g.,
             obstruction) or contribute to bowel dysfunction

          2. Has evidence of intestinal obstruction

          3. Has a history of rectal bleeding not due to hemorrhoids or fissures

          4. Has an active malignancy of any type (subjects with a history of successfully treated
             malignancy &gt; 5 years before the scheduled administration of study medication and
             subjects with treated basal or squamous cell cancer may be enrolled)

          5. Is taking antispasmodics (e.g., dicyclomine), antidiarrheals (e.g., loperamide),
             prokinetics (e.g., metoclopramide), or locally acting chloride channel activators
             (e.g., lubiprostone)

          6. Is taking nonopioid medications known to cause constipation (e.g., iron sulfate
             therapy, tricyclic antidepressants)
