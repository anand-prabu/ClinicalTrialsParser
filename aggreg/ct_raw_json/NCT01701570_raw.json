            "textblock": "Exercise is a potent therapy to reduce cardiovascular mortality in Type 2 Diabetes (T2D).\n      Although exercise is a cornerstone of treatment for T2D, people with T2D are more sedentary\n      than similarly obese people without diabetes, for reasons that are unclear.  Interventions\n      which combined behavioral support and physical activity prescriptions successfully increased\n      physical activity levels for people with T2D and at-risk for T2D. However, the program\n      components which mediated increased physical activity were combined and thus the individual\n      benefits of each component remain unknown.  Given the success of these combined programs, it\n      appears behavioral support and other psychological factors may play an important role. The\n      study investigators are interested in the predictors of physical activity adherence in T2D\n      as key targets for future interventions.\n\n      One likely factor which may influence physical activity adherence is perceived exercise\n      effort. The study investigators reported, based on a small study, that perceived exercise\n      effort is worse in people with T2D than in healthy obese controls, as measured by the Borg\n      Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE), even during low intensity exercise.  Thus, one strategy\n      to increase physical activity in T2D is to first identify the mediators of RPE in the\n      proposed study and then to address them in future studies.  The preliminary data suggest\n      that likely mediators of RPE are both objective and subjective in nature.  A key objective\n      mediator of RPE is serum lactate level during exercise, which is a physiological marker of\n      effort, and is disproportionately elevated in people with T2D vs. healthy controls.  A key\n      subjective mediator of RPE is self-efficacy, which influences the perception of exercise\n      effort, and is disproportionately worse in people with T2D vs. healthy controls.  To develop\n      optimal physical activity interventions for people with T2D, the study investigators must\n      understand whether RPE differences vary across the spectrum of exercise intensities (Aim 1),\n      and the investigators must also determine the mediators of RPE across exercise intensities\n      (Aim 2).  Mediators of RPE in low-to-moderate intensity exercise are particularly important,\n      because walking is a preferred physical activity for people with T2D."
