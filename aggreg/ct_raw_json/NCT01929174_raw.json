We will do this by\n      measuring relaxation with MRI, echocardiography, and cardiac catheterization and compare to\n      blood levels that measure heart scarring.  We will also measure relaxation before and after\n      boluses of intravenous (IV) fluids to see if the relaxation changes when there is more fluid\n      in the heart.  Measurements of heart relaxation will be obtained from the MRI,\n      echocardiogram, and cardiac catheterization for each patient and compared to blood markers\n      of heart scarring.  We aim to compare all of these measurements to see if we can accurately\n      identify heart scarring and, if present, how much it correlates with impaired heart\n      relaxation."
