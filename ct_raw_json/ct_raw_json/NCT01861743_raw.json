Inadequate\n      peri-operative pain management may decrease post-operative mobilization and increase length\n      of hospitalization. Additionally, poorly managed acute post-operative pain analgesia is\n      associated with an increased risk of developing chronic pain and delayed wound healing.\n\n      Lumbar spine surgery is particularly painful, often requiring a multi-day hospitalization.\n      The most common post-operative analgesia used in spine surgery is narcotic medication\n      delivered via an intravenous patient controlled analgesia (IV PCA).\n\n      A multimodal peri-operative pain management protocol for spine surgery has the potential to\n      not only decrease pain but also to improve recovery, decrease narcotic consumption, decrease\n      length of stay in the hospital and reduce both direct and indirect hospital costs.\n\n      The purpose of this study is to determine if post-operative pain and rate of recovery are\n      improved in patients undergoing spine surgery using MMA compared to usual analgesic care."
