  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, acceptability, pharmacokinetics (what
      the body does to the medication), and ex vivo (tested outside the body) pharmacodynamics
      (what the medication does to the body) of TMC278 long acting (slowly effective after initial
      dosage and maintaining its effects over a long period of time) when administered as an
      intramuscular (ie, in to the muscle) injection in adult participants who are seronegative
      for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), multi-arm (more
      than one treatment group), dose-ranging study (clinical study where different doses of study
      medication are tested against each other) to evaluate the safety, acceptability,
      pharmacokinetics, and ex vivo pharmacodynamics of a single and multiple intramuscular
      injections of long acting TMC278 to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) seronegative
      (having a negative serum reaction) male and female participants. The study consists of 3
      phases including screening phase, treatment phase, and the follow up phase (approximately 4
      to 6 months after the first dose of study medication). In treatment phase, enrolled
      participants will be divided in to 2 arms, ie, Arm A (female participants) which will be
      further divided in to Arm 1A, Arm 2A, Arm 3A, Arm 4A, and Arm 5A with 12 female participants
      per arm; and Arm B (male participants) which will be  further divided in to Arm 1B, Arm 2B,
      Arm 3B, Arm 4B, and Arm 5B with 6 male participants per arm. Safety evaluations will include
      assessment of adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, electrocardiogram, physical
      examination, and vital signs which will be monitored throughout the study. The total
      duration of study for each participant will be approximately 5 to 7 months.
