As\n      evidence- based knowledge about the delivery of aerosol to the lungs of mechanically\n      ventilated patients increases, one piece of the puzzle has remained unexplored; measurement\n      of clinically relevant outcomes.  The primary aim of this research is to compare clinical\n      outcomes (ventilator- associated events (VAEs), length of stay (LOS) in intensive care unit\n      (ICU) and total days on mechanical ventilation) when using a traditional jet nebulizer\n      versus a newer generation vibrating mesh nebulizer during mechanical ventilation.  The\n      secondary aim of this research is to identify source of bacteria by obtaining cultures of\n      each nebulizer and ventilator circuit and plating them for colony growth and identification."

The sample size\n      will be one of consecutive convenience over an entire year (September 2013-September 2014)\n      to include all seasons.  The study will be performed at Rush University Medical Center\n      (RUMC) in Chicago, IL.\n\n      Each mechanically ventilated patient within inclusion criteria, with a physician order for\n      aerosol treatment, will be randomized to either the jet nebulizer or mesh nebulizer group\n      using SPSS computer software.  The respiratory care staff will place the nebulization device\n      in the ventilator circuit per hospital protocol.  Both devices, jet and mesh nebulizers, are\n      currently standard practice, therefore hospital protocol will be followed regarding\n      placement and administration of ordered aerosol treatment.\n\n      The study subject will remain on the device in which they were randomized to for the\n      duration of their hospital stay in order to obtain clinical outcome data.  Study staff to be\n      notified of patient extubation from mechanical ventilation, discharge from intensive care\n      unit or expiration, this will conclude participant involvement in study.
