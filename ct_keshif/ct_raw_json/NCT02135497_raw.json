            "textblock": "The purpose of this study is to compare the safety and effects of low dose aspirin (100\n      mg/day ) with placebo on subjects with subsolid nodules.\n\n      Currently no effective drug to prevent lung cancer in people at increased risk has been\n      discovered. In your case these nodules are probably not cancerous but it is not possible to\n      exclude that they may become cancers, so they should be monitored with periodic exams to\n      evaluate their growth rate. At the moment the growth of your nodules does not have clinical\n      relevance, but requires a yearly follow up with low dose CT scan.\n\n      Previous studies have shown  total nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID( use was\n      associated with a small reduction in risk of lung cancer, which was strongest for\n      adenocarcinoma in men, and in long-term former smokers and of a protective effect of lowdose\n      aspirin was seen in the Women's Health Study. Another study found that lung cancer risk was\n      significantly lower for aspirin users compared to non-users and prolonged duration of use\n      was associated with reduced lung cancer risk.\n\n      We will also be studying the effect of Aspirin on levels of several different substances,\n      called biomarkers, in your blood and urine.  These biomarkers may be used to track the\n      amount of lung tissue inflammation and the risk of developing lung cancer.  In this study,\n      you will get either aspirin 100mg/day or placebo, a pill that looks like the study drug but\n      contains no medication. There will be 128 subjects taking part in this study.\n\n      This is a randomized study.  You will be randomly assigned to get a dose of aspirin or\n      placebo.\n\n      A placebo is not a drug. It looks like the study drug but is not designed to treat any\n      disease or illness.\n\n      It is designed to be compared with a study drug to learn if the study drug has any real\n      effect.\n\n      Neither you or your doctor will know whether you are getting aspirin or placebo."

Pregnant women are excluded from this study because Aspirin is an agent with the\n             potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects.
