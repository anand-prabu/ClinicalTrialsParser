  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed protocol is a multi-site double-blind, placebo-controlled outpatient study of
      the safety and efficacy of Adderall-XR (MAS-ER) and topiramate in the treatment of cocaine
      dependence. 198 patients will be enrolled and 176 patients randomized in a 14-week trial.
      The proportion of participants achieving sustained cocaine abstinence for three consecutive
      weeks at the end of the study will be significantly greater for the combined
      pharmacotherapies group compared to the placebo group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that the combination of an agent that increased baseline
      dopamine signaling (amphetamine) with one that reduced cocaine-induced dopamine release
      (topiramate) will improve dopamine regulation and be associated with improved cocaine use
      outcomes. 99 subjects at each of the two sites whom meet criteria for cocaine dependence,
      and all other study inclusion and exclusion criteria will be assigned to the 14-week
      double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment trial. Subjects will be randomized to receive
      either placebo or MAS-ER and topiramate. This proposal will test the hypothesis that MAS-ER
      and topiramate will promote cocaine abstinence. Participants who are randomized to the
      combination medication arm will have their dose titrated to 60 mg MAS-ER daily (over 2
      weeks) and 200 mg topiramate a day (over 6 weeks) and maintained on this dose through week
      13 of the trial. During week 14, participants will be tapered off both medications. All
      participants will receive a supportive behavioral treatment that emphasizes study procedure
      adherence. Starting in week one, all patients will receive incentives for compliance with
      study procedures on an escalating reinforcement schedule similar to that developed
      previously and not contingent on urine results. The purpose of the lead-out is to blind
      patients to the exact point of medication discontinuation and to provide naturalistic data
      on the effects of medication discontinuation. Moreover, a 3 month follow-up will be
      conducted to determine what happens to cocaine use after treatment discontinuation.
