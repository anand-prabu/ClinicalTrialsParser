        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Healthy Japanese male adults

          2. Body Mass Index (BMI) between 17.6 and 26.4 kg/m² at the time of screening BMI = Body
             Weight (kg)/[Height (m)]²

          3. The individual who freely consents to participate after receiving a detailed
             explanation of the clinical study and completely understanding thereof, and who has
             capacity to follow precautions and provide written consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History of hypersensitivity to components of Trastuzumab or diphenhydramine or any
             other drug

          2. Use of any ethical drug within 2 weeks before investigational product administration
             or any over-the-counter drug within 1 week before investigational product
             administration that would affect study participation in the opinion of the
             investigator or subinvestigators (except for diphenhydramine, which will be used
             concomitantly in the present clinical trial and any drug applied locally and having
             no systemic actions)

          3. History of allergic symptoms such as bronchial asthma and urticaria that would affect
             study participation in the opinion of the investigator or subinvestigators

          4. History of cardiac disorders, hypertension, coronary artery disease (e.g., myocardial
             infarction, angina), and/or vascular disorder; ongoing palpitations, shortness of
             breath, and/or tachycardia
