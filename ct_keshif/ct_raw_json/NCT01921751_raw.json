Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine hydrochloride or FOLFIRINOX, work\n      in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by\n      stopping them from dividing. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells.\n      Drugs, such as capecitabine, may make tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy.\n      Giving radiation therapy in different ways and adding chemotherapy may kill more tumor\n      cells. It is not yet known whether standard systemic chemotherapy followed by standard\n      radiochemotherapy is more effective than standard systemic chemotherapy followed by\n      intensified radiochemotherapy or standard radiochemotherapy preceded by intensified systemic\n      chemotherapy in treating pancreatic cancer."

To evaluate patterns of failure (local and systemic progression) by SMAD family member 4\n      (SMAD4) status and intensity of therapy.\n\n      II. To evaluate the impact of intensified radiotherapy on OS for the subset of SMAD4 intact\n      patients.\n\n      III.
