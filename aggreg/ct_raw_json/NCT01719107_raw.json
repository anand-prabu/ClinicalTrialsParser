Supplementation will be stopped after 4\n      weeks, and the subjects will be followed up for an additional 4 weeks. The subjects will\n      complete a diary to record frequency and intensity of pain, use of medication, deviation\n      from the usual diet, physical activities, and absence from school and other activities.\n      Gastrointestinal symptoms are assessed by the GSRS (Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Score).\n\n      Subjects/caregivers will be instructed to maintain the usual diet throughout the study, but\n      not to consume other probiotics (foods or supplements) during the entire study period.\n\n      The symptoms diary will be completed daily by the parents and will report information on the\n      frequency of pain episodes, location of pain, presence or absence of associated symptoms,\n      need to take medication for pain and interference with normal activities.
