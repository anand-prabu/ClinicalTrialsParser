Studies done in high risk patients have shown increased risk of death if\n      patients are exposed to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin blocking\n      agents.\n\n      The hypothesis is that patients exposed to medications that block the renin angiotensin\n      system have altered dose response (a type of adverse drug reaction) to inhaled anaesthetic\n      agents in a dose dependant manner as measured by cardiovascular response, specifically\n      systemic vascular resistance index.\n\n      This is a pilot study of hypertensive patients undergoing anaesthesia and composite head and\n      neck surgery.  The patients will be separated into three groups: Angiotensin converting\n      enzyme inhibitor exposed, Angiotensin Receptor Blocking Agent exposed, and any other treated\n      hypertension.  Following separation into groups based upon preoperative medication exposures\n      each group will be randomized to determine the order in which two types of inhaled\n      anaesthetics are administered. Each subject will be randomized to receive either\n      Sevoflurane/air/oxygen first or Sevoflurane/50 per cent nitrous oxide/oxygen second or vice\n      versa.   The dose of the anaesthetic will be adjusted across the dosing range from 0.8 MAC\n      (minimum alveolar concentration) to 1.6 MAC in steps of 0.2 MAC.\n\n      Each subject will have hemodynamic parameters measured at each dose of anaesthetic at each\n      MAC.   Five measurements of hemodynamic parameters will be recorded to minimize the effects\n      of surgery on each measurement.   The hemodynamic variables will be measured using a Flotrak\n      and Vigeleo monitor and the quantities to be measured are: heart rate, blood pressure,\n      systemic vascular resistance, systemic vascular resistance index, cardiac output, cardiac\n      index, central venous pressure, stroke volume variation.\n\n      The subjects are offered the opportunity to donate DNA for future study of hypertension."
