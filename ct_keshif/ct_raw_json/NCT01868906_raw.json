Additionally hypoxia\n      modification may increase survival. However, in high grade gliomas (HGG) there are not well\n      established methods to evaluate and modify tumor hypoxia. We have previously described how\n      spinal cord stimulation (SCS) can modify oxygenation, blood flow and metabolism in malignant\n      gliomas. The aim of this study is to assess with 18F-FMISO PET: hypoxia in HGG and changes\n      by spinal cord stimulation in a subset of patients. Additionally, the potential correlation\n      with pathological, imaging and clinical parameters will be analyzed.\n\n      18F-FMISO PET will be performed in 20 patients with diagnosis of HGG: after surgery/biopsy\n      and before radical treatment with 3D radiotherapy and temozolomide. A subset of 10 patients\n      undergo two studies with 18F- FMISO-PET (one with SCS \"off\" and one with SCS \"on\"). In these\n      patients, SCS will be connected from 1 hour before to 1 hour after each radiotherapy\n      session, and in the day-time during the days of adjuvant temozolomide.\n\n      18F-FMISO PET results will not be taking into account for patient management. Patients will\n      be followed at least until the end of adjuvant temozolomide (6 months after the end of\n      concurrent radiochemotherapy)."
