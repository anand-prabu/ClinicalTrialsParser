      The purpose of this signal seeking study is to determine whether treatment with LDE225
      demonstrates sufficient efficacy in hedgehog pathway-mutated solid tumors and/or hematologic
      malignancies to warrant further study

    <description>Overall Response (OR) of Partial Response (PR) or greater based on local investigator assessment. For patients with solid tumors, the assessment criteria will be RECIST 1.1 and will include responses of CR and/or PR.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has confirmed diagnosis of a select solid tumor (except medulloblastoma,

             appropriate hematological guidelines.
