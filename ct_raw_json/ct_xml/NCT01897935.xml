  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a cross sectional study of a novel non-invasive optical flare photometer (OFAM).
      Patients meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria will receive a standard eye examination
      including a slit lamp examination to collect ocular flare data. In addition to the standard
      eye examination, subjects will receive flare measurements using the OFAM device.

        All patients with uveitis seen in the uveitis clinic at the UW Medicine Eye Institute
        would be eligible for participation in the uveitis arm of the study (n ≤ 50). Patients
        with other, non-inflammatory forms of eye disease will be eligible for the
        non-inflammatory arm of the study (n ≤ 50).

          -  To be eligible for the uveitis arm of the study subjects must have active anterior
             chamber uveitis in one or both eyes as determined by a physician

          -  To be eligible for the non-inflammatory arm of the study the study subjects must have
             no ocular inflammation in either eye as determined by a physician.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Inability to give informed consent
