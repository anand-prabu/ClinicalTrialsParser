This could lead not only to improvement in liver function and to\n      prevent bacterial infections and other complications but also to improve CD and to avoid its\n      consequences falls, HRQoL deterioration).\n\n      Recently, the investigators have observed that VSL#3 administration to rats with\n      experimental cirrhosis decreases bacterial translocation, inflammatory response and ascites\n      formation, without changes in intestinal flora. This suggests an improvement in intestinal\n      barrier that deserves further investigation.\n\n      VSL#3, through decreasing intestinal bacterial translocation and immune system modulation,\n      could improve cognitive function and prevent the consequences of CD, including falls and\n      HRQoL deterioration, in patients with cirrhosis."
