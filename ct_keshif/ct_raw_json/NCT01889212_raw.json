Patients with an activating mutation in the EGFR have high responds\n      rates to the treatment and should be treated with a EGFR inhibitor as first line of\n      treatment. Some wild type patients do as well respond but selection of these patients is\n      more difficult.\n\n      Erlotinib has been labeling with 11C and used as a new PET tracer. Accumulation of the\n      tracer (11C-erlotinib) in tumors has showed promising results for selection of responders.\n\n      The investigators now want to conduct a larger clinical study to evaluate if accumulation of\n      tracer on a pre-treatment 11C-erlotinib PET/CT can predict responds to erlotinib."
