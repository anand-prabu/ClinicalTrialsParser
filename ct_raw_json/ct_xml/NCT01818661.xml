  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to determine the relationship between structural and functional
      changes in the brain on imaging and progression of speech and language, neurological and
      neuropsychological features in patients with neurodegenerative apraxia of speech (AOS).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Apraxia of Speech (AOS) is a disorder of speech motor planning and/or programming that
      affects the production of speech, characterized by slow speaking rate, abnormal prosody and
      distorted sound substitutions, additions, repetitions and prolongations, sometimes
      accompanied by groping, and trial and error articulatory movements. While AOS is commonly
      associated with vascular insults, it can be the predominant manifestation of
      neurodegenerative disease. Apraxia of speech can be the only manifestation of a
      neurodegenerative disorder. However, AOS very often co-occurs with aphasia, particularly a
      non-fluent aphasia (NFA) of the Broca's type; a language disorder, typically characterized
      by agrammatic, telegraphic or truncated spoken language, often accompanied by similar
      difficulties with written language. Patients with neurodegenerative AOS can have varying
      degrees of NFA, with the aphasia considered more severe than the AOS in some patients, but
      with the AOS dominant in others. It is extremely rare to have a patient that presents with
      NFA that does not also have AOS. Patients with isolated AOS can develop NFA over time,
      although in some patients the AOS remains isolated for as many as 8-10 years.

      Patients with AOS can also develop dysarthria and other non-speech motor symptoms, such as
      extrapyramidal features, postural instability, extra ocular eye movement abnormalities and
      limb apraxia. Cognitive impairment can also develop, although is rarely an early feature of
      the disease. The syndrome is progressive with many patients eventually becoming mute.

      Studies have shown that patients with neurodegenerative AOS can be pathologically
      heterogeneous, with some cases showing deposition of the microtubule associated protein tau,
      while others have deposition of the TAR DNA binding protein of 43kDa (TDP-43). Typical tau
      pathologies that are observed include corticobasal degeneration, progressive supranuclear
      palsy (PSP) and Pick's disease. Clinical features are currently unhelpful in predicting the
      underlying pathology in these cases, although there is a suggestion that cases with isolated
      or dominant AOS may be more likely to show tau pathology, particularly PSP.

      This project will be the first to assess longitudinal multi-modality neuroimaging in
      subjects with neurodegenerative AOS. It will allow us to assess all aspects of disease
      progression in these subjects, including changes on neuroimaging, speech and language,
      neurological, and neuropsychological assessments, to get a complete picture of dysfunction
      and progression in these subjects. This project will also be the first to apply DTI and the
      recently developed technique of resting state fMRI to the study of this disease. These
      techniques are of great current interest to the field and provide, for the first time, a way
      of assessing underlying functional and structural connectivity across the brain. Both
      techniques provide important information about how disease progresses through the brain
      tissue and have huge potential to be important future biomarkers of many different
      neurodegenerative diseases.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  We will study subjects that fulfill clinical inclusion criteria for neurodegenerative
             AOS that have already been recruited as part of a cross-sectional speech and language
             based dementias study (R01 DC010367, PI Josephs) that began in February 2010.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with concurrent illnesses that could account for speech and language
             deficits, such as traumatic brain injury, strokes or developmental syndromes will be
             excluded.

          -  Subjects meeting criteria for another neurodegenerative disease at baseline
             evaluation will be excluded.

          -  Women that are pregnant or post-partum and breast-feeding will be excluded. All women
             who can become pregnant must have a pregnancy test no more than 48 hours before the
             PET scan.

          -  Subjects will also be excluded if MRI is contraindicated (metal in head, cardiac pace
             maker, e.t.c.), if there is severe claustrophobia, if there are conditions that may
             confound brain imaging studies (e.g. structural abnormalities, including subdural
             hematoma or intracranial neoplasm), or if they are medically unstable or are on
             medications that might affect brain structure or metabolism,(e.g. chemotherapy).

          -  Subjects will also be excluded if they do not have an informant, or do not consent to
             research.
