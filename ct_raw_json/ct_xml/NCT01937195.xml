  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will test a hypothesis that the AccuCath™ System will have a higher rate of
      successful first attempt PIV placement, higher completion of therapy, fewer complications,
      longer dwell times and higher user satisfaction compared to Conventional IV Catheters.

      Phase One is designed as a one arm prospective study to compare patients using the AccuCath™
      Intravenous Catheter System to the results found in literature.  Phase Two is designed as a
      two arm prospective randomized controlled study comparing the AccuCath™ Intravenous Catheter
      System to conventional PIV catheters.  This study site will be completing Phase One only.

    <description>Will measure the rate of observed (anticipated) complications of IV therapy - infection, occlusion, infiltration, extravasation, phlebitis, dislodgement, leaking/bleeding at site, patient complaints of pain without other identifiable cause, and other (up to 7 days).</description>

    <measure>Patient Satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline at catheter insertion and study exit at catheter removal expected to be no more than 7 days post placement</time_frame>

    <time_frame>baseline, and up to catheter removal expected to be no more than 7 days post placement</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>Yes</safety_issue>
    <description>Will measure the number and severity of adverse events associated with peripheral IV initiation and indwelling catheter time (anticipated to be similar in both groups) up to 7 days.</description>
