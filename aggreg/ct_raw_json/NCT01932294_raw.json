The history of prior hospitalizations will be available from\n      clinical records.\n\n      Routine evaluation and triage of ambulatory patients with advanced heart disease includes\n      echocardiography and functional assessment with peak oxygen consumption and frequently 6\n      minute walk distance. The elements of information required for estimation of the Seattle\n      Heart Failure Risk score will be gleaned from laboratory data, or imputed as described in\n      the Seattle score literature. The research coordinator will enter this data onto a currently\n      available website for calculation of the Seattle score.\n\n      Eligibility will be determined by the inclusion and exclusion criteria and the study\n      research team will approach individual subjects who are potential candidates for\n      participation once the subject's primary physician has given permission to approach.  Only\n      persons with a scientific or ethical reason will be excluded. Incarcerated prisoners have\n      been excluded by this protocol.\n\n      Participants will be followed every 6 months for 24 months after two baseline visits. The 6\n      month and 18 month follow ups consist of telephone interviews.  Follow ups at 12 months and\n      24 months consists of routine clinical visits.\n\n      Approximately 350 patients from 12 centers in the United States will be enrolled over a 12\n      month period."
