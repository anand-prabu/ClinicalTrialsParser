  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center study to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of two
      investigational devices, the Cook Custom Aortic Endograft and the Zenith t-Branch
      Endovascular Graft, in the treatment of aortic pathologies involving the visceral vessels.

      The two investigational devices offer an endovascular approach to treat complex aortic
      pathologies that cannot be treated with commercially available devices.  This customized,
      endovascular approach has the potential to decrease hospital length of stay, pulmonary
      complications, and in-hospital mortality.

      Once the participant has signed the approved informed consent the following tests will be
      done to determine final subject eligibility and which device will be used:

      Clinical Exam, Blood Tests, CT Scans (with and without contrast), Ultrasound, Abdominal
      Device X-ray, and Angiography.

      The participants will be followed for 5 years.

These tests will aid in the sizing of the the Zenith t-Branch Endovascular Graft. The Zenith t-Branch Endovascular Graft is a tubular graft with four branches and a covered stent at the proximal end that contains barbs for proximal fixation of the device. The graft is designed to be connected with celiac, superior mesenteric and two renal arteries via self-expanding covered bridging stents.</description>

                  (atherosclerotic/degenerative or saccular) involving or in close approximation
                  to the visceral segment of the aorta.

                    1. Diameter &gt;5.5 cm if asymptomatic, or 5.0 cm with enlargement of  &gt;0.5cm in
                       6 months.

                    2. History of growth &gt;0.5 cm per year

                    3. Any size if ruptured or symptomatic

               2. Penetrating aortic ulcer (PAU)

                    1. &gt;2.0cm in depth

        General Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Less than 18 years of age

          -  Life expectancy less than 12 months based on the surgeon's assessment

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding or planning on becoming pregnant within 60 months

          -  Inability or refusal to give informed consent

          -  Unwilling or unable to comply with the follow-up schedule

          -  Less than 30 days beyond primary endpoint for other investigative drug or device
             study

        Medical Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known allergy to the device components (i.e. stainless steel, polyester, solder,
             gold, or nitinol)

          -  History of anaphylactic reaction to contrast material that cannot be adequately
             premedicated

          -  Systemic or local infection that may increase the risk of endovascular graft
             infection.

          -  Baseline eGFR &lt;30mL/min (calculated by the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease
             formula) and not on hemo- or peritoneal dialysis.  If the patient is currently on
             dialysis, or is currently planning on initiating dialysis, then they may undergo
             repair.

          -  History of connective tissue disorders.

          -  Body habitus that would inhibit X-ray visualization of the aorta.

          -  Major surgical or interventional procedure unrelated to the treatment of the aneurysm
             planned â‰¤30 days of the endovascular repair.

          -  Unstable angina, defined as a progressive increase in symptoms, new onset at rest or
             nocturnal angina, or onset of prolonged angina.

          -  Irreversible coagulopathy

        Anatomical Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Aortic transection due to acute trauma.

          -  Aortic dissection.

          -  Infectious (&quot;mycotic&quot;) etiology of the aortic disease.

          -  Significant occlusive disease or tortuosity precluding delivery of the device
             components.

          -  Proximal Landing zone &lt;20mm in length.  The proximal landing zone can be within zones
             2 through 8, with least 20mm of proximal seal and fixation in aorta or Dacron.

          -  Proximal neck, defined as the thoracic aorta distal to the native left carotid
             artery, measured outer wall to outer wall on a sectional image (CT) &gt;41 mm in
             diameter or &lt; 18 mm in diameter

          -  Distal landing zone &lt;20mm in length if the landing zone is in the aorta, or &lt;20mm if
             the landing zone is in the iliac arteries or in Dacron (in the event the patient has
             had a previous or concomitant aortic or aorto-iliac reconstruction).

          -  Untreatable branch vessel stenosis.

          -  Anatomy that would not allow maintenance of at least one patent hypogastric artery.

          -  Signs that the inferior mesenteric artery is indispensable (i.e. angiographic
             visualization or a large IMA, filling of SMA via collaterals, stenosis of celiac or
             SMA or oblique views) and the indispensible IMA is not amenable to treatment with a
             graft branch or fenestration.

          -  Branching, duplication, aneurysm or untreatable stenosis of the celiac, SMA or renal
             arteries that would preclude implantation of the investigational devices.
