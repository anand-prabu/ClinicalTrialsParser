            "textblock": "Silicone gel-filled breast implants were introduced in the early sixties and were in\n      wide-scale distribution by the time the Medical Device Amendments to the Food Drug and\n      Cosmetic Act was passed in 1976.   In 1983, gel-filled breast implants were designated as\n      Class III devices requiring pre-market approval.  In May 1990, the Food and Drug\n      Administration (FDA) published a proposed request (515(b)) for Pre-market Approval\n      Applications (PMA) and in April 1991 published the final request.  This final publication\n      put manufacturers of gel-filled breast implants on notice that for continued marketing of\n      gel-filled breast implants, a PMA was due to FDA in 90 days from the final publication date.\n\n      A pre-market approval (PMA) for the Mentor gel-filled breast implants was filed with the FDA\n      in July 1991.  At the FDA General and Plastic Surgery Advisory Committee meeting in November\n      1991, the committee recommended the submission of additional information to establish the\n      safety and effectiveness of gel-filled breast implants.\n\n      In January 1992, the FDA Commissioner announced a voluntary moratorium of the sale of\n      gel-filled breast implants to allow the advisory panel time to assess additional\n      information.  In April 1992, the moratorium was lifted but only for reconstruction and\n      revision subjects.  Every subject implanted had to be part of an adjunct study, in addition\n      to being offered participation in a registry of gel-filled breast implant subjects.  In\n      order to be implanted with gel-filled implants for augmentation, women had to be enrolled in\n      an IDE clinical trial.\n\n      In September of 2000 the Core Gel study began, leading the way to the November 2006 FDA\n      approval of MemoryGel breast implant.\n\n      The objective of the CPG Styles Study is to determine the safety of the different styles of\n      Mentor's Contour Profile Gel (CPG) breast implants in  women undergoing breast augmentation,\n      reconstruction, or revision.\n\n      Throughout the duration of this study, patients are required to have follow-up visits at 10\n      weeks post-surgery and every year after surgery through the 10th year of study completion.\n\n      Total subject population: Up to 500 new subjects, plus up to 1500 subjects rolled over from\n      the CPG Continued Access Study will continue the 10-year follow-up under this protocol."

The Siltex\u00ae (textured) shell consists of a smooth shell bonded to an additional layer of silicone that has a textured pattern imprinted into its surface. The Siltex\u00ae shell is textured to provide a disruptive surface for collagen interface. The CPG implant contains a gel that is a more cohesive silicone gel than that used in other Mentor gel implants. The gel is made from the same materials as Mentor's standard gel. The contour shape of the CPG is designed to provide inferior projection with reduced superior fullness. The CPG mammary prosthesis contains raised orientation marks on the anterior and posterior of the implant which may help the physician ensure proper placement.\nThe Contour Profile Gel is available in sizes 125cc - 690cc and 4 styles with various projection and height options in this study.",
