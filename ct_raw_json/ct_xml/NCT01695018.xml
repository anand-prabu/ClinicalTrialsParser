      Background:Oral epithelial dysplasia (OED) is one of the common precancerous lesions among
      Chinese adults. To investigate the clinical predictive value of p16 methylation diagnostic
      reagents in the early diagnosis of oral cancer, the investigators carried out the
      prospective multi-center double-blind cohort study.

      Methods:180 patients with histologically confirmed mild or moderate OED were included in the
      present study. The investigators using p16 methylation diagnostic reagents to analysis of
      the p16 methylation status in these patients. Building two follow-up queue by p16-methylated
      and p16-unmethylated. The Statistical analysis used SAS6.12 software. All P-values were
      two-sided. P&lt;0.05 was considered to test for statistical significance difference.

        180 patients with mild or moderate oral epithelial dysplasia were selected. 82 of them
        were from Peking University of Stomatology and 68 were from Capital Medical University
        School of Stomatology and other 31 were from Fourth Military Medical University School of
        Stomatology.All of the patients with OED had been diagnosed pathologically by at least two
        senior pathologists using the criteria from '2005 WHO Classification System' and The oral
        tissue pathology diagnostic criteria (oral histopathology Edition Sixth).All cases
        involved primary lesions without any LASER, radiation therapy or chemotherapy.
