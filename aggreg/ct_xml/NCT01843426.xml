    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate contrast media volume, safety and 30-day outcome of
      patients after a computed tomography (CT) scan. The results of this study will help to
      determine the minimum volume of contrast material that can be used to ensure patient safety
      while not compromising diagnostic image quality in high-risk patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The scholarly rationale for the study is to determine the feasibility of restricting the
      contrast media volume to 60ml of 270mg Iodine (mgI)/ml iodixanol or less to accomplish
      sufficient intravascular attenuation for comprehensive CT assessment prior to TAVR. The
      study will also evaluate the effects of contrast media administration on our subjects'
      kidney function by performing serum creatinine measurements at baseline, as well as at three
      days and thirty days after contrast media administration.

    <description>An ECG-synchronized, contrast-medium enhanced CT study of the heart for the evaluation of the aortic root complex and general cardiac morphology will be obtained. This is immediately followed by a CT angiographic study of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis (beyond the femoral heads), which utilizes the same contrast bolus that is injected for evaluating the heart. This latter vascular study serves to evaluate the TAVR deployment catheter access route through the femoral, iliac, and aortic vascular stations. In clinical routine, we have been performing this type of study with total contrast media volumes ranging from 40-120 mL of iodinated contrast material.</description>
