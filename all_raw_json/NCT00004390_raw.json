Determine whether opioid (morphine) treatment results in better management\n      of pain than treatment with tricyclic antidepressant (nortriptyline).\n\n      II.

Determine whether the presence of psychiatric comorbidity, particularly depression, can\n      predict the outcome of the two treatments."

Patients are\n      stratified by the duration of pain (greater than 1 year or no greater than 1 year) and the\n      presence or absence of major depression.\n\n      Patients are randomized into 6 treatment order groups.  Patients start with nortriptyline,\n      morphine, or placebo, taken orally every day.  If patients are unable to tolerate\n      nortriptyline or morphine, they will receive desipramine or methadone instead.\n\n      A drug titration period lasting 3 weeks is ensued for administration of the first drug\n      treatment.  The goal of this titration period is to gradually increase the dose of the drug\n      to obtain maximal analgesic efficacy.  Drug dosage is maintained for a period of 3 weeks.\n      The drug dosage is tapered off and followed by a drug free period of 1 week."
