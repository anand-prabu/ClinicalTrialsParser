            "textblock": "Young adults with a history of preterm birth are identified as having a unique risk profile\n      for developing hypertension and having reduced exercise capacity. Globally, there are 15\n      million annual preterm births. In Europe, incidence is 6-15% of all births, with up to 6\n      million adults in the United Kingdom having a preterm birth history. Understanding the\n      associations between early life exposures and this early cardiovascular risk is extremely\n      important to be able to target primary prevention strategies.\n\n      As yet there are no clear explanations for the reduced exercise capacity and elevated risk\n      of hypertension reported in preterm born young adults. Magnetic resonance imaging studies of\n      young adult born premature demonstrated altered heart shape, with increased left ventricular\n      mass, reduced cavity sizes and reduced stroke volumes. The changes in cardiac size\n      identified from these studies is similar to those seen in other disease groups and has been\n      equated to greater than 50% increased risk of cardiovascular clinical events in these\n      groups. These structural changes may account for the reduced exercise capacity observed in\n      preterm born young adults\n\n      This study aims to understand the physiological determinants of limited exercise capacity\n      and associated cardiovascular risk profile of adult preterm born populations."
