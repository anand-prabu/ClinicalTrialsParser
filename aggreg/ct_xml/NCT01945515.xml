      1. Study objective To evaluate the effect of robotic-assisted gait training combined with
           transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) as compared to that of robotic-assisted
           gait training on gait function of subacute stroke patients

        2. Subjects subacute stroke patients who cannot walk independently

        3. Methods

             -  Group 1: Robotic-assisted gait training with anodal tDCS (30 min) + conventional
                gait training on ground (30 min)

             -  Group 2: Robotic-assisted gait training with sham tDCS (30 min) + conventional
                gait training on ground (30 min)

             -  Duration of treatment: 2 weeks, 5 times a week

             -  Evaluation: Baseline, 1 day after the treatment, 12 weeks after the treatment

    <description>tDCS will be applied on the primary motor cortex of the lower limb in the impared hemisphere during robotic-assisted gait training. Anodal tDCS will be applied with an intensity of 2mA for 20 min. Sham tDCS will be applied with an intensity of 2mA just for 1 min, after which the current will be slowly tapered down to 0 over a several seconds.</description>
