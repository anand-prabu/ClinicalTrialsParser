However, such a system would\n      prove useful in the clinical setting to improve the quality of surgical interventions at the\n      knee.\n\n      Hypothesis:\n\n      A novel knee kinematic assessment and surgical guidance tool using 3D personalized imaging\n      and minimally invasive bony fixation allows precise kinematic assessment and surgical\n      guidance in the routine clinical setting.\n\n      Objectives :\n\n        -  Demonstrating the capacity of the system to precisely measure 3D knee kinematics\n\n        -  Quantifying the reproducibility of the kinematic measurements\n\n        -  Measuring the impact of knee surgical procedures on knee kinematics\n\n        -  Assessing the correlations between measured articular kinematics and clinical results\n           after knee surgery\n\n        -  Integrating the novel measuring system to the surgical flow of three knee surgical\n           procedures\n\n        -  Quantifying the precision and reproducibility of the surgical actions guided by the\n           system\n\n        -  Comparing the clinical results of surgeries guided by the system to those performed\n           with the traditional technique"
