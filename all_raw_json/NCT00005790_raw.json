Correlate the findings of perfusion magnetic resonance imaging with known\n      tissue and serum markers of angiogenesis in patients with newly diagnosed surgically\n      resectable brain tumors.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients undergo perfusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning with contrast\n      in conjunction with preoperative conventional MRI scanning with contrast. Patients receive\n      gadopentetate dimeglumine IV over 5 seconds prior to perfusion MRI. Gadopentetate\n      dimeglumine is administered at a slower rate prior to conventional MRI. Patients undergo\n      blood draw to determine urokinase type plasminogen activator levels. After completion of\n      perfusion and conventional MRI scanning, brain tumor tissue samples are obtained during\n      surgical resection to determine tumor grade and type and urokinase type plasminogen\n      activator and basic fibroblast growth factor levels. If CSF removal is required during\n      surgery, then CSF samples are collected to determine urokinase type plasminogen activator\n      and basic fibroblast growth factor levels.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10 patients will be accrued for this study."
