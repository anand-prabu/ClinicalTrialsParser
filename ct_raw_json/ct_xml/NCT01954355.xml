      The primary aim of this trial is to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the
      recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of LDE225 given in combination with standard doses of
      paclitaxel in patients with advanced solid tumors. In addition, the preliminary anti-tumor
      activity of this combination will be assessed, in particular in ovarian cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open label phase I dose-escalation trial of LDE225 administered once
      daily (OD) with Paclitaxel administered weekly for three weeks (days 1, 8, 15) in 28-day
      cycles in adult patients with advanced solid tumors that have progressed despite standard
      therapy.

      The trial will consist of two parts. In Part A (dose escalation following a standard 3+3
      design), patients with previously treated advanced solid tumors will receive escalating
      doses of LDE225 in combination with standard Paclitaxel doses, to define the MTD and the
      RP2D of LED225 OD that can be given in combination with standard doses of Paclitaxel. Once
      the MTD and RP2D is established in 6 patients, then part B will start.

      Part B is an expansion cohort in 6 patients with advanced platinum-resistant ovarian cancer
      to further evaluate the safety of the combination and to assess for any preliminary
      antitumor activity.
