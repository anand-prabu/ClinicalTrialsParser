RDAD is an\n      evidence-based program with demonstrated efficacy in helping older adults with dementia\n      maintain physical function and remain physically and mentally healthy.  This study asks two\n      questions: 1) Can AAA partners successfully translate and implement RDAD, and 2) Is AAA\n      implementation of RDAD effective in producing desired outcomes among agencies, providers,\n      and older adults with dementia and their family members.  This study is being conducted in\n      Washington and Oregon states."
