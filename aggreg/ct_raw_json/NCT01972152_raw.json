History of regular alcohol consumption as defined by alcohol intake in a quantity\n             exceeding 7 drinks per week for females or 14 drinks per week for males, where 1\n             drink = 5 ounces (150 mL) of wine or 12 ounces (360 mL) of beer or 1.5 ounces (45 mL)\n             of hard liquor.\n\n         16. Participation in other studies involving administration of an investigational drug or\n             device within 30 days or 5 half-lives, whichever is longer, before screening for the\n             current study and during participation in the current study.\n\n         17. Blood donation of approximately 1 pint (500 mL) within 8 weeks prior to Screening.\n\n         18. Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory\n             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or\n             investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of\n             study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the subject\n             inappropriate for entry into this study."
