To evaluate the effects of oral ingestion of Sunphenon 90DCF-T during the period between\n      recruitment and biopsy on histologic findings in prostate tissue such as nuclear\n      measurements viz. shape, size and texture and quality of life (QOL) assessment.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\n      ARM A: Patients undergo active surveillance for 52 weeks.\n\n      ARM B: Patients receive green tea extract orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 52 weeks in the\n      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days."
