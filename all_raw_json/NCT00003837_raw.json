Treatment repeats every\n      21 days for a maximum of 12 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease\n      progression.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for one year and then every 6 months until death.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A minimum of 25 patients will be accrued for this study."
