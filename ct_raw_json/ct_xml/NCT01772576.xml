      The objective of this study is to gather data to establish the chronic safety, performance
      and effectiveness of the RELIANCE 4-FRONT™ Active Fixation Defibrillation Leads.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The RELIANCE 4-FRONT Defibrillation Lead Post Market Clinical Follow-Up Study is a
      prospective, non-randomized, multi-center, single-group, post market clinical study to
      establish the chronic safety, performance and effectiveness of the RELIANCE 4-FRONT active
      fixation defibrillation leads.

      A total of 167 patients (including 10 % attrition) are required to evaluate the Primary
      Endpoint.

      Up to 20 Investigational centers located in Europe and Asia Pacific. Lead-related
      Complication-Free Rate (CFR) from Implant through 3 Months Post-Implant.

      Lead-related complications associated with the RELIANCE 4-FRONT active fixation lead will
      count toward this endpoint.

      Lead-related Complication-Free Rate from 3 Months through 15 Months Post-Implant.

      Lead-related complications associated with the RELIANCE 4-FRONT active fixation lead will
      count toward this endpoint.

        -  Lead-related Complication-Free Rate from 3 Months through 24 Months Post-Implant

        -  Pacing Threshold at 0.5 ms pulse width at 3 Months Post-Implant

        -  Sensed Amplitude at 3 Months Post-Implant

        -  Pacing Impedance at 3 Months Post-Implant All endpoints will be assessed for the
           RELIANCE 4-FRONT active fixation lead.

      Clinic visits will occur at:

        -  Enrollment Visit (no later than 30 days prior to implant procedure)

        -  Implant Procedure (Day 0; all future follow ups based on this date)

        -  Pre-Discharge Clinic Visit (3 - 72 hours post-implant)

        -  One Month Clinic Visit (30±7 days)

        -  3 Month Clinic Visit (91 ± 21 days)

        -  6 Month Clinic Visit (180 ± 30 days)

        -  12 Month Clinic Visit (365 ± 45 days)

        -  18 Month Clinic Visit (545± 45 days)

        -  24 Month Clinic Visit (730 ± 45 days) The study will be considered completed after all
           subjects have completed the 24 Month follow-up and study completion is anticipated in
           2015.  Primary endpoint completion is anticipated after all subjects have completed the
           3 Month follow-up visit. All study required visits will be completed during clinic
           visits.

      Hypotheses testing in the RELIANCE 4-FRONT PMCF Study will use standard statistical
      methodology as specified more in detail in the protocol.
