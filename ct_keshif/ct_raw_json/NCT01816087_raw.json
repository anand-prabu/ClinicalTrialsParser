At the end of the consultation, the primary care physician\n      will fill a questionnaire where the absence/presence of syndromes will be recorded\n      (according to the findings of the BAT). Each patient will be then seen a second time by\n      expert geriatricians that will perform a full geriatric evaluation (90 minutes). This will\n      allow to calculate the performances of the intervention (BAT) in terms of sensibility\n      /specificity,..."
