Patients are stratified according to prior radiotherapy (yes vs no).\n\n      Patients undergo pretherapy imaging with indium In 111 anti-CEA monoclonal antibody MN-14 IV\n      over 30-40 minutes on day -7 or -6 followed by external scintigraphy on days -7 or -6 to 0.\n\n      Patients who show positive localization of at least one documented tumor site receive\n      90Y-hMN-14 IV over 30-40 minutes on day 0.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of 90Y-hMN-14 until the maximum tolerated\n      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2\n      of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed at 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks; every 3 months for 2 years; and then every 6\n      months for 3 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 10-14\n      months."
