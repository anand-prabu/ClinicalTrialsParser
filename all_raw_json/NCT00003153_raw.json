Patients with rapidly progressive disease may skip the initial cell dose and\n      proceed directly to dose escalation to receive CD3+ cells at a higher cell dose. Patients\n      who achieve complete response to the initial treatment may receive up to 2 additional\n      courses of escalating doses of CD3+ cells 8-12 weeks apart in the absence of unacceptable\n      toxicity. Patients are evaluated at 4 and 8 weeks after each infusion. Patients with disease\n      progression at 8 weeks are retreated at that time. Patients who achieve partial response or\n      stable disease at 8 weeks are re-evaluated at 12 weeks and may then be retreated.\n\n      Patients are followed every 2 weeks for 3 months, once a month for 9 months, and then every\n      2 months thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 22 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years."
