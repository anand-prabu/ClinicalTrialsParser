Breast or colorectal cancer patients receiving\n      neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy containing neurotoxic agents (taxanes or oxaliplatin)\n      at the University of Maryland Marlene & Stewart Greenebaum Cancer Center (UMGCC) will be\n      screened for CIPN.  Once these patients develop greater than or equal to National Cancer\n      Institute-Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI-CTC) grade 2 CIPN, they will be recruited for this\n      study.  Severity of CIPN as defined by NCI-CTC is listed in Appendix A. Patients will be\n      stratified based on cancer type (breast cancer vs colorectal cancer).  The patients will\n      then be randomly assigned to one of three arms: (A) real acupuncture, (B) sham acupuncture\n      or (C) standard care.  All patients will follow the same chemotherapy dose reduction\n      algorithm (Appendix B).  No concomitant anti-neuropathy medication is allowed.  Patients in\n      the intervention arms will be randomly assigned to undergo weekly real or sham acupuncture\n      until the end of their chemotherapy. In these two arms, the patient, the patient's medical\n      oncologist, pharmacist, research nurse, and study coordinator will be blinded to the\n      treatment assignment. In standard care arm, patients will not receive additional therapy for\n      CIPN.  Their CIPN will be managed according to the standard chemotherapy dose reduction\n      algorithm.  In all arms, chemotherapy dose will be documented during the patient's scheduled\n      chemotherapy sessions.  The chemotherapy relative dose intensity (RDI) will be calculated at\n      the end of their chemotherapy.  Validated patient-reported outcome questionnaires:\n      Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy/ Gynecologic Oncology Group-Neurotoxicity\n      (FACT/GOG-Ntx) questionnaire and Neuropathy Pain Scale (NPS), described later, will be used\n      to assess CIPN severity weekly in all patients until the end of their chemotherapy and at\n      the 4 week follow up.  Nerve conduction study will be performed by a neurologist at baseline\n      and after chemotherapy is finished.  Side effects from real or sham acupuncture will be\n      recorded weekly.  Approximately 4 ml of blood will be drawn from patients before each real\n      or sham acupuncture treatment, or with routine weekly blood work check (in the standard care\n      arm), at the end of chemotherapy, and at the 4 week follow up to measure changes in nerve\n      growth factor and other neurotrophic factors such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor,\n      neurotrophin-3, the insulin-like growth factors, and vascular endothelial growth factor.\n      They will be analyzed in the cytokine lab at the University of Maryland School of Medicine\n      (UMSOM)."
