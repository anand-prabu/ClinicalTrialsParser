Patients are stratified according to disease stage\n      (cutaneous stage IIB, IIC, III, and IV vs ocular and mucosal stage III and IV). Patients are\n      randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive vaccine with tyrosinase:368-376 (370D)/gp100:209-217\n           (210M)/MART-1:26-27 (27L) peptides emulsified with Montanide ISA-51 (ISA-51), low-dose\n           interleukin-12 (IL-12) subcutaneously (SC), and alum adjuvant SC on day 1 of weeks 1,\n           3, 5, 7, 11, 15, 19, 27, and 53.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive peptide vaccine emulsified with ISA-51, high-dose IL-12 SC,\n           and alum adjuvant SC on day 1 of weeks 1, 3, 5, 7, 11, 15, 19, 27, and 53.\n\n        -  Arm III: Patients receive peptide vaccine emulsified with ISA-51 on day 1 and low-dose\n           IL-12 SC and sargramostim (GM-CSF) SC on days 1-5 of weeks 1, 3, 5, 7, 11, 15, 19, 27,\n           and 53.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then\n      annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients (20 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this\n      study within 3 years."
