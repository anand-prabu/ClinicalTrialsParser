The virus, which can\n      manifest as a viral nephritis, was first described in a renal transplant recipient in 1971,\n      however it was not until the past decade that infection with BK virus became known as an\n      important contributor to graft dysfunction and graft loss after renal transplantation. It\n      has been widely accepted that emergence of BK virus correlates with the more potent\n      immunosuppressive agents currently used to lower acute rejection rates. In contrast to other\n      opportunistic infections after transplantation, for which routine prophylactic agents are\n      administered, there is no effective agent for the prevention of BK infection, nor is there\n      an effective agent for treating BK infection once it occurs.\n\n      Ciprofloxacin is a well known anti-infective agent in the fluoroquinolone class of\n      antibiotics. It is most active against gram-negative enteric pathogens, and is commonly used\n      for a variety of infectious indications.\n\n      Though classified as antibacterial agents, fluoroquinolones have been suggested to exhibit\n      anti-BK viral effects by interfering with helicase activity of the BK virus large T antigen.\n      Ciprofloxacin has been shown in previous studies to reduce urine BK viral load, and\n      BK-associated hemorrhagic cystitis in the stem cell transplant population. Ciprofloxacin has\n      also been associated with a lower incidence of BK viremia in one retrospective study in\n      kidney transplant recipients. Based on these reports, the investigators hope to find a\n      reduction BK viremia and BK nephropathy using a prospective, randomized study design."
