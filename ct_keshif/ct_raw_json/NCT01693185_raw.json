            "textblock": "A regimen with combined administration of midazolam and meperidine has been widely used and\n      provides quite satisfactory sedation as well as analgesia during colonoscopy. However, the\n      relatively long duration of midazolam and meperidine often prolongs the recovery time after\n      colonoscopy and delays discharge time. (Reimann FM , Samson U , Derad I et al. Synergistic\n      sedation with low-dose midazolam and propofol for colonoscopies . Endoscopy 2000 ; 32 : 239\n      - 44).\n\n      Remifentanil, an ultra-short-acting opioid, provides excellent pain control during\n      colonoscopy and its rapid onset and offset times are advantages over other conventional\n      opioids including meperidine, in avoiding prolonged discharge time after the colonoscopy.\n\n      A total 54 patients, aged 18-65 years in American Society of Anesthesiologists physical\n      status 1 and 2, scheduled for elective colonoscopy under Monitored Anesthesia Care in a\n      University Hospital, will be recruited after obtaining written informed consent.\n\n      Patients are allocated into one of two groups, Group 1 and Group 2 (27 patients each)\n      according to the patient identification number (PIN) at the recruitment.\n\n      All colonoscopic procedure is going to be performed by one Gastroenterologist (endoscopist).\n\n      At patients' arrival to colonoscopy room, basal values of heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen\n      saturation, respiratory rate and BIS score are recorded before administering the\n      investigational drugs and monitored every 2 min during the entire procedure in the\n      colonoscopy room as well as recovery period after procedure in the recovery unit.\n      Supplemental oxygen (3 L/min) is given through nasal prong with capnography transducer in\n      all patients.\n\n      Two min before the colonoscopy procedure, a bolus midazolam of 0.03 mg/kg with a bolus\n      meperidine of 1.0 mg/kg are given intravenously over 60 sec in Group 1 or those of\n      comparable amount of diluted remifentanil 0.4 mcg/kg are given in Group 2 at the colonoscopy\n      room, and a continuous infusion of diluted remifentanil of 0.04 mcg/kg/min is followed in\n      Group 2 or that of comparable amount of normal saline (placebo) is followed in Group 1.\n\n      The patients are asked to rate the degree of pain and satisfaction by a 100 mm VAS (0 =\n      minimum, 100 = maximum) just after passing the scope, during the scope, just after the\n      completion of the colonoscopy and at the discharge from the recovery unit.\n\n      After colonoscopy, the patients are transferred to the recovery unit and evaluated every 5\n      min until ready for discharge from the 30 min stay in the recovery unit.\n\n      The patients are considered recovered if when they achieved an Aldrete score of 10 (Aldrete\n      JA , Kroulik D . A postanesthetic recovery score. Anesth Analg 1970; 49: 924 - 34), have\n      stable vital signs, are able to tolerate oral fluids, have no nausea, vomiting, or itching,\n      and can walk unaided.\n\n      Assessment of readiness to ambulate is made by a blinded observer who remained with the\n      patient for the duration of recovery unit stay.\n\n      The observer is instructed that the patients are required to walk as if they were leaving\n      the recovery unit unescorted.\n\n      Time for achieving Aldrete score 10, patient's degree of pain, patient's satisfaction during\n      and after colonoscopy, patient's ability to recall the explanations and instructions given\n      during and before colonoscopy are determined and compared."
