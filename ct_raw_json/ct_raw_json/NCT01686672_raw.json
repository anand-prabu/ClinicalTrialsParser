Better pulmonary function, as measured by forced expiratory rate\n      in 1 second (FEV1), is associated with body mass index (BMI) above the 50th percentile for\n      age and gender for children with CF1.  Evidence based practice guidelines recommend that\n      nutritional treatment for children with CF ages 2 to 20 years should aim to achieve and\n      maintain a BMI > 50th percentile, however across 117 CF centers in the United States 57% of\n      girls and 56% of boys failed to meet this recommendation1.  The investigators have developed\n      a highly effective behavioral plus nutrition intervention (BE IN CHARGE) and demonstrated\n      its efficacy when delivered face-to-face to produce weight gain and its superiority over\n      nutrition education alone.  Although endorsed by the CF Foundation as an evidence-based\n      treatment, it is not available to most CF Centers or families due to lack of trained\n      personnel, cost, and distance issues.  With funding from the CF Foundation the investigators\n      developed a web-based delivery system of their efficacious behavioral plus nutrition\n      intervention for parents of children with CF ages 4 to 9 years of age. Using a Place\n      Outcomes Award the investigators have conducted beta testing of the web-intervention and\n      made appropriate modifications.   The current study represents the next steps in refining\n      and testing our web-based intervention.  This study will demonstrate feasibility and collect\n      pilot data on the effectiveness of the intervention in a pilot randomized trial of 20\n      treatment na\u00efve participants."
