Patients that were included\n      presented: 1) a diagnosis of COPD according to criteria set forth by the Global Initiative\n      for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (19), 2) compliance with medical management, 3) no\n      change in medical management and no decompensation episodes for at least one month prior to\n      study initiation, and 4) no participation in a regular physical exercise program for at\n      least six months prior to study initiation. Exclusion criteria consisted of the presence of\n      orthopedic or neurological conditions that would preclude participation in a physical\n      exercise program, a history of cardiac arrhythmias, a past history consistent with heart\n      disease, diabetes mellitus, arterial hypertension and failure to comply with the research\n      protocol.\n\n      Patients were randomly assigned to physical exercise training program PTG, (n=17) or to a\n      control group (CG, n=15) without aerobic exercise training by drawing of shuffled, opaque,\n      coded envelopes that were opened immediately before starting each case. However, after the\n      randomization process, five patients refused to continue and seven interested patients were\n      excluded.\n\n      Finally the groups were composed of PTG (n=10) and control group (CG, n=10). Heart rate\n      variability (HRV) on rest and during submaximal test was determined by linear analysis\n      (rMSSD and SDNN) and nonlinear indices SD1, SD2 and sample entropy (SE). In addition, the\n      physiological responses were obtained during cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPX), the\n      walking distance (WD) on six minute walking test and submaximal constant speed testing\n      (CST). PTP consisted of 30 minutes of aerobic exercise training on a treadmill, 3 times per\n      week at 70% of CPX peak speed rate. Patients were evaluated on baseline, 6 and 12 weeks.\n\n      All patients received regular treatment consisting of inhaled bronchodilators and steroids\n      and the dosage did not changed during the study. The study protocol was approved by the\n      Institutional Ethics Committee and all patients signed a written consent form prior to study\n      initiation (109/2006). The target number of patients was calculated to be 10 patients in\n      each group, based on a 5% type I error, a 2-sided test, and an 80% power to detect a change\n      between the groups in 5 to SD2 at rest. Considering a drop out of 20%, 12 patients in each\n      group were calculated. Due to the Gaussian distribution and/or homogeneity of variance in\n      variable values, parametric tests were selected for statistical analysis."
