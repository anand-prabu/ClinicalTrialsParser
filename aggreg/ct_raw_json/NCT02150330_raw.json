Eventually, patients with DOR\n      turn to adapt children instead. In recent studies, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEAS) supplement\n      might play a role in reverse diminished ovarian reserve and improve the prognosis of ART.\n      Cumulus cells, formed cumulus-oocyte complex (COC) with oocyte, play a important role in\n      folliculogenesis, oocyte maturation, oocyte meiosis and ovulation. Growing evidences\n      disclose there are crosstalks between oocyte and cumulus cells as paracrine regulations.\n      Aberration the crosswalks between oocytes and cumulus cells would be associated with poor\n      prognosis of folliculogenesis and further pregnancy outcomes. In patients under ovarian\n      hyper-stimulation protocol, the assessment of cumulus cells might be reliable indicators of\n      folliculogenesis, embryo development, pregnancy rate and pregnancy outcomes. These genes\n      (indicators), such as Hyaluronan synthase\uff08HAS2), Versican (VCAN), Thrombospondin 1 (THBS1),\n      Runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2), Chromobox homolog 3 (CBX3),Tripartite\n      motif-containing 28 (TRIM28), B-cell lymphoma 2  (BCL2)\uff0cBCL2-associated X protein (BAX).\n      This study was assess the gene expressions of cumulus cells after the DHEAS supplement in\n      patients with DOR under ovarian hyper stimulation protocol."
