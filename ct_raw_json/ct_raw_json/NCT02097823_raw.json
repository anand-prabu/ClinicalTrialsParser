Secondary objectives are to obtain preliminary data regarding the\n      effectiveness of olanzapine and aprepitant as well as the tolerability of olanzapine in the\n      pediatric oncology population.\n\n      Each patient must be planned to undergo at least 2 cycles of the same cycle of HEC.  Each\n      patient will be randomized to receive olanzapine or aprepitant in the first cycle of\n      chemotherapy, and then will receive the other agent in a second cycle of chemotherapy.\n      Patients will also receive ondansetron and dexamethasone with each cycle.  Patients with CNS\n      tumors will not receive dexamethasone.  Response will be measured objectively recording\n      number of emesis and use of breakthrough medications.  The medications chosen for\n      breakthrough medications will be at the treating physicians discretion.  A complete response\n      will be no episodes of emesis or use of breakthrough medications.  A partial response is one\n      or less episodes of emesis and one or less use of breakthrough medications.  Nausea will be\n      measured based on parent and patient scales and will be a separate measure, not included in\n      the compete or partial response."
