  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many patients who are candidates for nephron-sparing surgery, partial nephrectomy is now the
      standard treatment with a surgical, small, clinical T1 tumor (&lt;7 cm). In many recent
      studies, partial nephrectomy provides equivalent oncologic, and superior functional,
      outcomes compared with the standard radical nephrectomy over the short and long term (2, 3).
      Partial nephrectomy techniques, whether open, laparoscopic or robotic, typically involve
      hilar clamping, which creates the desired bloodless operative field, allowing for more
      precise tumor excision and renal reconstruction. This hilar clamping eventually may lead to
      ischemic kidney injury which can compromise the functional outcomes of the remaining
      kidney.We are working now to develop a novel technique of Hypo-Perfusion by achieving
      partial renal arterial clamping, with the goal of completely eliminating surgical ischemia
      to the renal remnant.
