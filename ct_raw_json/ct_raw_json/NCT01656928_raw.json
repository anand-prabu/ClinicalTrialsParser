At baseline, six and twelve months, a parent-completed\n      questionnaire assesses fruit and vegetable intake (primary outcomes) and water and sugared\n      drink consumption (other outcomes). Direct measurement assessed BMI, percentage body fat\n      (skin fold thicknesses) and waist-to-height-ratio. An intention-to-treat analysis used\n      random effects panel regression models to assess the intervention effect, adjusted for each\n      child's age, gender, immigrant background and maternal education.\n\n      Setting: 18 Preschools from three south German regions. Subjects: Healthy children from\n      three to seven years of age."
