A total of\n      up to 42 adults (aiming for 30 completed subjects) aged 18 years and older with T1D on\n      insulin pump therapy will be recruited through diabetes clinics and other established\n      methods in participating centres. Subjects who drop out of the study within the first 6\n      weeks of the first intervention arm will be replaced.\n\n      Subjects will receive appropriate training in the safe use of closed-loop insulin delivery\n      system. Subjects will have regular contact with the study team during the home study phase\n      including 24/7 telephone support. Subjects will be discouraged from international travel\n      during the first two weeks of closed-loop use.\n\n      The primary outcome is time spent in target range between 3.9 and 10.0 mmol/L as recorded by\n      CGM (adjusted for potential over-estimation) during home stay. Secondary outcomes are the\n      HbA1c, time spent with glucose levels above and below target, as recorded by CGM, and other\n      CGM-based metrics."
