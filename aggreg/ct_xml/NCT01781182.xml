  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Escalating resistance to antibiotics among disease-causing community bacteria increasingly
      threatens our ability to treat patients' infections. At the level of the physician-patient
      encounter, incentives at the patient level often take priority to society; this is often the
      case with antibiotic prescribing. Each patient level antibiotic treatment decision is based
      on how we value potential outcomes, including short-term benefits and risks and longer-term
      risks, including those related to future bacterial resistance to antibiotics. Unfortunately,
      antibiotics are often prescribed for illnesses unlikely to have a bacterial etiology; even a
      very small likelihood of benefit seems to outweigh an increased risk of future antibiotic
      resistance. While short-term effects of antibiotics on colonization with resistant bacteria
      have been demonstrated, the overall implications of each treatment for future individual,
      family and societal-level resistance remain difficult to quantify, and are often steeply
      discounted or ignored during decision-making. Knowledge regarding the longer-term effects of
      personal and household antibiotic use could better quantify these future resistance-related
      risks, and help guide antibiotic decision-making for physicians and patients.

      Infants are born with sterile nasopharyngeal and gastrointestinal tracts and yet, during the
      1st year of life, become important reservoirs of resistant organisms; this creates an
      opportunity to study colonization and resistance starting from a microbiological tabula
      rasa. In this proposal, we will use an observational cohort to following newborns'
      antibiotic exposure and longitudinal colonization with specific bacterial pathogens and
      related antibiotic resistance in the 1st year of life. Our hypothesis is that during the 1st
      year of life, infants with personal and household antibiotic exposure will have greater
      colonization with resistan organisms than infants without antibiotic exposure. This project
      will help us understand the development of bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics within
      the community, and help to inform judicious decision-making regarding antibiotic
      prescribing.
