  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe aplastic anemia (SAA)is characterized by the depletion of hematopoietic precursors
      associated with life-threatening complications. High-dose cyclophosphamide has been found to
      yield a complete response (CR) in adults and children with SAA.However, the optimal dosage
      of cyclophosphamide for patients in childhood remains unclear. So we explore the ideal
      dosage of cyclophosphamide for the treatment of children with SAA.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tisdale et al. (2000,2002) attempted to compare immunosuppression using ATG/CSA with
      high-dose cyclophosphamide (50 mg/kg/d for 4 consecutive days) plus CSA in a randomized
      trial of newly diagnosed adults with SAA. Both groups received CSA as part of the treatment
      regimen. However, the trial was terminated prematurely due to excessive morbidity among the
      patients treated in the cyclophosphamide arm. They documented that invasive fungal
      infections were severe among the cyclophosphamide group. Between January 2008 through May
      2009, in our department, nine pediatric patients with a diagnosis of SAA were enrolled a
      study with lower dose of cyclophosphamide with 30mg/kg/day for 4 consecutive days and
      combination with CSA, this study shows promise for children with severe aplastic anemia.Now
      we want explore the dosage of cyclophosphamide.

The dose of CSA was adjusted to maintain trough drug concentration above 150 μg/L and peak drug concentration  above 300 μg/L.
Drug, human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhG-CSF), 5 μg/kg/day subcutaneously starting 24 hrs after the fourth dose of cyclophosphamide, and it was withdrawed when ANC was &gt;1×109/L.</description>
