Low blood pressure on dialysis is not a good thing and it is associated\n      with an increased risk of death and hospitalizations.  It might be possible to minimize or\n      even prevent these low blood pressure episodes with a software that can be added to the\n      dialysis machine which detects the patient's changes in blood pressure and automatically\n      slows down how much fluid is being removed from the person.\n\n      The investigators hypothesize that a blood pressure guided biofeedback system (called\n      BioLogics RR) will result in a 30% reduction in the number of hypotensive episodes on\n      hemodialysis."
