    <textblock>
      This is an observational, multi-center study to assess clinical features and biologic
      biomarkers in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients compared to healthy controls (HC). The
      primary objective of this study is to discover clinical and biologic markers of PD for use
      in clinical trials of disease-modifying therapies.

      BioFIND is a two-year observational clinical study designed to discover and verify
      biomarkers of Parkinson's disease (PD). BioFIND is collecting clinical data and
      biospecimens, including blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), in a population of 120
      well-defined, moderately advanced PD subjects and 120 healthy controls.

      BioFIND will follow standardized data acquisition protocols to ensure that tests and
      assessments conducted at multiple sites can be pooled. Data and samples acquired from study
      participants will enable the development of a comprehensive Parkinson's database and
      biorepository, which will be available to the scientific community to conduct research on
      novel PD biomarkers.

        Inclusion Criteria (PD Subjects):

          -  Subjects must have bradykinesia and rigidity.

          -  Current or history of well documented resting tremor.

          -  Unilateral onset or persistent asymmetry.

          -  A well established response to dopaminergic agents including the presence of levodopa
             induced dyskinesia for at least 3 years according to treating physician's judgment.

          -  Subject has progressive PD of 5 to 18 years of duration from the onset of symptoms.

          -  Male or female age of onset of PD 50 to 70 by history.  Current ages would range from
             55 to 93 based on #5 and #6 requirements.

          -  Ability to provide written informed consent in accordance with Good Clinical Practice
             (GCP), International Conference on Harmonization (ICH), and local regulations.

          -  Willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, required study procedures and
             laboratory tests.

        Exclusion Criteria (PD Subjects):

          -  Family history of PD in first degree relatives.

          -  Ashkenazi Jewish subject (defined as all 4 grandparents being Ashkenazi Jewish) will
             be excluded because of the high likelihood of genetic forms of PD (LRRK2) and GBA),
             unless these have been already excluded by genetic testing.

          -  Has others serious neurological disorders (clinically significant stroke, brain
             tumor, hydrocephalus, epilepsy, other neurodegenerative disorders, encephalitis,
             repeated head trauma).

          -  Has early severe autonomic involvement. Symptomatic orthostatic, hypotension or
             urinary incontinence within one year of onset of disease symptom.

          -  Current treatment with anticoagulants (e.g., Coumadin, heparin) that might preclude
             safe completion of the lumbar puncture.

          -  Condition that precludes the safe performance of routine lumbar puncture, such as
             prohibitive lumbar spinal disease, bleeding diathesis, or clinically significant
             coagulopathy or thrombocytopenia.

          -  Any other medical or psychiatric condition or lab abnormality, which in the opinion
             of the investigator might preclude participation.

          -  Use of investigational drugs or devices within 60 days prior to baseline (dietary
             supplements taken outside of a clinical trial are not exclusionary, e.g., coenzyme
             Q10).

          -  Has lower body predominant symptoms.

          -  Has supra-nuclear gaze palsy, CG sign, corticospinal track signs.

        Inclusion Criteria (HC Subjects):

          -  Male or female age 55 to 93 years at visit 1.

          -  Ability to provide written informed consent in accordance with Good Clinical Practice
             (GCP), International Conference on Harmonization (ICH), and local regulations.

          -  Willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, required study procedures and
             laboratory tests.

        Exclusion Criteria (HC Subjects):

          -  Family history of PD in first degree relatives.

          -  Ashkenazi Jewish subject (defined as all 4 grandparents being Ashkenazi Jewish) will
             be excluded because of the high likelihood of genetic forms of PD (LRRK2) and GBA),
             unless these have been already excluded by genetic testing.

          -  Has other serious neurological disorders (clinically significant stroke, brain tumor,
             hydrocephalus, epilepsy, other neurodegenerative disorders, encephalitis, repeated
             head trauma).

          -  Has a history of cancer, autoimmune disorder, liver disease, or hematological
             disorders within the past 5 years.

          -  Has early severe autonomic involvement: symptomatic orthostatic hypotension or
             urinary incontinence within one year of onset of disease symptom.

          -  Current treatment with anticoagulants (e.g., Coumadin, heparin) that might preclude
             safe completion of the lumbar puncture.

          -  Condition that precludes the safe performance of routine lumbar puncture, such as
