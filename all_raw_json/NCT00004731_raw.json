A subject must have early PD that\n      does not require treatment.  A subject will be evaluated at a Screening Visit, a Baseline\n      Visit (after which the subject begins to take the study drug) and visits at 1, 4, 8, 12, and\n      16 months after the baseline visit.  The subject will be followed until she/he needs\n      treatment with levodopa or for a maximum of 16 months.  Because CoQ10 is a component of the\n      mitochondria (the part of a cell that makes energy), blood samples will be taken at the\n      baseline visit and the last visit to study mitochondrial function."
