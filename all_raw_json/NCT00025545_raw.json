Treating donor peripheral stem cells with filgrastim may increase the number of\n      donor white blood cells. This may help to decrease the rejection of the transplanted cells\n      in patients receiving them as treatment for acute leukemia.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of filgrastim-treated donor peripheral\n      stem cells in treating patients with acute leukemia who are undergoing peripheral stem cell\n      transplantation."

Donors then\n      undergo leukapheresis on days -1 and 0.\n\n      Patients undergo total body irradiation twice daily on days -7 to -4. Patients receive 2\n      doses of intrathecal methotrexate per local guidelines between days -10 and -3. Patients\n      also receive cyclophosphamide IV on days -3 and -2. Patients receive infusion of allogeneic\n      peripheral blood stem cells on day 0.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 5-60 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years."
