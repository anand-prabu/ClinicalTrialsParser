The investigators hypothesize that QGIT\n      clinics will identify LTBI and initiate isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) in a higher\n      proportion of patients and in a significantly faster timeframe. The cost-effectiveness of\n      linking QGIT with routine CD4 compared to routine TST will also be evaluated, and the\n      process of implementation of QGIT into the routine cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) blood\n      draw will be evaluated using a mixed method approach to identify steps that can be modified\n      for future scale-up of the intervention."
