Pramipexole is a non-ergot DA 3\n      receptor-preferring agonist. In contrast to pergolide, bromocriptine and cabergoline, it\n      does not stimulate 5-HT2B receptors and therefore does not cause cardiac valvulopathy. It\n      can therefore be safely used chronically at higher doses, whereas pergolide has been\n      withdrawn from the market for causing cardiac valvulopathy."

To ensure that subjects will not be at risk from cocaine, the\n             resting pulse must be < 90 bpm and the blood pressure must be < 150 mmHg systolic and\n             < 90 mmHg diastolic.\n\n          -  Have hematology and chemistry laboratory tests that are within reference limits\n             (\u00b110%), with the following exceptions: (a) total bilirubin must be < 2x upper limit\n             of normal and ALT, AST, and alkaline phosphatase <3\u00d7 the upper limit of normal and\n             (b) kidney function tests (creatinine and BUN) within normal limits.\n\n          -  Have a baseline ECG that demonstrates clinically normal sinus rhythm, clinically\n             normal conduction, and no clinically significant arrhythmias.\n\n          -  Have a medical history and brief physical examination demonstrating no clinically\n             significant contraindications for study participation, in the judgment of the\n             admitting physician and the principal investigator.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  Have any history or evidence suggestive of seizure disorder or brain injury.\n\n          -  Have any previous medically adverse reaction to cocaine, including loss of\n             consciousness, chest pain, or epileptic seizure.\n\n          -  Have neurological or psychiatric disorders, such as: psychosis, bipolar illness or\n             major depression as assessed by SCID; organic brain disease or dementia assessed by\n             clinical interview; history of any psychiatric disorder that would require ongoing\n             treatment or that would make study compliance difficult; and history of suicide\n             attempts within the past year and/or current suicidal ideation/plan.\n\n          -  Have evidence of clinically significant heart disease or hypertension, as determined\n             by the PI.\n\n          -  Have a family history in first-degree relatives of early cardiovascular morbidity or\n             mortality, as determined by the PI.\n\n          -  Have evidence of untreated or unstable medical illness including neuroendocrine,\n             autoimmune, renal, hepatic, or active infectious disease.\n\n          -  Have HIV and are currently symptomatic or are taking antiretroviral medication.\n\n          -  Be pregnant or nursing. Females must provide negative pregnancy urine tests upon\n             hospital admission and at the end of study participation. Females must either be\n             unable to conceive (i.e., surgically sterilized, sterile, or postmenopausal) or be\n             using a reliable form of contraception (e.g., abstinence, birth control pills,\n             intrauterine device, or condoms with spermicide).\n\n          -  Have asthma or currently use theophylline or other sympathomimetics.\n\n          -  Have any other illness, condition, or use of psychotropic medications, which in the\n             opinion of the PI and/or the admitting physician would preclude safe and/or\n             successful completion of the study."
