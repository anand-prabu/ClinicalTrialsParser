            "textblock": "Up to 16 patients with confirmed low- or intermediate risk prostate cancer scheduled for a\n      radical prostatectomy will be asked to have the Irreversible Electroporation (IRE) procedure\n      approximately 30 days prior to the prostatectomy. Ablation with IRE will be performed using\n      similar planning criteria, procedure protocol, instruments and software used for\n      brachytherapy, a conventional targeted radiation therapy where radioactive seeds are\n      implanted into prostate tumours. Patients will have an ultrasound of the prostate and the\n      imaging data will be entered into the Planning Software system. The volume of the prostate\n      is measured and a specified ablation zone will be determined. The IRE will be performed\n      under general anaesthetic and the specified zone identified in the planning stage will be\n      ablated. Four IRE electrode needles will be placed into the prostate under ultrasound image\n      guidance. When the needles are in place, electric pulses of one to two minutes duration are\n      used to ablate the specified zone. The total procedure time will be approximately 1 hour.\n      Safety data will be collected and patients will be followed up at 1 week, 2 weeks post IRE,\n      pre- prostatectomy, post prostatectomy and 1 week post prostatectomy. The safety data\n      collection is at 2 weeks post IRE. Before the IRE procedure, patients will have a Magnetic\n      Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Contrast Enhanced Ultrasound (CEUS) of the prostate. The\n      patients will have their scheduled prostatectomy at approximately 30 days after the IRE\n      procedure. Pre-prostatectomy, the ablation zone will be radiologically assessed by a control\n      MRI/CEUS. Post prostatectomy, efficacy of ablation will be determined by histological\n      examination of the prostate by the Pathology Department and measured as complete or\n      incomplete ablation.\n\n      The primary outcome is safety as measured by the composite of procedural device and post\n      procedural adverse events, measured with the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events\n      v 4 (CTCAE), Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) score, International Prostate\n      Symptom Score (IPSS) or required catheterization time and International Index of Erectile\n      Function (IIEF) and efficacy of ablation determined by histological examination post\n      prostatectomy. Secondary outcomes will be patients procedure satisfaction measured by\n      patient satisfaction questionnaire, post procedural pain management and Visual Analogue\n      Scale (VAS) pain score, time to ambulation, length of hospital stay."
