The transfer will be conducted in up to 2 hours after the oocytes collection, when the semen and up to 3 oocytes will be transferred.  Surplus oocytes will be cryopreserved for future use. We will use a Sydney catheter (Cook Medical Inc., Bloomington, IN, USA) coupled to a 1 mL syringe to perform the transfer. The catheter will be loaded with oocytes and semen prepared in the following sequence: 10 \u00b5L of the prepared semen, a small space of air, 20 \u00b5L of the medium containing the oocytes, another small space of air and more 10 \u00b5L of prepared semen. The catheter will be placed through the endocervical canal up to the endometrial cavity guided by transabdominal ultrasound, where the liquid will be released. We will try to place the point of the catheter 1.0-1.5cm before touching the fundus of the endometrial cavity and release the liquid slowly, in approximately 30 seconds."

            "textblock": "Background: The cost for the treatment of infertility are limiting for the health care\n      access, particularly if we consider that the success rate per cycle is approximately 35%.\n      Alternative regimens for controlled ovarian stimulation (COS)have been described in the\n      medical literature, that lead to a lower cost, fewer injections and less risk of adverse\n      events, particularly ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. Furthermore, some services report\n      excellent results with less manipulation as possible, which reduces the cost of laboratory\n      of human and ethically be considered less complicated once fertilization occurs in the\n      uterus and not in vitro.\n\n      Objectives: The main objective is to compare the reproductive outcomes between intrauterine\n      transfer of gametes (TG) and embryos (TE), the secondary objective is to estimate the\n      average number of eggs that are raised when using an EOC reduced cost.\n\n      Methods: This study will be conducted in the area of Human Reproduction, Department of\n      Gynecology and Obstetrics Hospital of the FMRP-USP. We will conduct an open controlled study\n      with random allocation of the participants in a 1:1 ratio, and we plan to include 100\n      participants. All participants will undergo an EOC reduced cost. We will compare the chance\n      of the treatment (TE or TG) result in a live birth and clinical pregnancy per woman\n      allocated and to estimate the number of oocytes retrieved considering all participants."
