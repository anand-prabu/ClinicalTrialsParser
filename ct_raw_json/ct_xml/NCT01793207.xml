  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) is on the rise on a global scale. The number of
      cancer-related deaths related to CRC is also rising to an alarming level. This picture is
      similarly seen in Egypt where the incidence of colorectal carcinoma is increasing annually,
      moreover, CRC in Egypt exhibits an alarming characteristic which is the affection of much
      younger patients than their counterparts worldwide. Fortunately, the early detection of CRC
      and its precursor (adenoma) has been shown to markedly decrease morbidity and mortality
      related to this tumor, this has prompted the development of robust screening programs for
      CRC in several western countries. The implementation of a CRC screening program in Egypt has
      been hampered by the low compliance of the patients and the relatively high cost of
      colonoscopy. There is a need for an affordable, non-invasive, simple, accurate and socially
      accepted screening test to allow such a program to succeed in Egypt. Recent studies have
      shown that DNA is the future target of screening tests for several malignancies.
      Particularly for CRC a few preliminary studies have shown encouraging results with separate
      DNA methylation markers both in blood and stool. In our efforts to develop a screening test
      with the criteria stated above, the investigators have decided to join the forces of 2 of
      the largest medical centers in Egypt and the middle-east: Kasr-Alaini hospital and the
      National cancer institute (NCI). The investigators plan to test a panel of 7 DNA methylation
      markers in peripheral blood for their performance as an early marker for CRC and colorectal
      adenomas. Data from this study will pave the way for the development of a screening test for
      CRC &quot;tailored&quot; to the Egyptian population, moreover, it will supply essential data about the
      genetic alterations occurring in CRC in Egyptian patients.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients undergoing colonoscopy as part of their clinical care or part of   screening
             program.

          -  Complete endoscopic examination (up to the caecum)

          -  Adequate colonic preparation

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  - Incomplete colonoscopic examination due to technical causes e.g. difficult
             colonoscopy, patient intolerance (N.B. a neoplastic mass causing lumen stenosis will
             not be excluded.)

          -  Poor colonic preparation obscuring adequate mucosal examination.

          -  Patients who have received any treatment for CRC and/or adenomas.

          -  Patients with known malignancy elsewhere (i.e. non-colorectal malignancy)
