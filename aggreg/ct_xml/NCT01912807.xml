  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to test the efficacy of intravenous dextrose in preventing POV in
      pediatric population undergoing dental day surgery at the Prairieview Surgery Centre in
      Saskatoon.

      In previous studies IV dextrose has demonstrated to reduce postoperative nausea and
      vomiting. It is a commonly used and safe intervention that could potentially reduce the
      amount of rescue antiemetic medications, improve recovery in same-day surgery pediatric
      patients as well as the impact on patient and parents satisfaction after the procedure.

      Healthy pediatric patients (ages 3 - 9) with Physical Status Classification System American
      Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) I and II scheduled for ambulatory dental surgery will be
      enrolled to determine the rates of postoperative vomit (POV) after intraoperative
      administration of IV dextrose in Normal Saline (D5NS).

      The assignment of the participants will be done randomly. The intervention group will
      receive D5NS at maintenance intravenous rate. The control group (150 patients) will receive
      Normal Saline (NS) not containing dextrose at a similarly calculated intravenous rate. Both
      groups (intervention and control) will receive Dexamethasone as standard antiemetic
      prophylaxis. As a second antiemetic, the control group will receive Ondansetron and the
      intervention group will receive D5NS at an intravenous rate calculated based on their weight
      and determined for the purpose of the study.

      Patients will then undergo a general anesthetic maintained with a volatile anesthetic and
      including endotracheal intubation, crystalloids (RL or NS) for IV fluid replacement therapy
      as well as narcotics and other medications at the discretion of the anesthetic provider
      based on the standard of care from the American Society of Anesthesiologists. While the
      patient is asleep, under general anesthetic, the blood sugar level will be measure using a
      chemstrip and a glucometer. There is no need to send any sample to the laboratory for
      results.

      The researchers will be in the Post Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU) in order to document the
      measured outcomes at different times; immediate postoperative period and 2 hours
      postoperatively / discharge time; as this is the length of stay in the PACU before
      discharge.

      The researchers will also follow up with the participants/parents 24 hours after discharge
      via telephone and record the same outcome variables, including any medical attention sought
      after discharge due to POV.
