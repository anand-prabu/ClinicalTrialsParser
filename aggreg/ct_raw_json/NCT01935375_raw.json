The (a) feasibility, (b) acceptability and (c) safety of a psychological intervention\n           (Interpersonal Psychotherapy [IPT]) provided by nurse midwives in collaboration with a\n           mental health team (psychiatrist team leader and a licensed social worker) for\n           treatment of PPD in a pilot two-armed non-randomized clinical trial.\n\n        2. The preliminary evidence of efficacy of IPT in decreasing depressive symptoms when\n           administered via telephone by nurse-midwives/ women's health nurse practitioner\n\n        3. The proposed study will also evaluate preliminary evidence for the efficacy of IPT\n           administered by nurse midwives in\n\n             1. Improving the general level of maternal functioning\n\n             2. Specific improvement in marital adjustment\n\n             3. Increase in maternal infant bonding\n\n      This pilot study is the first step in developing an intervention to decrease depressive\n      symptoms, improve functioning, improve interpersonal relationships between mother and spouse\n      and infant, improve access to care, and improve treatment engagement among postpartum women\n      diagnosed with PPD. The intervention will be cost-effective, brief and acceptable to both\n      patients and nurse midwives for incorporation into current midwifery practice. If the IPT\n      program is found to be feasible, acceptable and safe with preliminary evidence of efficacy,\n      a postpartum IPT manual for advanced practice nurses will be finalized in order to test\n      whether other advanced practice nurses such as pediatric nurse practitioners and family\n      nurse practitioners can also safely and effectively administer IPT in a full-scale\n      randomized clinical trial"
