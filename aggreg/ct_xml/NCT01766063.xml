        The study population will consist of patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis
        (RRMS) or patients with a clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) with an Expanded Disability
        Status Scale (EDSS) score ≤5 who tolerate Betaferon according to the investigator's
        evaluation, but have not received Betaferon longer than six months. Participants will be
        recruited from private neurological offices and neurology departments throughout Germany.

        In this non-interventional observational study, the decision on the duration and dosage of
        treatment is solely at the discretion of the attending physician.

        The medication is prescribed at regular visits to the investigator's office. Commercially
        available product will be used to treat the patients.
