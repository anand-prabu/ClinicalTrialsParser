This is to verify the diagnostic properties of the CAM (French version)\n      compared to the gold standard represented by the confused state of psychiatric diagnosis\n      using the DSM.\n\n      A representative sample of geriatric patients for whom a delirium is suspected, will be\n      recruited in the various participating centers, patients will undergo two consecutive\n      visits:\n\n        -  A visit by a geriatrician, during which the confused state of the patient will be\n           evaluated using the French version of the CAM.\n\n        -  A visit by a psychiatrist during which the diagnosis of confusional state will be\n           evaluated using the gold standard criteria of the DSM IV.\n\n      These two evaluations will be conducted on the same day and blinded from each other.\n\n      The order of these two procedures will be balanced within each center. This process will\n      allow the calculation of diagnostic parameters of the CAM French version (validation\n      competitive): sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values\u200b\u200b."
