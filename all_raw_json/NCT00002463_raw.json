            "textblock": "OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the efficacy of high-dose methotrexate (HMTX) in combination with\n      mechlorethamine, vincristine, prednisone, and procarbazine (MOPP) in infants or young\n      children with primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNET) (including medulloblastoma, anaplastic\n      ependymoma, ependymoblastoma, or pineoblastoma) or high-grade astrocytoma. II. Determine\n      whether the addition of HMTX to MOPP (MMOPP) improves the continuous complete response rate\n      of MOPP alone and eliminates the need for salvage with radiotherapy in these patients. III.\n      Determine the ability of MMOPP to provide neuroaxis prophylaxis or to treat spinal\n      metastasis without radiotherapy in infants or young children with PNET. IV. Determine the\n      toxicity of this regimen in terms of neurologic and neuropsychologic sequelae, growth, and\n      development in these patients. V. Correlate the efficacy of this regimen with the\n      histopathologic diagnosis of these patients. VI. Determine the optimum method for\n      radiographic evaluation of spinal cord disease in patients with PNET. VII. Determine the\n      utility of sequential spinal cord radiography as a means of monitoring PNET in these\n      patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients undergo maximum tumor debulking. Patients who have undergone incomplete\n      resection proceed to induction. Patients with a primary diagnosis of primitive\n      neuroectodermal and pineal tumors or glioblastoma multiforme who have undergone total\n      resection proceed to induction. Induction: Patients receive high dose methotrexate (HMTX) IV\n      over 6 hours on day 1. Beginning 3 hours after completion of HMTX infusion, leucovorin\n      calcium (CF) is administered IV over 30 minutes every 3 hours for 9 doses. Beginning 3 hours\n      after completion of the last CF infusion, oral CF is administered every 6 hours for 8 doses.\n      Patients receive a second HMTX infusion beginning 1 week after completion of the first HMTX\n      infusion. Beginning 1 week after completion of the second HMTX infusion, patients receive\n      mechlorethamine IV and vincristine IV on days 1 and 8, oral procarbazine and oral prednisone\n      on days 1-10, and tapered doses of prednisone on days 11-13 (MOPP). Maintenance: Beginning 4\n      weeks after initiating the first course of MOPP, patients receive HMTX on day 1 and MOPP\n      beginning on day 4. Treatment continues every 31 days in the absence of disease progression\n      or unacceptable toxicity. After 1 year or 14 doses of HMTX, whichever occurs first, HMTX is\n      discontinued and treatment with MOPP alone continues every 4 weeks in the absence of disease\n      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Treatment is discontinued after 2 years if the patient\n      is in continuous complete remission.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 5-25 patients will be accrued for this study within 24-30\n      months."
