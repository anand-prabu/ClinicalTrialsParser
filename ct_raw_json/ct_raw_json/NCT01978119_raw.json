The study consists of six phases:\n      Pre-screening, Screening/Run-in (3 weeks), Treatment Period 1 (12 weeks), Washout (minimum 3\n      weeks), Treatment Period 2 (12 weeks) and Follow-up (1 week). The total duration of the\n      study for each subject will be at least 31 weeks."

Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of\n             postmenopausal status before study enrolment. For most forms of HRT, at least 2 to 4\n             weeks should elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this\n             interval depends on the type and dosage of HRT. After confirmation of their\n             postmenopausal status, they can resume use of HRT during the study without use of a\n             contraceptive method; child-bearing potential and is abstinent or agrees to use one\n             of the contraception methods for an appropriate period of time (as determined by the\n             product label or investigator) before the start of dosing to sufficiently minimise\n             the risk of pregnancy at that point. Female subjects must agree to use contraception\n             until at least 2 days post the last dose of study treatment; abstinence from\n             penile-vaginal intercourse must be consistent with the preferred and usual lifestyle\n             of the subject.\n\n          -  Severity of disease: A best prebronchodilator FEV1 of >=40% to <=85% of the predicted\n             normal value at Visit 1 (Screening and Run-in Visit). Predicted values will be based\n             upon National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) III. If a subject is\n             recorded as having Hispanic or Latino ethnicity, then the Mexican-American equations\n             will be used (irrespective of race). If a subject is recorded as being of\n             African-American/African heritage race, then the African American equations will be\n             used. If a subject is recorded as being of Asian race, then the Asian adjustment will\n             be used. Otherwise, the Caucasian equations will be used.\n\n          -  Reversibility of disease: Demonstrated >=12% and >=200 mL reversibility of FEV1\n             within 10 to 40 minutes after 2 to 4 inhalations of salbutamol inhalation aerosol (or\n             equivalent nebulised treatment with salbutamol solution) at Visit 1 (Screening and\n             Run-in Visit).\n\n          -  Current anti-asthma therapy: All subjects must be using an Inhaled Corticosteroid\n             (ICS) with or without long-acting beta-adrenergic agonist (LABA) for at least 8 weeks\n             and a stable dose for at least 4 weeks before Visit 1 (Screening and Run-in Visit).\n             Two populations are eligible for enrolment:  -  Subjects maintained on ICS\n             monotherapy (FP 100 mcg to 250 mcg BID or equivalent) for at least 8 weeks and a\n             stable dose for at least 4 weeks before Visit 1 (Screening and Run-in Visit) or\n             Subjects maintained on an ICS/LABA combination product (e.g., Fluticasone\n             propionate/salmeterol 100/50 or 250/50 mcg BID or equivalent by other combination\n             products or by separate inhalers) for at least 8 weeks and a stable dose for at least\n             4 weeks before Visit 1 (Screening and Run-in Visit).

NOTE: Subjects on low dose ICS\n             monotherapy should only be enrolled, if, in the opinion of the investigator, after\n             review of their medical history and clinical examination, they will be able to\n             benefit from both an increase in ICS dose and the addition of LABA therapy arising\n             from and ICS/LABA combination.\n\n          -  Ability to withhold LABA therapy: Other than what is provided during the study, LABA\n             therapy is not permitted on the day of Visit 1 (Screening and Run-in Visit) and\n             throughout the entire study. The last dose of LABA and LABA/ICS combinations are to\n             be taken on the day before Visit 1. Sites should contact the medical monitor to\n             discuss subject eligibility, for doses of commonly prescribed ICS and ICS/LABA\n             combination medication; as mentioned in the study protocol.\n\n          -  SABA: All subjects must be able to replace their current SABA treatment with rescue\n             salbutamol/albuterol at Visit 1 (Screening and Run-in Visit) for use as needed for\n             the duration of the study.

As such, the\n             investigator will determine the clinical significance of any ECG abnormality and\n             determine if a subject is precluded from entering the study. At Visit 1 (Screening\n             and Run-in Visit), ECG safety criteria must be: QT interval corrected for heart rate\n             (QTc) or QT interval corrected for heart rate according to Fridericia formula (QTcF)\n             <450 msec or QTc <480 msec for subjects with bundle branch block; Investigators will\n             be responsible for ensuring appropriate clinical interpretation of ECGs.\n\n          -  The subject and/or the subject's legal guardian (if applicable) must be capable of\n             giving informed consent/assent, which includes compliance with the study requirements\n             and restrictions listed in the consent/assent form.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  History of life-threatening asthma: Defined for this protocol as an asthma episode\n             that required intubation and/or was associated with hypercapnia, respiratory arrest\n             or hypoxic seizures within the last 10 years\n\n          -  Respiratory infection: Culture-documented or suspected bacterial or viral infection\n             of the upper or lower respiratory tract, sinus or middle ear that is not resolved\n             within 4 weeks of Visit 1 (Screening and Run-in Visit) and led to a change in asthma\n             management, or in the opinion of the investigator, is expected to affect the\n             subject's asthma status or ability to participate in the study\n\n          -  Asthma exacerbation: Any asthma exacerbation requiring oral corticosteroids within 12\n             weeks of Visit 1 (Screening and Run-in Visit) or that resulted in overnight\n             hospitalisation requiring additional treatment for asthma within 6 months before\n             Visit 1 (Screening and Run-in Visit)\n\n          -  Concurrent respiratory disease: A subject must not have current evidence of\n             pneumonia, pneumothorax, atelectasis, pulmonary fibrotic disease, bronchopulmonary\n             dysplasia, chronic bronchitis, emphysema, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or\n             other respiratory abnormalities other than asthma\n\n          -  Other concurrent diseases/abnormalities: A subject must not have any clinically\n             significant, uncontrolled condition or disease state that, in the opinion of the\n             investigator, would put the safety of the subject at risk through study participation\n             or would confound the interpretation of the efficacy results if the condition/disease\n             exacerbated during the study.
