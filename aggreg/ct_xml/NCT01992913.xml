  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Schizophrenia is associated with serious problems with cognitive skills, social skills, and
      functional skills (like employment). There is a new form of cognitive behavioral therapy
      called integrated cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) that specifically addresses the
      cognitive, social, and functional deficits of schizophrenia. This study is to compare iCBT
      to another treatment that has been shown to be helpful in schizophrenia called
      psychoeducation (PE). We will compare iCBT to PE in subjects with schizophrenia who are
      enrolled in a Supported Employment (SE) program, and evaluate whether iCBT is more helpful
      in improving job performance, and other areas of functioning both right after treatment, and
      6 months after the end of treatment.

      The objective of the current proposal is to evaluate whether integrated cognitive behavior
      therapy (iCBT) can improve engagement and success in an existing Supported Employment (SE)
      program among the most functionally disabled patients with schizophrenia. The iCBT condition
      also includes computerized cognitive remediation. Our primary specific aim is to determine
      whether iCBT will significantly improve work outcomes at post-treatment to a greater extent
      than Psychoeducation (PE) in low functioning patients with schizophrenia who join the SE
      program. Our secondary aims are to evaluate the whether iCBT will significantly improve work
      outcomes at 6 month follow-up relative to PE, and whether iCBT will improve functional
      outcomes post-treatment and at follow-up relative to PE in subjects who join the SE program.

    <description>The SLOF is a self-report behavioral rating scale used to assess mentally ill patients' level of functioning in the community and in mental hospitals. The 30-item scale emphasizes patients' everyday behaviors rather than emotional or mental capacity, and it focuses on patients' tangible strengths and skills rather than on patients' weaknesses.</description>
