Both groups will review their baseline and 12-week diabetes risk score\n      results at the conclusion of the program and will be followed for an additional twelve\n      weeks.  Attendance rates and changes in weight, BMI, abdominal circumference,  blood\n      pressure, HgA1c, fasting blood glucose, cholesterol, and diabetes risk score will be\n      compared between the groups."
