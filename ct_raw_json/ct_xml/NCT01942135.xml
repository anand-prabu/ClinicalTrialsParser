  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, Phase 3 clinical trial with the
      primary objective of demonstrating the superiority of palbociclib in combination with
      fulvestrant (Faslodex®) over fulvestrant alone in prolonging PFS in women with HR+, HER2
      negative metastatic breast cancer whose disease has progressed after prior endocrine
      therapy.  The safety between the two treatment arms will also be compared.  During study
      treatment, pre- and perimenopausal women must be receiving therapy with the LHRH agonist
      goserelin (Zoladex® or generic).
