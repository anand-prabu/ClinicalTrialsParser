  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this randomized controlled study was to examine the effects of a 8 weeks
      innovative training regime (stochastic resonance whole-body vibration [SR-WBV] and virtual
      virtual games [VG]) in the skilling up phase on physical performance, strength and cognition
      in an frail elderly population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is based on the physical performance classification for elderly (PPCfE). The
      PPCfE was determining by the total score of the short physical performance battery (SPPB).
      Status (pre-)frail: 0 - 6 points; status mobile: 7 - 10 points; status trained: 11 - 12
      points.

      Sensorimotor and strength exercise are methods to increase strength &amp; power in the field of
      geriatrics. The question that arise what exercises are best suited to and most effective for
      (pre-)frail elderly individuals. Such populations are advised first to enter a &quot;skilling up
      program&quot; before more traditional forms of training exercises are implemented.

      Goals in the skilling up phase: improvement in neuromuscular control, postural control and
      strengthening of large muscle groups of the lower extremity.

      The aim of the study in the skilling up phase:

      Study the effect on physical performance Study the effects on muscle strength. Study the
      effects on cognition. The participants will be recruited in Canton Bern - Swizerland and
      will be randomly allocated to an intervention group or sham group.

    <description>Short physical performance battery (SPBB): The SPBB examines 3 areas of lower extremity function: standing balance (semi-tandem stand, side-by-side stand, full tandem stand), usual walking speed and ability to stand from a chair.

    <description>The trail-making test is a neuropsychological test of visual attention and task switching. The task requires a subject to 'connect-the-dots' of 25 consecutive targets on a sheet of paper. Two versions are available: A, in which the targets are all numbers (1,2,3, etc.), and B, in which the subject alternates between numbers and letters (1, A, 2, B, etc.). The goal of the subject is to finish the test as quickly as possible, and the time taken to complete the test is used as the primary performance metric.</description>
