Those with a viral load below 50 copies/ml (<50 cps/ml) will undergo a repeat test\n      ideally 4-6 weeks later (allowed up to 12 weeks); if the viral load is confirmed as <50\n      cps/ml the patient will be invited to join the randomised phase of the study. Patients\n      (n=150) will be randomised 1:2 to either continue the current triple ART regimen (n=50) or\n      switch to DRV/r monotherapy (n=100). The primary end-point will be viral load suppression\n      <400 cps/ml at week 24; secondary end-points will be viral load suppression <50 cps/ml at\n      week 12 and week 24, safety, tolerability, and emergence of protease inhibitor (PI)\n      drug-resistance. Patients will continue observational follow-up depending on the treatment\n      arm they are randomized to. After week 48, patients will return to local standard of care.\n      Pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacogenomics sub-study to correlate plasma concentrations of\n      DRV to outcomes, HIV-1 drug resistance testing sub study to detect mutants archived at the\n      time of first-line ART failure and measuring HIV DNA load will be performed, as well as a\n      cost-effectiveness analysis will test the hypothesis that savings can be achieved by\n      switching to DRV/r monotherapy without affecting quality of care. The primary virological\n      objective is to evaluate efficacy in terms of the percentage of subjects who have plasma\n      HIV-1 RNA levels <400 cps/ml after 24 weeks of follow-up following a switch to DRV/r\n      monotherapy versus continuing triple therapy containing 2 NRTIs + LPV/r (or ATV/r) (FDA\n      Snapshot method).\n\n      Study hypothesis:\n\n      we propose that maintenance therapy with DRV/r monotherapy is a feasible, effective and safe\n      treatment option for patients receiving second-line ART in Yaound\u00e9."
