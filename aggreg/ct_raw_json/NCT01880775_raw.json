After\n      inserting a 20 G intravenous line the patients will be hydrated with 10 ml/kg 0.9 % saline.\n\n      Preoperative systolic blood  pressure (SBP), diastolic blood  pressure (DBP), mean blood\n      pressure (MBP),  heart rate (HR) and Spo2 will be measured and recorded.\n\n      Spinal anesthesia will be commenced in the sitting position with a 25 G Quincke needle, with\n      the midline approach. After observing free flow of cerebrospinal fluid the prepared study\n      drug will be injected in 15 seconds. The patients will be  placed supine after waiting 2\n      minute in the sitting position. Supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula will be  provided.\n\n      Fentanyl and midazolam will be  used for rescue analgesia and sedation and recorded.\n\n      Sensorial block will be assessed with pinprick test with 2 minute intervals until the\n      maximum block achieves and with 15 minute intervals until the block was regresses to S3\n      dermatome. Motor block will be assessed with the Bromage score when the block reached the\n      maximum level. Patients will be  transferred to postoperative care unit (PACU) at he end of\n      surgery.\n\n      Pain will be assessed on a 10 point visual analog scale (VAS)(0= no pain, 10= worst pain\n      ever). Postoperative analgesia will be  provided with 2 mg.kg-1 tramadol  or 15 mg.kg-1\n      paracetamol when the VAS score is \u22653 time of first analgesic request will be  recorded.\n\n      Hypotension (\u226520% reduced from baseline values) will be treated with ephedrine or iv fluid\n      boluses), bradycardia (HR<45 beat min-1 was treated with atropine) was recorded.\n\n      The patients will be asked whether to void before surgery. Bladder volume will be  assessed\n      with ultrasonography. Patients with residual bladder volumes \u2265400 ml will be  placed an\n      urine catheter. Time to first urinate will be  recorded.\n\n      Patients will be  assessed for transient neurologic symptoms(pain in the buttocks and\n      legs)(TNS) and satisfaction after surgery.\n\n      TNS will be evaluated with daily telephone calls. Patient satisfaction will be  evaluated\n      with global satisfaction scale (1= bad, 2=not satisfied, 3=have no idea, 4=satisfied, 5=very\n      satisfied) Parameters to record; time of entering operation room, duration of surgery, time\n      of intrathecal injection, onset of sensorial block(block at L1), time to reach maximum block\n      level, maximum block level, first analgesic ingestion time, PACU duration, two segment\n      regression, time to L1 regression, time to S3 regression, time to it without help, time to\n      stand up without help, time to walk without help, discharge time, time to first void.
