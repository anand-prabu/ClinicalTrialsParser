            "textblock": "The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends yearly screening of thyroid studies in\n      DS. Clinical experience suggests that TSH concentrations in the subclinical hypothyroid\n      range (5-10 milli international units(mIU/L)) are not uncommon in DS, but the benefits and\n      risks of treating SCH in the DS population are not known. In adults, SCH has been associated\n      with increased cardiometabolic risk (CMR) and individuals with DS may be at increased\n      cardiometabolic risk as well.\n\n      Data in children with SCH are limited. Despite the recommendations to screen for thyroid\n      dysfunction, evidence to guide management of elevated TSH in children with DS is equally\n      sparse. In non-DS children, TSH>4.65 mIU/L was associated with lower HDL. One year of\n      levothyroxine treatment in short children with subclinical hypothyroidism and short stature\n      improved growth velocity. Left ventricular (LV) function and LV mass (by echocardiography)\n      was not different in 16 children with DS and subclinical hypothyroidism (TSH>6.5 mIU/L; mean\n      TSH = 7.8 mIU/L) vs. 25 children with DS and normal TSH. However, these findings may be\n      limited by the small sample size. An intervention study of 7 subjects age 2-42 years with DS\n      and hypothyroidism, defined as low T4 and normal or elevated TSH (0.2-18.9 mIU/L) on 8 weeks\n      of levothyroxine treatment did not improve developmental or functional outcomes.\n      Anthropometrics and CMR factors were not examined. In contrast, increased TSH in the absence\n      of overt congenital hypothyroidism is common in neonates with DS and prompted a randomized\n      controlled trial (RCT) in 181 neonates with DS. TSH-directed levothyroxine treatment was\n      associated with better growth, weight gain, and motor development after 24 months compared\n      to placebo. These findings highlight that the \"asymptomatic\" component of subclinical\n      hypothyroidism may have medically-relevant effects. This study will provide potentially\n      clinically relevant preliminary evidence for the treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism in\n      DS."
