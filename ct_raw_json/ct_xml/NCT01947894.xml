      The purpose of this study is to assess the long term treatment outcomes of Growth Hormone
      treatment in patients who are prescribed and treated with Genotropin. Also, plan to
      determine the relationships between clinical status, dosage schedule and response to
      Genotropin treatment.

      This study will also contribute to our knowledge of adult Growth Hormone Deficiency,
      including transition period in Childhood Onset Growth Hormone Deficiency and its treatment.
