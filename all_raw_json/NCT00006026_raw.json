Characterize the toxicities of this treatment\n      in this patient population.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive oral nitrocamptothecin daily on days\n      1-5. Treatment continues weekly every 3 weeks for at least 2 courses in the absence of\n      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 6 weeks until\n      disease progression.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-25 patients will be accrued for this study."
