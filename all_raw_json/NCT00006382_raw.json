Patients are\n      randomized to one of two screening arms. Arm I: Patients undergo one spiral CT scan. Arm II:\n      Patients undergo one chest x-ray. Patients and their primary care physicians are notified of\n      test results within 3 weeks of the exam.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3,000 participants (1,500 per screening arm) will be accrued\n      for this study at six screening centers (500 per center) by October 31, 2000."
