In order to safely introduce MBI as a screening\n      modality, we aim to perform MBI using 4 mCi Tc-99m sestamibi. An image processing algorithm\n      called Wide Beam Reconstruction (WBR) has been tailored for MBI technology with the goal of\n      allowing either the current administered dose or current acquisition time to be reduced by\n      half."

Reason: true tumor size will not be able to be ascertained from the final\n             pathology findings\n\n          -  Breast implants.  Reason: cases with breast implants will be easily identifiable on\n             blinded interpretation to take place at the study end\n\n          -  Suspected that breasts will not fit in the MBI field of view. Reason: cases that\n             require tiled views or additional views will be easily identifiable on blinded\n             interpretation to take place at the study end\n\n          -  Only one breast remaining. Reason: unilateral cases will be easily identifiable on\n             blinded interpretation to take place at the study end; injection timing is designed\n             for bilateral views\n\n          -  Pregnancy test (if necessary) is not negative, or the patient is unable to complete\n             the pregnancy test\n\n          -  Physically unable to sit upright and still remain still during two consecutive MBI\n             studies over the course of a 2-hour period."
