  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a major complication after cardiac surgery and has been
      reported to be associated with adverse outcome. Previous studies have reported that the
      incidence of AKI in patients undergoing surgery for congenital heart disease is as high as
      42% and AKI increase the patient mortality, intensive care unit stay and hospital stay.
      Previous studies have reported several risk factors for AKI after congenital heart surgery,
      however, perioperative variables including anesthesia-related factors have not been
      evaluated fully. Therefore, the investigators attempt to find out independent risk factors
      regarding perioperative variables.

      of hydroxyethyl starch, perioperative medication, hemodynamic variables.
