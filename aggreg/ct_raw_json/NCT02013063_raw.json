            "textblock": "A small proportion of patients with lung cancer present with a solitary pulmonary nodule\n      (SPN), this is a single spot on a CT scan. This is an important group of patients because if\n      it is lung cancer, presentation as a SPN represents early disease, which following surgery\n      has a high 5 year survival rate. However as not all SPNs are lung cancer it would be\n      unethical to biopsy every case. Clinical guidelines recommend that SPNs should undergo an\n      initial fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET/CT scan, which may give more information about the SPN\n      and may indicate that it is likely to be lung cancer. However in many cases it does not and\n      current practice is to monitor the SPN with a series of CT scans over 2 years to look for\n      changes or growth which may/ but not always indicate lung cancer. If no changes are observed\n      over 2 years the SPN is considered not lung cancer.  This is both expensive for the National\n      Health Service (NHS) and worrying for the patient in terms of monitoring CT costs and\n      delayed treatment due to length of time to diagnosis.\n\n      In this study the investigators propose to examine the diagnostic capacity of initially\n      using a different CT scan Dynamic Contrast Enhanced -CT(DCE-CT). DCE-CT and FDG-PET/CT scans\n      give different information about the SPN and the investigators will look to see if\n      information from either scan or combined information from both scans may be better in the\n      diagnosis of early stage lung cancer.\n\n      The investigators will also undertake a review of previous studies that have been done using\n      these scans in the diagnosis of lung cancer and use data from both the review and the trial\n      to look at the cost effectiveness of using DCE-CT in the diagnosis of SPN.\n\n      The investigators hope to recruit 375 people who have a SPN detected by a normal CT scan.\n      These patients will normally be offered a FDG-PET/CT scan and if they participate in this\n      study they will also receive a DCE-CT scan either on the same day or within two weeks of the\n      FDG-PET/CT scan. This is the only extra procedure that will take place to normal NHS care,\n      however patients will sign a consent form to give us permission to use data from any future\n      CT scans or biopsies and any diagnosis that they may have over the next two years.\n\n      The study is coordinated by the clinical trials unit at Southampton University.\n\n      Recruitment began in January 2013. Patients will be recruited from 10 centres throughout the\n      UK where they will be treated locally. The investigators expect recruitment to last until\n      late 2014 and patient's medical data to be followed for another 2 years.\n\n      The investigators expect to have completed the analysis and made conclusions about the\n      usefulness and cost effectiveness of DCE-CT scans in the diagnosis of early stage lung\n      cancer in SPN.\n\n      The study is funded by the Health Technology Assessment arm of the National Institute for\n      Health research, which is government funded."

            "textblock": "Indication: Lung Cancer\n\n      Primary Objectives:\n\n        -  To determine with high precision, the diagnostic performances of DCE-CT and\n           18FDG-PET/CT in the NHS for the characterisation of solitary pulmonary nodules (SPNs).\n\n        -  To use decision analytic modelling to assess the likely costs and health outcomes\n           resulting from incorporation of DCE-CT into management strategies for patients with\n           SPNs.\n\n      Secondary Objectives:\n\n        -  To assess, within an NHS setting, the incremental value of incorporating the CT\n           appearances of a SPN into the interpretation of integrated PET/CT examinations.\n\n        -  To assess whether combining DCE-CT with 18FDG-PET/CT is more accurate and/or\n           cost-effective, in the characterisation of SPNs, than either test used alone or in\n           series.\n\n        -  To document the nature and incidence of incidental extra-thoracic findings on\n           18FDG-PET/CT undertaken for the characterisation of SPNs and model their impact on\n           cost-effectiveness.\n\n      Rationale:\n\n      A small proportion of patients with lung cancer present with a solitary pulmonary nodule\n      (SPN) on diagnostic imaging tests. This is an important group of patients because\n      presentation as a SPN represents early disease with high 5 year survival rates following\n      surgical resection. However, not all SPNs are due to lung cancer and the accurate\n      characterisation of SPNs for diagnosis of early stage lung cancer is a diagnostic challenge\n      with significant associated health costs.\n\n      Widely adopted clinical guidelines for the subsequent investigation of SPNs recommend serial\n      CT scans to look for subsequent growth with biopsy to confirm diagnosis. UK, National\n      Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines recommend 18FDG-PET for the\n      assessment of SPN in cases where a biopsy is not possible or has failed.\n\n      DCE-CT and 18FDG-PET scans give different information about the SPN.  Information from\n      either scan or combined information from both scans may be better in the diagnosis of early\n      stage lung cancer.\n\n      Trial Design: Prospective Observational\n\n      Sample size: 375\n\n      Non-CTIMP:Non interventional trial\n\n      Concomitant Therapy: As per local practice\n\n      Primary Trial Endpoints:\n\n      Primary outcome measures will include diagnostic test characteristics (sensitivity,\n      specificity, accuracy) for 18FDG-PET/CT and DCE-CT in relation to a subsequent clinical\n      diagnosis of lung cancer. The outcome measures used in the economic model will include\n      accuracy, estimated life expectancy, and quality adjusted life years (QALYs). Costs will be\n      estimated from an NHS perspective. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios will compare\n      management strategies with DCE-CT to strategies without DCE-CT.\n\n      Secondary Trial Endpoints:\n\n      Secondary outcome measures will include diagnostic test characteristics for 18FDG-PET/CT\n      with incorporation of CT appearances and combined DCE-CT/18FDG-PET. The incidence of\n      incidental extra-thoracic findings on 18FDG-PET/CT, subsequent investigations and costs will\n      also be determined.\n\n      Total Number of Sites: 10"
