Photodynamic therapy uses a drug, porfimer\n      sodium, that becomes active when it is exposed to a certain kind of light. When the drug is\n      active, cancer cells are killed. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine\n      hydrochloride, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing\n      the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving photodynamic therapy together with\n      gemcitabine hydrochloride may be effect in patients with pancreatic cancer."

Quantify computed tomography (CT) detected volume of tumor necrosis produced by EUS-PDT.\n\n      II. Quantify rates of tumor size stabilization or decrease by EUS PDT and determine\n      objective response rate per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria.\n\n      III. Determine surgical downstaging off of abdominal vessels and resectability. IV.\n      Determine changes in serum cancer antigen (CA) 19-9 levels with treatment. V. Evaluate\n      progression-free and overall survival.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of EUS-PDT with porfimer sodium.\n\n      Patients receive porfimer sodium intravenously (IV) on day 1 and undergo EUS-PDT on days 1,\n      3, 8, and 21.
