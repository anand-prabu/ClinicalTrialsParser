Quantify the magnitude and distribution of target and organ at risk volume variations\n      between the different imaging modalities.\n\n      III. Determine dosimetric changes related to contouring variations for tumor and normal\n      tissue.\n\n      OUTLINE:\n\n      Patients undergo conventional free breathing CT, 4D CT, ABC CT, ABC CBCT, and free breathing\n      CBCT before undergoing radiation therapy."
