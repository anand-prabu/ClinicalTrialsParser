            "textblock": "Inaccuracy of medication histories and lack of knowledge on actual medication use results in\n      confusion about medication regimens and medication mismanagement before- during - and after\n      hospital admission. This phenomenon accounts for many readmissions, longer duration of\n      admission and preventable and serious Adverse Drug Events (ADEs) as a result of Drug Related\n      Problems (DRPs). Several studies show that discharge medication reconciliation (MR) and\n      counseling by a pharmacy employee reduces the amount of discrepancies in the discharge\n      prescription lists. Still, no unequivocal effect of MR on the occurrence of DRPs after\n      discharge has been shown. This is due to a shift in underlying potential harmful\n      discrepancies from mainly patient based (unintended nonadherence) to mainly system based (eg\n      dispensing errors) and might be explained by (1) suboptimal transfer of information (2) an\n      overload of information during a stressful situation and (3) difficulty to implement changes\n      in medication at home. Therefore the reduction of DRPs, improvement of patients' medication\n      knowledge and initial adherence can probably most effectively be addressed in a multifaceted\n      integrated transmural intervention. Repetition of important information is the key to\n      success. Moreover, the first weeks following hospital discharge are most crucial in\n      preventing drug-related problems as patients could slip back in old medication schemes, or\n      new problems may arise, such as emerging ADEs due to medication changes made during\n      hospitalization."
