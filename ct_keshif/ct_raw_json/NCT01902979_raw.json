            "textblock": "Obesity is one of the most important determinants of quality of life and function. People\n      with lumbar spinal stenosis may be at increased risk of obesity given walking limitations.\n      Spinal stenosis is a very common degenerative condition in people over 45. People with this\n      condition have pain and numbness in the legs during walking, and therefore avoid physical\n      activity. Lack of physical activity is related to weight gain and increased risk of chronic\n      disease. Objective: The objective of this project is test a new e-health (online) pedometer\n      and nutrition intervention aimed at promoting weight loss and increasing physical activity\n      in overweight and obese individuals with spinal stenosis. Methods:  The investigators will\n      recruit 88 people with lumbar spinal stenosis who are overweight or obese. Half of these\n      people will receive the 12-week intervention, and the other half will receive usual care (no\n      intervention). In Weeks 1 and 6, people in the intervention group will meet with a\n      Registered Dietitian and an Exercise Physiologist for personalized sessions. They will\n      receive a pedometer and instructions on how to log in to the e-health site\n      (https://sspanli.mtroyal.ca). They will wear the pedometer daily and log in to the website\n      each week for a nutrition education session, a weekly step goal, and tips. The investigators\n      will look to see whether people in the intervention group show greater change in physical\n      activity, body composition and quality of life compared to the individuals who received\n      usual care. Relevance: The increasing number of people with spinal stenosis represents a\n      huge health care burden in Canada. This intervention could provide a new treatment option\n      that would increase mobility, quality of life, and potentially alleviate the need for\n      expensive treatments like surgery. E-health interventions provide an opportunity for\n      patients to take an active role in their own health, and promote behaviour changes that will\n      result in healthier Canadians less likely to access care in the future."
