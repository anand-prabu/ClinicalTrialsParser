This condition manifests with symptoms of diarrhea, weight loss, causing\n      potential impairment on an individual's quality of life. Creon, a pancreatic enzyme\n      supplement, marketed by Abbott Laboratories, Inc. is currently the standard treatment for\n      this condition. However, there has been limited work evaluating the merits of this\n      medication in this condition. This study aims to evaluate the benefits that Creon may have\n      in coeliac patients with low faecal pancreatic elastase by randomising patients with low\n      faecal pancreatic elastase (<200 ug/g) to either treatment with Creon or placebo. Outcome\n      measures that we aim to assess to determine the benefits of Creon include evaluation of\n      stool frequency, abdominal pain, body mass index (BMI) and quality of life."
