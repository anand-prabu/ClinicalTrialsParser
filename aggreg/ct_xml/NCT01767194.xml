      This randomized phase II trial studies how well giving irinotecan hydrochloride and
      temozolomide together with temsirolimus or monoclonal antibody Ch14.18 works in treating
      younger patients with refractory or relapsed neuroblastoma. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such
      as irinotecan hydrochloride and temozolomide, work in different ways to stop the growth of
      tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Temsirolimus may
      stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.
      Monoclonal antibodies, such as monoclonal antibody Ch14.18, can block tumor growth in
      different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor
      cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. It is not yet known
      whether giving irinotecan hydrochloride and temozolomide together with temsirolimus or
      monoclonal antibody Ch14.18 is more effective in treating neuroblastoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To identify whether temsirolimus or ch14.18 (monoclonal antibody Ch14.18) is the optimal
      therapeutic agent to consider for further testing in a future Phase III randomized trial for
      treatment of newly diagnosed high-risk neuroblastoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the response rates (RR) for patients receiving temsirolimus or ch14.18 in
      combination with irinotecan (irinotecan hydrochloride) and temozolomide.

      II. To compare the progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) rates for
      patients receiving temsirolimus or ch14.18 in combination with irinotecan and temozolomide.

      III. To compare the toxicities associated with temsirolimus or ch14.18 when combined with
      irinotecan and temozolomide in patients with refractory, relapsed or progressive
      neuroblastoma.

      IV. To compare the ability to maintain intended dose intensity of all agents when
      temsirolimus or ch14.18 is combined with irinotecan and temozolomide in patients with
      refractory, relapsed or progressive neuroblastoma.

      V. To determine the concordance between tumor responses as defined by standard International
      Neuroblastoma Response Criteria (INRC) versus response per the revised INRC.

      VI. To study the clinical relevance of naturally occurring anti-glycan antibodies in
      patients receiving ch14.18 antibody.

      VII. To study the clinical relevance of natural killer (NK) receptor NKp30 isoforms in
      patients receiving ch14.18 antibody or temsirolimus.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment regimens.

      ARM I: Patients receive temozolomide orally (PO) on days 1-5, irinotecan hydrochloride
      intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes on days 1-5, and temsirolimus IV over 30 minutes on days
      1 and 8.

      ARM II: Patients receive temozolomide and irinotecan hydrochloride as in Arm I, monoclonal
      antibody Ch14.18 IV over 10-20 hours on days 2-5 and sargramostim subcutaneously (SC) or IV
      over 2 hours on days 6-12.

      In both arms, treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 17 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.

               -  Measurable tumor on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT)
                  scan obtained within 3 weeks prior to study entry; measurable is defined as &gt;=

                  metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) avid or demonstrates increased fludeoxyglucose

             minimum of 4 weeks prior to study entry at the site of any lesion that will be
             identified as a target lesion to measure tumor response; lesions that have been
             previously radiated cannot be used as target lesions unless there is radiographic
             evidence of progression at the site following radiation or a biopsy done following
             radiation shows viable neuroblastoma; palliative radiation is allowed to sites that
             will not be used to measure response during this study
