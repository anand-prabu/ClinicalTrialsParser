Hormone therapy using\n      arzoxifene hydrochloride may fight breast cancer by blocking the use of estrogen by the\n      tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is comparing two different doses of arzoxifene\n      hydrochloride to see how well it works in treating women with advanced or metastatic breast\n      cancer."

            "textblock": "OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the response rate or clinical benefit rate in patients with locally\n      advanced or metastatic breast cancer treated with 1 of 2 different doses of arzoxifene\n      hydrochloride. II. Compare the response rates and clinical benefit rates for patients with\n      tamoxifen-sensitive versus tamoxifen-refractory disease. III. Compare the degree of toxicity\n      between the 2 doses of arzoxifene hydrochloride in these patients. IV. Compare the quality\n      of life and survival of these patients receiving high versus low dose arzoxifene\n      hydrochloride. V. Determine the time to progressive disease, time to treatment failure, and\n      response duration of this treatment in these patients. VII. Measure changes in serum\n      estradiol, follicle stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, and sex hormone binding\n      globulin in these patients during treatment.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind study. Patients are stratified according to\n      number of metastatic sites (less than 3 vs 3 or more), tamoxifen sensitivity (sensitive vs\n      refractory), and degree of estrogen receptor positivity (high vs low vs unknown). Patients\n      are randomized to receive 1 of 2 doses of arzoxifene hydrochloride. Patients receive\n      arzoxifene hydrochloride orally once daily for 12 weeks. Treatment continues in the absence\n      of toxicity and disease progression. Quality of life is assessed before, during, and at the\n      completion of the study. Patients are followed every 4 weeks for 12 weeks, at 30 days after\n      the last treatment, and every 2-3 months after the last treatment.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: This study will accrue 104-114 patients."
