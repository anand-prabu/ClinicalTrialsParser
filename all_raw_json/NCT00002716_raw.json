Combining more than one drug may kill more cancer cells. It is\n      not yet known which chemotherapy regimen is more effective for metastatic colorectal cancer.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of intrahepatic\n      floxuridine, leucovorin, and dexamethasone with that of systemic fluorouracil and leucovorin\n      in treating patients who have unresectable liver metastases from colorectal cancer."

Patients are stratified according to\n      center, percentage of liver involvement on CT scan or MRI (less than 30% vs 30% to under\n      70%), prior chemotherapy (none vs adjuvant chemotherapy comprising fluorouracil (5-FU) and\n      leucovorin calcium (CF) or 5-FU, CF, and levamisole (LEV) completed at least 1 year before\n      study vs adjuvant chemotherapy comprising 5-FU with or without LEV completed at least 6\n      months before study), and synchronous disease (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2\n      treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients undergo laparotomy for placement of a hepatic artery catheter and then\n           subcutaneous placement of a hepatic artery infusion pump. Patients with unresected\n           primary disease also undergo resection at the time of catheter and pump placement.\n           Beginning within 1-2 weeks after surgery, patients receive floxuridine, dexamethasone,\n           and leucovorin calcium (CF) via continuous hepatic artery infusion on days 1-14.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive CF IV and fluorouracil IV on days 1-5. Patients with\n           unresected primary disease undergo resection within 3-4 weeks before initiation of\n           chemotherapy.\n\n      Treatment for patients on both arms continues every 4 weeks in the absence of disease\n      progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Quality of life and medical resource utilization are assessed at baseline, every 3 months\n      for 1 year, and then at 18 months.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 340 patients (170 per arm) will be accrued for this study\n      within approximately 4.5 years."
