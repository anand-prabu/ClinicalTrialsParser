Evaluate\n      the safety, tolerability, and dose limiting toxicity of this regimen in these patients. III.\n      Assess steady state plasma concentrations of various doses of L-778,123 combined with\n      paclitaxel in these patients. IV. Evaluate radiologic or tumor marker responses to this\n      regimen in these patients. V. Evaluate the relationship between ras mutations and response\n      to this regimen in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation, multicenter study of L-778,123. Patients receive\n      paclitaxel IV over 3 hours followed within 24 hours by L-778,123 IV over 7 days. Courses\n      repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n      Patients achieving complete response receive 2 courses after documentation of response.\n      Cohorts of 1-3 patients receive escalating doses of L-778,123 until the maximum tolerated\n      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which 2 of 6 patients experience\n      dose limiting toxicity. Patients are followed at about 2 weeks.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 40 patients will be accrued for this study."
