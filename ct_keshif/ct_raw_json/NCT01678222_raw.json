            "textblock": "Background:\n\n      - The immune system contains several different types of cells in the blood and other parts\n      of the body. The body can fight infections well with the right balance of these cell types.\n      The wrong balance of cell types may cause diseases, such as allergies or asthma. The COX-2\n      gene may help decide the balance of cell types that the body makes as part of the immune\n      system. It may also play a role in certain immune system diseases. Researchers want to see\n      how COX-2 affects the cells in the immune system.\n\n      Objectives:\n\n      - To study how the COX-2 gene works in the body   s immune system.\n\n      Eligibility:\n\n      - Individuals between 18 and 65 years of age who are part of the Environmental Polymorphisms\n      Registry.\n\n      Design:\n\n        -  Participants will have one study visit at the National Institutes of Health. They will\n           collect a urine sample at home on the morning of the study visit.\n\n        -  Participants will have a physical exam and medical history. They will provide a blood\n           sample. They will also give researchers the urine sample they collected that morning.\n\n        -  No treatment will be provided as part of this study."

            "textblock": "This is a cross-sectional, controlled study designed to investigate the association of\n      single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2) gene, also called\n      prostaglandin endoperoxidase synthase 2 (PTGS2), on T-cell differentiation and function.\n      Specifically, the impact of the promoter-region SNP 765G> C (rs20417) and the 3\n      untranslated region (UTR) SNP 8473T> C (rs5275) on T helper cell (Th) 2, Th9, and Th17\n      differentiation and function will be examined. Non-Hispanic, White or Black/African\n      American, non-pregnant adults, aged 18-65 years, who are wild type (WT), with respect to\n      both the 765G> C and 8473T> C SNPs, WT with respect to 765G> C and homozygous for 8473T> C,\n      and homozygous for both 765G> C and 8473T> C will be recruited into a total of three\n      genotype groups. Potential participants will be identified from the Environmental\n      Polymorphisms Registry, contacted and pre-screened for eligibility. Pre-screened individuals\n      will provide verbal consent to withhold certain supplements/medications prior to the study\n      visit, and will be mailed an informed consent form, a urine collection cup, and pre-visit\n      instructions. Participants will attend a single study visit that will take place at the\n      National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) Clinical Research Unit (CRU).\n      During this visit, written informed consent will be obtained, and there will be a final\n      screening and eligibility determination, medical history review, vital signs, physical\n      examination and blood and urine samples will be collected. From peripheral blood, lymphocyte\n      subsets, prostaglandin levels, and cytokine levels will be determined; stable prostaglandin\n      metabolites, creatinine, total protein and albumin will be measured in urine. Lymphocytes\n      will be isolated from peripheral blood for ex vivo analyses. Demographic characteristics\n      (i.e., age) will be compared between the groups, and when possible, recruitment will be\n      targeted to achieve an approximate match of race and gender across the groups. The primary\n      objective of the study is to determine whether the 765G> C or 8473T> C SNPs exhibit altered\n      Th2, Th9 and Th17 cell differentiation by examining lymphocyte subsets in vivo. The study\n      will also examine the impact of these two SNPs on circulating Th2/Th9/Th17 cytokine levels\n      and prostaglandins in vivo, on differentiation of naive CD4+T-cells to Th cell subsets in\n      vitro, and on lymphocyte production of cytokines and prostaglandins in vitro."
