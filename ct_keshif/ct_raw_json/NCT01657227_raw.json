Setting: Basic healthcare district in Canary Islands.\n      Spain. Subjects: Patients with T2DM, 18-65 years old, without complications. Main measures:\n      HbA1c, rate of patients with properly controlled T2DM. Sample: 2328 patients, 582 per arm.\n      Intervention: G1: Interventions on the patients: Educational and habit modification group\n      program. G2: Intervention on the PHCT: a) Educative intervention to improve the knowledge\n      about the disease and their abilities; b) Computer-based clinical decision support system;\n      c) Feedback of results.
