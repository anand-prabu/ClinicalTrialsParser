      Background Physical as well as psychosocial complaints are frequently present in patients
      with a neuroendocrine tumor (NET). Adequate information is seen as an essential aspect of
      supportive care. The aim of the current study is to test the effectiveness of a web-based
      tailored information and support system targeting patients' information and care needs. Key
      features of this system are self-screening of physical and psychosocial problems, tailored
      education on reported problems and self-referral to professional health care.

      Objective To detect whether a web-based tailored information and support system improves
      patients' perception and satisfaction of received information. The investigators hypothesize
      that after having received web-based tailored information and support patients feel more
      informed and are more satisfied with the received information than when receiving standard
      care.

      Study design The present study is a randomized prospective longitudinal experimental
      multicenter pilot study. In this study, we want to examine the effect sizes on the
      perception and satisfaction by the patient of received information (primary objective) and
      secondary objectives after having used web-based tailored information and support. Eligible
      are newly diagnosed NET-patients (N=40) (diagnosed less than 3 months ago). Patients will be
      asked to fill out questionnaires at baseline and after 12 weeks, on socio-demographic
      features (only at baseline), internet use (only at baseline), health care use, patients'
      perception and satisfaction of received information, distress, quality of life and
      empowerment (only after 12 weeks).

      Study population Patients diagnosed with a NET (any type of NET, any phase of disease) who
      are under treatment at the Department of Medical Oncology in the University Medical Center
      Groningen or Hospital Medisch Spectrum; twenty will be invited to participate in the study.

      Intervention During 12 subsequent weeks, a personalized website (with a surname/password)
      will become available to patients in the experimental group beside the usual standard care.
      Key features of the website are self-screening, tailored patient education and
      self-referral. Self-screening will be performed by an online version of the Dutch Distress
      thermometer (DT) and Problem List (PL). Patients will receive automated feedback on their DT
      score immediately after test completion together with information regarding problems
      reported on the PL, options for (self)-help and possibilities for referral to professional
      care. Contact information will also be available to discuss questions, problems and/or
      referral needs. Patients may also request a telephone call.

      Main study endpoint The primary endpoint is to detect an improvement in patients' perception
      and satisfaction of received information after having received web-based tailored
      information and support.
