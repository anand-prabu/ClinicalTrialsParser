            "textblock": "Geriatric patients (age \u2265 65 years) undergo surgery for hip fractures that develops due to\n      osteoporosis and falls. Dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease is associated with an\n      increased risk of cardiovascular comorbidity. Elective or urgent surgical operations may be\n      required for geriatric patients with end stage renal disease. These patients have severe\n      comorbidities, fluid, electrolyte disturbances and drug metabolism abnormalities during the\n      perioperative period. For this reasons a careful anesthesia plan should be planned and\n      performed.  Spinal anesthesia can be used for hip fracture surgery at geriatric patients\n      with chronic renal failure. Anterograde femoral intramedullary nailing can be performed in\n      supine position with a fracture table. Intraoperative sedation might be necessary for\n      patients under regional anesthesia on traction table. Dexmedetomidine is an alpha 2 receptor\n      agonist that is being used as an agent for its sedative and adjuvant analgesic effects.\n\n      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of dexmedetomidine premedication on\n      geriatric patients with end stage renal disease, who will be undergoing a surgical operation\n      for hip fracture under spinal anesthesia with  hyperbaric bupivacaine and BIS (Bispectral\n      Index) guided sedation with intraoperative propofol infusion."

The patients will be monitored with a pulse-oxymeter,\n      5-channel ECG, noninvasive blood pressure and BIS at the preoperative preparation room. BIS\n      monitoring electrodes will be placed on the forehead of the patient. Study drugs will be\n      administered to the patient by another anesthesiologist who is also not taking part in the\n      study at the preparation room preoperatively. Dexmedetomidine  (0.5 \u03bcg/kg) in 20 ml saline\n      will be administered in 10 minutes, with an infusion pump.

The patient will then be transported to\n      the operating room with the supervision of this anesthesiologist.  The intraoperative and\n      postoperative follow-up of the patients will be performed by another anesthesiologist who\n      has been blinded to the study drugs as well as the group distribution. Routine anesthesia\n      monitoring will be performed with  pulse-oxymeter, 5-lead ECG, noninvasive blood pressure\n      measurement, pulse oxymetry  and BIS. Before induction of the spinal block  basal systolic,\n      diastolic and mean blood pressures, heart rate, peripheral oxygen saturation and  BIS values\n      will be recorded.
