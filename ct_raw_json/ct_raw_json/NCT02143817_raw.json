The use of the amino acid L-citrulline has\n      been suggested as a potential aid for the treatment of CVD by increasing endothelial\n      production of Nitric Oxide (NO). Whole body vibration (WBV) is new and effective form of\n      exercise that is feasible for clinical populations and has been proven to decrease blood\n      pressure (BP) and arterial stiffness and increase muscle mass and strength. Therefore, the\n      purpose of this study was to investigate if the combination of WBV training (WBVT) plus\n      L-citrulline supplementation would induce positive additive effects and would be an\n      effective means to ameliorate arterial stiffness, endothelial function, BP and muscle\n      strength/mass in postmenopausal women."

To investigate if the additive effect of 8 weeks of WBVT combined with L-citrulline\n           supplementation are more efficacious than either treatment alone in ameliorating\n           cardiovascular disease risk factors by assessing arterial stiffness (aortic, systemic,\n           and leg), aortic BP and wave reflection, and autonomic function (heart rate\n           variability, vascular sympathetic activity [low-frequency power of systolic BP\n           variability], and baroreflex sensitivity). Flow mediated dilation and circulating\n           levels of adipocytokines (adiponectin and leptin) and endothelial-derived vasodilators\n           (NO metabolites [NOx], 6-keto PGFIa, insulin, and ghrelin) and vasoconstrictors\n           (endothelin-1 [ET-1],8-iso PGF2a,vascular endothelium growth factor [VGEF]) will be\n           assessed as secondary outcome variables.\n\n        2. To evaluate the extent to which 8 weeks of WBVT combined with L-citrulline improves\n           body composition assessed by changes in fat mass and lean mass using dual-energy x-ray\n           absorptiometry and waist circumference.\n\n        3. To determine the additive effect of 8 weeks of WBVT combined with L-citrulline\n           supplementation on muscle strength.

Dynamic exercises will be performed with slow controlled movements starting from an upright position into a 60 degree knee flexion (squat) and maximal heel elevation (toestand). Static exercises will be performed without movement in the joint angles described previously. The training volume will increase progressively over the 12-week training period by increasing the intensity of vibration, duration of the exercise set (30-60 sec), number of sets per exercise, and total duration of the training session, and decreasing the duration of rest periods (30-60 sec).The intensity of vibration and amplitude will also be increased progressively (25-30 Hz of frequency and from low to high amplitude).",
