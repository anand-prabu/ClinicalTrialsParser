            "textblock": "Influenza virus infection leads to millions of cases of severe illnesses worldwide and up to\n      an estimated 500.000 deaths annually. The potential for the sudden emergence of pandemic\n      influenza strains represents an incessant threat on even a larger scale. seasonal influenza\n      vaccination is the backbone of influenza management. However, antibodies generated by\n      vaccination, most often do not effectively neutralize emergent strains due to the high\n      mutation rate of the influenza viral genome. In addition, although vaccination is effective\n      in up to 85% of healthy adults, only 40-60% of the elderly are able to mount an protective\n      antibody response due to an agerelated decline in immune function (so-called\n      immunoscenescence). As a result, the protective effects of influenza vaccination are\n      limited, and strategies to improve host immune defenses against influenza virus infection\n      per se, and following influenza vaccination, are highly warranted.\n\n      It is suggested that prior vaccination with Bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) could enhance\n      resistance to other infectious diseases in addition to protection to tuberculosis (TBC)\n      and, in mice, protection of prior BCGvaccination against influenza infection was\n      demonstrated long ago. However, only recently substantial evidence for these nonspecific\n      beneficial effects of BCG-vaccination in humans has been provided by several randomized\n      clinical trials. Considering these potentiating effects of BCG-vaccination, it could be a\n      viable strategy to improve efficacy of influenza vaccination, and/or enhance immune defenses\n      against influenza virus infection per se. If so, this would have an enormous impact on\n      clinical practice."
