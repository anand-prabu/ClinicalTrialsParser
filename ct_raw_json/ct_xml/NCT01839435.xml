  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of our monocentric prospective in intention-to-treat study is to evaluate the
      feasibility of outpatient appendectomy for non complicated acute appendicitis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute appendicitis is one of the most common surgical emergencies and corresponds to an high
      number of admissions (about 120.000) in France. It mainly affects young adults and is
      associated to fewer complications and to a short length of stay. The notion of outpatient
      refers to a shorter hospital length to stay i.e. less than 12 hours without an overnight
      hospitalization. This notion came from 3 learned society recommendations' (SFCD, ACHBT, and
      AFCA) and has been considered as a national priority.

      There is no consensus about appendectomy in an outpatient setting.
