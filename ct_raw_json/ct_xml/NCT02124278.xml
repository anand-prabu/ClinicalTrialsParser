  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of
      single ascending doses of PUL-042 inhalation solutions in healthy subjects.

      Subjects will be enter a screening period of up to 14 days to determine eligibility.
      Subjects will be admitted to the Phase 1 unit the day prior to dosing and remain in the unit
      until 24 hours post-dose.  Subjects will be seen in the clinic at 3 and 7 days post-dose

      A modified 3+3 design will be used to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) based on
      the occurrence of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) defined by Common Terminology Criteria for
      Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.  Additional specific DLTs will be defined as: 1) Hypoxia, defined
      as a non-artifactual drop in pulse oximetry to &lt; 90% on room air, 2) A decrease in forced
      expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) of 12% or greater compared to the last observation
      prior to dosing, 3) Any  evidence of bronchospasm or wheezing requiring medical
      intervention.  Doses will be doubled until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD- defined as the
      largest dose with 0/6 or 1/6 DLTs) is reached.
