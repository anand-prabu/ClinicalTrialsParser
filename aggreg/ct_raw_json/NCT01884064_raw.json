However, the\n      majority of subjects reported symptom improvement. Previous research using a similar\n      protocol has shown significant changes in cortical excitability and handwriting performance\n      lasting at least 10-days following treatment. Data collection and analysis is currently in\n      progress. Additionally, Impaired inhibition as measured by CSP may be present in people with\n      oromandibular dystonia, which is a similar finding to other focal dystonias. Inhibitory rTMS\n      may be effective in reducing excitability that may improve clinical symptoms of this\n      disorder."

Six subjects with focal hand dystonia (FHD) and nine healthy controls were\n      studied. All subjects with FHD received rTMS (1Hz) to the premotor cortex (PMC) for five\n      consecutive days; of those, three subjects received five days of sham rTMS completed ten\n      days prior to real treatment. Healthy subjects received one real rTMS session. Cortical\n      silent period (CSP) and measures of handwriting performance were compared before and after\n      treatment and at ten-day post-treatment follow-up. At baseline, significant differences in\n      CSP and pen pressure were observed between subjects with FHD and healthy controls.\n      Differences in CSP and pen velocity between subjects in real and sham rTMS groups were\n      observed across treatment sessions and maintained at follow-up. After five days of rTMS to\n      PMC, reduced cortical excitability and improved handwriting performance were observed and\n      maintained at least ten days following treatment in subjects with FHD. These preliminary\n      results support further investigation of the therapeutic potential of rTMS in FHD. We have\n      modified the current treatment parameters to increase the treatment time to build upon these\n      initial findings"
