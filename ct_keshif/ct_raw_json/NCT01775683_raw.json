Some have asked if\n      a difference in thinking skills explains how people who are homeless for a long time need\n      more help in getting and keeping housing compared to other homeless persons.\n\n      In this study, thinking skills that help a person plan and make decisions will be screened\n      among those who have been homeless for a long time and those who were homeless for a short\n      time.  If there is a difference, then screening may change how future homeless people get\n      the help they need."
