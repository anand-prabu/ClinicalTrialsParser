II. Characterize the\n      single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of temozolomide following oral administration in\n      these patients. III. Determine antitumor activity of temozolomide in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is an open label, dose escalation study. Patients receive oral temozolomide on\n      days 1-21. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or\n      unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients are treated at escalating doses of\n      temozolomide. The maximum tolerated dose is defined as the dose at which no more than 1 of 6\n      patients experiences dose limiting toxicity (DLT) during courses 1 or 2, with at least 2\n      patients experiencing DLT at the next higher dose level.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study."
