Traditionally, the presence of\n      urinary bladder fibrosis has been confirmed directly with bladder biopsy or using urodynamic\n      testing.  We're will use ARFI (acoustic radiation force impulse)-derived shear wave\n      velocities to hopefully identify the presence of urinary bladder wall fibrosis.  We\n      hypothesize that shear wave velocities obtained within the bladder wall will increase with\n      increasing evidence of fibrosis."
