Some reports suggest that spiramycin is useful in improving the\n      symptoms of cryptosporidial diarrhea in some patients. Results of one study, however, showed\n      no significant difference between spiramycin and placebo (inactive medication).

Thus, the results of the trial may have been due to poor absorption of spiramycin."
