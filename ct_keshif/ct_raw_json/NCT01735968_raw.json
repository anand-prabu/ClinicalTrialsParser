In the\n             absence of archival tumor tissue, patients must agree to a fresh pre-treatment biopsy\n             at screening. \u2022 Dose-expansion part: patients must have available archival tumor\n             tissue which can be shipped during the course of the study and must agree to a fresh\n             pre-treatment biopsy\n\n          -  Failed prior therapy with imatinib followed by sunitinib for the treatment of\n             unresectable or metastatic GIST. Note the following specific criteria for the two\n             parts of the trial: \u2022 Dose-escalation part: patients who failed prior therapy with\n             imatinib and then have failed therapy with sunitinib. Treatment failure may be due to\n             either disease progression on therapy (both imatinib and sunitinib) or intolerance to\n             therapy (sunitinib) \u2022 Dose-escalation part patients may have had additional lines of\n             therapy than imatinib and sunitinib  dose-expansion part: patients must have\n             documented disease progression on both imatinib and sunitinib. In addition, patients\n             may have had no more than two lines of prior therapy (i.e. treatment with imatinib\n             followed by treatment with sunitinib). \u2022 Note: Adjuvant imatinib will not count as a\n             prior course of imatinib for the purposes of this criterion 6. Radiological (CT/MRI)\n             confirmation of disease progression (RECIST criteria) during prior therapy with\n             imatinib and sunitinib will be required for patients entering the Dose-expansion part\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n        -Previous treatment with PI3K inhibitors -Patient has active uncontrolled or symptomatic\n        central nervous system (CNS) metastases Note: A patient with controlled and asymptomatic\n        CNS metastases may participate in this trial. As such, the patient must have completed any\n        prior treatment for CNS metastases > 28 days (including radiotherapy and/or surgery) prior\n        to start of treatment in this study and should not be receiving chronic corticosteroid\n        therapy for the CNS metastases -Severe and/or uncontrolled concurrent medical condition\n        that, in the opinion of the investigator, could cause unacceptable safety risks or\n        compromise compliance with the protocol (e.g. acute or chronic liver, pancreatic disease,\n        severe renal disease considered unrelated to study disease, chronic pulmonary disease\n        including dyspnea at rest from any cause) -Patients with diabetes mellitus requiring\n        insulin treatment and/or with clinical signs or with FPG >120mg/dL / 6.7mmol/L, or history\n        of documented steroid-induced diabetes mellitus -Patient who has not recovered to grade 1\n        or better from any adverse events related to previous imatinib and/or sunitinib therapy\n        before screening procedures are initiated"
