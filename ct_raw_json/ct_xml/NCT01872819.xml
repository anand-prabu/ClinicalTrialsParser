  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial uses a laboratory test called a high throughput sensitivity assay in
      planning treatment for patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia. The aim
      is to try to identify drugs that may be effective in killing leukemia cells for those
      patients who will not be cured with conventional chemotherapy. This assay will test multiple
      drugs simultaneously against a patient's own donated blood sample. The goal is to use this
      laboratory assay to best match a drug to a patient's disease.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To obtain results from a high throughput drug sensitivity assay within 10 days, procure
      drug within 14 days and initiate treatment within 21 days.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To achieve a response (cytoreduction or at least partial response) greater that than
      expected for comparable refractory patient populations with other salvage regimens.

      OUTLINE:

      A patient receives a drug intervention based on the results of a high throughput sensitivity
      assay. This assay best matches a drug to the patient's disease.

             (except acute promyelocytic leukemia), acute leukemias of ambiguous lineage by WHO
             criteria, or myelodysplastic syndrome refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB)-2
             by WHO classification or advanced myeloproliferative neoplasm with &gt;= 10% blasts in
             the bone marrow or peripheral blood, including chronic myelomonocytic leukemia
             (CMML)-2 by WHO classification who have failed 2 inductions at initial diagnosis or
             failed &gt;= 2 salvage regimens for relapsed acute myeloid leukemia (AML)
