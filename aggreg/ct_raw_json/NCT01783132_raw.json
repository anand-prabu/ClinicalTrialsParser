At screening visit, Informed\n      Consent is signed and atopic asthma confirmed, spirometry is performed and questionnaires\n      responded to. At visit 2 venous blood samples are taken and serum stored at -20 \u00b0C for later\n      transport to Uppsala Biobank, Exhaled NO is measured at both visit using NIOX MINO (blinded\n      in control group).\n\n        -  The active group if on combination inhaler, will switch to Giona Easyhaler (same\n           budesonide equivalent as before study entry) and Oxis (same formoterol equivalent as\n           before study entry). These patients will receive a NIOX MINO and will be taught about\n           the adjustment of ICS treatment according to daily exhaled NO measurement at home and a\n           personalized treatment algorithm.\n\n        -  The control group will stay on previous controller treatment (only changed if indicated\n           by symptoms at visit) according to usual care.\n\n        -  Both groups will switch short-acting beta-2-agonist to Buventol Easyhaler.\n\n        -  Both groups will report symptoms (ACQ) monthly and in connection to asthma events via\n           an ePRO system (ViedocMe, PCG). Active group will report NO values on a weekly basis\n           via the same system.\n\n      There will be a follow-up clinic visit 3 at 6 months with exhaled NO measurement (blinded in\n      control group) and limited set of questionnaires. A second follow-up visit 4 at 12 months\n      with exhaled NO, spirometry, full set of questionnaires and blood sample will be made."
