The anti-emetics will be prescribed reflecting this risk for pre-chemotherapy, 8 hrs post chemotherapy and day 2-3 post chemotherapy. Dexamethasone, Ondansetron and Aprepitant will be given in different combination and doses depending on what score the participant receives based on their responses to the diary.
