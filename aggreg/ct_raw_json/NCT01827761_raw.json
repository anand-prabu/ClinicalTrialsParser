Some\n      of these issues are addressed in the American Society of Clinical Oncology's Quality\n      Oncology Practice Initiative (QOPI). This study will perform an analysis of the teaching\n      process that is provided prior to chemotherapy administration.\n\n      This study will provide data for each participating hospital to individually assess their\n      teaching process. Multivariate analysis can be performed to evaluate whether age, sex,\n      native, language, race highest level of education, cancer type,  chemotherapy regimen,\n      institution where chemotherapy will be administered, and type of personnel performing the\n      teaching visit,  influences the effectiveness of the teaching visit. In addition, results\n      can be compared across different hospitals.This analysis may lead to improvements in each\n      hospital's chemotherapy teaching practices and lead to advances in patient's cognitive and\n      emotional preparedness."
