Probenecid may increase the effectiveness of\n      10-propargyl-10-deazaaminopterin by making tumor cells more sensitive to the drug.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combining\n      10-propargyl-10-deazaaminopterin and probenecid in treating patients who have advanced solid\n      tumors."

Treatment repeats every 2 weeks in the\n      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive sequentially escalating doses of probenecid and PDX until\n      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which 2 of\n      6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 35-40 patients will be accrued for this study."
