  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Croatia, between 95% and 98% of mothers initiate breastfeeding, but by 3 months a third
      have stopped, and by six months only half are still providing any breast milk for their
      babies. Exclusive breastfeeding rates are even lower, with only about 9% of Croatian mothers
      exclusively breastfeeding at 6 months, despite the WHO recommendation of 6 months of
      exclusive breastfeeding. Currently, in Croatia, no breastfeeding information or other
      pregnancy and parenting related written information is routinely provided to expectant
      couples. In our study we would like to find out whether providing written breastfeeding
      information in pregnancy and breastfeeding focused support phone calls during pregnancy and
      after the birth of the baby result in better outcomes than providing general pregnancy
      information and phone calls. This will be tested by randomising women, attending their
      primary health care provider for routine antenatal visits between 27 and 32 weeks, to an
      intervention educational program focused on promoting and supporting breastfeeding, and to a
      control group who will receive educational support aimed at general pregnancy and parenting
      issues. Women will be followed-up for 6 months after the birth of their baby and data will
      be collected at 3 and 6 months on  breastfeeding rates, breastfeeding self-efficacy, quality
      of life, social support and attitudes toward infant feeding
