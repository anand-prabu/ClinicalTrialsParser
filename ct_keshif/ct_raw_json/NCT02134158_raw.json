The anode will be\n      placed at the hot spot of the tibialis anterior motor cortex area on the damage hemisphere,\n      and the cathode will be placed at the controlateral orbit. The intensity of stimulation will\n      be 2 mA.\n\n      In tDCS experimental visit, the stimulation will last 30 minutes. In tDCS placebo visit, the\n      duration of the stimulation will only be 120 seconds, with the identical other conditions.\n\n      Before the beginning of the stimulation, a clinical assessment, a functional gait related\n      activities evaluation and a 3D gait motion analysis associated with an evaluation of the\n      equilibrium will be performed.\n\n      During the stimulation period, the gait and the equilibrium assessments, using 3D motion\n      analysis will be done.\n\n      After the stimulation, the evaluations such as clinical, functional and motion analysis will\n      be realized again.\n\n      The tDCS experimental visit and the tDCS placebo visit will be spaced one week."
