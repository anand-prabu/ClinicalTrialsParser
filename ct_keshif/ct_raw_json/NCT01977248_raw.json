The manualized curriculum\n      addresses skills such as joint attention, eye contact, play, and peer engagement. Currently\n      individual goals are set for each child who participates and this is documented in the daily\n      treatment note. In order to research group outcomes, the investigators will use parent\n      questionnaires (an addition to current clinical practices) to measure changes in behavior\n      after each 12 week session for up to one year of treatment. The investigators hypothesize\n      that maladaptive behaviors will decrease and adaptive behaviors will increase in children\n      with ASD after participation in the SMART program."
