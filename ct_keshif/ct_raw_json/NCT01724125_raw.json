Given the complex health\n      needs and the fragmentation of care for persons with serious mental illnesses, these\n      individuals could derive particular benefit from a PHR. However, there are currently no\n      established PHRs developed for use in this population.\n\n      In order to fill this gap, the investigators propose to develop, test, and disseminate a\n      Personal Health Record for persons with serious mental illnesses and one or more comorbid\n      medical condition. The Mental Health PHR (MH-PHR) builds on an established personal health\n      record which was developed in partnership with medical consumers and is in wide use in a\n      number of communities in the United States and abroad."
