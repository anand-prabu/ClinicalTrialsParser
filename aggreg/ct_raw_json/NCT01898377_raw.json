Imatinib mesylate, a tyrosine kinase\n      inhibitor, has been shown to be effective in patients with sclerotic/fibrotic type chronic\n      GVHD by strongly inhibiting both PDGF (Platelet-derived growth factor) and TGF-\u03b2\n      (transforming growth factor-\u03b2) intracellular signaling, which is responsible for the\n      expression of extracellular matrix genes.\n\n      Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is one of effective agent for the treatment of chronic\n      graft-versus-host disease. MMF is rapidly absorbed after oral administration and hydrolyzed\n      to the active metabolite, MPA (mycophenolic acid). MPA selectively inhibits inosine\n      monophosphate dehydrogenase, blocking the pathway of purine synthesis in T and B\n      lymphocytes. In this study we will combine MMF and imatinib mesylate to treat\n      steroid-refractory sclerotic/fibrotic type chronic GVHD to see the response rate and to find\n      the safety of combination."
