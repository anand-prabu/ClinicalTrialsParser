The\n      main purpose of this study is to look at how much warfarin gets into the blood stream and\n      how long it takes the body to get rid of warfarin when given both with and without\n      evacetrapib. Another purpose is to evaluate the effectiveness of warfarin therapy to prevent\n      blood clots when given with evacetrapib by measuring the time it takes for blood to clot and\n      comparing it to an average of the international normalized ratio (INR). INR measures the\n      time it takes for blood to clot and compares it to an average.\n\n      The study will last approximately 5 weeks, not including screening."
