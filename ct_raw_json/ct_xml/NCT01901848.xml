  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and cigarette smoking are both associated with
      significant impairment in Veterans and cost to the Veterans' Affairs (VA) system. Though
      research suggests smoking is linked with PTSD symptoms, existing smoking cessation
      treatments targeting PTSD smokers do not include PTSD treatment. The purpose of this study
      is to examine a treatment that combines evidence based treatment for PTSD (cognitive
      processing therapy, or CPT) with smoking cessation treatment for PTSD  and a mobile text
      messaging program. The study objectives are to evaluate feasibility of the treatment and to
      examine effectiveness of CPT and smoking cessation treatment combined compared to smoking
      cessation treatment without CPT. Fifty Veteran smokers with PTSD will participate in
      fourteen study sessions, ending with the final follow-up session six months after the
      scheduled quit date.

    <textblock>
      Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and cigarette smoking are both associated with
      significant impairment in Veterans and cost to the Veterans' Affairs (VA) system. Though
      naturalistic and laboratory studies suggest smoking is linked with PTSD symptoms, existing
      smoking cessation treatments targeting PTSD smokers have not utilized standardized,
      evidence-based PTSD treatment. The most effective smoking cessation approach to date for
      PTSD smokers, Integrated Care for Smoking Cessation (ICSC), relies on delivery of smoking
      cessation treatment by the individual's PTSD treatment provider. In a recent trial comparing
      ICSC to VA specialty Smoking Cessation Clinic care, ICSC produced significantly better
      prolonged smoking abstinence. However, ICSC was associated with only modest improvements in
      PTSD symptoms, with no difference between ICSC and smoking cessation treatment alone,
      suggesting a likely avenue for improving ICSC. We have developed an intervention that
      combines evidence based treatment for PTSD [cognitive processing therapy (CPT-C)] with
      evidence based smoking cessation for PTSD [Integrated Care for Smoking Cessation (ICSC)] and
      a mobile text messaging program. The primary aim of the proposed study is to evaluate the
      integration of CPT-C and smoking cessation treatment in an individual 12-session PTSD
      protocol as compared to a protocol including the same smoking cessation treatment for
      individuals with PTSD, but without CPT-C. This intervention will be evaluated with the
      following hypotheses:

        1. Compared to the smoking cessation alone protocol, the smoking cessation + concurrent
           CPT-C protocol will result in reduced frequency and intensity of PTSD symptoms.

        2. Compared to the smoking cessation alone protocol, the smoking cessation + concurrent
           CPT-C protocol will result in reduced depressive symptoms.

        3. The smoking cessation + concurrent CPT-C protocol will result in decreased smoking
           rates, relative to published data on VA smoking cessation usual care.

        4. Greater PTSD symptom reduction during the smoking cessation + concurrent CPT-C
           treatment will result in longer duration to smoking lapse and relapse.

        5. Exploratory research question: Will candidate genes described earlier predict treatment
           response in smokers with PTSD?

        6. Exploratory research question: Will use of automated text messaging as an adjunct to
           smoking cessation be feasible, and will it impact quit rates?

      The development of a combined CPT-C/ICSC intervention with established empirical support
      would benefit the many Veterans with PTSD who smoke by providing them with treatment of two
      pervasive problems with significant associated impairment. In addition, this treatment could
      substantially reduce the cost of administering two individual treatments separately by
      administering them in combination.

    <description>CPT is based on a social cognitive theory of PTSD that includes primary emotional responses to traumatic events such as fear, anger, and sadness, as well as secondary emotions resulting from a patient's faulty interpretations of the traumatic event. CPT addresses PTSD by facilitating affective expression so that affective components of the trauma memory can be altered. In addition, faulty beliefs about the trauma are challenged and modified using Socratic questioning.</description>
