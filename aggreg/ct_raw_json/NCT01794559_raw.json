The wash out period for outpatients is no\n      longer than 14 days.\n\n      The subjects will be followed for 6 months after the initial treatment, or until the patient\n      has achieved maximum medical improvement (MMI).  The patient will be seen on a routine basis\n      and assessments will be made at each interaction to evaluate the patient's improvement in\n      mental health.  The subjects will also be closely evaluated to determine if they are\n      experiencing any psychiatric specific adverse events.  The investigator is allowed to treat\n      the patient according to their best medical judgment, which may include adding or changing\n      medications, seeing the patient more frequently, or other interventions such as the use of\n      sleep aids."
