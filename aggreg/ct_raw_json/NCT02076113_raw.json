There are no\n      established guidelines for the management of patients with CSM, which represents the most\n      common cause of spinal cord injury and dysfunction in the US and in the world.\n\n      This study aims to test the hypothesis that ventral surgery is associated with superior\n      Short Form-36 physical component Score (SF-36 PCS) outcome at one year follow-up compared to\n      dorsal approaches and that both ventral and dorsal surgery improve symptoms of spinal cord\n      dysfunction measured using the modified Japanese Orthopedic Association Score (mJOA).  A\n      secondary hypothesis is that health resource utilization for ventral surgery, dorsal fusion,\n      and laminoplasty surgery are different.  A third hypothesis is that cervical sagittal\n      balance post-operatively is a significant predictor of SF-36 PCS outcome."
