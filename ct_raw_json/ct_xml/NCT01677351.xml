  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clonidine, an agonist for alfa2 pre-synaptic, has been shown to be an effective adjuvant
      therapy for acute postoperative pain and has been shown an effect in sedative, intra-ocular
      and blood pressure and arrhythmias.The objective of this study is evaluating the analgesic
      effect of clonidine and its repercussion on arterial and intraocular pressure and
      arrhythmias for cataract surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After approved by the Ethical Committee and signed informed consent, 40 patients aged from
      40 until 80 years undergoing cataract extraction will be randomized in two groups. Exclusion
      criteria will be myocardial ischemia, psychiatric disease, chronic pain, drugs dependency,
      chronic use of  beta-blockage channel drugs. Group 2, patients will receive a single dose of
      4mcg.kg-1 of clonidin2, 20 minutes before the surgical incision; group 1, patients will
      receive a sterile saline solution dose. Pain intensity will be assessed with the numeric
      rating scale. The antiarrythmic effect will be assessed with the continuous measure by
      Holter. The number of patients was calculated by Instat Graph® program. To detect difference
      in pain intensity of 3 between the groups by NRS, with 95% of power (estimated SD= 2.0),
      when the alpha level is set at 0.05, the sample should be of 20. Statistical analyses will
      be performed with parametric and nonparametric tests, considering the variety studied. The
      statistical program that will be utilized is Instat Graph®.
