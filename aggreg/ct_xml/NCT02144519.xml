  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators long-term goal is to advance the adoption and successful implementation of
      policies that promote PA and nutrition in after school programs (ASP) nationwide. The
      investigators objective here is two fold. First, the investigators will test the
      effectiveness of two promising strategies designed to 1) increase the amount of PA children
      accumulate while attending an ASP and 2) promote changes in the nutritional quality of the
      snacks served. This represents a fundamental step in establishing practice-based guidelines
      (best practices) for the uptake and achievement of public health policy goals (CA and
      Harvard). Second, the investigators will examine the barriers and facilitators to
      implementing these strategies. The expected outcome of this study is evidence supporting
      best practices for ASPs to employ to meet policy goals.

      The investigators will use a 3-year delayed treatment, cluster randomized controlled trial
      design with 20 ASPs that serve mostly low-income and minority children (approximately 1300
      children ages 6-12yrs) in Columbia, SC and address the following specific aims: Aim 1.
      Evaluate the impact of a staff-level intervention, a professional development training
      program focused on core competencies to promote physical activity, on children's physical
      activity levels; Aim 2. Evaluate the impact of a site-level intervention, a snack
      modification program that includes a discount buying program, on the quality of snacks
      served and consumed; and Aim 3. Evaluate the implementation of the staff-level and
      site-level interventions and identify organizational, staff, and setting characteristics
      that influence the process of implementing these strategies.
