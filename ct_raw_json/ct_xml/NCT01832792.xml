  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Guided self-help (GSH) is a recommended first-step treatment for bulimia nervosa, binge
      eating disorder, and atypical variants of these disorders.  The current study proposes to
      investigate the effectiveness of providing GSH either face-to-face or via e-mail, also using
      a delayed treatment control condition.  Symptom outcomes will be assessed, and an estimate
      of cost-effectiveness made.  Results are proposed to be disseminated locally and
      internationally (through submission to conferences and peer-reviewed journals), and will
      hopefully inform local service provision.

      Please note that we are only able to offer the intervention to individuals who are currently
      registered with a General Practitioner that is covered by Oxford Health NHS Foundation Trust
      - this is typically restricted to practices in Oxfordshire, Buckinghamshire, and parts of
      Wiltshire.

    <time_frame>Change in symptoms between Assessment, Start-of-treatment (approx. 3 months later), End-of-treatment (approx. 12 weeks after start of treatment), and 6-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The EDE-Q is given as a measure of eating disorder symptoms in a standardised pack of measures, all given at Assessment, Start-of-treatment, End-of-treatment, and 6-month follow-up.  &quot;Assessment&quot; concerns the patient's first contact with the Eating Disorders Service.  Start-of-treatment will proceed as soon as possible; at present, the waiting list is around 3 months.  Treatment lasts 12 weeks, so End-of-treatment measures will be given approximately 12 weeks after start of treatment.  There is a 6-month follow-up.  Binge eating is the primary outcome measure, with other eating disorder symptoms as secondary measures.  Change in these symptoms will be assessed over the course of treatment.</description>

    <time_frame>Change in symptoms between Assessment, Start-of-treatment (approx. 3 months later), End-of-treatment (approx. 12 weeks after start of treatment), and 6-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The CORE-OM is given as a measure of psychological distress in a standardised pack of measures, all given at Assessment, Start-of-treatment, End-of-treatment, and 6-month follow-up.  &quot;Assessment&quot; concerns the patient's first contact with the Eating Disorders Service.  Start-of-treatment will proceed as soon as possible; at present, the waiting list is around 3 months.  Treatment lasts 12 weeks, so End-of-treatment measures will be given approximately 12 weeks after start of treatment.  There is a 6-month follow-up.</description>

    <description>The RSES is given as a measure of self-esteem in a standardised pack of measures, all given at Assessment, Start-of-treatment, End-of-treatment, and 6-month follow-up.  &quot;Assessment&quot; concerns the patient's first contact with the Eating Disorders Service.  Start-of-treatment will proceed as soon as possible; at present, the waiting list is around 3 months.  Treatment lasts 12 weeks, so End-of-treatment measures will be given approximately 12 weeks after start of treatment.  There is a 6-month follow-up.</description>

    <time_frame>Change in symptoms between Assessment, Start-of-treatment (approx. 3 months later), End-of-treatment (approx. 12 weeks after start of treatment), and 6-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The CIA is given as a measure of psychological functioning (quality of life) in a standardised pack of measures, all given at Assessment, Start-of-treatment, End-of-treatment, and 6-month follow-up.  &quot;Assessment&quot; concerns the patient's first contact with the Eating Disorders Service.  Start-of-treatment will proceed as soon as possible; at present, the waiting list is around 3 months.  Treatment lasts 12 weeks, so End-of-treatment measures will be given approximately 12 weeks after start of treatment.  There is a 6-month follow-up.</description>

    <measure>HAq-II</measure>
    <time_frame>End of Session 3 of treatment (3 weeks into treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>The Helping Alliance Questionnaire is given as a measure of therapeutic alliance after Session 3 of treatment (after 3 weeks from start of treatment) and again at end-of-treatment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Healthcare Use</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in healthcare use between Start-of-treatment (approx. 3 months later), End-of-treatment (approx. 12 weeks after start of treatment), and 6-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>A measure of healthcare use was developed for the study and is given at Start-of-treatment, End-of-treatment, and 6-month follow-up.  Start-of-treatment will proceed as soon as possible after assessment; at present, the waiting list is around 3 months.  Treatment lasts 12 weeks, so End-of-treatment measures will be given approximately 12 weeks after start of treatment.  There is a 6-month follow-up.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Therapist Time</measure>
    <time_frame>After every contact with the patient (approx. weekly), including weekly sessions during treatment (12 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Therapists are asked to indicate (to the nearest 5 minutes) how much time they spend doing clinical / administrative tasks for each patient (patient name not included).  Although there are no formal guidelines for how therapists report their time, it should accurately record all contact with patients, and thus is suggested to be completed approximately weekly.</description>
