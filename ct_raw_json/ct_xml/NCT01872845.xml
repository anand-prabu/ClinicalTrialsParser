  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current consensus papers recommend statin medication to reduce Low density lipoprotein (LDL)
      cholesterol level less than 100mg/dL (optional 70mg/dL) in patients with coronary artery
      disease. However, there is lack of solid evidence whether a specific kind of statin have the
      superiority against other statins in clinical outcomes. Furthermore, recent data have showed
      that several kinds of statin could have an adverse effect on glucose metabolism and increase
      the risk of development of diabetes. Carotid Intimamedia thickness (CIMT) is a surrogate
      marker of atherosclerosis to predict long term cardiovascular outcomes in not only general
      population but also patients with established coronary artery disease. Consequently, we will
      evaluate the efficacy of high dose of pravastatin on CIMT, comparing with moderate dose of
      rosuvastatin in patients with established coronary artery disease. Additionally, we will
      assess the clinical outcomes of pravastatin after percutaneous coronary intervention as well
      as adverse outcomes including insulin resistance and new onset diabetes compared with
      rosuvastatin. Our main hypothesis is that pravastatin 40mg would be non-inferior to
      rosuvastatin 20mg regarding CIMT at 1 year follow up.
