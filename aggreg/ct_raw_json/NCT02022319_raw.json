            "textblock": "Background: The main goal of diagnosing thyroid nodules is to differentiate the few\n      malignant from the large background of benign lesion. Currently available pre-operative\n      tests are unable to rule out malignancy in a subset of patients and diagnostic surgery is\n      necessary. Therefore there is a need to develope the available diagnostic tools for the\n      pre-operative diagnostic work-up of thyroid nodules.\n\n      The study will investigate a novel ultrasonographic technique called Shear Wave Elastography\n      (SWE) in the pre-operative evaluation of thyroid nodules.\n\n      Hypothesis:\n\n      1) SWE is a precise tool for evaluation of thyroid nodules in terms of inter- and\n      intra-observer reliability and day-to-day variation.\n\n      The study will be conducted as part of a larger PhD study, and an evaluation of the\n      diagnostic value of thyroid SWE will be evaluated in a larger study.\n\n      Perspectives:\n\n      An optimization of the pre-operative risk-stratification and diagnosis of thyroid nodules\n      can reduce unnecessary thyroid surgery, with a reduction in morbidity and better use of the\n      economic and surgical resources."
