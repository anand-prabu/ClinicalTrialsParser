  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is the 4th leading cause of death in United States with an estimated 1 death every 4
      minutes. On average, someone suffers from stroke in United States every 40th second. Stroke
      recurs in 1 out of 4 stroke patients. About 87% of the strokes are as a result of ischemic
      insult. The total economic burden from stroke accounts to 38.6 billion dollars per year.
      Stroke is also one of the leading causes of long term disability. Current stroke therapies
      concentrate mainly on acute revascularization, sub-acute rehabilitation and secondary
      prevention.

      Neuroprotection is not the mainstay of treatment modality as there are no effective regimen
      which has satisfied stroke clinicians and researchers. Many neuroprotection agents have
      shown excellent pre-clinical results but have failed in clinical translation. Thus we need
      to find new treatments in order to decrease the mortality and morbidity caused by stroke.

      The investigators hypothesize that adopting a narrower therapeutic window, with treatment
      initiation in the first six hours, may demonstrate a positive or significant short and long
      term neuroprotective effect from NMDA/Glutaminergic or histaminergic antagonism when
      compared with standard of care.

      If the subject decides to take part in this study, the subject will be placed randomly in
      the treatment group or the standard of care group. This means:

      The subject will be given either the treatment drugs with standard of care for stroke or
      only standard of care. If the subject is placed in the treatment group the subject will be
      again randomly administered either diphenhydramine oral or through an injection in the vein
      for 4 days or dextromethorphan tablet orally for 2 days. In the treatment group the subject
      will receive another drug named famotidine through an injection in vein as a prophylaxis to
      prevent any gastrointestinal bleeding or ulceration whereas in the standard of care group
      the subject will receive pantoprazole through an injection in the vein for the same purpose.
      If the subject cannot take medication orally then we will put a tube through the nose to the
      subject's stomach or small intestine or we might also put a gastric tube directly into the
      subject's stomach surgically through a small cut in the belly. The investigators will
      collect information for the medical charts to include: imaging data, stroke assessments and
      medical history. A neurological exam will done, called the National Institutes of Health
      Stroke Scale (NIHSS).  It is used to assess the neurologic damage caused by stroke. A
      Modified Rankin Scale (m-RS) will also be performed and this is a scale used to measure the
      degree of disability or dependence in the daily activities after a stroke.

      The subject will be asked to come for a follow-up at 3 months after the discharge from the
      hospital and the following will be done:

        1. Modified Rankin Scale (m-RS) scores NIH Stroke Scale scores

        2. CT or MRI of the head without contrast

    <description>The modified Rankin Scale (m-RS) is a commonly used scale for measuring the degree of disability or dependence in the daily activities of people after they have suffered a stroke.It is one of the most widely used clinical outcome measure for stroke clinical trials. The score is given according to following scale.
0- No symptoms at all
No significant disability despite symptoms; able to carry out all usual duties and activities
Slight disability; unable to carry out all previous activities, but able to look after own affairs without assistance
Moderate disability; requiring some help, but able to walk without assistance
Moderately severe disability; unable to walk without assistance and unable to attend to own bodily needs without assistance
Severe disability; bedridden, incontinent and requiring constant nursing care and attention

    <description>NIHSS is a tool used by healthcare providers to objectively quantify the degree of impairment caused by a stroke. It is composed of 11 items. Each item scores a specific ability between a score of 0-4. Usually, for each item, a score of 0 indicates normal function in that specific ability, while a higher score indicates some level of impairment. The individual scores from each item are added together to calculate a patient's total NIHSS score. The maximum possible score is 42, with the minimum score being a 0.</description>
