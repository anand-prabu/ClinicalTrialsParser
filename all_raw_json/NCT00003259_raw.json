Evaluate the toxicity of vinorelbine in these\n      patients. III. Evaluate the quality of life of these patients, and correlate quality of life\n      with PSA response.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients receive a 5-10 minute intravenous infusion of vinorelbine on day 1 and day\n      8 of a 21-day course. Patients with stabilization of their disease, partial response, or\n      complete response, receive a maximum of 12 courses of treatment. Patients showing disease\n      progression or severe toxic side effects discontinue treatment. Quality of life and pain are\n      assessed prior to treatment, at days 1 and 8 of each course, and at end of the treatment.\n      Patients are followed every 3 months until disease progression.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-40 patients will be accrued for this study."
