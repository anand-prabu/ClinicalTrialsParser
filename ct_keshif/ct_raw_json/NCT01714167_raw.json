However, even with rehabilitation therapy, 50% to\n      95% of stroke survivors remain impaired. There is thus a great need for new therapeutic\n      developments for patients with disability after stroke, which is largely unexplored.\n      Regenerative cell-based therapies offer long-term hope for many patients with stroke, as\n      stem cells might be possible for dead or injured neural cells to be replaced after acute\n      stroke. In this study, the investigators will assess the safety and feasibility of\n      intracerebral transplantation of autologous bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells in patients\n      with chronic stroke. The neurological outcome will be determined after transplantation."
