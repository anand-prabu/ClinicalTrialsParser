  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Excision repair cross complementing 1 (ERCC1) ribonucleotide reductase M1 (RRM1) 、β-tubulin
      (TUB) and thymidylate synthase(TS) are molecular determinants that predict sensitivity or
      resistance to platinum agents 、paclitaxel  gemcitabine and pemetrexed respectively.

      Tailored therapy using these molecular determinants suggested patient benefit in a
      previously reported phase 2 trial. Here, we designed a study for an individual patient
      analysis of prospectively accrued patients who were treated with the &quot;personalized therapy&quot;
      approach versus other standard approaches.

      Patients who had nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) performance status of 0/1 were accrued to
      2 phase 2 clinical trials Trial A (carboplatin and chemotherapy individuation based on
      sensitivity marker ), Trial B (carboplatin non-individuation or chemotherapy
      non-individuation ).

      Patients who were treated on Trials B were analyzed as the &quot;standard therapy&quot; group.
      Patients accrued to Trial A were called the &quot;personalized therapy&quot; group. Overall survival
      (OS), disease free survival (DFS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were estimated using
      the Kaplan-Meier method.
