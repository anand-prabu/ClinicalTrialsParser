The investigators have used these two drugs for many years to\n      treat patients with Ewing sarcoma whose cancer has relapsed.\n\n      For patients with newly diagnosed Ewing sarcoma the current standard of care at MSKCC is a\n      five drug chemotherapy regimen in combination with surgery and/or radiation therapy. This\n      standard regimen is called the EFT regimen. . Some patients with Ewing sarcoma do not have\n      their cancer cured by the chemotherapy and surgery/radiation therapy.\n\n      This study adds the chemotherapy drugs called irinotecan and temozolomide to the standard\n      EFT regimen. The investigators are trying to improve the success of standard therapy by\n      adding these drugs. The use of irinotecan and temozolomide in this study is experimental\n      because they have not been used before in patients with newly diagnosed Ewing sarcoma.\n      However the investigators have found these drugs to be effective in patients with relapsed\n      Ewing sarcoma. It is not known if adding these two drugs will improve the outcomes of\n      patients treated for Ewing sarcoma."
