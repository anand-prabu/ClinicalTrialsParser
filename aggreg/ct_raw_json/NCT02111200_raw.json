            "textblock": "The research will be performed as an outpatient over a four-day period at Texas Children's\n      Hospital and the Metabolic Research Unit, of the CNRC. On Day 1 of both treatment arms,\n      subjects will be asked to arrive at the Clinical Care Center of TCH early in the morning\n      having fasted (had nothing to eat or drink) since midnight. Study staff will draw 6 mL\n      (slightly over 1 teaspoon) of blood. From this sample, red and white blood cells will be\n      measured. This is to rule out anemia (too few red blood blood cells) or infection (which\n      often causes a high number of white blood cells). The chemistries in the blood will also be\n      measured. This is to be sure that the levels of certain substances like sodium and potassium\n      are normal, that the blood sugar is not too high or too low, and that the subject's liver\n      and kidneys are working well. The blood will also be sent to the lab to test the subject's\n      ammonia level (the by-product of protein breakdown). A physical examination will be\n      performed, and a medical history will be taken. During the physical examination, an\n      investigator will listen to the subject's chest and abdomen with a stethoscope, test his/her\n      reflexes and look in his/her nose, mouth, and ears. In addition, arms and legs, skin,\n      muscles, joints, and spine as well as the subject's ability to walk and move will be\n      assessed. Vital signs, including heart rate, blood pressure, rate of breathing and\n      temperature, and height and weight will be measured.  A urine pregnancy test will be\n      performed on all women able to have children.\n\n      Investigators will place study participants on one of the study medications (either sodium\n      phenylbutyrate or sodium benzoate) and a protein-restricted diet. Study staff will closely\n      monitor everything subjects eat during each treatment arm by providing them with\n      pre-measured meals three times a day for Days 1-3. Subjects may take all their meals for\n      Days 1-3 with them or pick up their meals daily at the CNRC. Study medications will be in\n      powder form, and prescribed at a dose based on the subject's weight. The study medication\n      must be taken in equal doses, at breakfast,(8 AM), lunch (1 PM), and dinner (7 PM). The\n      powder may be mixed in a flavored syrup and water and given by mouth or gastrostomy tube, if\n      the subject has one. Subjects will be discharged on Day 1 with a scale, instructions on how\n      to weigh out the powder, and enough study medication to last until their next study visit on\n      Day 4. After the Day 1 clinic visit, subjects will be able to return home if they live\n      locally. If they would prefer, or live too far from the Medical Center, study staff may\n      arrange for them to stay in a local hotel between study visits.\n\n      For the next visit, on Day 4, subjects may be admitted to the Metabolic Research Unit of the\n      CNRC at 7 AM in the morning. If it is more convenient, study staff will arrange for them to\n      be admitted the evening before. In the morning of Day 4, after an overnight fast, study\n      staff will put a small tube (catheter) into a vein in the subject's hand or arm. This\n      catheter will be taped to their hand or arm and remain there for the next 8-9 hours. If\n      preferred, a numbing cream may be placed on the skin before inserting the catheter to lessen\n      the pain felt. A sample of urine will be collected before breakfast and then urine will be\n      collected every two hours for 8 hours.\n\n      When the catheter is placed, study staff will draw 5 ml (about one teaspoon) of blood. From\n      this sample, blood ammonia, plasma amino acids and stable isotopes levels will be measured.\n      Once the catheter is in place, subjects will have breakfast of a protein drink (Ensure)\n      containing 15N labeled protein plus one half of their daily protein allowance. In addition,\n      subjects will receive a small dose of a stable isotope of urea through their vein over five\n      minutes. Stable isotopes are non-radioactive, non-toxic and already present in the body.\n      After the infusion is finished, study staff will draw blood (5 mL, approx. a teaspoon) every\n      30 minutes for 3 hours, and then hourly until the end of the study (8 hours). Subjects will\n      be offered a low protein snack at lunchtime.\n\n      A total of 67 mL (~13.5 teaspoons) of blood will be drawn during the entire study.\n\n      All procedures conducted during this study are being performed for research purposes, and\n      participation in the study ends when subjects are discharged on Day 4 of the second\n      treatment arm."
