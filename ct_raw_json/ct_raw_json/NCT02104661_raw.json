Drugs that may prevent nerve loss\n      work better in earlier stages when it is difficult to measure progressive disability. But it\n      is now possible to measure the nerve loss as neurofilament light (NFL) in the cerebrospinal\n      fluid (CSF). This is a trial of a neuroprotective drug, oxcarbazepine, which showed benefit\n      in an animal model of multiple sclerosis. The investigators will use an innovative outcome,\n      a reduction in the content of NFL in the CSF, as well as the usual clinical disability and\n      imaging methods, to measure the success of the oxcarbazepine as a neuroprotective agent in\n      MS. The use of NFL, a surrogate marker of neurodegeneration, allows a blinded and accurate\n      outcome."
