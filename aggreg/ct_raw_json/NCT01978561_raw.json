Subjects who are pregnant at Week 10 of gestation will be enrolled in\n      NT-04.\n\n      Subjects in NT-04 will be contacted by telephone every 6 to 8 weeks until Week 38 of\n      gestation, at which time subjects will be contacted every two weeks until confirmation of\n      delivery.  Information about pregnancy status and use of prescription medications will be\n      collected at these telephone interviews.\n\n      Between Weeks 18 and 22 of gestation, an obstetrical ultrasound will be performed.\n\n      Following delivery, additional information will be obtained, including pregnancy outcome,\n      gestational age at delivery, etc.  Standardized photographs will be taken as part of a\n      newborn assessment."
