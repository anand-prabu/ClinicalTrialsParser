  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to determine the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of a single oral dose
      of PBT2 administered to healthy volunteers in the presence and absence of food.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted in 2 dosing periods, with participants being randomised to
      receive PBT2 250 mg with or without food in the first dosing period, followed by a 7 day
      washout period before receiving the opposite fed/fasted condition to that allocated in the
      first dosing period. Pharmacokinetic samples will be collected during each dosing period,
      along with safety monitoring assessments.
