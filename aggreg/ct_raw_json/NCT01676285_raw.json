The purpose of this prospective, randomized trial is to\n      determine whether metoprolol succinate can revert cardiac dysfunction secondary to cirrhosis\n      (cirrhotic cardiomyopathy), and prevent complications (renal dysfunction, mortality). A\n      total of 100 patients with cirrhotic cardiomyopathy will be randomized (Group R) to receive\n      metoprolol succinate or placebo; other 25 patients without cirrhotic cardiomyopathy (Group\n      F) will only be followed up without medication. All patients will be evaluated in the\n      beginning and again after six months. The assessment protocol includes clinical evaluation,\n      electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, laboratory analysis and life quality questionaire. The\n      end points will be cardiac remodeling, electrophysiologic changes, sympathetic activity,\n      laboratory issue changes, renal function, quality of life, and mortality."

            "textblock": "Cirrhotic cardiomyopathy (CMC) is defined as a chronic cardiac dysfunction in patients with\n      cirrhosis. Moreover, it is characterized by an abnormal and blunted response to pathological\n      or pharmacological stress in the absence of any other associated cardiac disease. The\n      diagnostic criteria are: baseline increased cardiac output, attenuated myocardial\n      contractile response to stress, diastolic dysfunction, and electrophysiological\n      repolarization abnormalities. It is suspected that cardiac dysfunction in cirrhosis\n      contribute to the onset of complications in liver disease. We will investigate the effect of\n      metoprolol succinate in the reversal of cardiac dysfunction and prevention of complications\n      of cirrhosis in patients with cirrhotic cardiomyopathy. Furthermore, we want to study the\n      influence of presence of CMC in the evolution of cirrhotic patients. The study will be\n      prospective, randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled. The sample consists of 125\n      patients aged between 18 and 60 years old diagnosed with severe liver cirrhosis (Child B or\n      C or MELD score above 10) with cirrhotic cardiomyopathy or not. Of these, 100 patients with\n      cirrhotic cardiomyopathy will be randomized into two groups: group R1 (metoprolol succinate)\n      and group R2 (placebo). Group F will consist of cirrhotic patients without cardiomyopathy\n      and will not receive medication. Patients will be evaluated by clinical examination, resting\n      electrocardiogram, 24-hour Holter, stress echocardiography and laboratory (brain natriuretic\n      peptide (BNP), catecholamines, plasma renin activity, and troponin) at inclusion and after\n      six months. The end points are: 1) Reversal of cardiac dysfunction in patients with\n      cirrhotic cardiomyopathy, 2) Development of hepatorenal syndrome, 3) Reversal of the\n      electrophysiologic abnormalities, 4)Changes in laboratory tests, and 5) Mortality."
