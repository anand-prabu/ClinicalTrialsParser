  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The efficacy of codeine is dependent on its demethylation to morphine. This extent of
      demethylation has wide inter-individual variability, making codeine's efficacy as a
      analgesic variable. Oxycodone is a semi-synthetic opioid and is a weak agonist on mu opioid
      receptors.

      Codeine has been the mainstay of analgesia for patients after craniotomy for many years.
      Traditionally, craniotomies were not thought to be very painful procedures, hence the use of
      codeine, a moderately potent opioid (when compared to morphine).

      However, in recent years, it has been found that up to 70% of post-craniotomy patients have
      moderate to severe pain and codeine did not provide adequate analgesic relief. Many studies
      have compared codeine to other drugs such as PCA morphine, fentanyl and tramadol, and
      patients on these stronger opioids generally had lower pain scores and better satisfaction.

      No study has been conducted to determine the efficacy of analgesia of oral oxycodone to oral
      codeine.

      Hence, the hypothesis is that oxycodone is more effective than codeine in providing pain
      relief in post-craniotomy patients.
