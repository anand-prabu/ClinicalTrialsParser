    <description>During a procedure, the surgical condition will be scored by one surgeon using a 5-point surgical rating scale. The rating scale is a 5-point ordinal scale ranging from 1 = poor condition to 5 = optimal surgical conditions. The surgeon will score the condition at 15 minute intervals.</description>

    <measure>The relation between scoring of surgical conditions by the surgeon and video assisted scoring of surgical conditions.</measure>
    <time_frame>peroperative</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Video images will be collected from the camera connected to the endoscopic probe placed in the retroperitoneal field of surgery. The images collected are the images used by the surgeon to observe the surgical field throughout the procedure (these are his working images). The video images will be edited into short 1-2 min snippets at 15 min intervals (corresponding with the moment of surgical scoring). The rating scale is a 5-point ordinal scale ranging from 1 = poor condition to 5 = optimal surgical conditions. Postoperative these images will be scored by 15 anesthesiologists and 10 surgeons</description>
