However FNA with small\n      needle has sometimes failed in acquisition of tissue due to small caliber. To overcome this\n      limitation, newly designed ProCore needle was developed and flexible 22 and 25 gauge ProCore\n      needles were frequently used. However there was no comparative study of the efficacy and\n      accuracy between 22 and 25 gauge ProCore needle yet.\n\n      Aim:\n\n      To compare the efficacy and accuracy of EUS-guided FNA between 22 and 25 gauge ProCore\n      needle. (The investigators hypothesized that the accuracy of 25 gauge Procore needle is not\n      inferior to 22 gauge ProCore needle.)"
