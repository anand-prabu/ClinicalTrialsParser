      This is a Phase 1, multi-center, open-label, single-dose, 2 period, 2 sequence cross-over
      trial to investigate the relative bioavailability of 2 solid oral pimasertib formulations in
      cancer subjects (Part A), followed by open-label pimasertib administration (Part B and trial
      extension phase).
