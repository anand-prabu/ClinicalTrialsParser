            "textblock": "Trichomonas vaginalis (TV), the most common sexually transmitted infection in the world, is\n      associated with inflammation of the vagina, cervix, and urethra; low birth weight; preterm\n      delivery; pelvic inflammatory disease; and may increase the risk of acquiring and\n      transmitting genital herpes and HIV. Repeat infections are common, ranging from 5% - 31%,\n      and have similar health outcomes as primary infections. Given the high prevalence of TV, the\n      absence of a national screening program, the deleterious reproductive outcomes associated\n      with TV and the potential for a TV infection to increase HIV transmission, reducing repeat\n      TV infections is an important targeted public health approach. However, rescreening for TV\n      should not happen until there is sufficient time for the parasites and DNA to clear from the\n      vaginal cavity after treatment. HIV negative women who attend Delgado Personal Health Center\n      will be asked to enroll in the screening component in order to test them for TV using\n      InPouch culture along with the standard TV screening of wet preparation. The objective of\n      this study is to screen treated TV positive women weekly using culture and Polymerase Chain\n      Reaction to determine how long TV DNA is detectable post treatment and to examine potential\n      confounders to clearance such as bacterial vaginosis. The outcome of interest will be a\n      negative PCR result indicating that TV DNA has cleared."
