    <textblock>
      Phase IIa study in COPD patients aimed to evaluate the safety, tolerability
      ,pharmacodynamics (effect on biological markers of inflammation in induced sputum and in
      blood, and on pulmonary function) and on  pharmacokinetics of CHF 6001 (a PDE4 inhibitor)
      after 28-days of daily inhaled dosing.
