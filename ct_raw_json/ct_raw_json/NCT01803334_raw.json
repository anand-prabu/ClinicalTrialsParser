The\n      patient will be randomized into two groups: preoperative marking the abdomen versus\n      conventional preoperative counseling.\n\n      If the patient is randomized to the marking the abdomen group (study group) she will then\n      have the anticipated incision needed to place the trocars during her surgery marked on her\n      abdomen by the surgeon attending physician involved in the patient care during the\n      preoperative counseling visit. If she is randomized to the control group, then she will\n      undergo traditional preoperative counseling by the same team without marking the abdomen.\n\n      After completed the surgery, information regarding type of surgery, reason for the\n      procedure, estimated blood loss, surgical length, complications, location and size of\n      abdominal incisions made on the patient's abdomen will be collected. Then at the 6 weeks\n      post op visit, patient's satisfaction with the incision scar will be evaluated with a\n      validated patient scar assessment questionnaire form and by one 5 point Likert scale\n      question used in previous studies. The pain at rest at the incision site will be evaluated\n      by a Visual Analog Pain Scale (VAS). Patients will also be asked to evaluate their\n      generalized pain using a modified McGill Present Pain Intensity Scale."
