  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to assess the reproducibility of quantitative measurements of
      myocardial uptake of Iobenguane I 123 on planar and SPECT imaging following intravenous
      (iv.) administration of AdreView.  Efficacy will be assessed based upon the absolute
      differences between quantitative analyses of imaging data on 2 scans performed 5 to 14 days
      apart.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject was originally diagnosed with NYHA Class II-III HF due to ischemic heart
             disease at least 3 months or due to non-ischemic cardiomyopathy at least 6 months
             before enrolment into the study.

          -  The subject has Left Ventricular (LV) dysfunction with Left Ventricular Ejection
             Fraction (LVEF) less than or equal to 35% measured by an appropriate method (e.g.,
             radionuclide or contrast ventriculography, electrocardiogram (ECG)-gated SPECT
             myocardial perfusion imaging [MPI], magnetic resonance imaging, CT or
             echocardiography) within 6 months of enrolment into the study and documented in the
             subject's medical record.

          -  The subject has a history of compliance with prescribed HF medications and takes
             Heart Failure (HF) guidelines-based medication at study entry including at a minimum
             a beta-blocker and either an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin
             receptor antagonist unless documented to be intolerant to any of these classes of
             medications.

          -  The subject has been on a stable medical regimen for a minimum of 3 months, with no
             hospitalizations or change in HF medications or HF symptoms.

          -  Subjects must be clinically stable for at least 7 days before enrolling in the study
             (e.g., not experiencing continuing chest pain or hemodynamic instability).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject has previously received 123I-mIBG or 131I-mIBG.

          -  The subject has known or suspected hypersensitivity/allergy to iodine, Iobenguane or
             to any of the excipients in AdreView.

          -  The subject has had a heart transplant at any time prior to enrollment.

          -  The subject had LVEF greater than 35% as measured by an appropriate method (e.g.,
             radionuclide or contrast ventriculography, ECG-gated SPECT MPI, MR, CT, or
             echocardiography) within 30 days prior to enrolment into the study.

          -  The subject has received defibrillation (either external or via an implantable
             cardioverter defibrillator [ICD]), anti-tachycardia pacing, or cardioversion to treat
             an arrhythmic event in the previous 90 days.

          -  The subject had a cardiac revascularization, insertion of an ICD, or acute myocardial
             infarction within 30 days before study entry.

          -  The subject has renal insufficiency (creatinine greater than 3 mg/dl).
