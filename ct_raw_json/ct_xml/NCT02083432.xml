    <textblock>
      The aims of the study:  to explore the possible effectiveness of cognitive behavior
      treatment (CBT) among children and adolescents with formally diagnosed intra-oral injection
      phobia (DSM-IV), when performed by specially trained dentists.

      The patients diagnosed with intra-oral injection phobia according to the diagnostic manual
      DSM-IV. The effect of cognitive behavior therapy when performed by specially trained
      dentists will be evaluated. Patients referred to the Centre for Odontophobia, and who meet
      the inclusion criteria, will be allocated to an immediate treatment group (test group) and a
      waiting list group (control group) of 30 subjects in each group. After treatment they will
      be followed up during a 1-year period.

      Hypotheses are formulated based on the literature and previous population and treatment
      studies of similar designs among adults at the Centre for Odontophobia.

The participants in the waiting list Control Group are enrolled to the treatment Group (5 sessions of CBT) after 5 weeks if they still meet the diagnostic criteria of a specific phobia (according to DSM-IV).</description>
