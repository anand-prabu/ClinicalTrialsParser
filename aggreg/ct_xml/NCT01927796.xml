    <textblock>
      The need to obtain human tissue (blood, urine, saliva, sweat, pleural, pericardia\, ascitic,
      synovial, cerebrospinal fluids) for methods development and disease correlation is frequent
      in Gerontology Research Center laboratories.  This protocol is to create the opportunity  to
      obtain such tissue samples that have been obtained during the course of usual clinical care
      and would be discarded, or alternatively, to obtain such samples during subject and patient
      screening for other studies (in this case only blood, urine, saliva, or sweat).
      Information derived from such studies is for research purposes only and is not provided to
      the patient/subject or their health care provider.   When genetic analyses are performed,
      samples will have been coded and identifying  information  linking patient/subject to the
      sample will be destroyed.   Any genetic information  obtained will have no established
      clinical value and will not be provided to the subject/patient or their health care
      provider.

      Patients included will be those 18 years or older and who have been identified by the
      investigator to have a condition of interest for exploratory studies related to the
      patient's illness or other feature that offers the possibility of creating information  that
      leads to scientifically useful and important  studies.  Patients will be excluded if
      obtaining the sample would be over and above usual clinical care, would result in excessive
      blood loss, or the individual is unable to provide informed consent.

      The expected outcome is to provide the investigator the opportunity  to obtain tissues of
      interest for laboratory evaluation with the goal of either better understanding a disease or
      to design a scientific study to better understand or treat a disease.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Age 18 or older.

          -  Identified by the investigator to have a condition of interest for exploratory
             studies related to the patient   s illness or other feature that offers the
             possibility of generation of hypotheses for future study.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  The patient would be subjected to diagnostic and/or therapeutic procedures that are
             not necessary for clinical management.

          -  Excessive blood loss if this phlebotomy plus other research participation and/or
             clinical evaluation will result in blood loss of greater than 1 unit (400 ml, 1 pint)
             over an 8-week period.

        Inability of the volunteer to give informed consent.
