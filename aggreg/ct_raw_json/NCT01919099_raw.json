            "textblock": "Background:\n\n      - The National Institutes of Health (NIH) performs up to 100 allogenic stem cell transplants\n      (allo-HSCT) each year.  Many studies already look at different problems that can follow a\n      transplant. But there are many types of transplants, diseases, responses, and treatments. An\n      organized study of this information could help researchers learn more about how often\n      transplant complications occur and what problems they cause. It could also lead to ideas for\n      future research. This study will focus on complications thought to be the most significant.\n\n      Objectives:\n\n      - To gather information on the complications that may occur after an allo-HSCT.\n\n      Eligibility:\n\n      - People over 2 years of age currently enrolled in an allo-HSCT study at NIH.\n\n      Design:\n\n        -  Visits for this study will be scheduled along with primary study visits. The number of\n           visits will depend on the primary study schedule.\n\n        -  At each visit, participants will answer questions and take physical exams.\n\n        -  The same questions and physical exams will continue for as long as they are in the\n           primary study.\n\n        -  In between visits, researchers might call participants to discuss their health. They\n           may also discuss the cases with the primary study doctors and other doctors. Primary\n           transplant study doctors will make treatment decisions.\n\n        -  When participation in the primary transplant study ends, participation in this study\n           will also end."

            "textblock": "Between 80 and 100 allogeneic stem cell transplants (allo-HSCT) are performed every year at\n      the NIH to treat a variety of malignant and nonmalignant conditions. The current transplant\n      protocols at the NIH focus on research regarding the response of the underlying disease, the\n      development of graft versus host disease (GVHD) as well as the feasibility and safety of a\n      variety of transplant strategies. Many clinically significant complications are considered\n      to be part of the transplant process and are not studied systematically. Even when they are\n      studied, the diverse institute-based protocols differ on the range of complications captured\n      and the amount of information collected on them. This leads to knowledge gaps regarding the\n      incidence and risk factors for complications in the various protocols.\n\n      This exploratory natural history study involves a prospective review of the medical records\n      of patients actively enrolled in allo-HSCT protocols at the NIH. The study will focus on\n      infections and a subset of noninfectious complications identified by the transplant\n      community as significant causes of morbidity, mortality and cost. The cost data captured in\n      this study will be the cost consumed by the Clinical Center. This study does not require any\n      sample collection and will consist merely of data collection and periodic patient\n      examinations that will be performed in conjunction with those already scheduled by the\n      original transplant protocol. The prospective collection of clinical data and information\n      available in the medical record will allow us to determine the rates of a number of\n      complications in different protocols. At the completion of the study, it is expected the\n      investigators will be able to generate preliminary hypotheses regarding risk factors for\n      infection and noninfectious complications, the impact of complications on transplant costs\n      and the correlation between laboratory immune reconstitution (usually determined by each\n      transplant protocol in a variety of ways and functional immune reconstitution (frequency of\n      infections)."
