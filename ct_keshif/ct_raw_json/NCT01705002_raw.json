The study comprised of eight cohorts, with three subjects\n      per cohort. Eligible subjects will be assigned, successively in order of accrual, to one of\n      eight cohorts, to receive escalating doses of intravenously infused PROMITIL. PROMITIL will\n      be administered as an intravenous infusion. Dose escalation will only proceed in the absence\n      of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). For this purpose, each cohort will only begin its first\n      cycle of PROMITIL when the cohort preceding it has successfully completed its first 4-week\n      cycle without any signs of DLT."
