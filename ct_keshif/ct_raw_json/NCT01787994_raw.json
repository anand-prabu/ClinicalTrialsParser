Concomitant acute or chronic hepatitis B (surface antigen positive) or hepatitis C\n             infection. If HCV antibody test is positive, an HCV RNA test will be performed. If\n             both HCV tests (antibody and RNA) are positive, the subjects will be excluded from\n             study. If HCV antibody test is positive, but HCV RNA test is negative, subject can\n             enroll.\n\n          3.

If subjects are\n             prescribed a brief course of oral corticosteroids, the use should be limited to less\n             than 7 days.\n\n          8. Use of steroids before apheresis and immune assessment blood draws should be\n             discouraged as it will affect white blood cell function.\n\n          9. Breast\u2010feeding, pregnant, or unwilling to use acceptable methods of birth control.\n\n         10. Use of aspirin, dipyrdamole, warfarin or any other medication that is likely to\n             affect platelet function or other aspects of blood coagulation during the 2\u2010week\n             period prior to leukapheresis.\n\n         11.

Serious illness requiring systemic treatment and/or hospitalization within 30 days\n             prior to study entry.\n\n         13. Asymptomatic baseline serum chemistry elevations in total or indirect bilirubin in\n             subjects receiving atazanavir or indinavir is not exclusionary. Asymptomatic baseline\n             serum chemistry elevations in LFTs, lipase and creatinine due to HAART medication are\n             not exclusionary, when in the opinion of the investigator, the abnormalities are not\n             attributable to intrinsic hepatorenal disease. Such elevations must be due to HAART.\n\n         14. Receipt of a vaccination within 30 days prior to study entry. NOTE: It is recommended\n             that subjects enrolling into this study should have completed their routine\n             vaccinations (hepatitis A, hepatitis B, pneumococcus, and tetanus diphtheria booster)\n             at least 30 days prior to screening for the study.\n\n         15.
