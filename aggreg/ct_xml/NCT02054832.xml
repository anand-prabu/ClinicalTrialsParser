  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study is to determine if there is a change in quality and quantity of
      sleep perceived by adults and children with GSD and their parents while starting a modified
      UCCS (Glycosade) to prevent nocturnal hypoglycemia. The investigators also aim to evaluate
      if there is a change in quality of life perceived by adults and children and their parents
      with Glycosade.

      This is a prospective cohort study. Patients above 2 years old and their parents (for
      children only) will be enrolled during their usual follow-up. Parents will be asked to
      complete a quality of sleep questionnaire (as it pertains to both child and parent) relating
      to the past month on their current dietary regimen (standard UCCS) and a quality of life
      questionnaire (as it pertains to the child only). Parents will then complete a sleep diary
      (for both child and parent) and both child and parent will wear an actigraph that will
      record movements during sleep over a 1 week period. Adult GSD patients will complete their
      own questionnaires. Following this first assessment, they will be hospitalised over a 24
      hour period as part of standard of care to start the modified UCCS, Glycosade, under
      supervision and with a continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) sensor. Following
      hospitalization, the family will return home. Glucose will be monitored with the aid of the
      CGM sensor for 5 to 7 days. The actigraphy and the sleep diary will be repeated after 2
      weeks (for 1 week) while on Glycosade. One month after starting the modified UCCS,
      questionnaires on quality of sleep and quality of life will be repeated.
