A diagnosis of a ruptured brain aneurysm deemed suitable for repair by\n             neuroendovascular techniques involving intraluminal occlusion by detachable platinum\n             coils, or any neuroendovascular technique such as balloon-assisted coiling not\n             requiring the use of antiplatelet agents other than ASA.\n\n          -  2. Patient should be Grade I-IV on the WFNS grading scale for SAH.\n\n          -  3. Male or female with a minimum age of 18 years on the day of enrolment.\n\n          -  4.

Vital signs on admission:\n\n               -  Blood pressure between 80-180 mm Hg systolic/50-100 mm Hg diastolic;\n\n               -  Body temperature \u2264 38.5oC.\n\n          -  8. Informed consent and availability of the subject for the entire study period and\n             willingness of the subject to adhere to protocol requirements.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  1. Prior SAH within 6 months of presentation.\n\n          -  2. Dissecting or mycotic brain aneurysm.\n\n          -  3. Planned endovascular vessel sacrifice as the primary modality for aneurysm\n             treatment.\n\n          -  4. Intended use of antiplatelet medications other than ASA for the endovascular\n             repair procedure.\n\n          -  5. Known history of life-threatening allergic reaction to any medication.\n\n          -  6. Chronic renal disease defined as a baseline serum creatinine > 150 \u00b5mol/L.\n\n          -  7. Women who are pregnant, or have a positive urine or blood (\u03b2-hCG) pregnancy test.\n\n          -  8. Women who are breastfeeding.\n\n          -  9. Any clinically significant psychiatric or psychological disease, which would\n             preclude the patient from completing the protocol.\n\n          -  10. Pre-morbid (estimated) modified Rankin scale score of >1.\n\n          -  11. Previous major stroke.\n\n          -  12. Patients with known HIV infection.\n\n          -  13. Participation in a clinical trial with an investigational drug within 30 days\n             preceding this study.\n\n          -  14. Previous participation in the ENACT trial (e.g, to treat a prior aneurysm),\n             participation in another trial involving NA-1 or prior receipt of NA-1.\n\n          -  15. Any other medical condition that the site investigator deems would put the\n             patient at excessive risk of participation in the study or an expected life\n             expectancy less than 1 year or that would result in inability to collect clinical\n             outcomes at 90 days."
