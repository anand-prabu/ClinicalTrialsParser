  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hemospray (TC-325, Cook Medical Inc, Winston-Salem, NC, USA), a new adsorptive nanopowder
      hemostatic agent for endoscopic treatment of high-risk bleeding peptic ulcers, provides
      significant ease of administration compared to the combined conventional technique of
      saline-adrenaline injection with mechanical clip or heater probe applications.  The
      Hemospray powder is easily applied on ulcers at difficult endoscopic positions and ulcers
      with fibrotic bases, where the combined conventional technique has limited efficacy.
      Building up on preliminary work from small single-arm studies, the investigators aim to
      establish the efficacy and safety of Hemospray in treating bleeding peptic ulcers in
      comparison with the combined conventional technique.  The investigators propose a pilot
      study to establish our centre's feasibility of performing a prospective, randomized,
      parallel group trial, which compares the efficacy of Hemospray with the combined
      conventional technique, in the endoscopic treatment of high-risk bleeding peptic ulcers.
      Patients with high-risk bleeding peptic ulcers will be treated with Hemospray to determine
      its initial hemostasis rate (defined as endoscopically verified cessation of bleeding for at
      least 5 minutes after endoscopic treatment), rebleeding rate (recurrent hemorrhage during a
      4-week period following the initial hemostasis) and its safety profile.
