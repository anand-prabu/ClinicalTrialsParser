      The primary objective of this study is to determine ex vivo the amount of fluticasone
      deposited onto a filter (delivered dose) interposed between the OptiChamber Diamond VHC
      mouthpiece and the subject's mouth during coordinated and uncoordinated actuation/inhalation
      maneuver.
