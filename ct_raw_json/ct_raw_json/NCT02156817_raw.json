Determinants of the length\n      of hospitalization (LOH) in this population are understudied.  Gestational age (GA) is used\n      most commonly as a predictor for LOH but there are many limitations including inaccurate\n      dating and morbidities of prematurity which at least partly related to neurophysiological\n      immaturity.  The latter can be assessed by amplitude integrated electroencephalogram (aEEG,\n      a simplified 5 lead EEG), and possibly by heart rate variability (HRV) and respiratory\n      variability (RV). All 3 are non-invasive tests that can be done at the bedside.  Our study\n      hypothesis is to determine if neurophysiologic maturation as assessed by aEEG, HRV and RV\n      within 24-96 hours following birth improves the correlation between gestational age and\n      length of hospitalization compared to gestational age alone."
