  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a drug called
      LY2405319.  It will be given as a daily injection under the skin to participants with type 2
      diabetes mellitus (T2DM) for 28 days.  This study will determine how long the drug stays in
      the body and how it affects blood sugar levels.  After screening, the study will last about
      2 months for each participant.  Participants will continue their pre-study regimen of diet
      and exercise alone, or in combination with metformin.

             gastrointestinal, endocrine (including pancreatitis), hematological, or neurological
             disorders capable of significantly altering the absorption, metabolism, or
             elimination of drugs; or constituting a risk when taking the study medication; or of
             interfering with the interpretation of data.

          -  Are women who are breastfeeding.

          -  Have had a significant change in weight, defined as a gain or loss of at least 4
             kilograms (kg) (9 pounds) in the 90 days prior to randomization.

          -  Have taken in the 30 days prior to randomization, a medication, herbal product, or
             nutritional supplement that affects adipose mass or distribution or energy balance.

          -  Are receiving chronic (&gt;2 weeks) systemic glucocorticoid therapy (excluding topical
             or inhaled preparations) or have received such therapy within 4 weeks immediately
             prior to second screening appointment.

          -  Have current or recent (within the past 3 months) use of gemfibrozil or fenofibrate,
             niacin, ezetimibe or bile acid binding resins (for example, cholestyramines). Stable
             statin therapy of ≥3 months will be allowed.

          -  Are currently taking central nervous system stimulant.
