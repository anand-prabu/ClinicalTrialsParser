The exercise protocol will focus on improving balance, walking, lower limb and core muscle strength, and spasticity. During the instructional session, participants will be taught a standardized series of exercises that focuses on balance, muscle strength, and stretching. The exercises target lower limb and core muscle function. Once we have taught the exercise routine, participants will then be instructed to perform the exercises 3 times a week in their home as outlined in a manual. Subjects will return biweekly to our lab for the first month and once again in the second month to ensure that exercises are being executed with correct form and at the appropriate intensity level.  Compliance of at-home exercise will be assessed with diaries that participants will complete every other week."
