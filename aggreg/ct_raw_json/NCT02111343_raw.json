The AP skills of\n      the trained group were evaluated again at 3 months post-intervention to examine the\n      sustainability of any improvements made from the CBAT intervention. I hypothesised that\n      after intervention, children from the auditory training (AT) group would improve in their AP\n      skills, and that improvement would be greater than the changes in AP skills of those\n      untrained controls. I also hypothesised that the improvement made from the intervention\n      would sustain for at least 3 months after the end of intervention. Finally, I examined if\n      the training outcomes are predictable from any underlying factors such as the initial AP,\n      language, or cognitive skills of these children."

Apart from regular school attendance and activities, all\n      participants were requested to discontinue any other auditory-based interventions, which\n      might affect the outcomes of this study. All the participants were assessed again after the\n      conclusion of the training period.\n\n      After the end of the intervention, participants from the AT group were requested to undergo\n      a no-intervention phase for a period of 3 months before another assessment. This was\n      intended to examine the sustainability of any improvement made through the CBAT programme.\n\n      An auditory test and two validated questionnaires were used as outcome measures,\n      administered at baseline, and at post-3 months (immediately post-intervention)."

The target sentences were presented at an initial level of 62 dB SPL, whereas the distracter stories were presented at a constant level of 55 dB SPL. The target stimuli and distracter discourse were presented to both ears simultaneously. A maximum of 30 sentences were presented in each of the four listening conditions. The patient was required to repeat the targeted sentences verbally in every listening condition and correct responses were scored manually by the me on the computer.  The stimulus presentation level was adjusted adaptively depending on the patient's response. The assessment took approximately 20 minutes to complete.",
