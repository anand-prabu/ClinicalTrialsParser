      This study is a 37-month safety and immunogenicity study conducted in boys and girls 9 to 14
      years of age and in females 16 to 26 years of age. From this study, the goal is to establish
      that the investigational 2-dose regimens (0, 6 months and 0, 12 months) studied in boys and
      girls 9 to 14 years of age are generally safe and immunogenic, with an antibody response
      that is not inferior to that observed in females 16 to 26 years of age (the core efficacy
      population, assessed concurrently in this study) who received the standard 3-dose regimen of
      V503.
