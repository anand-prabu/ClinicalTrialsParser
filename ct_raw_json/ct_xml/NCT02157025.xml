  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The majority of young children do not think that visual field (VF) testing of peripheral
      vision is similar to a game; therefore, it is not surprising that they have difficulty
      maintaining attention during VF testing and thus the test reliability suffers as a
      consequence. Poor VF reliability has been a longstanding, major issue since it leads to an
      increased number of tests and/or longer duration of time needed to determine when there are
      true vision losses. Providers are less likely to obtain VF tests in children since the
      results are of doubtful value and challenging to interpret when they are inconsistent.
      Effectively this means that children with untreated, slowly progressive eye diseases may go
      undiagnosed and incur greater visual losses.  The investigators aim to create a prototype
      device that the investigators hypothesize will make VF testing more engaging for young
      children, thus increasing their attention and consistency of their responses to the test
      stimuli, which in turn should improve VF reliability.  The components include a microdisplay
      video screen (1.5&quot; diameter) as the fixation target (instead of the standard LED light)
      displaying video clips of popular cartoon characters, and audio clips of impersonated
      cartoon character voices presented by the test operator to provide instructional feedback
      based on the child's performance during testing. Improved VF reliability from the
      investigators intervention would translate to improved diagnosis and care for young
      childrens' peripheral vision loss through widespread implementation of the investigators
      innovative, affordable and readily adoptable system at eye care providers' offices.
