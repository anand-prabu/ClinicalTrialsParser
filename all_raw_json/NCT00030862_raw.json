Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining irinotecan and cisplatin in\n      treating patients who have locally advanced unresectable or metastatic cancer of the\n      esophagus that has not been previously treated."

Treatment repeats every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable\n      toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 80 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year."
