    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness of two rehabilitation programs
      (one month) in patients with multiple sclerosis. The first program is combined with
      physiotherapy, endurance training and resistance training. The second one is physiotherapy
      in private practice. Another purpose is to assess the length of the benefits of the combined
      program.

      This study will include 240 patients with a diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis and with an
      Expanded Disability Status Scale ≤ 5. Patients will be divided into 2 groups, according to a
      randomization design. At recruitment (J0), after rehabilitation (M1) and at follow up (M3
      and M6) each patient will be tested for the primary and secondary outcomes.
