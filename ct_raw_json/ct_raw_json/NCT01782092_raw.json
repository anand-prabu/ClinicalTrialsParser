Special shoes designed for improved accuracy of leg length analysis will be used for all visits.  The patients will be analyzed two times per week for the first month followed by once per week for the remainder of the study.  The Activator Methods protocol will be followed for all visits by all doctors in accordance with the guidelines set forth by Activator Methods International, Ltd.  The first four visits will be limited to Basic Protocol to allow the patients to become accustomed to the process."
