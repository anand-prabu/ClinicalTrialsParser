  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physical exercise has been identified as a major item of many chronic diseases and cancer
      rehabilitation. It contributes to an improvement in the quality of life and to a decrease in
      the current treatment side effects and mortality. Cancer in association with treatment
      toxicity and an inactive lifestyle lead to a fall in physical capability and causes problems
      in daily activities. The physical capacity and the tolerance for exercise fall
      simultaneously leading to a deconditioning vicious circle which increases physical,
      psychological and emotional symptoms of fatigue. Therefore, physical activity for health is
      a valid and relevant way to improve quality of life and to manage cancer patient fatigue.
      The aim of the study is the assessment of the effects of a physical activity retraining
      program on aerobic capacity, strength and fatigue, in a breast cancer population treated by
      adjuvant or néoadjuvant chemotherapy.
