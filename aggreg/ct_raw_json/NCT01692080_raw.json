With the guidance of pharmacy faculty, student pharmacists develop innovative educational activities directed at three of the most common barriers to proper asthma control: avoidance of asthma triggers; compliance with asthma medications and proper usage of inhalers; and the importance of an asthma action plan.  There is a different group of student pharmacists participating in each camp and this allows for variation in educational activities, all reinforcing the same important aspects of optimal asthma management.  Students create age-appropriate activities for each group.   Parents are required to attend camps with their child and participate in the asthma education sessions.",
