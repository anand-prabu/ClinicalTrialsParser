Explore individual and workplace factors associated with work ability in BCS.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\n      ARM I: Patients receive access to the WISE web-based educational intervention to help BCS\n      manage their symptoms, identify ergonomic workplace problems and risks, and implement\n      ergonomic modifications. Patients also receive standard of care comprising symptom\n      management therapies and a pamphlet on employment rights.\n\n      ARM II: Patients receive standard of care comprising symptom management therapies and a\n      pamphlet on employment rights.\n\n      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3 and 6 months."
