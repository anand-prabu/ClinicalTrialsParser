Blood will be placed in plastic cuvettes and probes will be inserted.  Wires on the probes measure platelet aggregation in electrical impedance.  A baseline is obtained and then adenosine diphosphate (ADP) is added to cause aggregation.  Clopidogrel prevents platelet aggregation through irreversible binding of its active metabolite to the ADP receptors on the platelet surface. The change in impedance from baseline is directly proportional to the extent of platelet aggregation and is expressed in ohms of resistance.",
