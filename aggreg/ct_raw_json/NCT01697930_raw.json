The [18F] 4-L-Fluoroglutamine (2S,4R) agent will be administered by bolus intravenous injection. In all study patients, the pharmacokinetics, metabolism, and biodistribution of [18F] 4-L-Fluoroglutamine (2S,4R) will be evaluated by non-invasive blood- and PET-based assays, at multiple time points (see Table 1,) during one day. At the discretion of the investigator, scan 3 can be waived."

F-Glutamine is a drug designed\n      to be used with PET scanners that can 'see' where F-Glutamine goes in the body, after its\n      injected. PET scanners are one of the kinds of scanners you normally find in a hospital\n      radiology department. The researchers have found that tumors in animals absorb F-Glutamine.\n      The researchers believe that scans with F-Glutamine might be able to find tumors in\n      patients.\n\n      This first in-human study is being done to see how long F-Glutamine lasts in the blood, when\n      it is given to people in tiny amounts by an injection, and to see where F-Glutamine goes in\n      the body. If the results of this trial are good, then the study doctors plan to use\n      F-Glutamine in another trial to see if scans with F-Glutamine are better for finding tumors\n      compared to the standard types of scans that doctors use."
