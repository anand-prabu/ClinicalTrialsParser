For instance, the observation of a visible pulsating central retinal vein is a\n      phenomenon that can be seen in up to 98% of the healthy individuals but is identifiable in\n      less than 50% of glaucoma patients. While the nature of these venous changes are not year\n      clear, the lack of a visible pulsating flow could suggest an increased intraluminal venous\n      pressure due to some obstruction from both ocular or extraocular structures. This\n      undetermined increase in venous pulse pressure could then significantly decrease perfusion\n      pressures and therefore further decrease oxygen supply to the retinal tissues.\n\n      The investigators will therefore try to determine if there is a significant difference\n      between the oxygen saturation of the retinal vessels in both glaucoma patients with and\n      without a visible pulsating central vein"
