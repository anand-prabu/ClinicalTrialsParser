  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label, multi-center Phase 1/2 study will assess the safety, pharmacokinetics, and
      pharmacodynamics of escalating doses of BVD-523 in patients with advanced malignancies.  The
      study also seeks to demonstrate target modulation and early signs of clinical response in
      select patient populations.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is being performed to assess the safety and tolerability of BVD-523 given orally,
      twice daily for 21-day cycles.

      In Part 1 of the study, an accelerated dose escalation plan will be used to establish dose
      limiting toxicities (DLT), maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and the recommended Phase 2 dose
      (RP2D).

      In Part 2 of the study, additional patients with particular tumor types and/or cancers
      harboring specific genetic mutations will be recruited for treatment at the Recommended
      Phase 2 Dose (RP2D). Patients may also be assessed pharmacodynamic measures in healthy or
      malignant tissues, using biomarker assays for phosphorylation, cytotoxic or cytostatic
      measures.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with metastatic or advanced-stage malignant tumor, confirmed histologically,
             for whom no therapy exists that would be curative. Patients may have received up to 2
             prior lines of chemotherapy for their metastatic disease.

          -  Predicted life expectancy of ≥ 3 months

          -  Adequate bone marrow, liver and renal function renal function as assessed by the
             following laboratory requirements:

               1. creatinine ≤ 1.5 times ULN (upper limit of normal)] and/or GFR of ≥ 50mL/min

               2. total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x UNL; AST (aspartate transaminase) and/or ALT (alanine
                  transaminase) ≤   3x UNL or ≤ 5 x UNL if due to liver involvement by tumor

               3. hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL; platelets ≥ 100 x 10 cells/L; absolute neutrophil count ≥
                  1.5 x 109 cells/L
