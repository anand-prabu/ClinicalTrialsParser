In spite of\n      advancements in peroxisome biology, the pathophysiology remains unknown, the spectrum of\n      phenotypes poorly characterized and the natural history not yet systematically reported. Our\n      aims are to further define this population clinically, biochemically and genetically. The\n      investigators will prospectively follow patients from Canada, the US and internationally,\n      and collect data from medical evaluations, blood, urine and imaging studies that would be\n      performed on a clinical care basis. Patients unable to attend clinics can participate in\n      this study by mailing in their medical information. The investigators will use this\n      information to identify standards of care and improve management."
