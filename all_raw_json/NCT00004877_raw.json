            "textblock": "OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose, dose limiting toxicity, recommended\n      phase II dose, and safety of BMS-214662 in patients with advanced solid tumors. II.\n      Determine the pharmacokinetics of BMS-214662 in these patients. III. Assess the absolute\n      oral bioavailability of BMS-214662 using a capsule and single intravenous dose in these\n      patients. IV. Determine any preliminary evidence of antitumor activity of BMS-214662 in\n      these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive BMS-214662 IV over 1 hour on day\n      -7, followed by oral BMS-214662 daily on days 0-14 for course 1 only. Beginning with course\n      2, patients receive oral BMS-214662 twice daily for 14 days. Treatment continues every 3\n      weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6\n      patients receive escalating doses of BMS-214662 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is\n      determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which fewer than 2 of 6 patients experience\n      dose limiting toxicity. Patients are followed every 4 weeks until toxicities resolve.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30-40 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-18\n      months."
