  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate if multiple therapy sessions of Transcranial Direct
      Current Stimulation (tDCS non-invasive brain stimulation) combined with robotic arm therapy
      lead to a greater functional recovery in upper limb mobility after stroke than that provided
      by robotic arm therapy alone.
