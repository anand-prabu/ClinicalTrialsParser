Fifty complete maxillary denture-wearers were\n      instructed to brush their dentures after meals and once a day, for a period of 07 days,\n      immerse them in the following solutions: A - Control: Physiological solution(20 minutes). B\n      -  Polident alkaline peroxide(3 minutes). C - 1% sodium hypochlorite(20 minutes). D - castor\n      bean-based solution(20 minutes). The participants immersed their dentures in each of the\n      solutions, according to a randomized sequence. For biofilm quantification, before (Baseline)\n      and after the use of each product, the internal surfaces of maxillary complete dentures were\n      revealed (1% neutral red), photographed and the stained biofilm was quantified with the aid\n      of software (Image Tool 3.0). After concluding measurements of the areas (total and\n      biofilm), the percentage of surface covered by biofilm of the complete denture was\n      calculated ."
