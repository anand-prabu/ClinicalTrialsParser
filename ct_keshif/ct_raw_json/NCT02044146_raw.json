            "textblock": "In patients with heart attacks, the treatment of choice is to restore blood flow with\n      percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) (use of stents (metal meshes) to open blockages).\n      After PCI, the standard drug treatment includes aspirin and clopidogrel.  These medications\n      block full function of the platelet cells, which are responsible for clotting.  Despite\n      their use, patients after PCI are at risk for heart attacks, sudden clotting of stents or\n      death.  A major contributor may be resistance to clopidogrel.  New more potent drugs, which\n      can overcome the resistance, are now available; however, they come with an increase chance\n      of severe bleeding and costs.  An ideal solution would be to identify at-risk patients and\n      selectively treat them with more potent drugs, while lower-risk patients continue with\n      clopidogrel.  This type of strategy (personalized strategy) would decrease heart attacks and\n      death (compared to clopidogrel), while also preventing bleeding complications (compared to\n      treating all patients with the new drugs).\n\n      Of resistant patients, many carry genes (inherited units) that prevent proper absorption of\n      clopidogrel.   Our group has developed and tested a new bedside genetic test, which\n      identifies carriers of at-risk genes.  However, this technique alone does not identify all\n      at-risk patients.  Consequently, we have now devised a novel tool, which combines genetics\n      with patient characteristics to identify high-risk patients.\n\n      The present study combines this new tool into a strategy for personalized treatment.\n      Patients with heart attacks who undergo PCI will be randomly assigned to 1 of 3 strategies:\n      a) new personalized strategy, b) clopidogrel strategy (previous standard drug) or c)\n      ticagrelor strategy (stronger approved drug).  The function of the platelet cells will be\n      measured at 1 month to determine potential benefits.  Evaluation of this new personalized\n      strategy is important for improving patient outcomes after PCI.   The hypothesis is that\n      patients receiving a personalized strategy will have decrease risk for future heart attacks\n      and bleeding."
