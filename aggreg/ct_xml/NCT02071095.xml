      This study involves researching new approaches to treating HIV infection. Currently, HIV
      infection is treated with combinations of drugs called antiretrovirals. These drugs protect
      cells from infection by interfering with the viruses' ability to make copies of itself by
      infecting new target cells. Though these drugs are very effective, they cannot cure HIV
      infection and must be taken each and every day at prescribed doses to maintain their
      beneficial effect. In this research study we are investigating a new approach that involves
      an addition to existing medications.

      We are investigating a medication called Poly-ICLC (Hiltonol®, Oncovir), which is an
      adjuvant. Adjuvants are medications that are designed to boost your body's immune responses
      resulting from a vaccine. We want to test whether Poly-ICLC is an adjuvant that is effective
      in HIV-infected patients.  We are not giving a vaccine in this study, but just investigating
      the adjuvant, Poly-ICLC, to determine whether it may be safe and useful in future vaccines
      that could be used to treat HIV, called therapeutic vaccines. One goal of future therapeutic
      vaccines is to reduce the virus that remains persistently inside of cells in a dormant or
      resting state despite treatment with HIV medications. This persistent pool is termed the
      &quot;latent virus pool&quot; or &quot;viral reservoir&quot;.  One tactic to reduce this viral reservoir is to
      first stimulate HIV to start replicating in order to force it out of hiding. Once viral
      replication occurs, the infected cells may then be recognized and killed by cells of the
      immune system. Therefore, we also want to see what effect Poly-ICLC has on the virus that
      lives inside of cells. Specifically, we want to look at whether Poly-ICLC increases the
      level of virus inside your cells while also improving your immune system's responses.

      We are doing this research because we hope to find new ways to treat HIV infection that may
      reduce exposure to medications that are called antiretrovirals. Antiretrovirals are
      medications used to treat HIV infection. They are very effective but have side effects and
      have to be taken each and every day and cannot cure HIV.

    <textblock>
      Effective combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) has dramatically altered the morbidity
      and mortality associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection. Nevertheless,
      the current treatment paradigm of lifelong antiviral therapy with near perfect patient
      adherence to avoid the emergence of drug resistant HIV remains less than ideal and this
      therapeutic approach has clear limitations.

      In addition to long term toxicities associated with currently preferred therapies,
      combination therapy for HIV-1 infection cannot address the issue of viral persistence. HIV-1
      persists in both blood and tissue despite long-term suppression with antiretroviral agents
      (ARVs). Eradication strategies for HIV-1 are likely to require a multi-faceted approach to
      reduce the latent reservoir, with key components focusing upon both the disruption of viral
      latency and the enhancement of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) function to promote killing of
      infected cells. In order to successfully achieve these objectives, we must investigate
      agents that safely stimulate replication of the latent reservoir AND explore approaches to
      enhance HIV-specific adaptive immunity to augment CTL function.  We propose that this may be
      accomplished with a single therapeutic modality that is devised appropriately.  Certain
      adjuvants may possess immunostimulatory properties that trigger transient activation of
      viral transcription while simultaneously enhancing HIV-specific CTL function and, thus, may
      play an important role in such a vaccine.

      Here, we propose a proof of concept clinical trial to determine the ability of Poly-ICLC
      (Hiltonol®, Oncovir), to safely activate the latent viral reservoir and enhance innate
      immunity when administered to HIV-infected individuals. This randomized, double-blinded,
      placebo-controlled study will administer two doses of Poly-ICLC to HIV-infected individuals
      whom are virologically suppressed on combination anti-retroviral therapy (cART). We
      hypothesize that Poly-ICLC will be safe and well-tolerated and will transiently disrupt
      viral latency while enhancing innate immune responses. Should this be the case, then
      Poly-ICLC would be an ideal modality to combine with a therapeutic HIV vaccine to reduce the
      number of latently infected CD4+ T cells in treated HIV-1 infected individuals.
