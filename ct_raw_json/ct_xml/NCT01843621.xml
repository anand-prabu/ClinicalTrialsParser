  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out more about the two doses of dengue vaccine, over a
      five year period, that the children received in the Dengue-003 study and to study a third
      dose of dengue that will be given to the children

        -  Do children still have dengue antibodies intended to provide protection against dengue
           infection one year after the two doses of vaccine given in study Dengue-003?

        -  Were there any major medical problems that appeared as dengue-like symptoms during the
           one year after vaccinations?

        -  Will a third dose of dengue help to further stimulate the part of the immune system
           intended to help protect against dengue infection?

        -  Is a third dose as safe as the first two doses?

        -  Are the local reactions to a third dose of the vaccine similar to what your child
           experienced after the first two doses?
