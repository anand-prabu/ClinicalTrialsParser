      to measure the pro-permeability factors VEGF, SDF-1, and angiopoietin-2 in the aqueous humor

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with Diabetic Macular Edema (DME) are increasingly being treated with molecules
      targeting vascular endothelial factor (VEGF). One potential advantage of OZURDEX over
      specific VEGF antagonists is that steroids suppress production of multiple pro-permeability
      factors.

      It is important to test the effect of OZURDEX in patients who have had a suboptimal response
      to VEGF antagonists to determine if OZURDEX provides more sustained benefit and to
      simultaneously assess its effect on aqueous levels of pro-permeability factors.

      Our primary objective is to measure the pro-permeability factors VEGF, SDF-1, and
      angiopoietin-2 in the aqueous humor of patients with persistent/recurrent macular edema
      despite prior treatment with anti-VEGF agents at baseline and at 1, 2, 3, and 4 months after
      intraocular injection of OZURDEX.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  • Signed informed consent and authorization of use and disclosure of protected health
             information

               -  Age more than or equal to 18 years

               -  Diagnosis of diabetic macular edema

               -  Intraretinal or subretinal fluid in the macula determined by Spectralis OCT

               -  Best corrected visual acuity score in the study eye of 20/30 to 20/400 inclusive
                  (Snellen equivalents using the ETDRS protocol at a distance of 4 meters)

               -  In the opinion of the investigator, decreased vision in the study eye is due to
                  foveal thickening from DME and not from other obvious causes of decreased vision

               -  Persistent or recurrent edema despite prolonged treatment with an anti-VEFG
                  agent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  • Scatter laser photocoagulation or macular photocoagulation within 3 months of study
             entry in the study eye

               -  Intraocular surgery in the study eye within 3 months of study entry

               -  Use of intraocular or periocular injection of steroids in the study eye (e.g.,
                  triamcinolone) within 4 months of study entry

               -  Previous use of an anti-VEGF drug within 1 month of study entry

               -  Yttrium-Aluminum-Garnet (YAG) laser capsulotomy within 1 month of study entry

               -  Any condition that the investigator believes would pose a significant hazard to
                  the subject if investigational therapy were initiated.

               -  Inability to comply with study or follow up procedures

               -  History of glaucoma. (Patients who have undergone filtration surgery may be
                  included)

               -  Patients with active or suspected ocular or periocular infection, including most
                  viral diseases of the cornea and conjunctiva, including active epithelial herpes
                  simplex keratitis (dendritic keratitis), vaccinia, varicella, mycobacterial
                  infections, and fungal diseases.

               -  Aphakic eyes with rupture of the posterior lens capsule.

               -  Eyes with ACIOL and rupture of the posterior lens capsule.

               -  Patients with hypersensitivity to dexamethasone or to any other components of
                  the product
