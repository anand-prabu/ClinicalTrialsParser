Parents and\n      teachers' utmost concern are adverse effects on eye-sight of children, especially the higher\n      progression rate in myopia and the visual discomfort which may be caused by the e-book\n      technology.\n\n      This is a prospective cohort study to determine if implementation of electronic devices for\n      teaching promotes myopia development and progression and affects visual function in primary\n      schoolchildren.\n\n      The schools will introduce e-books to their students in some classes. Signed informed\n      consent letters from parents will be obtained prior to subject recruitment and data\n      collection. Eye examination and data collection will be conducted in primary school campus.\n      The children from two local primary schools in same grade will be assigned into two groups\n      by their schools. One group will use e-books (e-book group) to study course materials\n      assigned by their teachers whereas another group will use ordinary textbooks (control\n      group). Their refractive errors, axial length (AXL) and binocular functions will be measured\n      and monitored at six-month intervals for a maximum of 2 years."
