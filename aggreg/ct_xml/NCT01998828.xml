    <textblock>
      This open-label study is to determine the safety and efficacy of momelotinib in participants
      with either polycythemia vera (PV) or essential thrombocythemia (ET) who have not yet
      received treatment with a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor.

Platelet count ≤ 400 x 10^9/L that lasts at least 4 weeks
Resolution of palpable splenomegaly that lasts at least 4 weeks
For the ET Cohort, overall response rate is defined as the proportion of participants with all of the following at some point during the treatment period:
WBC count &lt; 10 x 10^9/L that lasts at least 4 weeks
