The\n      study may contribute with basic information on underlying pathophysiological mechanisms\n      involved in human responses to these pollutants and in their interactive effects. The study\n      includes as methods and techniques to detect minor changes in biomarkers suggesting early\n      effect of exposure. These analyses will give information at a high sensitive level about the\n      exposure effects on biomarkers for an array of symptoms and reactions.\n\n      The study Group consitss of 24 non-smoking persons(aged 60-70).  A controlled, randomized\n      and balanced Latin square cross-over design using the participants as their own controls.\n      The exposures are arranged in a full-scale climate chamber where the participants will be\n      exposed for 5\u00bd hour under controlled environmental conditions.\n\n      The exposure facility (Climate chamber):\n\n      The exposures are arranged at the controlled experimental facilities at our department which\n      include climate chambers and exposure generators for dust and ozone. The exposure sessions\n      will take place under controlled conditions in a 79 m3 climate chamber made of welded\n      stainless steel optimized for experiments with gasses and particulate air pollutants. The\n      chamber facility allows exposures with controlled ventilation, temperature and air humidity\n      and has an efficient mixing of ventilation air with the chamber air.\n\n      All participants will attend all four diff. exposure sessions:\n\n      Dust (250-300\u00b5g/m3), Ozone (0,1ppm ozone),Dust+ozone (250-300\u00b5g/m3 + 0,1 ppm ozone),\n      Filtered air (<20\u00b5g/m3). with at least 2 weeks between each exposure session to eliminate\n      hang\u2010over effects.
