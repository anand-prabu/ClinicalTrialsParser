PTA>24 hrs or - foca cerebral contusion on CT/MRI or\n             Loss of Consciousness (LOC) > 12 hours.\n\n             Note: the definition of mild, moderate or severe head injury differs widely between\n             centers and is absolutely not critical for the work proposed as we will use\n             continuous measures of severity throughout.\n\n          2. Within three months of first assessment. (In practice, patients may be recruited\n             after 3 months. We will deal with this issue by covarying the time from injury to\n             first assessment in our analyses).\n\n          3. Rancho Los Amigos cognitive level of 5-7 at first assessment.\n\n          4. Volunteer informed consent signed by patient of family.\n\n          5. Military or veterans health care beneficiary.\n\n          6. Age 17-55\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          1.
