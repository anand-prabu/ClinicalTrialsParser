    <textblock>
      Breast augmentation surgery is currently the most common elective plastic surgery performed
      in the US. With regards to the surgical technique, there are 4 incisional sites available
      for breast augmentation, each with its advantages and disadvantages: Axillary, Periareolar,
      inframammary, and umbilical. The implant is inserted in either a subglandular (beneath
      breast tissue), submuscular (underneath the Pectoralis Major), or &quot;dual-plane&quot; (combination
      of both) manner.

      Echocardiography is the most commonly used diagnostic test in cardiology for the evaluation
      of cardiac structure and function. Its use has increased dramatically in the last decades.
      We have encountered three women with congenital heart disease who have undergone breast
      augmentation, and their echocardiographic images were significantly limited after the
      implantation. There is only one case report in the medical literature suggesting that breast
      implants interfere with echocardiographic views .

      The underlying physical property of the silicone breast implants that causes interference
      with the ultrasound beam during echocardiographic examination is not known and has not been
      studied. Similar to air in the lung but to a lesser degree, silicone breast implants appear
      to prevent penetration of ultrasound beams. The poor penetration appears to be persistent
      and unrevealing despite increase in gain or change in the ultrasound wave's frequency.

      Many women elect breast augmentation for cosmetic reasons. Women with congenital heart
      disease who have undergone cardiac surgery may have breast asymmetry or distortion and
      desire augmentation accordingly.

      Knowledge of the extent of impairment of breast implants to the echocardiographic
      examination is important for few reasons:

        1. Women with heart disease who need echocardiographic follow up and wish to undergo
           breast augmentation should be consulted as to the limitation of the echocardiographic
           examination following the procedure.

        2. Women without heart disease considering breast augmentation should be informed of
           potential echocardiographic interference, if echocardiography be needed in the future,

        3. Different surgical techniques may cause different masking effect.

        4. Different implants size and shape may cause different masking effect.
