PI3K inhibitor BKM120 may stop\n      the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Monoclonal\n      antibodies, such as cetuximab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the\n      ability of tumors to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry\n      tumor-killing substances to them. Giving PI3K inhibitor BKM120 together with cetuximab may\n      kill more tumor cells"
