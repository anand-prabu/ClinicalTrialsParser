      Heart transplantation is a lifesaving procedure for patients with end-stage heart failure
      and provides a better survival and quality of life as compared to conventional medical or
      pharmacological treatment. Transplanted hearts are subject to the effects of the alloimmune
      response, which if left uncontrolled is capable of jeopardizing long-term cardiac function.
      Recently, advances in immunosuppression have enhanced the survival of transplanted patients.
      Nearly 2500 cardiac transplants per year have been performed in the US during the last 10
      years and despite significant improvements, long-term cardiac allograft survival rates
      remain poor. More than 20% of patients do not survive beyond 3 years, and those who do
      survive are afflicted with the long-term complications associated with chronic
      immunosuppression. Life expectancy of patients who lose cardiac allografts is dramatically
      poor due to the absence of any therapeutic tool apart from re-transplantation, which is
      plagued by poor outcomes. The identification of novel therapeutic targets is thus mandatory.
      ATP/P2X7R signaling in T cells is highly relevant for cardiac allograft survival. ATP is a
      small molecule present at high concentrations inside cells and released as extracellular ATP
      (eATP) following cell damage or death, which is abundant at inflammation sites and acts as a
      danger signal constituting an &quot;alerting system&quot;. ATP is sensed by the ionotropic purinergic
      P2X receptors (seven receptors named P2X1-7) expressed mainly, but not exclusively, by T
      lymphocytes, thereby regulating T cell activation. We have recently demonstrated that the
      ATP/P2X7R axis has a key role in cardiac allograft survival in humans and mice. Cardiac
      allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is a major limiting factor for cardiac allograft survival. One
      of the major limiting factors for cardiac transplantation is CAV, which develops frequently
      in heart transplant recipients. CAV results in allograft failure, and it occurs in 50% of
      cardiac transplant recipients by 5 years after transplantation, as shown by angiography or
      intravascular ultrasound examination. CAV is clearly of immunological origin, as syngeneic
      murine grafts do not develop CAV. Once CAV occurs, the most definitive treatment is
      re-transplantation, but survival is limited due to the fact that pharmacological management
      only somewhat attenuates the process. We hypothesize that a single nucleotide polymorphysm
      (SNP) loss-of-function P2X7R mutation (p.Glu496Ala / c.1513A&gt;C, rs3751143) generates a
      compensatory upregulation of the other purinergic receptors (P2XsR), thus creating a state
      of hypersensitivity to eATP. This eATP hypersensitivity results in an abnormal generation of
      Th1/Th17 cells, that leads to CAV and early cardiac allograft loss. Our study will answer a
      fundamental question: What is the effect of the P2X7R loss-of-function mutation on the
      immune system? Our expertise in studying the ATP/P2X7R axis has been recently recognized in
      two publications and we are now ready to test our novel hypothesis on the P2X7R
      loss-of-function mutation. Our goal is to generate the first targeted-therapy for a selected
      group of cardiac transplant recipients.

      Heart transplantation is a lifesaving procedure however, more then 20% of patients do not
      survive beyond 3 years, being the cardiac allograft afflicted by cardiac allograft
      vasculopathy (CAV), which results in allograft loss. The purine adenosine 5'-triphosphate
      (ATP), released during cell damage/inflammation, is sensed by the ionotropic purinergic P2X7
      receptor (P2X7R), which is expressed primarily, though not exclusively, on lymphocytes, thus
      regulating T cell activation. Loss-of-function single nucleotide mutations (SNPs) have been
      detected for P2X7R gene; particularly the Glu496 to Ala 1513A&gt;C (rs3751143) P2X7R
      loss-of-function mutation is relatively common (1-3% of individuals are mutated omozygous
      and 25% are heterozygous). Our central hypothesis is that a loss-of-function P2X7R mutation
      identifies a group of cardiac transplanted patients at high risk for CAV and cardiac
      allograft loss because of a compensatory overexpression of P2X1R/P2X4R, which induces a
      disregulation of T-bet/ROR-g, ultimately leading to the abnormal generation of Th1/Th17
      cells. Our primary goal is to define the effect of the P2X7R loss-of-function mutation on
      clinical end points in the CTOT-05 cohort of cardiac transplant recipients (200 patients)
      and to explore the effects of the mutation on the immune system.  Our preliminary data
      demonstrated that P2X7R increases during cardiac transplant rejection in vivo in mice and in
      humans and it is activated by ATP released by cardiac cells, thus triggering activation of
      Th1/Th17 cells. However, while short-term disruption of the P2X7R pathway prolongs cardiac
      allograft survival, the genetic deletion of P2X7R accelerates CAV and shortens cardiac
      allograft survival. This was evident in P2X7R KO-B6 mice and in a group of cardiac
      transplant recipients bearing the P2X7R loss-of-function mutation. Based on our published
      results and our novel observations, we have developed the following working hypothesis:
      P2X7R loss-of-function mutation generates a compensatory overexpression of the other
      ionotropic purinergic receptors (P2X1/P2X4) with chronic delivery of ATP immunity,
      hyperactivation T-bet/ROR-g, abnormal generation of Th1/Th17 cells and ultimately leading to
      accelerated CAV and to cardiac allograft loss. To test this hypothesis, we will follow two
      main paths: i) we will evaluate in the CTOT-05 cohort of cardiac transplant recipients the
      effect of the Glu496 to Ala 1513A&gt;C (rs3751143) P2X7R loss-of-function mutation on clinical
      end points (development of coronary artery vasculopathy, death, re-transplantation or
      re-listed for transplantation, any rejection) in the first year post transplant; ii) we will
      explore in vivo and ex vivo in the CTOT-05 cohort of cardiac transplant recipients the
      effects of P2X7R loss-of-function mutation on the immune system.
