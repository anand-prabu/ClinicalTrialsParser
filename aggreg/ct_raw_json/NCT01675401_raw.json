            "textblock": "An increased body mass impairs vascular function (VF), an important characteristic of\n      subjects suffering from type 2 diabetes and a risk marker for cardiovascular diseases.\n      However, a wide variety of in vivo VF markers exists each measuring different aspects of VF.\n      Each of these markers addresses a different aspect of the vasculature. Studies comparing\n      under standardized conditions the differences and relationships of the many different VF\n      measurements in lean and abdominally overweight / obese subjects are missing. Also, there is\n      a great need to know which of these markers are sensitive to dietary challenges.\n\n      Therefore, it is imperative to conduct an extensive study on dietary effects and\n      interrelationships of a broad spectrum of VF measurements and plasma biomarkers in lean and\n      overweight / obese subjects. Focus will be on FMD, a well accepted biomarker for\n      cardiovascular disease. The investigators propose to examine, in a two-way\n      parallel-randomized human intervention study, the effects of weight-loss in abdominally\n      overweight / obese men on VF markers and plasma biomarkers related to low-grade inflammation\n      and vascular activity during the fasting and both the postprandial and hyperinsulinemic\n      state. Furthermore, differences - and relations between - VF measurements and plasma\n      biomarkers will be compared cross-sectionally between lean and abdominally overweight /\n      obese male subjects."
