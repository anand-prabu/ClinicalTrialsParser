      The HAART 200 &quot;Aortic Annuloplasty during Bicuspid Aortic Valve Reconstruction&quot; Trial is a
      prospective, non-randomized, multi-center trial to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of
      the HAART 200 bicuspid annuloplasty ring when used to surgically stabilize the aortic valve
      annulus in patients undergoing repair of bicuspid aortic valves (BAV) for predominant aortic
      insufficiency (AI).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The subject is 18 years of age or older

          2. The subject has bi-leaflet aortic valve morphology

          3. The subject has documented aortic valve disease which may or may not include:

               -  Aortic valve insufficiency

               -  Ascending aortic or aortic root pathology

               -  Other pathology of the ascending aorta that requires elective aortic replacement

               -  Associated stable one or two vessel coronary disease requiring concomitant
                  coronary bypass

               -  Patients with recurrent severe AI (Grade 3 or 4) after prior bicuspid repair who
                  are undergoing re-repair because of annular re-dilatation

               -  All bicuspid annular and leaflet configurations will be included

          4. The subject needs:

               -  correction of BAV annular dilatation in patients with chronic AI and dilated
                  annulus

               -  restoration of a circular annular shape in patients with bicuspid valve and
                  expansion of sinus to sinus dimensions

               -  stabilization of annular geometry long-term in rare bicuspid valve patients with
                  severe AI and minimal annular dilatation

          5. The is willing to comply with specified follow-up evaluations, including
             transesophageal echocardiography (TEE)    if there are inadequate images by
             transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) to assess the aortic valve

          6. The subject has reviewed and signed the written informed consent form

          7. The subject agrees to return for all follow-up evaluations for the duration of the
             study (i.e. geographically stable)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. All patients will be excluded who require emergency surgery for any reason.

          2. All the patients who have had a prior heart valve replacement

          3. The subject's aortic valve morphology is not bicuspid.

          4. The subject has active endocarditis

          5. The subject has mixed stenosis and regurgitation of the aortic valve with predominant
             stenosis

          6. Heavily calcified BAV valves, calcified aortic roots, or &quot;porcelain aortas&quot;

          7. Leukopenia with a White Blood Cell (WBC) of less than 3000

          8. Acute anemia with a Hgb less than 9mg%

          9. Platelet count less than 100,000 cells/mm3

         10. History of a defined bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy or the subject refuses blood
             transfusions

         11. Active infection requiring antibiotic therapy (if temporary illness, subjects may
             enroll 2-4 weeks after discontinuation of antibiotics)

         12. Subjects in whom transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is contraindicated

         13. Low Ejection Fraction (EF) &lt; 35%

         14. Life expectancy &lt; 1 year, or severe comorbidities, such as dialysis or severe Chronic
             Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)

         15. The subject is or will be participating in a concomitant research study of an
             investigational product or has participated in such a study within the 30 days prior
             to screening

         16. The subject is a minor, an illicit drug user, alcohol abuser, prisoner,
             institutionalized, or is unable to give informed consent

         17. The subject is pregnant or lactating

         18. Recent (within 6 months) cerebrovascular accident (CVA) or a transient ischemic
             attack (TIA)

         19. Myocardial Infarction (MI) within one month of trial inclusion

         20. The subject has a known intolerance to titanium or polyester

         21. The subject has documented unstable or &gt; 2 vessel coronary disease

         22. The subject requires additional valve replacement or valve repair
