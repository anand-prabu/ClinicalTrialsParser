After written informed consent has been obtained, subjects\n      will be randomized to intervention or control group (1:2), stratified based on insulin\n      initiation within 1 week of study inclusion. Participants randomized to the intervention\n      group will be further divided into subgroups as \"insulin user\" or \"non-insulin user\" and\n      both will receive SMS messages every 7 days.  The content of the message consist of\n      medication reminders, reporting of blood glucose results, insulin technique assessment (if\n      applicable), or d) medication adherence assessment.  Participants will be asked to respond\n      with a simple text within 7 days.  The intervention group will receive the standard medical\n      appointment reminder via telephone one to two business days prior to the appointment at WCHC\n       PLUS a unidirectional text message two business days prior to scheduled health center\n      appointments.   Control group participants will receive the standard medical appointment\n      reminder via telephone one to two business days prior to the appointment at WCHC.  All\n      participants in the study (control and intervention) will undergo venipuncture at 3 months\n      (+/-) 2 weeks for the determination of hemoglobin A1C.  Demographic information, and\n      frequency of hemoglobin A1C concentrations in the past 6 months will be assessed at\n      baseline.  Each week for 12 weeks, the number of texts sent per week and by type, percent of\n      respondents weekly by text or by phone, content of participant responses, number of patients\n      unable to be reached via text, total investigator time spent per week, and time spent per\n      contact will be recorded.  At the three month visit, the hemoglobin A1C concentration, blood\n      transfusions since study initiation, and medication changes will be recorded."
