As secondary\n      outcomes, time to follow up appointment with physician and economic impact of this\n      intervention will be assessed.\n\n      Patients 65 years of age and older will be randomized following discharge from the ED into\n      one of three groups. Group 1(Intervention) will receive a phone call collecting information\n      about understanding of ED discharge instructions and guiding patient through the discharge\n      instructions, Group 2 (Placebo) will receive a follow up phone call for a satisfaction\n      survey, and Group 3(Control) will receive usual care.\n\n      We hypothesize return visits to the ED and readmission to the hospital will decrease as a\n      result of the nurse phone call intervention."

The caller\n      will attempt to answer questions about the medicines, and encourage patients to take the\n      medicines as directed. The caller will also encourage the patients to follow-up with their\n      own physician in a timely manner and offer to help with setting up follow up appointments if\n      needed.\n\n      Subsequently, 30-35 days after ED discharge, all patients will receive a phone call to\n      evaluate rates of compliance with medicines and scheduling follow-up appointments. All calls\n      will be made by trained nurses.\n\n      Using an \u03b1 0.05 and \u03b2 0.80 we will need to enroll 2235 patients to detect a decrease in ED\n      return visits/re-admission/ death of 6%.
