We developed a yearlong pilot social branding intervention to decrease smoking among this group, using social events and social leaders to promote a strong nonsmoking lifestyle. The intervention rationale is based on utilizing industry market research tools to define the target audience and directly countering tobacco industry lifestyle marketing strategies. We now propose to extend this intervention to three other cities (tailoring the intervention to a high-risk subpopulation of young adults in each city) and evaluate it in a multicenter quasi-experimental controlled trial."
