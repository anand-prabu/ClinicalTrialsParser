First line or progressive disease if already treated with any form of therapy,\n             including but not limited to chemotherapy, radiotherapy, local therapy, surgery or\n             immuno-therapy.\n\n          3. Measurable disease using RECIST 1.1 criteria (Appendix A).  At least 1 measurable\n             lesion must be present.  Subjects who have received local-regional therapy such as\n             (but not limited to) chemoembolization, embolization, cryoablation, hepatic artery\n             therapy, percutaneous ethanol injection, radiation therapy, radiofrequency ablation\n             or surgery are eligible, provided that they have either a target lesion which has not\n             been treated with local therapy and/or the target lesion(s) within the field of the\n             local regional therapy has shown an increase of \u2265 20% in size.  Local-regional\n             therapy must be completed at least 4 weeks prior to the baseline CT scan.\n\n          4. ECOG performance status of 0 - 1.\n\n          5. Expected survival of at least 3 months.\n\n          6. Age \u2265 18 years.\n\n          7. No prior systemic therapy, immunotherapy, investigational agent, or radiation therapy\n             within the last 4 weeks, except radiation therapy for symptomatic treatment within\n             the last 2 weeks.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          1. Serious infection requiring treatment with systemically administered antibiotics at\n             the time of study entrance, or an infection requiring systemic antibiotic therapy\n             within 7 days prior to the first dose of study treatment.\n\n          2. Pregnancy or lactation.\n\n          3. Expected non-compliance.\n\n          4. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active\n             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association Class III\n             or IV), cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness, social situations that would\n             limit compliance with study requirements.\n\n          5. Subjects who have had any anticancer treatment prior to entering the study and have\n             not recovered to baseline (except alopecia) or \u2264 Grade 1 AEs, or deemed irreversible\n             from the effects of prior cancer therapy.  AEs > Grade 1 that are not considered a\n             safety risk by the Sponsor and investigator may be allowed upon agreement with both.\n\n          6. Subjects with history of another primary cancer, including co-existent second\n             malignancy, with the exception of: a) curatively resected non-melanoma skin cancer;\n             b) curatively treated cervical carcinoma in situ; or c) other primary solid tumor\n             with no known active disease present or in the opinion of the investigator will not\n             affect patient outcome.\n\n          7. Subjects who had been treated with ADI-PEG 20 previously."
