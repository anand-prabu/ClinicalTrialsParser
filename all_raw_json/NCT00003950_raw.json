II. Determine antitumor activity, safety, tolerance, and\n      toxicity of this combination treatment in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive cyclosporine IV over 6 hours and\n      irinotecan IV over 90 minutes weekly for 4 weeks. Courses repeat every 6 weeks. Patients\n      receive at least 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-45 patients will be accrued for this study over 14 months."
