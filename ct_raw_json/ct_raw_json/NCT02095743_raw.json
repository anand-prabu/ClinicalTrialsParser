            "textblock": "Adjuvant chemotherapy is frequently proposed to patients presenting early breast cancer, in\n      case of high risk of recurrence (large tumors, node involvement, high grade\u2026). Due to its\n      toxicity toward veins, chemotherapy must be administered through a central venous device.\n      Today, one can use either an implanted port or a PICC line (Peripherally Inserted Central\n      Catheter). A PICC line is easier to implant and to explant, but has to be flushed every week\n      and may impact daily life (no swimming, some clothes may not fit). On the other hand, a port\n      is subcutaneous and lets patients lead a normal life, but its implant and explant require a\n      cutaneous incision with possible complications (bleeding, pain, infection). For both venous\n      devices, complications such as thrombosis or infection may happen. Published data comparing\n      the two devices are heterogeneous and do not often distinguish patients treated for\n      different diseases at various stages. Empirically in daily practice, for long term use (>6\n      months) a port is usually preferred, whereas for short-term treatments (<6 weeks) a PICC\n      line is used.  In the case of Her2 negative early breast cancer, adjuvant chemotherapy\n      usually lasts 4 to 5 months. There is no scientific evidence for preferring one device to\n      the other for these patients.\n\n      The aim of this study is to prospectively compare the patients' satisfaction and tolerance\n      of each of the two devices."
