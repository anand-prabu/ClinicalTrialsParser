  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Posterior fossa mutism (PFM) occurs in up to 30% of patients after resection of a posterior
      fossa tumor, most commonly a medulloblastoma.  PFM is characterized by delayed onset of
      mutism 1-6 days after surgery that can spontaneously improve on average from 7-8 weeks
      later.   Few patients recover normal speech.  Most of their speech continues to be marked by
      dysarthria, dysfluency and slowed rate.  Researchers have not identified the
      pathophysiologic mechanism for PFM nor have they found a cure.  Despite the improvements in
      speech, patients with PFM have shown multiple areas of neurocognitive deficits 12 months
      after diagnosis.  Few studies have looked at long term outcomes of patients affected by PFM.
       We propose to survey patients who developed PFM after resection of a medulloblastoma to
      determine long term effects of PFM on patient's quality of life.

        Patients must be between 8 years and 25 years of age at the time of enrollment and have
        completed treatment for their initial diagnosis of medulloblastoma.

        We will identify a group of patients who developed PFM as well as a group of appropriately
        matched controls with regard to age, sex and treatment protocol who did not develop PFM.
