    <textblock>
      An open label, prospective, non-randomized single arm study. Combination of two treatment
      modalities - HAI with FUDR and systemic chemotherapy with cisplatin and gemcitabine.

      Definition of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of intravenous gemcitabine in combination
      with intravenous cisplatin and intra-arterial FUDR. Definition of safety and toxicity of
      this combined regional and systemic treatment approach. Definition of the response rate
      after 3 months of hepatic intra-arterial chemotherapy with continuous infusion FUDR with or
      without ligation of the right or left portal vein, in combination with 3 months of systemic
      cisplatin and gemcitabine in patients with unresectable intrahepatic or hilar CCC.

      A total of 9-18 patients are required. 3-6 patients per dose level. A maximum of three dose
      levels (1 - 3) has been defined.

      Statistical Methodology: Traditional 3+3 dosing algorithm to find MTD.

        -  Trial with medicinal product

    <description>Dose limiting toxicities will be assessed to define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of gemcitabine in combination with fixed doses of cisplatin and FUDR. DLTs are per protocol prespecified AE or laboratory abnormalities observed during the first 6 weeks of study treatment. The MTD is one dose level below the dose level that caused DLTs in â‰¥ one third of patients (2 or more in a cohort of 6 patients), as determined by a traditional 3+3 algorithm.</description>

      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Histologically or cytologically proven cholangiocellular carcinoma including
             gallbladder cancer.

          -  Non-resectable cholangiocellular carcinoma as judged within an interdisciplinary
             tumor-board including senior hepatobiliary surgeons. Non- resectability is based on
             insufficient remnant liver volume.

          -  Patient is not a candidate for liver transplantation

          -  WHO Performance Score 0 or 1

          -  No extrahepatic tumor, as evaluated by PET/CT scan of the chest and the
             abdomen/pelvis with the exception of potentially resectable small lung nodules or
             hilar lymph node involvement.

          -  The assessment is done within 21 days before registration.

          -  Adequate liver function or kidney function tests, including any of the following:

               -  Bilirubin &lt; 2 x ULN

               -  Aspartate-Aminotransferase (AST) &lt; 5 x ULN

               -  Alanine-Aminotransferase (ALT) &lt; 5 x ULN

               -  Alkaline phosphatase &lt; 5 x ULN

               -  Estimated creatinine clearance &gt; 60 ml/min (using the Cockcroft formula)

               -  Hemoglobin &gt; 80 G/L

               -  Leucocytes &gt; 3.00 G/L,

               -  Neutrophils &gt; 1.00 G/Ll

               -  Platelets &gt; 100 G/L

          -  Signed written informed consent

          -  Patient age &gt;/= 18 years

          -  Presentation of the case at the interdisciplinary tumor-board attended by
             hepatobiliary surgeons, oncologists, hepatologists and radiologists

          -  Women who are not breastfeeding and are using effective contraception if sexually
             active, who are not pregnant and agree not to become pregnant during the 12 months

          -  Men who agree not to father a child during participation in the trial or during the
             12 months thereafter.

          -  Patient compliance and geographic proximity allow proper staging and follow- up.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Anatomic variant in arteriogram which prevents selective delivery of the chemotherapy
             to the liver

          -  Life expectancy &lt; 3 months
