      The primary research aim of this project is to test the effectiveness of a comprehensive,
      evidence-based vaccine promotion package implemented in the obstetric setting on increasing
      the likelihood that a pregnant woman in Georgia will receive an influenza and/or pertussis
      vaccine.

      The primary research aim of this project is to test the effectiveness of a comprehensive,
      evidence-based vaccine promotion package implemented in the obstetric setting on increasing
      the likelihood that a pregnant woman in Georgia will receive an influenza vaccine and/or
      Tdap vaccine before delivery.  A secondary research aim assesses whether the comprehensive
      package improves maternal knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs regarding maternal and infant
      vaccination.  The intervention package will include evidence-based components aimed at the
      practice-level, provider-level, and patient level and will be tested through a
      cluster-randomized trial design.  The primary outcome measure is influenza vaccine receipt
      during pregnancy.  The secondary outcomes include 1) receipt of pertussis (Tdap) vaccination
      during pregnancy, and 2) changes in maternal knowledge, attitudes and beliefs regarding
      maternal and infant vaccination. The primary hypothesis is that implementation of a
      comprehensive vaccine promotion package in the obstetric setting will increase the
      likelihood that a pregnant woman receives an influenza and/or pertussis vaccination.

    <description>&quot;P3&quot; stands for Practice, Provider, and Patient level vaccine promotion package.  The 5 obstetric practices randomized to the intervention arm will receive this comprehensive influenza and Tdap vaccine promotion package at the beginning of the study.  Physicians and staff will be familiarized with each component, and practices will be instructed to implement each component to the best of their ability.  The components include:  posters, educational brochures, lapel buttons, provider-to-patient talking points, lists of nearby locations offering flu and/or Tdap vaccines (if not offered by the practice), identification of a &quot;vaccine champion&quot; within the practice, provider and staff training on vaccination during pregnancy, and use of an interactive, tablet-based educational tutorial for patients.</description>
