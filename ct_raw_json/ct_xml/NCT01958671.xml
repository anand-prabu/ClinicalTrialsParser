  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial will evaluate the efficacy and safety of ertugliflozin monotherapy in the
      treatment of subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and inadequate glycemic control
      on diet and exercise.  This trial consists of a run-in period of 3 to 11 weeks, a 26-week
      placebo-controlled treatment period (Phase A), and a 26-week active treatment period (Phase
      B).  The primary hypothesis of the trial is that at Week 26, the mean reduction from
      baseline in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) for 15 mg ertugliflozin is greater than that for placebo.
