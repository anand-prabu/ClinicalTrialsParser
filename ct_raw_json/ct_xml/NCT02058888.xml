  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The worldwide increase in the incidence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens is alarming.
      Antimicrobial treatment is a risk factor for the isolation of MDR pathogens and can
      therefore contribute to the observed trend. Differences in the degree of selection pressure
      caused by various antimicrobials have not been systematically investigated until today. The
      aim of the proposed project is the determination of the impact of antibiotic treatment on
      the copy number of resistance genes in the human intestinal microbiome using metagenome
      shotgun sequencing. The resistance gene count in the gastrointestinal tract will be
      determined in a clinical cohorts of patients treated with either ciprofloxacin or
      cotrimoxazol as monotherapy. The subsequent quantification and comparison of the selection
      pressure facilitates the application of antibiotics with a lower potential to select for
      resistance. To achieve this goal, a self-controlled, prospective observational
      epidemiological study will be performed at two centres of the German Centre for Infection
      Research (Tübingen, Cologne).

    <description>Stool samples will be collected from patients at four time points:
t0 (baseline) The time point serves as a control. The stool sample will be obtained before treatment start.
t1 (early phase) The time point reflects the early phase at day 1 of treatment with either ciprofloxacin or cotrimoxazol.
t2 (early-late phase) The time point reflects the early-late phase at day 3 of treatment.
t3 (late phase) The time point reflects the end of treatment (max. day 7).</description>
