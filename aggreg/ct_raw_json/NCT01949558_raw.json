Pregnancy and lactation are associated with changes in weight, body\n      composition and lipid metabolism and affect the risk of developing these chronic illnesses.\n      Our group has conducted a randomized clinical trial (LEVA) to evaluate overweight/obese\n      women's ability to make longterm lifestyle changes during the postpartum (pp) period, under\n      ideal study conditions. Physiological mechanisms for weight reduction were investigated with\n      precise methodology. However, effectiveness studies under different conditions are crucial\n      for the development of effective programs for the Primary Health Care sector. Hence, the\n      interest for translational research that brings results from clinical trials to the Primary\n      Health Care sector has increased. The aim of this effectiveness-study is to investigate if\n      dietary restrictions pp lead to significantly greater weight reduction among\n      overweight/obese women, compared to no intervention, in a longterm perspective. In total 106\n      women will be recruited 10 wk pp and randomized into 1) control group; 2) dietary\n      restrictions in individualized intervention during 12 wks. One and two years pp long term\n      effects are evaluated. Positive results may be integrated into usual practice after the\n      study ends."
