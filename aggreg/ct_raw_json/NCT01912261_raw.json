            "textblock": "Postoperative fatigue (POF) is one of the main complaints in approximately 39-80% of CABG\n      surgery patients. POF can have a significant impact on an individual's quality of life (QoL)\n      and recovery. The objectives are to examine how an oral iron (Feramax\u00ae) influences fatigue\n      during early postoperative recovery (at three months) among CABG patients and determine the\n      effects on recovery outcomes (e.g. QoL, functional capacity, anemia, and medication\n      adherence). To achieve these objectives the research will aim to answer the following\n      questions:\n\n        1. Is oral iron effective in reducing POF measured by the Identity Consequence Fatigue\n           Scale (ICFS) over 12 weeks?\n\n        2. If oral iron is effective, how effective was it on improving fatigue, functional\n           capacity, QoL, and anemia?\n\n        3. To what degree do patients taking oral iron adhere to the prescription? A prospective,\n           randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled, single-center study was chosen for this\n           study. Three hundred participants who are scheduled for an isolated CABG surgery will\n           be recruited from the QEII Health Sciences Centre (QEIIHSC), Halifax, Nova Scotia. All\n           study participants will be followed for three months following hospital discharge.\n\n      Data will be collected at three time points:\n\n      Time point 1 Baseline -Patients are screened in the preadmission clinic or nursing unit and\n      recruited for the study. During this visit, the patient will be assessed for eligibility,\n      demographic data and blood work collected and three questionnaires and six minute walk test\n      completed by participants.\n\n      Time point 2 Discharge/Randomization-Patients will be randomized to either FeraMAX\u00ae or\n      placebo at hospital discharge. The treatment will be taken once daily for 84 days starting\n      Day 1 (day after discharge from hospital). The questionnaires, six minute walk test and\n      blood work will be repeated.\n\n      Time point 3 End of treatment-The questionnaires, six minute walk test, blood work and pill\n      count will be repeated during a clinic visit.\n\n      Fatigue will be measured with the ICFS and FACT-An questionnaire. The SF-36 is used to\n      measure QoL and the six minute walk test to measure functional capacity. Standard of care\n      laboratory tests including (Hgb level, reticulocyte count, ferritin, iron, total iron\n      binding capacity (TIBC), transferrin saturation, and C-Reactive Protein levels will be\n      drawn. Medication adherence to the will be assessed by pill count.\n\n      Data will be analyzed using mean and standard deviation and median for nonparametric data.\n      Comparison of continuous data will be analyzed using Mann-Whitney U-test and categorical\n      variables will be compared using Fisher exact test or t test when appropriate. Multiple\n      variant analyses will be used to adjust for differences in the clinical characteristics of\n      the two groups. Level of significance was set at p < 0.05.\n\n      Oral iron is inexpensive and effective treatment for iron deficiency that occurs from\n      surgical blood loss. Currently there is no specific drug used to treat POF. Standard of care\n      for POF consists of treating and eliminating the underlying symptoms."
