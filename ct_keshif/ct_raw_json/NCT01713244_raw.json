It can ablated and blocked the\n      small vessels while destroyed the tumor cell in situ. Surgical resection is the most widely\n      accepted treatment for the patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma in the Asian\n      countries. But the effectiveness of hepatectomy was depressed because of the high recurrence\n      rate. The spreading of the cancer cell along the portal vein or the hepatic vein system\n      during the operation account for the tumor recurrence. Using RFA to ablate and block the\n      small vessels around the tumor before resection will reduce the spreading of the cancer\n      cell. Investigators hypothesized that the RFA assisted  hepatectomy might result in lower\n      recurrence rate than hepatectomy alone in the treatment of advanced HCC. Thus, the purpose\n      of this study was to prospectively compare the effects of RFA assisted  hepatectomy with\n      hepatectomy alone for the treatment of advanced HCC."
