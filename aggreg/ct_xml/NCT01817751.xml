  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well sorafenib tosylate, valproic acid, and sildenafil
      citrate works in treating patients with recurrent glioblastoma. Sorafenib tosylate, valproic
      acid, and sildenafil citrate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the
      enzymes needed for cell growth.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The combination of sorafenib, valproic acid, and sildenafil may have therapeutic potential
      for the treatment of GBM in the clinic. The combination of sorafenib and valproic acid is
      predicated on the basis that sorafenib activity is enhanced by HDAC inhibition. The addition
      of sildenafil is based on its ability to block ABCB1 and ABCG2 drug efflux pumps. As the
      ABCG2 transporter is the primary transporter involved in the efflux of sorafenib at the BBB,
      blocking its action is predicted to increase the concentration of sorafenib in the brain.
