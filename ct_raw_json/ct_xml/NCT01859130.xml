  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to obtain implant survivorship and clinical outcomes
      data for commercially available Persona fixed bearing knee implants used in total knee
      arthroplasty.  The assessment will include implant survivorship and clinical performance
      measured by pain and function, quality of life data, radiographic parameters and
      survivorship.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study design is a prospective, multicenter, study of the commercially available Persona
      fixed bearing knee implants.  The study will require each site to obtain Institutional
      Review Board (IRB) approval prior to study enrollment.  All potential study subjects will be
      required to participate in the Informed Consent Process.

      All study subjects will undergo preoperative clinical evaluations prior to their total knee
      arthroplasty.  The post-operative clinical and radiographic evaluations will be conducted at
      6 weeks, 6 months, 1 year, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient 18-75 years of age, inclusive;

          -  Patient qualifies for primary total knee arthroplasty based on physical exam and
             medical history, including diagnosis of severe knee pain and disability due to at
             least one of the following:

               -  rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, traumatic arthritis, polyarthritis;

               -  collagen disorders and/or avascular necrosis of the femoral condyle;

               -  post-traumatic loss of joint configuration, particularly when there is
                  patellofemoral erosion, dysfunction or prior patellectomy;

               -  moderate valgus, varus, or flexion deformities;

               -  the salvage of previously failed surgical attempts that did not include partial
                  or total knee arthroplasty of the ipsilateral knee;

          -  Patient has participated in a study-related Informed Consent process;

          -  Patient is willing and able to complete scheduled study procedures and follow-up
             evaluations;

          -  Independent of study participation, patient is a candidate for commercially available
             Persona fixed bearing knee components implanted in accordance with product labeling.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient is currently participating in any other surgical intervention studies or pain
             management studies;

          -  Previous history of infection in the affected joint and/or other local/systemic
             infection that may affect the prosthetic joint;

          -  Insufficient bone stock on femoral or tibial surfaces;

          -  Skeletal immaturity;

          -  Neuropathic arthropathy;

          -  Osteoporosis or any loss of musculature or neuromuscular disease that compromises the
             affected limb;

          -  Stable, painless arthrodesis in a satisfactory functional position;

          -  Severe instability secondary to the absence of collateral ligament integrity;

          -  Rheumatoid arthritis accompanied by an ulcer of the skin or a history of recurrent
             breakdown of the skin;

          -  Patient has a known or suspected sensitivity or allergy to one or more of the implant
             materials;
