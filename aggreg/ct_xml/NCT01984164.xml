  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to conduct a 1-year double blind randomized control trial comparing
      candesartan to lisinopril in 140 individuals with hypertension and executive mild cognitive
      impairment in their effects on executive function, neuroimaging markers, and vascular
      indicators.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  Hypertension is associated with cognitive impairment even in the absence of clinical
           dementia. To date, no specific treatment is available for this pattern of mild
           cognitive impairment related to hypertension.

        -  Objectives or purpose: The aims of this study are to investigate the effects of
           candesartan on executive function decline and on changes in cerebral perfusion,
           cerebrovascular reserve and microvascular brain injury. The study also intends to
           identify potential underlying mechanisms related to vascular structure and function,
           including atherosclerosis, vascular inflammation, vascular stiffness, and endothelial
           progenitor cells, by which candesartan may affect the cognitive and cerebrovascular
           outcomes.

        -  Study methodology:This is a double blind randomized clinical trial that will be
           conducted in 140 individuals (70 in the candesartan group, 70 in the lisinopril group).
           Our target population is subjects: 60 years or older with hypertension and Executive
           Mild Cognitive Impairment.

        -  Endpoints to be measured:Our measures include cognitive function, cerebral perfusion
           and reserve, markers of vascular brain damage, atherosclerosis, stiffness, vascular
           inflammation and endothelial function.

        -  Description of intervention, follow-up, and duration of study: Eligible participants
           will undergo randomization into 2 groups and will be seen frequently until their blood
           pressure is controlled (&lt;140/90 mmHg). Participants will be seen at 3, 6 and 12 months
           afterwards.

    <description>Resting functional MRI (r-fMRI): This protocol assesses the communication or &quot;functional connectivity&quot; between brain regions. Functional connectivity has a key role in important complex cognitive processes.  It focuses on spontaneous, rather than task-induced, low frequency (&lt;0.1 Hz) fluctuations in the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signals.</description>

Both groups will also receive (unblinded) , if needed to achieve blood pressure control, HCTZ 12.5mg→ 25mg, Amlodipine 2.5mg→ 5mg →10mg and metoprolol succinate extended release 12.5mg→ 25mg→ 50mg. Antihypertensive medications will be increased every 2 weeks until control is achieved.</description>
