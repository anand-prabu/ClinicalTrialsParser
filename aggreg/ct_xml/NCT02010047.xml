  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The anaplastic lymphoma kinase gene(ALK) is mutated approximately 5% of non-small cell lung
      cancers. Testing for this gene is important because there are drugs known as ALK inhibitors
      that have been shown to significantly delay the progression of ALK-mutated lung cancers.
      There are a number of ways to test for the presence of the ALK gene in lung cancer biopsy
      tissue. One method involves making slides and staining them to detect the ALK protein. This
      is called immunohistochemistry. Another method called fluorescence in situ
      hybridization(FISH)is used to detect rearrangements of the ALK gene associated with lung
      cancer. Although both these tests are widely used to test for ALK gene abnormalities, the
      techniques may not always find the ALK gene mutation because they are not sensitive enough
      or not enough cancer cells are present in the lung biopsy.

      This study is being performed to determine if a technique called quantitation polymerase
      chain reaction (qPCR) is as accurate or better at finding the ALK gene mutation in lung
      cancer biopsy tissue.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  You have a confirmed diagnosis of non-squamous, non-endocrine non-small cell   lung
             cancer.

          -  Your cancer biopsy has sufficient cancer cells to be tested for the (Epidermal Growth
             Factor Receptor (EGFR) mutation, the ALK fusion gene abnormality and the research ALK
             testing.

          -  Your lung cancer biopsy is determined not to have a mutation in the EGFR gene.

          -  You are 19 years old or older.

          -  You fully understand the study and give informed consent to participate as
             demonstrated by signing the consent.
