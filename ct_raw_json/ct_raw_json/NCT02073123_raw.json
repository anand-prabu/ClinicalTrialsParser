            "textblock": "The incidence of melanoma is increasing.  Based upon data obtained between 2004 and 2006,\n      the lifetime probability of developing melanoma in the United States is estimated to be 1 in\n      37 for men and 1 in 56 for women. In the United States, melanoma is the fifth leading cancer\n      in men and the seventh in women.  Locally confined, fully-resectable disease may be curable\n      with current therapy; but Stage IV metastatic disease (or relapsed/recurrent disease) is\n      highly refractory to therapy.  Thus, experimental clinical trials provide an accepted\n      treatment option for metastatic or relapsed/refractory melanoma.\n\n      The current study is designed as a prospective trial to evaluate the combination of\n      indoximod and ipilimumab in adult patients with metastatic melanoma.  Ipilimumab will be\n      used at the recommended approved dose for this indication.\n\n      The current trial will be done in two phases: a Phase 1b dose escalation of indoximod in\n      combination with ipilimumab, starting at half the recommended single-agent dose, to\n      establish the recommended Phase 2 dose for the combination.\n\n      This will be followed by a single-arm expansion study testing a fixed dose of indoximod (at\n      the recommended Phase 2 dose) combined with standard-dose ipilimumab.\n\n      Treatment will be administered on an outpatient basis.    No investigational or commercial\n      cancer directed agents or therapies other than those described below may be administered.\n\n      Safety assessment will follow the guidelines provided in the National Cancer Institute\n      Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) Version.4.03.\n\n      Patients will be followed both clinically and radiographically starting 12 weeks after\n      initiation of treatment then every 8 weeks for tumor evaluation. Post-treatment scans will\n      be compared to the baseline scan and responses will be assessed based using RECIST and\n      immune related response criteria (irRC) described by Wolchok et al. (Wolchok et al., 2009)."

For this reason\n             and because indoximod may affect maternal immune tolerance of the fetus, sexually\n             active women of child-bearing potential must agree to use two forms of contraception\n             (hormonal and barrier method of birth control or abstinence) prior to study entry and\n             for the duration of study participation.   Use of contraception or abstinence should\n             continue for a minimum of 1 month after completion of the study.  Should a woman\n             become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she\n             should discontinue the   study   drug   and   inform   her   treating   physician\n             immediately.  A pregnancy test is required prior to study enrollment and monthly\n             while on treatment with indoximod for all women of child-bearing potential.

Pre-treatment with other immune modulators is\n             allowed in the phase 1 component of the study only. For the Phase II component,\n             patients are excluded if they have had prior therapy with or immune-stimulating\n             agents including interleukin-2, interferons, CTLA-4 or PD1 antagonists, CD40 or CD137\n             agonist, or cancer therapeutic vaccines in any prior line for metastatic disease.\n             Interferons used in the adjuvant setting are allowed (Phase 1 or 2 component).\n\n          -  Patients with known active, uncontrolled brain metastases should be excluded from\n             this clinical trial.\n\n          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic\n             composition to ipilimumab or tryptophan containing substances. This would include\n             L-tryptophan or 5-hydroxy-tryptophan supplements.

Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse\n             events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with indoximod,\n             breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with indoximod.\n\n          -  Known HIV-positive patients and those with other acquired/inherited\n             immunodeficiencies are ineligible due the possibility of affecting the response to\n             indoximod, and the higher risk of active opportunistic infections.\n\n          -  Any other cancer, unless the patient has been disease-free for \u22655 years (except\n             treated and cured basal-cell or squamous-cell skin cancer, superficial bladder\n             cancer, or treated carcinoma in situ of the cervix, breast, or bladder and treated\n             localized prostate cancer with undetectable PSA for 2 years).\n\n          -  Patients with laboratory evidence of pancreatitis are excluded.\n\n          -  Patients with autoimmune disease other than vitiligo (e.g., psoriasis, extensive\n             atopic dermatitis, asthma, IBD, M.S., uveitis, vasculitis), chronic inflammatory\n             condition, or any condition requiring concurrent use of any systemic\n             immunosuppressants or steroids for any reason are excluded from the study.  Patients\n             with isolated vitiligo remain eligible.  Any patient with an allo-transplant of any\n             kind would be excluded as well, including xenograft heart valve.  Mild, intermittent\n             asthma requiring only occasional beta-agonist inhaler use or mild localized eczema\n             will not be excluded.\n\n          -  Chronic use of immune-suppressive drugs (ie, systemic corticosteroids used in the\n             management of cancer or non-cancer related illnesses, eg, COPD).\n\n          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agent."
