      This is a phase III study of Peptid Receptor Radionuclide Therapy (PRRT) with
      177Lu-octreotate versus Interferon α-2b.

      Objectives of the study:

        1. To assess the benefit of 177Lu-octreotate versus interferon α-2b in patients with
           progressive, unresectable,non-pancreatic gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumors,
           resistant to therapy with somatostatine analogues.

        2. To assess efficacy and safety parameters of both treatment arms and the prognostic
           value of tumor 68Ga-octreotate PET/CT and 18FDG PET/CT uptake at baseline, at mid and
           end of PRRT treatment.

      In the interferon arm: 5000000 Units of interferon will be administered subcutaneously
      preferentially in the evening every second day.

      In the 177Lu-octreotate arm: Treatment will consist of 177Lu-octreotate infusions in fixed
      activities of 7,4 GigaBecqurel each, given 8-11 weeks apart, injected intravenously with
      simultaneous infusion of an amino acid solution. (Before amino acid nephroprotection
      solution, ondansetron, methylprednisolone and metoclopramid, are given intravenously in
      order to prevent nausea or vomiting). Approximately 30 min after the beginning of the
      aminoacid solution,  177Lu-octreotate is co-infused over 15-30 minutes. The amino acid
      infusion is continued at the same rate for 3-5 more hours (total infusion lasts 4-6 hours).

      In total, 4 cycles are planned. However, the total number of administered cycles will be
      limited by critical organ (kidneys and bone marrow) cumulated absorbed doses.

      Treatment efficacy will be assessed on a patient-basis by evaluation of the Progression-Free
      Survival
