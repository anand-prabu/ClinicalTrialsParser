To make a comparison of\n      therapeutic efficacy between the two groups, motor and non-motor symptoms will be assessed\n      using specific rating scales and questionnaires. To investigate whether DBS is\n      neuroprotective, disease progression will be monitored by PET imaging in a half of each\n      group preoperatively and at follow-up. A selective vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2)\n      tracer, 9-[18F]fluoropropyl-(+)-dihydrotetrabenazine (18F-AV-133) will be used to measure\n      the number of dopaminergic neurons."
