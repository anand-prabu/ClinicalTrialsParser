        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  At least 12 years old

          -  Enrolled in a program of regular RBCx to prevent symptoms/complications of sickle
             cell disease (SCD) or Initiating a program of regular RBCx or Receiving RBCx as a
             pre-surgical procedure.

          -  Medically stable

          -  Previous documentation of diagnosis by hemoglobin electrophoresis of a type of sickle
             cell disorder requiring RBCx.

          -  Sufficient vascular access to accommodate the RBCx procedure as determined by the
             apheresis technician performing the procedure or phlebotomist responsible for
             obtaining intravenous access.

          -  Availability of sickle trait negative, leukoreduced, ABO, Rh (D) compatible,
             unexpired replacement blood. See Glossary for definition of replacement blood.

          -  Able to commit to the study follow-up schedule.

          -  Agree to report adverse events (AEs) during the required reporting period.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Inability to obtain informed consent/assent from patient, or permission from parent
             or guardian.

          -  Pregnancy (negative serum pregnancy test required for females of childbearing
             potential).

          -  Life expectancy is fewer than 30 days from time of procedure.

          -  Incarcerated or a ward of the court.

          -  Refusal of blood products.

          -  Failure to comply with site standard requirements for cessation of medications (e.g.,
             ACE inhibitors) that interfere with or increase risk of RBCx procedures.

          -  History of drug or alcohol abuse that, in the opinion of the investigator, could
             affect the ability of the patient to comply with the study requirements Inability to
             comply with the protocol in the opinion of the investigator.
