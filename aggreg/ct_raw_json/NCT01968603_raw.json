It has a major\n      negative impact on metabolic and cardiovascular health and quality of life in long-term\n      survivors. Identifying patients at higher risks for developing postoperative weight gain is\n      of great importance in preventing obesity and taking early actions in this population.\n      Though a lot of previous studies have been made in pediatric patients and several factors,\n      such as hypothalamic involvement, higher body mass index (BMI) standard deviation score\n      (SDS) at diagnosis, age at diagnosis and hydrocephalus requiring a shunt, have been\n      identified as risk factors for postoperative weight gain, data on this important morbidity\n      in adult-onset patients are sparse, especially in Chinese population. Therefore, the\n      investigators are going to undertake a retrospective evaluation of postoperative weight\n      change in adult-onset patients undergoing surgery for craniopharyngioma and identify\n      preoperative factors associated with it."
