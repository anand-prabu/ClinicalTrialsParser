  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive dysfunction is frequent in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and to date,
      there are no available treatments to improve cognition in this patient population. Some
      evidence from animal studies and small clinical trials suggest that aerobic exercise might
      beneficially affect cognitive function in MS. The aim of this randomized-controlled trial is
      to explore if an aerobic exercise training program can enhance cognition in MS. In addition,
      we will employ neuroimaging markers to determine if exercise alters measures of brain
      structure and function.

      Patients will be randomly assigned to either a 3-months exercise program (bicycle ergometry,
      2-3 session per week) or a waitlist control group. The primary endpoint of the study is a
      test of verbal learning and memory. Secondary endpoints include neuroimaging markers of
      functional and structural connectivity in the brain. We hypothesize that exercise will
      improve verbal learning and memory and beneficially affect measures of brain connectivity.
