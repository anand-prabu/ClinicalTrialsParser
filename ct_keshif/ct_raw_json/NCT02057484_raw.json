            "textblock": "Prograf is one of the medications taken by a patient after they have had a liver or kidney\n      transplant to prevent their body from rejecting the new liver or kidney transplant. Prograf\n      is taken by the patient twice a day. Advagraf is a similar medication but is taken by the\n      patient only once a day. There is some evidence emerging that may show that this once-a-day\n      medication may show additional benefits over the twice a day medication, such as, patients\n      more likely to remember to take this medication. Also, this once a day medication is slowly\n      released in the body through the course of a day which in turn may provide better protection\n      against the body rejecting the new transplanted organ over a longer period.\n\n      This study will follow up adult patients who were previously enrolled in an Advagraf trial\n      after they have had a liver or kidney transplant. The information collected for this study\n      will be information that the patient's doctor will normally collect when he/she sees the\n      patient  for their regular check-ups. Information will be collected once a year  for a\n      period of 5 years from when the patient received their new organ transplant.  It is hoped\n      that patient information collected during the study will provide prescribers with useful\n      information in treatment of organ transplant patients."
