The underlying deficit of TSC, loss of inhibition of the mammalian\n      target of rapamycin (mTOR) protein due to dysfunction of the tuberin/hamartin protein\n      complex, can be rescued by everolimus. Everolimus has been registered as treatment for renal\n      cell carcinoma and giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA). Evidence in human and animal studies\n      suggests that mTOR inhibitors improve learning and development in patients with TSC."
