  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Individuals in Appalachian Kentucky are vulnerable to cardiovascular disease (CVD) by virtue
      of having high rates of multiple CVD risk factors. There is a critical need to develop and
      test CVD risk reducing interventions that are appropriate and effective in Appalachia. In
      the absence of such interventions, the dramatic CVD disparities seen in this area will
      continue to rise.

      Lifestyle interventions reduce CVD risk by 44%. The investigators and others have
      demonstrated that lifestyle change is most effective when patients are given the tools to
      engage in effective self-care, and that interventions individualized to patients' specific
      needs and barriers are more effective than interventions that are not. The central
      hypothesis is that to be successful in Appalachia, CVD risk reducing interventions must
      focus on patient-centered lifestyle change that increase individuals' abilities to engage in
      self-care, must be culturally appropriate, and must have components that overcome barriers
      faced by individuals living in Appalachia.

      The investigators propose a randomized, controlled comparative effectiveness trial with 300
      individuals from Appalachian Kentucky who do not have a primary care provider and who are at
      risk for CVD by virtue of having two or more modifiable CVD risk factors. The investigators
      will compare (1) a patient-centered, culturally appropriate, self-care CVD risk reduction
      intervention (HeartHealth) designed to improve multiple CVD risk factors while overcoming
      barriers to success with (2) referral of patients to a primary care provider for management
      of their CVD risk factors. The investigators propose the following specific aims to be
      tested at 4 months and 1 year after baseline. To compare the short and long-term impact of
      the interventions on:

      1) the risk factor selected by patients (i.e., tobacco use, blood pressure, lipid profile,
      hemoglobin-A1c (HgA1c) for diabetics, body mass index, waist circumference, depressive
      symptoms, or physical activity level); 2) all of the CVD risk factors of each patient; 3)
      quality of life; 4) patient and healthcare provider satisfaction; 5) desirability and
      adoptability by assessing adherence to recommended CVD risk reduction measures, and
      retention of recruited individuals. The investigators hypothesize that in comparison to the
      referral strategy, the multifaceted patient-centered, self-care intervention will engender
      more favorable outcomes across all measures.
