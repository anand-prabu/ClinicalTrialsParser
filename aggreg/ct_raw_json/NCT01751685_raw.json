We will\n      assess the effect of the intervention on the co-primary outcomes of kyphosis, modified\n      Physical Performance Test (PPT) and gait speed measured as change over 6 months. We will\n      also assess the effect of the intervention on secondary outcomes of physical function and\n      health-related quality of life, measured as change in Timed Up and Go, Timed Loaded\n      Standing, Six-Minute Timed Walk, the Scoliosis Research Society SRS-30, PROMISe Global\n      Health and physical function and PACE questionnaires.  Furthermore, we will investigate\n      whether changes in kyphosis, spinal muscle strength and/or density mediate the effect of the\n      intervention on change in physical function. After the 6-month intervention, both groups\n      will continue their usual activity and we will assess the durability of the effects of the\n      intervention at 1-year follow-up."
