  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this 2-group randomized clinical trial is to: 1) examine the feasibility and
      acceptability of a 3-month positive-emotion focused therapy (Quality of Life Therapy)
      modified specifically for patients with implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD); and 2)
      obtain estimates of effect size for QOLT compared to Heart Healthy Education on the changes
      in arrhythmia frequency and biomarkers of autonomic function, as well as changes in emotion,
      mood, and well-being across time (baseline, 3 &amp; 9-months). It is hypothesized that the QOLT
      will promote improvements in autonomic function, reduced arrhythmia frequency, and improved
      psychological well-being.

             allowed).

          4. Long QT syndrome; and other channelopathies such as Brugada syndrome;

          5. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy;

          6. Neurocognitive or cognitive impairments;
