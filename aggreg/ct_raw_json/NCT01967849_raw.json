The patient's percent body fat, fat mass and lean\n      mass may also be measured using a Tanita scale.  The nurse will obtain a family and medical\n      history from the patient and/or the patient's parent/guardian.  In addition, before starting\n      the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), the nurse will request a urine sample from the\n      patient for analysis of microalbumin and creatinine.\n\n      The patient will receive 1.75 g/kg to a maximum of 75 g of a sugar drink, orally (Glucola).\n      The patient will have one intravenous line.  \"Emla\" or a local anesthetic (0.1cc buffered\n      lidocaine) will be applied before the placement of the IV catheter.  Blood will be drawn 10\n      times over three hours.  Should abnormal glucose results be found, appropriate referrals\n      will be made.
