  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial Fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac rhythm disturbance or arrhythmia. It is
      more common as you get older and is a major risk factor for stroke. Often AF has minimal
      symptoms and so diagnosing it may be difficult. Often if a GP suspects a cardiac rhythm
      problem, they may ask for an electrocardiogram (ECG).

      A 12 lead ECG is the gold-standard for diagnosing AF, however, it is not the most convenient
      process for patients or technicians. It requires removal of clothes and possibly body hair.
      Also the attachment of multiple leads for a standard 12-lead ECG recording often results in
      detachment of one or more of the adhesive leads, requiring repositioning and delays in the
      process.

      Novel ways of diagnosing AF are therefore needed. The RhythmPadGP does not have the same
      practical limitations as the standard 12-lead ECG system and requires the placement of three
      straps (one around each wrist and one around an ankle); this is likely to be more acceptable
      to patients and technicians.

      The RhythmPadGP is a novel technology and investigation is required to assess if it is an
      accurate method for screening for AF.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We hope to recruit 550 patients from those attending St Peters Hospital over a 6 month
      period.

      Patients will be selected from those arriving at the electrocardiogram (ECG) department for
      a standard 12 lead ECG recording, or from those attending the cardiology outpatient
      department.

      Whilst the participants are waiting for their ECGs, a research nurse trained in good
      clinical practice will give them an ethically approved information leaflet outlining the
      study. For those attending clinic, the same information sheet will also be posted out to
      them in advance.

      Once they have taken the time to read the information leaflet a research nurse or doctor
      will be available to answer any questions. Formal consent will then be sought for inclusion
      in the study, and will be gained by a member of the research department trained in gaining
      informed consent.

      Whilst having their 12-lead ECG, the patients shall also have 3 Velcro straps attached; 1 on
      each wrist and 1 around an ankle. As they are having the standard 12-lead ECG performed (as
      was requested by their health care professional), the additional 3 lead (Velcro straps)
      system will make separate recordings (a 6 lead and 1 lead recording). Owing to the
      simplicity of the trial 3-lead system and undertaking the recordings simultaneously, the
      time to perform the additional recordings shall not be significantly greater than the
      standard process.

      A patient experience questionnaire shall be undertaken. A standardized checklist will be
      used to confirm that we have the 1 lead, 6 lead and 12 lead recordings for the same patient.
      This will be completed at the time of the recordings and further monitored on a weekly
      basis.

      After the data is collected from the participants it will be analysed independently by
      doctors and cardiac physiologists who are blinded to the concurrent recordings. Any
      uncertain or discordant findings will be reviewed by a cardiologist blinded to all findings.

      The findings of the 6 lead device will be analyzed and the diagnostic rates, sensitivity and
      specificity of recordings will be calculated in comparison to the 12 lead gold standard.
      Further analysis will take place comparing a 1 lead recording, and looking at other findings
      such as atrial flutter, supraventricular tachycardia, tachycardia, bradycardia and sinus
      rhythm. The patient experience data shall be analyzed for inclusion in the results.
