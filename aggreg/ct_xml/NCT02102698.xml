  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tourette's Syndrome is a neurological disease characterized by motor and vocal tics. It has
      been hypothesized that abnormal interactions of dopamine with its receptors may cause the
      tics. The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that a drug (ecopipam) that
      selectively blocks dopamine D1/D5 receptors can reduce the frequency and severity of the
      tics.

        Inclusion Criteria:• Subjects must have Tourette's Syndrome (TS) based on the
        clinician-administered Diagnostic Confidence Index (DCI) for TS.

          -  Subjects must exhibit both motor and vocal tics.

          -  Subjects must have a minimum score of 20 at both Screening and Baseline (just prior
             to the first treatment) on the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale.

          -  Subjects must be age (≥ 7 to &lt; 18 years of age)

          -  Subjects must weigh ≥ 20 kg (45 lbs)

          -  Adolescent females of childbearing potential who are sexually active must be using
             effective contraception (i.e., oral contraceptives, intrauterine device, double
             barrier method of condom and spermicide) and agree to continue use of contraception
             for the duration of their participation in the study.  They must also agree to use
             contraception for 30 days after their last dose of study drug.

          -  Sexually active male subjects must use a barrier method of contraception during the

             the last dose of study drug.

          -  Subject's parent or legal guardian must execute a written informed consent.

               -  oral neuroleptics within 4 weeks

               -  selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors unless the dosage has been stable for a
