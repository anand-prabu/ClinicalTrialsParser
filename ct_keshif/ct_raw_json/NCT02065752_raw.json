Two Fixed Dose\n      Combinations (FDCs) will be evaluated during the study (two types of tablets). The tablets\n      will be of the same strength (50 mg CANA/500 mg MET XR) and will be compared with the equal\n      doses of the individual drugs: canagliflozin (1 x 100 mg tablet) and metformin XR (2 x 500\n      mg tablets). Thus, there will be 3 treatment periods in the study: Treatment A: \"Reference\"\n      treatment of individual components. Treatment B: CANA/MET XR FDC, formulation 1; and\n      Treatment C: CANA/MET XR FDC, formulation 2. Approximately 42 healthy adult participants\n      will be randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatments groups, and then each group will receive all\n      three treatments in different sequences (3-way crossover). The study will consist of 3\n      phases: a Screening Phase of approximately 3 weeks (Days -22 to -2), an Open-Label Treatment\n      Phase consisting of 3 single-dose Treatment Periods of 5 days each (Days -1 through 4)\n      separated by a washout of 10 to 14 days between Day 1 of each Treatment Period, and a\n      Follow-up Phase occurring 7 to 10 days after the last study-related procedure on Day 4 of\n      Treatment Period 3. The total duration of the study will be about 70 days for each\n      participant."
