  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dynamic parameters  like pulse pressure variation have been shown to be accurate predictors
      of fluid responsiveness. Hemodynamic optimization based on fluid management and stroke
      volume optimization have been shown to improve patient outcomes, especially for moderate and
      high risk abdominal surgical patients. A novel closed-loop fluid administration system based
      on multi-parameter hemodynamic monitoring have been described recently. This prospective,
      randomized, surgeon  and patient blinded study aims at comparing the cardiac output provided
      by either this closed-loop system or the anesthesiologist team in high-rish surgical patient
      elected for abdominal surgery at Pierre Bénite University Hospital, Hospices Civils of Lyon,
      France. Primary endpoint is the mean indexed cardiac output during surgery per group. We
      will also compare hemodynamic parameter (cardiac output, stroke volume, blood pressure heart
      rate…) and patient's outcomes (morbidity, mortality, transfusion rate, hospital length of
      stay) between groups
