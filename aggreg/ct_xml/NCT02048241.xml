  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children with explosive aggression are often rejected by their peers, placed in special
      classroom, and contribute to family discord. When psychotherapy and family therapy is
      unsuccessful, medications are often used. Current medications are stimulants (e.g.
      methylphenidate, dextroamphetamine), anticonvulsants (e.g. Divalproex) and antipsychotics
      (olanzapine, risperidone). At this time, the available medications are of limited
      usefulness, either because they do not always work or because they have side effects such as
      weight gain or insomnia. There is a clear need for new medications to treat explosive
      aggression when psychotherapy is unsuccessful.

      The hypothesis of this study is the medication Intuniv when combined with psychotherapy will
      be more helpful to children with explosive aggression than placebo combined with
      psychotherapy. Intuniv is a long acting form of guanfacine, a medication approved by the FDA
      for treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. Intuniv is not a stimulant, nor
      is it an anticonvulsant, nor is it an antipsychotic.

      The children in this study will be between the ages of 6 and 12 and meet Diagnostic and
      Statistical Manual of Psychiatry Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) criteria for
      Intermittent Explosive Disorder.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aggressive children are often alienated from parents, separated from peers, placed in
      special education and segregated with other aggressive children. While predatory (i.e.
      planned, goal directed, reward driven) aggression is not responsive to pharmacologic
      treatment, non predatory (impulsive, paranoid, irritable) aggression (DSM-IV-TR
      &quot;Intermittent Explosive Disorder&quot;) often is. Intermittent Explosive Disorder is
      characterized by discrete episodes of failure to resist aggressive impulses resulting in
      serious assaults or destruction of property. In children, due to their limited ability to
      damage or hurt others, the seriousness of the aggressive impulses are indicated by (a) the
      frequency and severity of tantrums (b) the fact that the severity is out of proportion to
      the provocation, and (c) the intent to damage and hurt is present and (d) this pattern of
      events causes impairment.

      The level of aggression being studied is equivalent to that in moderate to severe
      Oppositional Defiant Disorder with the severity due to the tantrums rather than passive
      aggression (Modified Overt Aggression Score between 15-50). For 20 years a blood pressure
      medication, guanfacine (Tenex), has also been used for impulse control (e.g. in Attention
      Deficit Disorder, in Tourette's Syndrome) and to calm the sympathetic nervous system when it
      is hyper-aroused (e.g. in opiate and nicotine withdrawal]. Both impulsivity and hyper
      arousal can also promote intermittent explosive aggression. If guanfacine treats impulsivity
      and hyper arousal, it is logical to ask if guanfacine can treat intermittent explosive
      aggression.

      Shire Pharmaceuticals modified the guanfacine molecule to create a long acting preparation
      (Intuniv) that the FDA recently judged safe and effective for Attention Deficit
      Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in children ages 6-17. Secondary analysis of data from the
      pivotal studies that led to this indication revealed that in ADHD children, Intuniv also
      reduced oppositional-defiant symptoms. Better impulse control (these were all ADHD children)
      and/or decreased sympathetic arousal (common to all intermittent explosive aggression) are
      plausible explanations.

      This Investigator Sponsor Protocol (ISP) seeks to replicate prospectively the
      anti-aggression finding. Since Intuniv could benefit non-ADHD aggressive children, any child
      with mild to moderate Intermittent Explosive Disorder is eligible. Anti-psychotic and
      anti-convulsant medications (current treatments for Intermittent Explosive Disorder) have
      serious side effects (weight gain, metabolic syndrome) and are not always effective. Intuniv
      is neither a stimulant, nor an antipsychotic, nor an anticonvulsant. Intuniv is not FDA
      approved for treatment of Intermittent Explosive Disorder.

      In addition to medication or placebo, all children will receive a modified form of Parent
      Management Training, the standard psychotherapy for oppositional symptoms, administered by a
      child psychiatrist. It addresses the coercive reciprocal social interactions that
      characterize microenvironment of oppositional children.

      Fifty children, ages 6-12 with Intermittent Explosive Disorder will be randomly assigned to
      eight weeks of double blind Intuniv plus Parent Management Training or placebo Parent
      Management Training. Titrated over four weeks to a maximum dose of 4 mgs or .09-.12
      mgs/kg/day, they will be maintained on that dose for four weeks. At the end of treatment,
      the treating physician will break the blind and offer open label treatment for eight weeks.
