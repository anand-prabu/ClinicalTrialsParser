This will be assessed after 24 months.\n\n      Phase of the trial: and design: Phase III study, open label, randomized, and active\n      controlled trial.\n\n      This study will have 3 stages: screening and recruitment of patients for 18 months,\n      treatment period for six months in corticosteroids plus CYC group and 9 months in\n      Tacrolimus-RTX group, and finally post-treatment follow-up period until to complete 24\n      months of follow-up since initial treatment.\n\n      This study will compare the standard therapy for primary MN patients with nephrotic range\n      proteinuria  (active control of steroids plus CYC) with a novel sequential therapy of\n      tacrolimus and RTX, an approach of potential high efficacy, low toxicity and more acceptable\n      safety profile."
