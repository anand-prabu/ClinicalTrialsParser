Treatment may be repeated when all toxic effects are grade 2 or less. Patients\n      undergo staging at 4 weeks after completion of the second treatment. Patients may receive 2\n      additional treatments.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of melphalan until the maximum tolerated\n      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2\n      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, 12 additional\n      patients are treated with melphalan at the recommended dose.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 4 months for 1 year.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 44 patients will be accrued for this study."
