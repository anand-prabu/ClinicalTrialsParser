  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to analyze the efficacy of Galectin-3 as a biomarker on the
      Chagas Disease prognosis. This analysis will be done through the correlation between the
      plasmatic levels of this molecule with functional and laboratory tests.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies indicate that activated macrophages secrete Galectin-3, a molecule that is
      involved in the development of fibrosis and tissue rearrangement  in the liver, kidney and
      the heart. Its plasmatic levels are increased on patients with acute decompensated heart
      failure. These observations suggest that measuring levels of Galectin-3 in patients with
      cardiac diseases can be useful to determine their prognosis. To investigate the role of this
      new biomarker in Chagas Disease, we will study a Chagas Disease  population (including
      patients with the indeterminate and cardiac form of the disease). The assessment of the
      prognostic value of Galectin-3 will be done through the comparison between its plasmatic
      levels and each patients's clinical evaluation, disease severity, inflammatory biomarkers
      and cardiac function tests.

      The patients included in the study must at first sign the written consent. They shall be
      accompanied in the specialized outpatient clinics for Chagas disease - Hospital São Rafael -
      Centro de Biotecnologia e Terapia Celular. They will be submitted to several tests,
      including:

        -  Collection of Blood samples for biochemical analysis;

        -  Electrocardiogram;

        -  Holter Electrocardiogram;

        -  Echocardiogram;

        -  Treadmill Test;

        -  X-Ray Imaging;

        -  Magnetic Resonance Imaging;

        -  Evaluation of the quality of life through the application of questionnaires (SF 36 and
           the Minnesota Living With Heart Failure Questionnaire).
