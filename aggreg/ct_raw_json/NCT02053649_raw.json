            "textblock": "Perinatal depression (i.e., during pregnancy and/or the postpartum period) is a common and\n      serious mood disorder that increases morbidity and mortality (including suicide) in new\n      mothers, results in poor child outcomes, and has high economic costs. Expectant and new\n      mothers who suffer from circadian rhythm disruption and sleep disturbance are at risk for\n      perinatal depression. This study seeks to determine if Triple Chronotherapy (TC) - a\n      multicomponent treatment consisting of bright light therapy, sleep phase advance, and sleep\n      deprivation/restriction - can improve treatment outcomes for patients with perinatal\n      depression.\n\n      The investigators will assess the feasibility and efficacy of a TC intervention for\n      perinatal depression by testing the treatment in first-time expectant mothers diagnosed with\n      major depressive disorder during 3rd trimester of pregnancy (n = 16). The investigators will\n      randomize patients to either:\n\n        1. usual care (UC, n = 8), or\n\n        2. TC+UC (n = 8).\n\n      TC+UC will have pregnancy and postpartum components and will be administered via an\n      individualized case formulation approach tailored to each patient. After a baseline\n      assessment, TC will be taught and prescribed during 5 dedicated clinical visits- three\n      during 3rd trimester of pregnancy and 2 in the postpartum period. UC will consist of\n      medication administered by a perinatal psychiatrist and/or psychotherapy. UC will be\n      measured in both groups to evaluate differences between TC+UC and UC groups in number of\n      appointments, medication use, and use of hospital/emergency services. Mood will be measured\n      in both groups by clinician interview and patient self-report. The investigators will assess\n      the safety profile of the TC intervention with evaluation of side effects/adverse events,\n      suicide assessments, and performance testing.\n\n      Importantly, the study will also examine the putative mechanisms by which TC is hypothesized\n      to work and the \"dose\" of TC received by patients in the TC+UC group. All participants will\n      wear wrist actigraphy/light monitors continuously during weeks 28-40 of pregnancy and\n      postpartum weeks 2-6 to assess light exposure and sleep duration and timing. Circadian phase\n      (measured with salivary dim light melatonin onset) will be measured at baseline during\n      pregnancy, at 36 weeks gestation, and at postpartum week 6.\n\n      The investigators anticipate that patients in the TC+UC group will show greater/more rapid\n      improvements in depression compared to UC alone. Furthermore, the investigators expect\n      decreased depression to be associated with greater circadian/sleep advances and more light\n      exposure. These data will support a proposal for a larger randomized controlled clinical\n      trial for Perinatal TC.  Perinatal TC could have major public health impact due to the high\n      prevalence of perinatal depression. TC may also work as a preventative strategy for at-risk\n      pregnant women. Finally, TC may be an especially desirable treatment for depressed women who\n      are reluctant to take medications during pregnancy or while lactating."
