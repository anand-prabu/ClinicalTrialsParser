  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Insulinoma: Insulinoma  are rare, small  insulin secreting neuroendocrine tumors. The only
      curative approach is the surgical excision. The preoperative detection remains a challenge.
      A non-invasive, highly sensitive tool in localizing the insulinomas would be appreciated in
      the preoperative work-up of these patients. To this aim Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor
      (GLP-1R) imaging (Single Photon Emission Computer Tomography co-registered with a CT;
      SPECT/CT) could be a convenient tool. The possibly more sensitive approach of targeting
      GLP-1R  using Positron emission tomography (PET/CT) methodology has not been investigated in
      patients so far.

      Beta cell mass (BCM): The in vivo determination of BCM is currently impossible due to the
      lack of a reliable tool. Quantitative assessment of BCM in vivo is of enormous interest  for
      patients with type 1 (T1D) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) in order to evaluate
      pathophysiological mechanisms of T1D and T2D and potential therapeutical interventions
      aiming at the prevention of autoimmune beta cell destruction (i.e. in T1D before clinical
      diagnosis or after islets transplantation) or preservation of BCM in T2D. Radionuclide-based
      methodology (GLP-1R imaging using) radioligands that directly target beta cells appears
      particularly promising.
