Numerous approaches are proposed for its\n      management; however, evidence regarding the best therapeutic approach is lacking.\n\n      Neurodynamic techniques are proposed to be effective to manage nerve trunk pain. In light of\n      this, many techniques are described for the management of the dysfunctions of the sciatic\n      nerve.\n\n      Thus, this study aims to verify, through a randomized sham-controlled trial, the\n      effectiveness of a single application of neurodynamic techniques on pain and disability in\n      individuals with LBRLP."
