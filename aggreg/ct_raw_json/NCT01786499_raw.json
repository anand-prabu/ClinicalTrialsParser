            "textblock": "Hypothesis: Relaxation Response training is an effective intervention in reducing the\n      prevalence and severity of burnout and its components from baseline levels among physicians\n      receiving the training intervention. The intervention is hypothesized to moderate the\n      relationship between Areas of Worklife (AWS) and burnout by improving physician's ability to\n      cope with the demands of their workplace. This increased coping ability is hypothesized to\n      reduce burnout.\n\n      Physician practices are as unique as the individual practitioners and the environment in\n      which they practice. Traditional instruction of relaxation or self-care techniques has\n      required participants to travel to locations remote from the workplace. The time commitment\n      required for this behavior is additive to the time required to learn the intervention and of\n      itself may induce extra stress increasing the potential for burnout. This study proposes\n      that bringing the intervention to the workplace will increase provider willingness to\n      participate and diminish the stress introduced by deployment of the intervention. Since\n      inpatient and outpatient medicine have different practice characteristics and demands on the\n      time of the practitioners, this study will need to develop and test the logistics necessary\n      to bring the training to the different physician populations."

Standard univariate statistics will be used to produce descriptive measures of the sample, Chronbach's alpha to assess internal reliability of survey measures, and confirmatory factor analysis will be employed to determine if the data fits the a priori theoretical model. A combination of the approaches above will help to assess the effectiveness of the Relaxation Response intervention on the prevalence, incidence, and trajectory of provider burnout.",
