These disorders are multifactorial in origin including physical and\n      psychosocial aspects; however, there is little understanding as to how much each of these\n      components are associated with a particular diagnosis and subsequent treatment outcome of\n      temporomandibular joint disorders.  There is also a paucity of information regarding the\n      relative effectiveness of different therapies for the treatment of patients with\n      temporomandibular joint disorders.  The identification of the least invasive and most\n      efficacious therapy is vital to proper management of these patients with temporomandibular\n      joint pain.\n\n      Patients enrolled into the study will be examined and treated at the Department of Oral and\n      Maxillofacial Surgery.  At the first appointment, they will be examined following standard\n      procedures to determine if they would potentially benefit from the TMJ arthrocentesis\n      procedure.  If the patient meets the inclusion criteria for the study and with their\n      informed consent, they will be required to complete a questionnaire about their physical and\n      pain symptoms and undergo a standardized clinical exam.  At the next appointment, the\n      patients will undergo the standard clinical protocol for TMJ arthrocentesis with either only\n      normal saline or normal saline with adjunctive steroids (triamcinolone hexacetonide).\n      Follow-up appointments will be at 2 weeks, 6 weeks and 12 weeks where the pain VAS and\n      clinical exams will be completed."
