      This study is to determine if patients experiencing an Acute Ischemic Stroke due to large
      vessel occlusion, treated with combined IV t-PA and Solitaire FR within 6 hours of symptom
      onset have less stroke-related disability than those patients treated with IV t-PA alone.

          5. Initiation of IV t-PA within 4.5 hours of onset of stroke symptoms (onset time is
             defined as the last time when the patient was witnessed to be at baseline), with
             investigator verification that the subject has received / is receiving the correct IV
             t-PA dose for the estimated weight prior to randomization.

             carotid artery, M1 segment of the MCA, or carotid terminus confirmed by CT or MR
             angiography that is accessible to the Solitaire™ FR Device.

          7. Subject is able to be treated within 1.5 hours (90 minutes) from CTP or DWI/PWI MR to
             groin puncture.

          8. Subject is willing to conduct protocol-required follow-up visits.

          9. Subject or subject's legally authorized representative has signed and dated an
             Informed Consent Form according to country regulations, ethics committee, and/or IRB
             requirements.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History of stroke in the past 3 months.

          2. Female who is pregnant or lactating or has a positive pregnancy test at time of
             admission.

          3. Rapid neurological improvement prior to study randomization suggesting resolution of
             signs/symptoms of stroke.

          4. Known serious sensitivity to radiographic contrast agents.

          5. Current participation in another investigational drug or device treatment study.

          6. Uncontrolled hypertension defined as systolic blood pressure &gt; 185 or diastolic blood
             pressure &gt; 110 that cannot be controlled except with continuous parenteral
             antihypertensive medication.

          7. Known hereditary or acquired hemorrhagic diathesis, coagulation factor deficiency.
             (Patients without history or suspicion of coagulopathy do not require INR or
             prothrombin time lab results to be available prior to enrollment.)

          8. Warfarin therapy with INR greater than 1.7.

          9. Low molecular Weight Heparins (such as Dalteparin, Enoxaparin, Tinzaparin,
             Fondaparinux) as DVT prophylaxis or in full dose within the last 24 hours from
             screening.

         10. Subject who has received heparin or a direct thrombin inhibitor (e.g. rivaroxaban,
             Angiomax™, argatroban, Refludan™) within the last 48 hours must have a normal partial
             thromboplastin time (PTT) to be eligible.

         11. Subject who has received factor Xa inhibitor therapy (e.g. dabigatran) within the
             past 24 hours must have a normal ecarin clotting time to be eligible.  Subject who
             has received factor Xa inhibitor therapy more than 24 hours ago but less than 48
             hours ago must have a normal partial thromboplastin time (PTT) to be eligible.

             aneurysm, or arteriovenous malformation.

         17. Clinical presentation suggests a subarachnoid hemorrhage, even if initial CT or MRI

         19. Presumed pericarditis including pericarditis after acute myocardial infarction.

         25. Cerebral vasculitis.

         26. Subject with a pre-existing neurological or psychiatric disease that would confound
             the neurological and functional evaluations.

        Imaging Exclusion Criteria:

             the middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory (or in other territories, &gt;100 cc of
             tissue) on presentation.

          3. CT or MRI evidence of mass effect or intra-cranial tumor (except small meningioma).

          4. Core Infarct and hypoperfusion:

               -  MRI- or CT-assessed core infarct lesion greater than 50 cc;

               -  Severe hypoperfusion lesion (10 sec or more Tmax lesion larger than 100 cc)

               -  Ischemic penumbra &lt; 15 cc and mismatch ratio ≤1.8.
