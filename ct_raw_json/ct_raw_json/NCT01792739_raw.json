However, antibiotics-associated diarrhea is another matter of concern. Many\n      previous studies were proved that the use of probiotic lactobacillus preparation can reduce\n      antibiotics-associated diarrhea in ward-admitted patients. In this study, we are planning to\n      perform a similar study in severely ill patients in ICU."
