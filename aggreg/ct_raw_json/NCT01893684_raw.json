            "textblock": "The prevalence of obesity continues to increase at an alarming rate for all sectors of the\n      population in the US. Obesity in the older adult cohort is of great concern as it is\n      associated with reductions in mobility, declines in physical performance and increased risk\n      for physical disability. With regard to body composition, a) fat mass has been determined to\n      be a stronger predictor of mobility limitations than low muscle mass in older individuals\n      and alternatively, b) leg lean mass has also been cited as a primary determinant of lower\n      extremity physical function.\n\n      Obesity is related to increased levels of fatigue and lack of motivation and mental energy.\n      Fatigue can be categorized as both a subjective perception and a performance decrement.\n      Fatigue can be defined as a perceived lack of physical or mental energy while fatigability\n      is another construct categorized by the degree of fatigue associated with activity in any\n      dimension (i.e. physical, mental, emotional, and/or social).\n\n      The impact of a higher protein diet on muscle quality, muscle fatigability, perceptions of\n      fatigue and systemic inflammation in older adults has not been well documented. The utility\n      of a higher protein weight loss diet combined with resistance exercise training to augment\n      fat mass loss, attenuate lean mass loss and improve muscle quality and physical function\n      could potentially be of high value to overweight older women. The potential further benefits\n      of this regimen to enhance mental energy and other aspects of psycho-social well-being are\n      unknown.\n\n      The aims of the present study include assessing the effects of the proposed diet and\n      exercise intervention on 1) body composition, 2) strength and muscle quality, and 3) energy\n      and fatigue symptoms."

With the training occurring 3 times per week generally in the morning, this means that if a person exercises on a Monday, their draw will occur on Wednesday prior to that exercise session. This timing also has maximal translational value in that it provides a \"snap shot\" of our lifestyle intervention. Participants will be queried regarding any acute illnesses during the 48-hours prior to the blood draw and again one week following this laboratory visit to ensure inflammatory status was not falsely elevated.",
