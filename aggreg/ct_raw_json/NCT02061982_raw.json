            "textblock": "There is increasing interest in the general public in measuring health parameters at home,\n      instead of in a medical setting. Many tests for measuring health parameters are commonly\n      available in drug stores as well as online. When structured, this trend may also be used for\n      performing a randomized intervention trial.\n\n      The current study is aimed to evaluate the procedure of performing a non invasive\n      intervention study by subjects themselves performing the tests at home.\n\n      The study is designed as a randomized, placebo-controlled, double blind, crossover study.\n\n      Subjects have to consume a cup of coffee after an overnight fast. Coffee will be prepared\n      from instant coffee containing either regular coffee or decaff coffee. Each intervention\n      will be given twice.\n\n      Effects on alertness and attention will be established by three computerized tests provided\n      by Quantified Mind. The tests will be performed by the subjects at t=0 (baseline, prior to\n      coffee consumption) and t=1h, one hour after coffee consumption, in one go. Each test will\n      be performed during 5 minutes. During the training session the participants will be\n      instructed to get acquainted with the task.\n\n      The evaluation of the study concerns the effect of caffeine in the at home setting versus\n      published results, as well as reproducibility of the results."
