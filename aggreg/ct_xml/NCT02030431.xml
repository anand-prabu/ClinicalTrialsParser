        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult men or women (see age specifications below) with subcapital femoral neck
             fractures (stable or unstable) confirmed with anteroposterior and lateral hip
             radiographs, computed tomography, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

          -  Patients between 50 and 69 years of age with any Garden type femoral neck fracture

          -  Patients older than 70 years of age with femoral neck fractures Garden type I and II

          -  Patients older than 70 years of age with a femoral neck fracture Garden types III and
             IV and contraindication to hemiarthroplasty.

          -  Operative treatment within 4 days (i.e., 72 hours) of presenting to the emergency
             room.

          -  Patient was ambulatory prior to fracture, though they may have used an aid such as a
             cane or a walker.

          -  Anticipated medical optimalization of the patient for operative fixation of the hip.

          -  Provision of informed consent by patient or proxy.

          -  Low energy fracture (defined as a fall from standing height).

          -  No other major trauma.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Associated major injuries of the lower extremity (i.e., ipsilateral or contralateral
             fractures of the foot, ankle, tibia, fibula, knee, or femur; dislocations of the
             ankle, knee, or hip; or femoral head defects or fracture).

          -  Retained hardware around the affected hip.

          -  Abnormal opposite hip making end-point evaluation impossible

          -  Infection around the hip (i.e., soft tissue or bone).

          -  Patients with disorders of bone metabolism other than osteoporosis (i.e., Paget's
             disease, renal osteodystrophy).

          -  Moderate or severe cognitively impaired patients (i.e., Six Item Screener with three
             or more errors).

          -  Patients with Parkinson's disease (or dementia or other neurological deficit) severe
             enough to increase the likelihood of falling or severe enough to compromise
             rehabilitation.

          -  Likely problems, in the judgment of the investigators, with maintaining follow-up. We
             will, for example, exclude patients with no fixed address, those who report a plan to
             move out of town in the next year, or intellectually challenged patients without
             adequate family support.
