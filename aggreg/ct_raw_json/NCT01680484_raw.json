However, fetal activity is considered as the main determinant. Any\n      factor decreasing fetal activity causes a decrease in FHR variability. Fetal activity may be\n      stimulated by manual manipulation, sound, light, change in maternal position and maternal\n      ingestion of glucose. Among those, ingestion of any kind of food or juice is most frequently\n      practiced in outpatient settings. This is not only medical but also a social routine. In\n      this study the investigators have chosen the two most popular so-called 'fetal\n      accelerators', chocolate and orange juice against no intervention and tried to find any\n      usefulness of these on non-reactive NST patterns."
