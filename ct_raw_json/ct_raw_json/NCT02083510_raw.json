We envision colchicine as playing a role in identifying and elucidating a\n      new mechanism for lowering TG levels, which may have a great impact on targeting patients\n      who have not met non-HDL goals according to Adult Treatment Panel III (ATPIII guidelines) or\n      at risk for hypertriglyceridemia-induced pancreatitis [11].  We will accomplish this by\n      conducting a prospective cohort clinical trial of low-dose colchicine in\n      hypertriglyceridemic patients to assess percent (%) reduction of apoCIII, VLDL, and TG.\n      Secondary endpoints will be to observe the effects of colchicine on apoA, apoB, HDL,\n      low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and total cholesterol (TC)."
