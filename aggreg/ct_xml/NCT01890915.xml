  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The deleterious effects of hyperthermia are well appreciated in able-bodied persons.
      However, the consequences of impaired regulation of normal body temperature on cognitive
      performance of persons with tetraplegia is not known. This study will provide the
      preliminary findings necessary for future work to design and explore physical and medical
      interventions to improve temperature regulation in those with tetraplegia with the goal of
      improved clinical care, health, and quality of life.

      The proposed study consists of 1 visit during which 20 subjects (10 with tetraplegia, 10
      controls) will be exposed to 81°F for 40 minutes and then 95° F for up to 2 hours.
      Physiological as well as psychological processes will be monitored in all subjects during
      the study for safety and to determine differences in responses to exposure to hot ambient
      temperatures

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After a cervical spinal cord injury (SCI) the motor, sensory and autonomic deficits cause,
      among other detriments, a blunted ability to maintain a constant core temperature. Impaired
      thermoregulation leaves persons with tetraplegia more susceptible to hyperthermia than
      able-bodied persons (AB). There has been a paucity of work addressing the thermoregulatory
      responses of persons with SCI to hot ambient temperatures, and even less study addressing
      the effect of these temperatures on cognitive performance. The goals of this pilot study
      are: to improve our understanding of the thermoregulatory mechanisms of individuals with
      tetraplegia when exposed to heat and to determine the effect of impaired thermoregulatory
      mechanisms on cognitive performance during exposure to 35°C for up to 2 hours. In order to
      address our goals we have designed a study methodology which consists of comparing the
      physiological and psychological responses of the two study groups (tetraplegia versus AB
      controls) from thermoneutral (27°C) to hot (35°C) environments.
