Secondly, from the prospective of\n      induced differentiation, the investigators want to verify whether ATRA is a potential\n      curative agent for RITP. Thirdly, the investigators are trying to explore the possible\n      pathogenesis of RITP and the mechanism of ATRA in curing RITP."

            "textblock": "Refractory immune thrombocytopenia (RITP) is a severe bleeding disorder with a high\n      mortality rate of 10% to 30%, which is resulted from the toxicities associated with\n      therapies, as well as from life-threatening bleedings. Up to now, treatments for RITP\n      patients are still limited and no consensus has been reached about the standard treatment\n      protocol, therefore, it remains a great problem and challenge for hematologists to think out\n      ways to treat RITP, that is to say, new therapies should be explored to maintain a\n      relatively stable and safe platelet counts with minimum toxicities, so as to improve\n      patients' quality of life and reduce mortalities related to severe bleedings and therapies.\n\n      Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an autoimmune disorder ascribed not only to increased\n      platelet (PLT) destruction, but also to reduced PLT production, which is appears to be\n      related to impaired megakaryocyte maturation. All-trance retinoid acid (ATRA) belongs to a\n      class of retinoids, which exerts immunomodulatory and differentiation inducing capacities,\n      and has been studied in clinical trails about autoimmune disease and has been successfully\n      applied in clinic to cure APL by inducing the differentiation of cancer cells.\n\n      In this study, the investigators retrospectively reviewed the medical chart of 35 RITP\n      patients who take ATRA as part of the combination therapy and have been regularly visiting\n      professor Zhang's clinic, a professional clinic of bleeding and coagulation disorders from\n      February 2008 to August 2012. The investigators made phone calls for some other detailed\n      medically relevant information not recorded, including previous ITP history, bleeding\n      episodes and etc."
