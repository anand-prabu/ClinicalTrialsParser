    <textblock>
      Nicotine dependence may prolong the exposure to toxic substances that cause various
      diseases. The Central Nervous System (CNS) is consisted by a large amount of Polyunsaturated
      Fatty Acids (PUFAS) from omega-3 serie. Omega-3 takes part in several actions, including the
      modulation of dopaminergic neurotransmission. In its deficiency is detected a
      hypofunctioning of the mesolimbic and mesocortical pathway, related to the reward system,
      involved on the context of nicotine dependence. Treatment using dietary supplementation with
      omega-3 shows improvements in several diseases, including mood disorders such as anxiety and
      depression. The investigators hypothesis is that supplementation with these fatty acids can
      restore the levels of omega-3 and could decrease nicotine dependence. The investigators
      objective is to investigate a possible association between increased serum levels of omega-3
      and the reduction in nicotine dependence.

      Introduction: A cigarette has more than 6,000 toxic substances that can cause various
      diseases. Nicotine dependence may prolong the exposure to these toxic substances. The
      Central Nervous System (CNS) is consisted by a large amount of Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids
      (PUFAS) from omega-3 serie. Omega-3 takes part in several actions, including the modulation
      of dopaminergic neurotransmission. In its deficiency is detected a hypofunctioning of the
      mesolimbic and mesocortical pathway, related to the reward system, involved on the context
      of nicotine dependence. Treatment using dietary supplementation with omega-3 shows
      improvements in several diseases, including mood disorders such as anxiety and depression.
      The investigators hypothesis is that supplementation with these fatty acids can restore the
      levels of omega-3 and could decrease nicotine dependence. Objective: Investigate a possible
      association between increased serum levels of omega-3 and the reduction in nicotine
      dependence. Material and Methods: In the clinical study, placebo controlled, double-blind,
      parallel, randomized, will be administered to 60 volunteers: placebo or fish oil for 90
      days. Psychometric assessments will be carried out, measurements of serum levels of PUFAS,
      levels of carbon monoxide (CO) and cotinine in plasma will be done for monitoring the
      clinical course. Data Analysis: Repeated measures (ANOVA) for the dependent variables
      (dependency, anxiety, depression, motivation, compulsion, dosage of PUFAS, exhaled CO and
      cotinine) and independent (groups and time) to check for significant differences. If so, a
      second ANOVA with covariates will be conducted. Significance is p &lt;0.05 in all analyzes.
