    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn whether it is better to receive the drug Metformin
      with standard of care for lung cancer or just standard of care.

      Patients will be identified and enrolled from Thoracic Surgical Clinics. A preoperative
      bronchoscopy will be performed to obtain systematic bronchial biopsies from defined proximal
      airway sites. Patients will then undergo surgical resection and tumor tissue and normal lung
      specimens collected. For patients with bronchial dysplasia postoperatively, starting less
      than 6 months from the time of surgery, patients will be randomized to receive either 850 mg
      po BID of metformin or observation. Metformin dosing will include a 4 week ramp up of 850 mg
      po daily prior to starting the BID dose. Adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy will be
      applied at the discretion of treating physicians.  Patients found to have bronchial
      dysplasia at the time of bronchoscopy will undergo follow up bronchoscopy and tissue
      sampling at 6 months follow up.
