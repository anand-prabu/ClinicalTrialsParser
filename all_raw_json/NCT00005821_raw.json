Dynamic imaging using a gamma camera is performed for\n      20 minutes postinjection and static images are obtained for up to 3 hours postinjection.\n\n      Surgery is performed within 24 hours of lymphoscintigraphy. Patients are injected with\n      patent blue V dye near the tumor and a gamma detection probe is used to measure radioactive\n      counts in the sentinel node. Surgery begins within 5 minutes of the patent blue V dye\n      injection.\n\n      All lymph nodes that stain blue or have a high radioactive count are removed. The primary\n      breast lump is removed by either wide local excision or mastectomy and the axilla are\n      cleared by standard axillary dissection.\n\n      Some patients may only receive patent blue V dye injected as a pilot study. Sentinel lymph\n      node biopsy and axillary dissection proceed as above.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 150 patients (75 per stratum) will be accrued for the main\n      study plus another 50 patients for the pilot study."
