The knowledge gained in this proposed research will\n      identify a specific premotor area to be targeted with rTMS that is expected to result in a\n      novel intervention that could enhance or replace current treatments for CD. rTMS could be\n      included as an adjunct treatment to botulinum toxin that could sustain treatment effect and\n      decrease the frequency of re-injection, potentially resulting in cost savings without a\n      decrease in symptom control. In addition to medical cost reduction, improved quality of life\n      could be expected with the successful development of therapies that extend dystonia symptom\n      control. rTMs has been FDA-approved for the treatment of depression and our proposal uses an\n      even lower stimulation rate, suggesting continued use within clearly safe parameters.\n      Successful completion of this research could lead to rapid adoption of this therapeutic\n      modality.\n\n      We will test the hypothesis that rTMS of a distinct premotor site will provide more\n      effective treatment of CD than non-specific activation of the entire premotor region.  This\n      will be done by performing a randomized, observer-blinded exploratory pilot study to\n      determine the optimal site of rTMS over various sites of the premotor and motor cortex to\n      improve the symptoms of cervical dystonia.  Completion of this aim should lead to\n      development of targeted TMS therapy for CD."
