Sometimes after severe injuries requiring operation, surgeons cannot\n      close the muscles and skin of a patient's belly, because of swelling. This study will also\n      try to find if direct peritoneal resuscitation decreases tissue swelling and allows for\n      quicker closure of of a patient's belly."

The\n      drain will be used to drip a high glucose solution into the abdomen in patients be part of\n      that group.
