It is known that inflammation\n      induces melanogenesis. Therefore, it is important to analyze the inflammatory\n      characteristics of this pigmentary disorder since it could be linked to its recurrent\n      nature. The objective is to evaluate the characteristics of the inflammatory cellular\n      infiltrate and the expression of IL1 alpha in melasma compared to unaffected skin.\n\n      At least 30 women with melasma, phototype III-V, aged 18-50 years will be included.\n      Volunteers will be evaluated by means of histological, histochemical, immunohistochemistry\n      analysis, immunoassay, quantitative real-time PCR, as well as colorimetry, clinically (MASI\n      scale) and by photography control."

            "textblock": "Melasma is a frequent pigmentary disorder among latin-american women. Its etiology is not\n      completely elucidated; however, there is evidence of a melanogenic paracrine cytokine\n      network between the melanocyte and other skin cells, including keratinocytes, fibroblasts,\n      vascular and inflammatory cells, which regulate melanocyte function.\n\n      Previous reports in melasma skin have described increased mast cell infiltration in\n      elastotic areas, presence of a moderate lymphohistiocytic infiltrate, increased vascularity\n      and up-regulation of proangiogenic factors. This histological evidence of skin inflammation\n      is also supported clinically by colorimetry and thermography, and by the improvement of\n      pigmentation with topical anti-inflammatories.\n\n      The exact role that  inflammatory cells plays in melasma, particularly mast cells, is\n      unknown. It has also poor elucidated the activation mechanisms of this inflammatory cascade\n      and its chronic nature. Previous studies suggest that interleukin 1 alpha might play a key\n      role. This proinflammatory cytokine, released by damaged UVB-exposed keratinocytes\n      stimulates autocrine secretion of  multiple melanogenic cytokines which in turn leads to the\n      activation of inflammatory skin cells, perpetuating the inflammatory micro-environment,\n      responsible of fibroblasts premature senescence, solar elastosis and pigmentation.\n\n      The objective of our study is to evaluate the characteristics of the inflammatory cellular\n      infiltrate and the expression of IL1 alpha and its receptor  in melasma through\n      histochemistry, immunohistochemistry, immunoassay, and quantitative real-time PCR.\n\n      The study population will include 30 women with melasma, phototype III-V, aged 18-50 years.\n      Informed consent will be obtained from the patients, under approval by the local ethical\n      committee. Volunteers will be evaluated through skin biopsies, colorimetry, clinical\n      assessment(MASI scale)and photographic control."
