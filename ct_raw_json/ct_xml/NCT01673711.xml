    <textblock>
      This clinical trial studies deuterated phenanthrene tetraol in smokers who are at high risk
      for lung cancer. Studying samples of urine in the laboratory from smokers who are at high
      risk for lung cancer may help doctors learn more about biomarkers related to cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the relationship between urinary deuterated ([D10]) phenanthrene tetraol
      (PheT) level, PheT:phenanthrols (HOPhe) ratio, and the presence of bronchoepithelial
      metaplasia and/or dysplasia in smokers who have undergone screening bronchoscopy at Roswell
      Park Cancer Institute (RPCI).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive deuterated phenanthrene tetraol orally (PO). Urine samples are collected
      for laboratory studies for 6 hours after dosing.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Enrolled in the High Risk Lung Cancer (HRLC) Screening Program

          -  Eligible for bronchoscopy or have undergone screening bronchoscopy in the past

          -  Current smoker of at least 10 cigarettes daily

          -  Able to provide written consent indicating an understanding of the investigational
             nature of the study

          -  Willing to take [D10]phenanthrene in water with 20% ethanol

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous aerodigestive tract cancer

          -  Currently attempting to cut down or quit smoking

          -  Major medical co-morbidities, for example, renal dysfunction, heart failure, and
             diabetes, to be adjudicated by study physicians

          -  Pregnant women, women intending to become pregnant, or women who are breastfeeding

          -  Former or recovering alcoholics

          -  Those needing to take medications such as metronidazole, chlorpromazine, Antabuse or
             benzodiazepines within 7 days of the deuterated phenanthrene dosing, as they could
             potentially interact with ethanol; ineligibility based on use of other medications is
             at the discretion of the study physicians
