  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We propose a phase II study to determine the impact of maintenance therapy with
      5-azacytidine and GM-CSF in patients with poor-risk AML or MDS, who are in remission after
      definitive treatment with either stem cell transplant or cytarabine-based consolidation
      chemotherapy.

      In order to precede relapse and to avoid lead time bias, treatment would need to commence
      within 185 days of definitive therapy. Furthermore, approximately 50% of relapses occur
      within the first year and up to 80% within two years after SCT, therefore we would limit the
      duration of maintenance therapy to one year, followed by two years of follow-up.
