  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Overweight/obesity is associated with sub-fertility. The investigators will assess if
      regular exercise training prior to assisted fertilization will improve pregnancy rate in
      overweight/obese women referred to assisted fertilization. It is expected that training will
      be successful in increasing pregnancy rate

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is associated with several diseases, as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and
      some types of cancer, this is of great concern for the public health. Also, of more
      immediate importance for these women; obesity is associated with increased risks of
      sub-fertility. The overall aim of the current project is to expand the knowledge about
      effective interventions to prevent the increasing prevalence of obesity-associated
      sub-fertility in population.

      One cause of the increased referral rate for in-vitro fertilization is the growing
      prevalence of overweight and obesity. Currently, about 700 couples are annually referred for
      in-vitro fertilization at St.Olav's Hospital. In this interdisciplinary trial, involving
      physiotherapists, exercise physiologists, gynecologists, and basic researchers, the effects
      of regular high intensity exercise training on fertility in sub-fertile overweight and obese
      women will be investigated.
