  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study concerns women diagnosed with postpartum hemorrhage and requiring sulprostone
      therapy.  Included patients are randomized to two arms: the &quot;Sulprostone + Bakri balloon&quot;
      arm versus the &quot;Sulprostone alone&quot; arm.

      The main objective of this study is to compare the efficiency of a care strategy  including
      the Bakri balloon to that of routine care without the Bakri balloon via a cost-consequence
      study juxtaposing costs and the necessity of invasive procedures (arterial embolization,
      ligation of arteries, hysterectomy, intrauterine sutures) for controlling postpartum
      hemorrhage.
