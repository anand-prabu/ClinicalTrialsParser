In this study, the investigators examined the vaccination effects produced\n      by CSC-enriched populations from histologically distinct murine tumors after their\n      inoculation into different syngeneic immunocompetent hosts. Enriched CSCs were immunogenic\n      and more effective as an antigen source than unselected tumor cells in inducing protective\n      antitumor immunity.Immune sera from CSC-vaccinated hosts contained high levels of IgG which\n      bound to CSCs, resulting in CSC lysis in the presence of complement.CTLs generated from\n      peripheral blood mononuclear cells or splenocytes harvested from CSC-vaccinated hosts were\n      capable of killing CSCs in vitro. Mechanistic investigations established that CSC-primed\n      antibodies and T cells were capable of selective targeting CSCs and conferring antitumor\n      immunity."

Patients receiving any other\n        investigational agents. 4. Patients with known brain metastases will be excluded because\n        of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurological\n        dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurological and other adverse effects.\n\n        5. Uncontrolled concurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active\n        infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac\n        arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situation that would limit compliance with study\n        requirements.\n\n        6.
