Premature infants are routinely given caffeine, a respiratory stimulant, on the\n      first day of life to prevent apneas. However, if they continue to have apneas, they may\n      require a breathing tube to be placed in the trachea.  There are risks to having a breathing\n      tube, so it would be beneficial to avoid it if possible. If caffeine is given earlier, it\n      may decrease the need for a breathing tube. Some studies also suggest that caffeine may also\n      improve heart function which may prevent low blood pressure if given early."

Secondary aims include detailing\n      the acute hemodynamic effects of caffeine and comparing the hemodynamic effects of receiving\n      caffeine .
