          3. Histological confirmation of intermediate or high grade soft-tissue sarcoma. Tissue
             must be sent to a central pathology lab for review but will not preclude entry onto
             the study. Final assignment of tumor grade and histology will be based on the
             designation provided by the central pathology review.

          4. An adequate tumor specimen obtained by either excisional biopsy, incisional biopsy or
             core needle biopsy must be sent to the central pathology lab for evaluation. The
             material must measure at least 0.8 × 0.1 cm in size or contain at least 50 tumor
             cells.

          5. Locally advanced, unresectable, and/or metastatic soft-tissue sarcoma of intermediate
             or high grade with evidence of disease progression by either computed tomography (CT)
             or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, or clinical judgment on or after the last
             cancer therapy within 6 months prior to randomization.

          6. Relapsed or refractory (lack of response) to ≥1 course of systemic therapy
             regimen(s), excluding adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and is incurable by
             either surgery or radiation.

          7. Capable of providing informed consent and complying with trial procedures.

          8. ECOG PS 0-2.

             surgically sterile, or practicing adequate birth control methods) for the duration of
             the study. (Adequate contraception includes: oral contraception, implanted
             contraception, intrauterine device implanted for at least 3 months, or barrier method

             the last menstrual period of the female partner during the study treatment and agree
             to continue use for 6 months after the final dose of study treatment.
