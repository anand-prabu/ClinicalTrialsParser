It was approved in China in 1995 and\n      has become the most popular anti-cancer drug in China.  In June of 2001, the Phase I study\n      of KLT commenced at the Huntsman Cancer Institute in Salt Lake City, Utah, with the\n      objectives of 1) To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the safety profile of KLT\n      in patients with refractory solid tumors; 2) To determine the pharmacokinetics of KLT in\n      patients with refractory solid tumors; and 3) To gather preliminary efficacy data.  The\n      method of testing is open-label, sequential cohort, dose-escalation study."
