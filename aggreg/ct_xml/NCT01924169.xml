    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if lenalidomide can increase the level
      of immunoglobulins (parts of the blood that may help to improve the immune system's
      function) and/or will improve the protective effect of the flu (influenza) and pneumonia
      vaccines in patients with CLL.

      Study Drug Administration:

      If patient is found to be eligible to take part in this study, they will take lenalidomide
      by mouth on Monday, Wednesday and Friday for 3 months.

      Depending on how patient responds to the drug, after 3 months, they will either:

      -Patient takes lenalidomide every Monday, Wednesday and Friday on a 3 months on/3 months off
      schedule. Patient will then repeat this process for up to 2 years.

      or -Take lenalidomide every day for an extra 3 months. If patient responds well, they will
      take lenalidomide every day for 3 months, then for the next 3 months stop the drug. Patient
      will then repeat this process for up to 2 years.

      Patient should swallow the lenalidomide capsules whole with water.  Do not open, crush, or
      break the lenalidomide capsules.  If patient touches a broken lenalidomide capsule, they
      should wash that area of the body with soap and water.

      If patient misses a dose of lenalidomide, and it has been less than 12 hours since their
      regular dose time, they should take it as soon as they remember. If it has been more than 12
      hours, patient should just skip their missed dose. Patient should not take 2 doses at the
      same time.  If patient takes too much lenalidomide or overdose, healthcare provider should
      be called right away.  If patient vomits after any dose, they should not take another dose.

      Patient will also receive a vaccine for the flu (Trivalent or Fluzone) 1 time a year. If
      patient has not received one in the last 5 years, they will receive a vaccine for pneumonia
      (Pneumovax) between months 6 and 21. Patient will receive these vaccines as an injection
      under the skin.

      Study Visits:

      Before the first dose of study drug:

      -Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn to test cytokines (proteins that may affect the
      immune system) and to test patient's immune system.

      If patient is able to become pregnant, 1 time a week for the first 4 weeks and then every 28
      days while on treatment, they will have a blood (about 1 teaspoon) or urine pregnancy test.

      While patient is taking lenalidomide, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for routine
      tests every 2-4 weeks.

      At 3 months (+/- 3 weeks):

        -  Patient will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for routine tests.

      Before the flu vaccine, blood (about 1 teaspoons) will be drawn for antibody testing.
      Antibodies are created by the immune system and may attack foreign cells or substances, such
      as the study drug.

      At 4 weeks (+/- 2 weeks) and 3 months (+/- 3 weeks) after the vaccine, blood (about  2
      teaspoons) will be drawn for antibody testing, cytokine testing, and to test patient's
      immune system.

      Length of Study:

      Patient will take the study drug for up to 2 years. Patient will no longer be able to take
      the study drug if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if they are
      unable to follow study directions.

      Patient's participation on the study will be over after the follow-up visits.

      End of Study:

      Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for antibody testing and cytokine testing.

      This is an investigational study.   Lenalidomide is FDA approved and commercially available
      for the treatment of multiple myeloma, myelodysplastic syndrome and mantle cell lymphoma.
      The use of this to help prevent infections by improving immunoglobulin levels and its use in
      combination with the flu and pneumonia vaccine is investigational.

      Up to 35 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.
