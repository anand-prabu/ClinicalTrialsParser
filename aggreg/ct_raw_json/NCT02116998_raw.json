Each subject will\n      receive up to 3 doses at 4 week intervals.\n\n      Following the third dose, subjects will be inoculated intranasally with S. pneumoniae\n      serotype 6B.  Nasal washes to identify S. pneumoniae colonization will be obtained\n      pre-inoculation, and then 2, 7 and 14 days after inoculation.\n\n      Subjects will also be monitored for safety and tolerability throughout the dosing  period,\n      and then for 12 months after their last dose.\n\n      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of GEN-003 in reducing\n      colonization rates and magnitude of colonization following the S. pneumoniae challenge."
