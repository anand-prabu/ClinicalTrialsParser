The main advantage of coflex\u00ae might be a faster recovery\n      after surgery, but after long term follow-up it is unknown if this treatment effect remains.\n      Therefore in addition, it will be investigated whether surgical intervention with coflex\u00ae is\n      more effective than surgical decompression on short-term follow-up (8 weeks to 6 months) and\n      whether surgical intervention with coflex\u00ae is more cost-effective after 12 months than\n      surgical decompression."
