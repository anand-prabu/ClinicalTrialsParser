            "textblock": "Advanced lung cancer remains an incurable disease although new agents and new treatment\n      strategies have resulted in improved survival outcomes for patients.  Most recently there\n      has been interest in augmenting tumor response to chemotherapy by the addition of drugs\n      which inhibit tumor cell growth and proliferation.  Everolimus is a new cancer drug which\n      works as an inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin (or mTOR), mTOR is a protein that is\n      part of a signaling pathway which can cause cancer cells to divide.  Everolimus when used\n      alone as a single agent has produced some response as well as prolonged stable disease in\n      both chemo-na\u00efve and pre-treated non-small cell lung cancer.  The goal of this study is to\n      evaluate the safety of everolimus with combined other cancer drugs called pemetrexed,\n      carboplatin, and bevacizumab.  Pemetrexed and carboplatin are both chemotherapy drugs and\n      bevacizumab inhibits the growth of new blood vessels.\n\n      Patients will be entered onto dosing cohorts of 3 patients according to the following dose\n      escalation scheme. The first cohort will begin at dose level 1. At least three patients on\n      each dose level must have completed cycle one before the study leadership (principal\n      investigators, study statisticians) will allow patients to be enrolled onto the successive\n      dose level.\n\n      Dose Levels: 1, 2, 3\n\n      Pemetrexed (mg/m\u00b2): 500, 500, 500\n\n      Carboplatin (AUC): 5, 6, 6\n\n      Bevacizumab (mg/kg): 15, 15, 15\n\n      Everolimus (mg/day): 2.5, 2.5, 5.0\n\n      The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose, or MTD, for the\n      combination of everolimus with pemetrexed, carboplatin, and bevacizumab in patients with\n      Stage IV non-squamous, non small cell lung cancer."
