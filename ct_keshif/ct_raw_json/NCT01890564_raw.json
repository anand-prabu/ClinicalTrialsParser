Although effective in facilitating the procedure, there are respiratory\n      consequences of the pneumoperitoneum, which significantly increases intra-abdominal pressure\n      (IAP) up to 20 cmH2O. The increased IAP can decrease functional residual capacity and\n      increase closing capacity resulting in increased resistance, decreased compliance, and\n      increased ventilation-perfusion mismatch. In a randomized, cross-over design, this study\n      will evaluate in sequential order, 3 modes of ventilation during laparoscopic bariatric\n      surgery to determine which is better able to support oxygenation and ventilation while\n      limiting the peak inflating pressure (PIP)."
