        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy adults, 18 to 55 years of age.

          -  Male volunteers must use effective contraception as outlined in the protocol.

          -  Willingness to abstain from alcohol and xanthine-containing beverages or food
             (coffee, tea, cola, chocolate and &quot;energy drinks&quot;) from 72 hours prior to the first
             dose until discharged.

          -  Willingness to avoid prolonged sun exposure and guard against sunburn during study &amp;
             follow-up.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinically significant medical history or findings in physical examination, vital
             signs, or laboratory test results prior to study start.

          -  Positive screening tests for hepatitis B or C, HIV, alcohol, drugs of abuse, or
             tobacco.

          -  Women of childbearing potential, or males with pregnant or lactating partners.

          -  Regular smoking within 6 months prior to first dosing. Subjects should avoid smoky
             environments for at least 1 week prior to each cotinine screen.

          -  Excessive alcohol consumption.

          -  Use of any metabolic inducers (including herbals such as St. John's Wort) within 4
             weeks or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) before the first dose of study
             medication, including but not limited to: rifampin, rifabutin, glucocorticoids,
             carbamazepine, phenytoin and phenobarbital.

          -  Strenuous activity, sunbathing, or contact sports are not allowed from 4 days prior
             to entry into the clinical site until study follow-up.

          -  Participation in an investigational drug or device study within 45 days (or 6 months
             for biologic therapies) prior to first dosing.
