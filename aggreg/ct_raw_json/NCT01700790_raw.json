Potential subjects will be referred from the\n      surrounding communities to Laboratorio de Pesquisa Clinica em Micobacterioses(LAPCLINTB)\n\n      Visit 1: After enrollment the subject will have a baseline rifampin PK will be done. They\n      will then be started on lopinavir/ritonavir containing HAART regimen with standard twice\n      daily dosing. Ritonavir 100 mg capsules will be added to the regimen and  the dose escalated\n      until the patient is taking 3 capsules twice daily. The time between enrollment and visit 1\n      will be determined by the treating physician\n\n      Visit 2: They will return about 1 week after dose escalation has been completed to sample\n      lopinavir concentrations.\n\n      Visit 3: Subject will return in 2 weeks to have repeat to review results of lopinavir\n      concentrations and response to therapy. Ritonavir will be adjusted as needed.\n\n      Visit 4: Subject will then return in 4 weeks for last visit for evaluation. Lopinavir and\n      rifampin PK will be done."
