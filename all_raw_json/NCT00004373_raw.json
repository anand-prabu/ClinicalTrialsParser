Determine whether the benzodiazepine alprazolam reinforces self-medication\n      behavior in anxious patients with varying histories of using other drugs.\n\n      II.  Establish outpatient methods for the study of self-medication and drug reinforcement in\n      patients vulnerable to prescription drug abuse or dependence.\n\n      III.  Evaluate the influence of alcohol and other non-prescription drug use as determinants\n      of vulnerability in these patients.\n\n      IV.  Identify personality, attitudinal, or other variables that might predict different\n      patterns of self-medication.\n\n      V.  Assess the effects of cognitive-behavioral therapy on alprazolam self-medication."
