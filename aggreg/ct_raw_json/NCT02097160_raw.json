Subjects\n      will be recruited from the general population in the greater Montreal area.  The study will\n      be conducted at the Mary Emily Clinical Nutrition Research Unit of McGill University.\n      Children will be required to attend two study visits.  Some information will be collected\n      through monthly telephone survey to the parents. The investigators will add vitamin D to\n      cheese and yogurt for daily consumption at home over a three month period.  All products\n      will be provided to the parents in the form of coded containers that do not contain any\n      labels aside from the group and expiration date.  Ingredient lists will be provided upon\n      consenting to the study. To better understand vitamin D status; dietary intake, hematology,\n      serum biochemistry including 25(OH)D, growth, and body composition will be measured at the\n      beginning and end of the three month study period.  In addition, bone mass at baseline will\n      be assessed.  Sun exposure will be documented and a skin pigmentation test will be used to\n      more objectively assess chronic sun exposure.  The investigators will also investigate the\n      association between vitamin D intake and status with immune function."
