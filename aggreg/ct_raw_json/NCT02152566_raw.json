This sleep study may be completed in the sleep laboratory (attended\n      polysomnography, PSG) or in-home (in-home polygraphy, PG). If they are diagnosed with\n      respiratory insufficiencies, they will be asked to attend further overnight studies to see\n      if treatment with nasal high flow therapy can be used to stabilize breathing."
