  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate safety of Targeted Lung Denervation (or TLD) in
      patients suffering from moderate to severe COPD.  It is hypothesized that TLD will have a
      similar safety profile and improved physiological and functional outcomes to a sham-control.

      A prospective, sequential two phase multicenter, randomized double-blind, safety, &amp;
      feasibility study, with unblinding in Phase B at 6 months.  The goal of Phase A will be to
      compare two energy doses and select the optimal energy dose to be utilized in Phase B.  The
      goal of Phase B is to compare the optimal energy dose to a sham control.  All subjects will
      be followed for a minimum of 3 years.
