  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Smoking prevalence is over 83% in methadone-maintained patients. These patients experience
      significant difficulty quitting, and there is evidence that a majority of
      methadone-maintained patients smoke most of their cigarettes in the 4 hours following
      methadone dosing. The objective is to provide a preliminary test of the ability of two
      pharmacological treatments, the nicotine nasal spray and varenicline, relative to  placebos,
      to reduce smoking during the 4 hours following methadone dosing.

    <description>Subjects will be given a special electronic cigarette pack called SmokeSignals (copyrighted and manufactured by LIFETECHniques in Santa Barbara, CA).The electronic pack will hold a regular pack of cigarettes and will be able to record each time the pack opens and a cigarette is dispensed. Data will be sent to a password protected website at each study visit. This will measure how many cigarettes are smoked and when.</description>

          4. have a positive urine drug screen for anything other than opioids

          5. have a medical condition that, in the judgment of the study physician, would make

          7. have taken an investigational drug within 30 days before consent

          8. be taking concomitant medications that are contraindicated for use with the NNS or
             varenicline

             cessation (such as wellbutrin or nortriptyline)

         10. have a known or suspected hypersensitivity to varenicline or the NNS

         11. use/have used smoking-cessation counseling programs or medication treatments
             currently, or within 30 days before consent

         12. have used electronic cigarettes or tobacco products, other than cigarettes, in the
             week before consent

         13. be pregnant or breastfeeding
