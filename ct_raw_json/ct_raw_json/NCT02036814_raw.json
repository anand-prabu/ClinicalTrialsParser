Methods: 21 treated patients were randomized into two groups: Group A\n      10 patients (8 women),  underwent to a health educational orientation program\n      (inter-relational strategy), with group meetings every 15 days during 4 months(8 meetings).\n      Group B 11 patients (7 women),  who underwent group orientation by the nurse every 40 days\n      during 4 months (3 meetings). Both groups received the same content guidelines (healthy\n      lifestyle and prevention of risk factors). The patients had 2 visits by nurses at baseline\n      (15 days) and at the final study (120 days). BP was measured by auscultatory method and QoL\n      questionnaire (WHOQoL-Brief)was applied. The dispensing and pill counts were done every 30\n      days. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) was performed at baseline and after 120\n      days."
