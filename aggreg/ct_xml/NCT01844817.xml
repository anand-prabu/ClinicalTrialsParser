             hours prior to start of randomization.

          6. Fertile male patients willing to use adequate contraceptive measures.

          7. Adequate bone marrow function:

               -  platelet count ≥ 100,000/uL

               -  hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL

          8. Adequate hepatic function:

               -  Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 X ULN

               -  Aspartate amino transferase (AST) (SGOT) ≤ 3.0 X ULN

               -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (SGPT) ≤ 3.0 X ULN

          9. Adequate renal function (defined as serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 X ULN)

         10. Ability to understand the nature of this study protocol, comply with study and/or
             follow-up procedures, and give written informed consent

         11. Willingness and ability to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plans, laboratory
             tests, and other study procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any prior systemic or investigational therapy for metastatic pancreatic cancer.
             Systemic therapy administered alone or in combination with radiation in the adjuvant
             or neoadjuvant setting is permissible as long as it was completed &gt; 6 months prior to
             the time of study randomization.

          2. History of other diseases, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination findings, or
             clinical laboratory findings giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition
             that, in the opinion of the investigator, renders the subject at high risk from
             treatment complications or might affect the interpretation of the results of the
             study.

          3. Presence of known central nervous system or brain metastases.

          4. Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.

          5. Active second invasive malignancy (except non-melanomatous skin cancer), defined as
             any malignancy with current need for cancer therapy or high possibility (&gt;30%) of
             recurrence during the study.

          6. Patients receiving warfarin.  However, therapeutic anticoagulation with Low Molecular
             Weight Heparin (LMWH)is allowed.

          7. Clinically significant cardiac disease (e.g. congestive heart failure, symptomatic
             coronary artery disease, and cardiac arrhythmias not well controlled with medication)
             or myocardial infarction within the last 6 months.

          8. Current sensory neuropathy &gt; Grade 1.

          9. Major surgery within 4 weeks of the start of study treatment (defined as those
             surgeries that require general anesthesia.  Insertion of a vascular access device is
             NOT considered major surgery.).  Patients must have recovered from the side effects
             of any major surgery prior to randomization.
