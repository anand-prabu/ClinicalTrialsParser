  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The most promising chimeric natriuretic peptide designed and studied by our group has been
      CD-NP which has anti-fibrotic and cardioprotective properties in vivo, vitro and in normal
      volunteers and human heart failure patients. Since left ventricular assist device (LVAD) can
      not reverse remodeling of the heart whereas it can improve hemodynamics, CD-NP may be novel
      anti-fibrotic and anti-remodeling drug as co-therapy during LVAD support.

    <textblock>
      This study is a double blind, placebo-controlled phase I trial of the safety and
      neurohumoral activity of CD-NP, in the treatment of heart failure with LVAD support.
      Subjects more than 3 months after LVAD implantation will be screened at outpatient clinic
      visit appointments lists and interested qualified subjects will be either confronted at a
      visit or sent a letter in the mail to be consented and offered participation in this trial.
      Once consent has been obtained, baseline values will be established at day 1 and subjects
      will be given subcutaneous injection of placebo or CD-NP and stay overnight on two different
      visits in the Clinical Research Unit (CRU). Participant's will receive both placebo and the
      CD-NP during the study, one per visit.  A final follow-up visit for clinical assessment will
      be conducted over the phone at the end of the study.

      Potential subjects who present to Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota for follow up clinical
      visit after LVAD implantation will be identified by the study coordinator.  A  $300
      remuneration per subject will be involved to compensate for the inconvenience to the
      subject. A $500 reimbursement of gas mileage will be provided for those who travel.

        Inclusion Criteria

          -  Male and non-pregnant/post-menopausal female, ages 18-90, in end-stage Heart Failure
             (HF) with LVAD support who are stable in the healed stage after at least 3 months
             from the LVAD implant (Destination therapy only) (the post-menopausal state is
             defined as the absence of menses for ≥ 1 year and serum follicle-stimulating hormone
             ≥ 20 IU/L; sterilization in the female is defined as bilateral tubal occlusion for ≥
             6 months, bilateral oophorectomy, or complete hysterectomy)

          -  Be willing to provide informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  Known allergy or other adverse reactions to exogenous natriuretic peptides (CD-NP or
             its components, nesiritide, other natriuretic peptides, or related compounds).

          -  Women who are pregnant, or breast-feeding.
