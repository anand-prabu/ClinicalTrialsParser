  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is an urgent need to prevent the onset and progression of food allergy in our
      population. Evidence demonstrates that food allergy and atopic eczema represent the earliest
      manifestations of the atopic march with 50% of infants with food allergy predicted to
      develop respiratory allergic diseases later in life. We report that Australia has the
      highest prevalence of IgE-mediated food allergy in the world, with 10% of infants having
      challenge-proven food allergy in Melbourne. There has been a 5-fold increase in hospital
      admissions for life-threatening anaphylaxis. These changes are most pronounced in children
      less than 5 years, suggesting a causal role for early life determinants. We have primary
      data to inform hypotheses for the rise in food allergy which appears to result from
      potentially modifiable factors related to the modern lifestyle particularly Vitamin D
      insufficiency (VDI) and have demonstrated an association between VDI and increased risk of
      challenge-proven food allergy in 12-month old infants which supports numerous ecological
      studies showing an increased risk of food allergy the further a child resides from the
      equator associated with decreased UV exposure and Vitamin D levels. Despite Australia's
      sunny clime population rates of VDI have steadily increased in infants and pregnant women in
      parallel to the apparent rise in food allergic disease. This association is biologically
      plausible as there is evidence Vitamin D is critical to the healthy development of the
      immune system in early life. We propose an intervention study to assess if infant Vitamin D
      supplementation during the first year of life significantly decreases the risk of early
      onset food allergy. Australia is ideally placed to answer this important question since
      unlike the USA, Canada and Europe there are no population recommendations for routine infant
      supplementation with Vitamin D and we are one of the few developed countries that do not
      supplement the food chain supply with Vitamin D.
