    <textblock>
      The long-term goal of this line of research is to determine if decreased vascular reactivity
      and frontal hypoperfusion is associated with poor response antidepressants. Such perfusion
      deficits could contribute to antidepressant nonresponse as they would hinder improvements in
      dorsal system metabolism seen with antidepressant treatment. The objective of the current
      proposal is to determine if decreased vascular reactivity and frontal hypoperfusion in
      depressed elders predicts and persists with antidepressant nonremission. The investigators
      will pursue the primary aim testing the hypothesis that decreased reactivity and
      hypoperfusion, specifically in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and dorsal anterior
      cingulate cortex, predict antidepressant nonremission. The investigators will enroll 40
      depressed elders who will complete clinical, cognitive, and MRI assessments before and after
      a 12-week open-label antidepressant trial of sertraline.

    <textblock>
      The long-term goal of this line of research is to determine if in late-life depression
      (LLD), cerebrovascular dysregulation is predictive of antidepressant outcomes. The
      investigators hypothesize that vascular pathology resulting in reduced cerebrovascular
      reactivity contributes to frontocingulate hypoperfusion. Such pathology would impair
      neurovascular coupling and reduce the ability of the vasculature to improve frontocingulate
      perfusion during antidepressant treatment. Thus decreased cerebrovascular reactivity and
      perfusion may be a biomarker of antidepressant nonresponse. As an initial step in this
      research, the current study will utilize MRI arterial spin labeling (ASL) to examine if
      cerebrovascular reactivity deficits and resting and task-based cerebral blood flow (CBF)
      deficits predict antidepressant nonremission in LLD.  The rationale for this proposal is
      that it will identify mechanisms by which vascular pathology may contribute to LLD.  If the
      study hypotheses are correct, this crucial next step will support studies examining
      antidepressant properties of cardiovascular drugs that may reverse vascular pathology and
      improve perfusion.

      The investigators will pursue our initial goal by examining ASL predictors of nonremission
      to a 12-week trial of sertraline.  Forty LLD subjects will complete MRI, cognitive testing,
      and hyperintensity assessment. ASL measured CBF will be obtained during a hypercapnia
      challenge, at rest with room air, and during an emotional oddball task examining neural
      correlates of executive function (target detection).  This will help determine if deficits
      in cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) and/or resting and on-demand CBF measures predict
      nonremission.

      AIM: To test for differences in CVR and CBF in dorsal frontal cognitive control regions
      between individuals who do and do not remit to a 12-week course of sertraline (defined as
      MADRS ≤ 7).

      Hypothesis 1: Compared with remitters, during a hypercapnia challenge nonremitters will
      exhibit less CVR in the dlPFC and dAC.

      Hypothesis 2: Compared with remitters, while breathing room air nonremitters will exhibit
      lower resting CBF in the dorsal anterior cingulate (dAC) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
      (dlPFC).

      Hypothesis 3: Compared with remitters, while breathing room air nonremitters will exhibit
      lower CBF during target detection with the emotional oddball task in the dAC and dlPFC.

      Exploratory Aim: To examine the relationship between ASL measures (CVR to hypercapnia and
      resting CBF during normoxia) and performance in cognitive domains implicated in LLD
      treatment outcomes.  For this Aim, we will focus on functions involving the dlPFC and dAC,
      specifically executive function and processing speed.

      The study will enroll patients from clinical referrals and response to advertisements.  In
      these cases, potential participants will call our study contact number.  Study staff will
      describe the study to them, including a description of the study entry criteria.  Those who
      continue to be interested will then be scheduled for an evaluation.  After scheduling, a
      study physician will review their electronic medical record to assure that potential
      subjects meet entry criteria.

      Following policies of the Vanderbilt University Health System Institutional Review Board,
      written informed consent will be obtained and documented by the study's Research Coordinator
      before any study-related procedures are performed.  The study coordinator will review study
      procedures and the consent form with each potential participant.  Each individual may take
      as much time as they like to decide if they do or do not wish to participate.  There is no
      randomization.  All participants receive open-label sertraline.

      An initial evaluation will determine eligibility, depression severity, and evaluate medical
      and psychiatric history.  Participants will also complete a detailed battery assessing
      cognitive function.  During this time they will also complete the one-hour MRI session,
      which includes measurement of cerebral perfusion and vascular reactivity.

      They will then begin the 12-week trial of open-label sertraline, allowing titration up to
      the maximum dose of 200mg daily.  At the end of the study participants will be referred for
      ongoing clinical treatment.
