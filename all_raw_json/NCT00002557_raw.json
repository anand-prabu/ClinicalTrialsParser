II. Assess changes in the hematologic and immunologic\n      status of the tumor in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients are treated sequentially on Regimens A, B, and C depending on response.\n      The following acronyms are used: CF Leucovorin calcium, NSC-3590 DOX Doxorubicin, NSC-123127\n      MTX Methotrexate, NSC-740 VP-16 Etoposide, NSC-141540 Regimen A: Single-Agent Chemotherapy.\n      VP-16. Regimen B: 2-Drug Combination Chemotherapy. VP-16/DOX. Regimen C: 3-Drug Combination\n      Chemotherapy.
