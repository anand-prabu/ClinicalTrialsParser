Towards year 2050 there will be a significant increase in number\n      of elderly persons in Norway, with an urgent need for new models for early intervention and\n      rehabilitation in order to give service to a larger amount of elderly persons. Everyday\n      rehabilitation is a new and promising rehabilitation model which many Norwegian\n      municipalities are implementing in order to meet current and future needs for municipal\n      home-based services. However, very little research has been conducted regarding the\n      effectiveness of this intervention. This study aims at assessing the effectiveness of\n      rehabilitation of everyday functioning in terms of daily functioning and economic costs\n      compared to standard home-based treatment and care.\n\n      The study will be conducted in the municipality of Voss in Western Norway, a municipality\n      with only 14000 inhabitants. It is a double-blinded, block-randomized controlled\n      intervention trial, recruiting home-dwelling older adults with an initial functional decline\n      in daily activities. The intervention is intensive, multidisciplinary, home-based\n      rehabilitation given by home-trainers, under supervision from an occupational therapist or a\n      physical therapist. The control intervention is standard home-based treatment and care.\n\n      Thirty participants will be recruited in each arm of the study. The participants will be\n      assessed at baseline, and at  3-, and 9 months follow-up. Primary outcomes will be\n      participation, activity, and municipal expenditures. Costs are generated by the working\n      hours of the different professions. Hence, there will be a daily registration of the working\n      hours different health care professions spend in the private homes of the participants.\n\n      Power calculations based on study with a similar target group using the instrument Canadian\n      Occupational Performance Measure, estimate a need for only 21 participants in each group due\n      to the longitudinal design. However, in order to account for possibilities of frailer target\n      group or a large drop out rate (40 %), a total number of 30 participants in each group will\n      be tried recruited. Data analyses will be performed according to intention to treat. The\n      working hour data is panel data and will be analysed accordingly; a random or a mixed effect\n      regression model will be employed. Also, descriptive statistics and simpler tests will be\n      carried out."
