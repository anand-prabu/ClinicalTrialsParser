    <textblock>
      The purpose of the survey is to study the followings under practical use, regarding the
      safety and effectiveness in high-dose administration (exceeding 6 g per day) of UNASYN-S and
      UNASYN-S KIT for intravenous use (UNASYN).

        1. Adverse Drug Reaction(s) that cannot be expected from precautions (Unexpected Adverse
           Drug Reaction)

        2. Incidence status of adverse drug reactions

        3. Factors that may affect the safety and effectiveness

    <description>Intravenous use; The usual adult dosage is 6 g of sulbactam sodium and ampicillin sodium (potency) per day given in two divided doses via intravenous injection or drip infusion. In the case of severe infection, the dosage may be increased if appropriate. Maximum dosage should not exceed 3 g (potency) 4 times daily (daily dose of 12 g (potency)).
Kit for intravenous use; The usual adult dosage is 6 g of sulbactam sodium and ampicillin sodium (potency) per day given in two divided doses via intravenous injection after dissolved in an accompanying reconstitution diluent. In the case of severe infection, the dosage may be increased if appropriate. Maximum dosage should not exceed 3 g (potency) 4 times daily (daily dose of 12 g (potency)).</description>
