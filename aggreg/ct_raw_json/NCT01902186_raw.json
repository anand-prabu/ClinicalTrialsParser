The underlying mechanism is believed\n      to be the reduction in hyper-phosphaturia induced by proximal tubular dysfunction: therefore\n      measuring renal tubular markers and hormones involved in calcium and phosphorus homeostasis\n      (such as vitamin D and parathormone) will explain the suspected mechanism."
