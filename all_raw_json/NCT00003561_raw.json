Colony-stimulating\n      factors such as sargramostim may increase the number of immune cells found in bone marrow or\n      peripheral blood and may help a person's immune system recover from the side effects of\n      therapy. Combining sargramostim with interferon alfa may kill more cancer cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of sargramostim in treating patients who\n      are receiving interferon alfa for chronic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia that is in\n      remission."

Estimate the rate of major cytogenetic responses to sargramostim (GM-CSF) and\n      interferon alfa in patients with newly diagnosed chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia. II.\n      Estimate the dosing, schedule, and toxic effects of GM-CSF plus interferon alfa in these\n      patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: All patients are in hematologic remission on subcutaneous interferon alfa upon\n      entering the study. Once a complete hematologic response is achieved and the interferon alfa\n      dose has been stable for 14 days, patients receive subcutaneous sargramostim (GM-CSF) daily\n      for 6 months. Patients are followed at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 48 patients will be accrued for this study."
