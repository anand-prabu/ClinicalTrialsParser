This illness has a great impact in quality\n      of life and one of the available treatments is the injection of Botulinum Toxin. This study\n      aims to review the efficacy and safety of type-A Botulinum Toxin in the management of\n      Idiopathic Overactive Bladder. A systematic search was performed in MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL\n      and LILACS, and the controlled randomized clinical trials were chosen to review with the\n      CONSORT criteria by independent reviewers. Outcomes analyzed were the efficacy of the\n      intervention for relieving the symptoms (urgency, frequency and urgency incontinence),\n      adverse events to treatment, change in quality of life and urodynamic measures."
