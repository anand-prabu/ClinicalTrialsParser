Continuous wound drainage poses a serious risk for infection and is\n      often initially treated with absorbent dressings and/or oral antibiotics. Comorbidities such\n      as obesity, diabetes and tobacco abuse predisposes to wound complications and therefore\n      infection after these procedures. NPWT has proven to be effective for postoperative drainage\n      and decreases the risk for infection or further reoperation. This prospective randomized\n      trial will involve 160 patients at high risk for infection undergoing revision total knee or\n      hip arthroplasty; 80 patients will be randomly selected to be treated with the NPWT  system\n      (Prevena) and randomly selected to be treated with the current standard of care wound\n      dressing (control group). Patients will be enrolled at a single site of the Cleveland Clinic\n      Health System (Main Campus)."
