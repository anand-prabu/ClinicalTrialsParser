    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to gather pilot data related to risk factors associated with
      suicide in Veterans with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)/ Acquired Immune Deficiency
      Syndrome (AIDS) and to develop an educational and interventional tool and instructional
      guide that can be utilized by local and national providers to increase understanding
      regarding suicide risk assessment. There are no hypotheses associated with this qualitative
      pilot study.

      To achieve these goals, a semi-structured interview will be conducted to gather this
      qualitative information. Specifically, this study aims to gather the following information
      from Veterans with HIV/AIDS: a) information regarding disease acquisition; b) psychosocial
      stressors; c) social supports; d) protective factors; and e) previous suicidal ideation and
      behaviors. Further, additional exploratory questions will be asked regarding proposed
      modifications to the Suicide Risk Assessment Guide Pocket Card, an existing VA tool, so that
      it can be modified for use by local and national HIV/AIDS providers.
