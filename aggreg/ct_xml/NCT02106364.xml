    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of a new basal insulin,
      insulin peglispro, to insulin glargine in participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
      Both drugs will be given by an injection under the skin.  Participants may continue to take
      oral antihyperglycemic medication (OAM) during the study, as prescribed by their personal
      physician.  The study is expected to last about 12 months for each participant.
