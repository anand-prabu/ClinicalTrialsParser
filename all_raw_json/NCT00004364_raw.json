The studies include measurements of basal fluid intake and urine output,\n      plasma vasopressin during standard fluid deprivation or waterload/saline infusion tests, and\n      changes in water balance during a therapeutic trial of DDAVP.  If clinically indicated,\n      echocardiograms and assays of plasma catecholes and renin are also completed.\n\n      Linkage analysis is performed for all participants; kindreds with the Marfan-like syndrome\n      are also studied for the fibrillin-1 genotype.\n\n      Participants determined to have DI are treated with desmopressin for 2 days."
