            "textblock": "Background:\n\n      - A small brain protein called the metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 5 (mGluR5) may\n      affect several brain diseases such as autism and depression. Researchers will use 2\n      radioactive chemicals ([11C]SP203 and [11C]FPEB) and a research drug (STX107) that can\n      attach to the receptor, to figure out the best way to use positron emission tomography (PET)\n      to see the mGluR5 receptor. They will use scans to monitor where the radioactivity goes.\n\n      Objectives:\n\n      - To find the best way to image the mGluR5 receptor in the brain.\n\n      Eligibility:\n\n      - Healthy volunteers ages 18 to 55.\n\n      Design:\n\n        -  All participants will be screened with a medical exam at visit 1. In later visits, they\n           may have a PET scan, when two small tubes are placed under the skin and they lie down\n           in a scanner. They may have an MRI scan, when they lie down in a scanner.\n\n        -  Part 1 participants will have 2 more visits. They will have a PET brain scan using\n           [11C]FPEB and will have blood drawn. Then they will have an MRI brain scan.\n\n        -  Part 2 participants will have 1 more visit, with a whole body PET scan using [11C]FPEB\n           and blood drawn.\n\n        -  Part 3 participants will have 4 more visits, including 1 overnight stay at a hospital.\n           Over all the visits, they will have 4 PET scans and 1 MRI brain scan. They will receive\n           the research drug and injections of both chemicals. Blood will be drawn during the\n           scans."

            "textblock": "Objective:\n\n      Multiple PET ligands exist for imaging metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 5 (mGluR5).\n      The selection of    best    PET ligand to image mGluR5 is necessary for a larger clinical\n      study in patient population     but choosing such a ligand is likely difficult because the\n      radioligands are evaluated under different conditions and in different subject populations.\n\n      The purpose of this study is to determine the best PET ligand for imaging mGluR5 receptors\n      in brain of healthy subjects. This will be accomplished by measuring mGluR5 receptor\n      occupancy in the same subject using two PET ligands having high affinity at mGluR5\n      [(11)C]SP203 and [(11)C]FPEB, and using STX107, a negative allosteric modulator at mGluR5\n      receptors to block the radioligand brain uptake. The two radioligands were chosen among many\n      based on the recommendation from the mGluR5 working group. Two serial PET scans using\n      [(11)C]SP203 and [(11)C]FPEB will be performed under baseline condition on one day and under\n      receptor blocked condition on another day. As [(11)C]FPEB has not been evaluated in humans\n      before, we plan to acquire brain and whole-body dosimetry scans before measuring receptor\n      occupancy. This study was designed based on recommendation from a large international group\n      of scientists from academia and industry on how to determine the    best    radioligand for\n      mGluR5. In addition, our efforts were coordinated with interests of NIMH   s extramural\n      program via Drs. Linda Brady and William Potter.\n\n      Study population:\n\n      35 healthy volunteers aged 18 to 55 years.\n\n      Design:\n\n      To characterize brain uptake and distribution of radioligand, an initial cohort of healthy\n      volunteers (n = up to 10) will undergo brain PET scans using [(11)C]FPEB. To estimate\n      radiation absorbed doses for [(11)C]FPEB, a cohort of healthy volunteers (n = up to 10) will\n      undergo whole-body PET or PET/CT scans. A subsequent cohort of healthy volunteers (n = up to\n      15) will have two scanning sessions: a) baseline     i.e., medication-free and b) blocking\n        i.e. with medication. Each scanning session will be with two serial PET scans: [(11)C]FPEB\n      and [(11)C]SP203 in a day (scans in morning and afternoon). The blocking session will be\n      after administration of STX107, at which time we will also measure the concentration of\n      STX107 in plasma. Both scanning sessions would include an arterial line and measurement of\n      the input function of parent radioligand separated from radiometabolites     as well as\n      plasma free fraction of radioligand. We plan to study up to two doses of STX107, with three\n      to five subjects at each dose. The blockade of brain uptake of [(11)C]FPEB and [(11)C]SP203\n      will be plotted as a function of the plasma concentration of STX107.\n\n      Outcome measures:\n\n      The two radioligands will be evaluated on three criteria:\n\n        1. Peak brain uptake. Higher uptake is better, because it provides more robust signal that\n           can be imaged for a longer time.\n\n        2. Time-stability of distribution volume. If the measurement of receptor binding (i.e.,\n           distribution volume) is stable with increasing lengths of imaging, the result is good\n           and consistent with the lack of radiometabolites in brain.\n\n        3. Ratio of specific to non-displaceable uptake in brain. The receptor occupancy study can\n           be analyzed with the so-called Lassen plot to calculate non-displaceable (free\n           radioligand plus non-specifically bound) uptake in brain. The better radioligand has\n           the better ratio of    signal to noise   , which in this case is the ratio of specific\n           to nondisplaceable uptake."
