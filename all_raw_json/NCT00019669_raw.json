It is\n      not yet known whether combining melanoma vaccine with interleukin-2 is more effective than\n      vaccine therapy alone in treating metastatic melanoma.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to compare the effectiveness of melanoma vaccine and interleukin-2\n      with that of melanoma vaccine alone in treating patients who have metastatic melanoma that\n      has not responded to previous treatment."

Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment\n      cohorts.\n\n        -  Cohort 1: Patients receive recombinant fowlpox virus encoding gp100 peptide (fowlpox\n           vaccine) IV once every 4 weeks for up to 4 doses. (Closed to accrual as of 6/21/02.)\n\n        -  Cohort 2: Patients receive fowlpox vaccine intramuscularly (IM) once every 4 weeks for\n           up to 4 doses. (Closed to accrual as of 6/21/04.)\n\n        -  Cohort 3 (for patients in need of immediate interleukin-2 [IL-2] and those with disease\n           progression after treatment in cohorts 1 or 2): Patients receive fowlpox vaccine either\n           IV or IM* once every 4 weeks for 4 doses and IL-2 IV every 8 hours for a maximum of 12\n           doses beginning 24 hours after fowlpox vaccine.\n\n      NOTE: *The IM route of administration was selected as the preferred route of administration\n      from cohorts 1 and 2\n\n        -  Expanded cohort 2 (open to accrual 7/19/02): Patients receive fowlpox vaccine IM once\n           every 4 weeks for up to 4 doses. Upon disease progression, patients receive fowlpox\n           vaccine as above and IL-2 IV every 8 hours for a maximum of 12 doses beginning 24 hours\n           after fowlpox vaccine. (Closed to accrual 12/4/03.) In all cohorts, 3-4 weeks after the\n           last injection, patients achieving a complete remission may receive a maximum of an\n           additional 2 courses of therapy. Patients with responding disease may receive repeat\n           vaccinations for up to 8 courses. Patients with no response or progressive disease in\n           cohorts not receiving IL-2 may be treated with fowlpox vaccine and IL-2 as in cohort 3.\n           Patients who are randomized to receive IL-2 may not receive additional IL-2 therapy.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 84 patients (24 in cohorts 1 and 2, 19-33 in cohort 3, and\n      27 in expanded cohort 2) will be accrued for this study within 1 year."
