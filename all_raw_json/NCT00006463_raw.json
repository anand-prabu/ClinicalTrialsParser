Determine the\n      pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients. III. Determine the antitumor activity of\n      this drug in this patient population.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to\n      pretreatment (pretreated vs less heavily pretreated). Patients receive ecteinascidin 743 IV\n      over 3 hours on day 1. Treatment continues every 3 weeks in the absence of disease\n      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of\n      ecteinascidin 743 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined\n      as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting\n      toxicities.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-20 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years."
