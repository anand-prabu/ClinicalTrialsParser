            "textblock": "The potential to harness the propagating power of social networks for chronic disease\n      treatment and management, such as for diabetes and obesity, is an emerging area in\n      epidemiology and clinical research. Social induction for disease management has been\n      effectively leveraged for disease management, but we have not carefully disaggregated of\n      different layers and modalities of social network effects in this context. This study will\n      test and demonstrate this through a novel randomized trial.\n\n      The randomized design is comprised of 2 arms. 1) Intervention Group: This arm takes part in\n      a 10-month (9-month for Phase 2, cycles 1 and 2) diabetes, weight, and cardiovascular\n      disease education and management program in combination with the microclinic social support\n      model.   A microclinic is a support group of 2-6 individuals from the same social network\n      who learn how to manage their disease together. 2) Control Group: This is a control arm with\n      observational parallel assessments of metabolic and lifestyle risk factors alone\n      (implemented in Phase 1 and 2, cycles 1 and 2). Each arm will take part in a 6-month\n      follow-up. The investigators also aim to study the intervention effects of social networks\n      in improving lifestyle risk factors on a small sample of Phase 1 controls in a repeated\n      measures design. Observational controls with 7 repeated measures in Phase 1\n      (pre-intervention) will receive the 9-month diabetes, weight, and cardiovascular disease\n      education and management program with microclinic social support model condensed in a 4-6\n      months program. The controls in this cycle will also receive 17 medical screenings during\n      the intervention, and 6-month follow-up (post-intervention).\n\n      Aim 1- (Phase 1 and 2, Cycles 1 & 2)\n\n      To evaluate the efficacy of the microclinic intervention group versus observational control\n      in improving lifestyle factors and metabolic outcome.\n\n      Aim 2\u2014 (Phase 2, Cycle 3)\n\n      To examine the effect of the microclinic intervention by comparing pre- and post measures\n      among those who were first controls in Phase 1 and then participated in the microclinic\n      intervention Phase 2, Cycle 3.\n\n      AIM 3\u2014 (Phases 1 & 2, cycles 1, 2, and 3)\n\n      To differentiate the modalities of social network effects: direct causal induction versus\n      homophilly, and to determine the extent of long-term temporal cross-propagating effects\n      between-persons in a microclinic group."
