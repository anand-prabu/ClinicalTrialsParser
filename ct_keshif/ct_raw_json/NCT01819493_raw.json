Based on our previous experience with AA adults, the investigators anticipate that all families will have access to email either at home or at work. Educational materials will be mailed to families without access to email. The study will also maintain contact with participants by sending holiday and birthday cards, as well as postcard reminders of scheduled data collection visits."

This project will be unique in its partnership with local\n      YMCAs and its use of Family Health Coaches from the YMCAs who will work one-on-one with\n      participating families. The investigators feel this program will benefit all members of the\n      families who are enrolled and will encourage all members to participate though the study\n      will target one parent and one child who is 8 to 10 years old."

            "textblock": "The investigators' long-term research goal is to translate the Diabetes Prevention Program\n      (DPP) in community-based settings for overweight/obese African American (AA) families at\n      risk for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM).   Intensive lifestyle approaches addressing\n      physical activity, healthy eating patterns, and stress management are established methods\n      for reducing obesity and risk of T2DM for adults (Knowler, 2002; Tuomilehto et al, 2001; Pan\n      et al, 1997). But, minimal evidence exists that this knowledge has been translated in\n      sustainable settings or in a manner that acknowledges the influences of daily life on\n      motivation and family self-efficacy for changes in nutrition and physical activity. The\n      study proposes to adapt these components for AA families through the use of \"family\n      coaches\", one-on-one intervention sessions through supervised individualized physical\n      activity, and tailoring intervention strategies for individual families.  Utilizing a family\n      systems approach, each component will be delivered using brief motivational strategies that\n      will target self-efficacy and motivational readiness. This four month, two-arm randomized\n      clinical trial, Parents and Children Together Preventing Diabetes (PACT PD) will test the\n      central hypothesis that, relative to a control condition, a \"family health coaching\"\n      intervention focused on nutrition and physical activity using brief motivational strategies\n      will improve targeted dietary and physical activity behaviors in overweight/obese AA parents\n      and their overweight/obese 8-10 year old children, (N=50 families) all of whom are at risk\n      for T2DM diabetes.  This study will test the feasibility and acceptability of training YMCA\n      fitness staff to utilize brief motivational interviewing and serve as \"family health\n      coaches\".  This study will evaluate the early efficacy of the newly translated, family-based\n      diabetes prevention intervention in improving anthropometric measures of BMI (primary\n      outcome) and waist circumference, physical activity and dietary intake, and family\n      functioning (secondary outcomes) and intervention fidelity, feasibility and acceptability of\n      participants.   Further, the study will assess the acceptability and feasibility of booster\n      interventions for motivation maintenance and potential for long-term retention and\n      intervention success in the subsequent R18 application.  This study will provide critical\n      information regarding the early effectiveness of an innovative, family-based, behavioral\n      intervention for the prevention of T2DM specifically translated for AA families.  This study\n      is funded by the National Institutes for Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Disorders."
