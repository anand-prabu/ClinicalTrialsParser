      Background:

      Pancreatic cancer is associated with a poor prognosis. Therefore, rapid and accurate
      diagnosis of a pancreatic mass is important to direct patient management. Endoscopic
      ultrasonography-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) is the current standard for sampling
      pancreatic mass lesions, with diagnostic accuracy of 78% to 95%. But, the EUS-FNA has some
      limitations include stromal cell tumors and lymphomas may be difficult to diagnose. To
      overcome these limitations, a new needle device with ProCore reverse-bevel technology was
      developed recently.

      Aims:

      The objective of this prospective study is to compare the rate of diagnostic sufficiency in
      the EUS sampling by using newly developed ProCore needle with conventional FNA needle in
      suspected unresectable pancreatic cancer. We will also compare the safety, the yield of
      histologic core tissue and the cost-effectiveness between these modalities.

      Patient:

      Newly diagnosed pancreatic cancer patient whose cancer lesion is suspected unresectable in
      diagnostic imaging such as CT or MRI

      Procedure:

      Each EUS-guided FNA and ProCore aspiration will performed twice in same patient. The
      priority of order will be given by randomization assignment.

      The number of patients required:

      Total sixty five patients will be required.
