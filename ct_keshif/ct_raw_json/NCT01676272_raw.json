            "textblock": "The primary goal in treating a DFU is to obtain wound closure. Healing can be a lengthy and\n      painful process for ulcers of diabetic etiology. Healing is often further complicated in\n      subjects with diabetes by vascular compromise and peripheral ischemia, renal insufficiency\n      and diminution of inflammatory responses\n\n      The two products to be compared in this study are both commonly used for the treatment of\n      diabetic foot ulcers.  DermaGraft is considered a medical device by the FDA, and was cleared\n      for the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers in 1997.  It is a staple for the treatment of\n      diabetic foot ulcers, and is widely used throughout the United States.  It is composed of an\n      absorbable substrate  that has been seeded with living human fibroblasts.  Once formed, the\n      graft is cryopreserved until it reaches the clinic, where it is defrosted and applied to the\n      wound surface.\n\n      TheraSkin is composed of a split thickness skin graft harvested within 24 hours post-mortem,\n      from an organ donor who has cleared the standard safety screenings.  It is classified by the\n      FDA as a donated tissue.  Once harvested, the graft is sanitized according to FDA\n      specifications, and cryopreserved, until it is delivered to the clinic for application to\n      the foot ulcer.  It is also a widely used treatment for diabetic foot ulcers."
