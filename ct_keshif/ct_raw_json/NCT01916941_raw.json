On the whole, less than 50% of people with alcoholism get better with treatment. This\n      study will help researchers develop better treatments for alcoholism because if the\n      investigators know why the treatments the investigators use are working, and in whom the\n      treatments work best, then the investigators may be able to make treatment more effective by\n      targeting treatments to individuals who would be most likely to benefit and by guiding\n      development of more effective treatments in the future."
