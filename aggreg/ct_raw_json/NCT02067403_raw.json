            "textblock": "Pressure support (PS) is a commonly used mode of ventilation which is triggered based upon\n      the patient's own inspiratory efforts. For the most part, pressure support is well tolerated\n      by patients. However, because the trigger for pressure support is an inspiratory effort by\n      the patient, and because the resulting support is constant, the ventilator response can be\n      \"out of sync\" with the patient's needs. The problem of patient-ventilator asynchrony has\n      been documented to be large in approximately one quarter of patients who require mechanical\n      ventilation. Asynchrony is associated with increased or abnormal work of breathing (WOB) and\n      prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation. Diagnosing asynchrony at the bedside can be\n      challenging. Electrical activation of the diaphragm (Eadi) recording  can provide clinicians\n      with a more accurate picture of patient-ventilator synchrony and may thus result in\n      decreased asynchrony and decreased or normalized work of breathing for the patient. The\n      purpose of this physiologic study is to evaluate the role of protocolized pressure support\n      ventilation (based upon Eadi) in comparison to standard pressure support ventilation."
