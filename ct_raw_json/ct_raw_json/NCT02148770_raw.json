            "textblock": "Neuroimaging has becoming increasingly common to investigate the neural networks underlying\n      eating behaviour and food preference in normal-weight and obese humans. It has been observed\n      that obese in comparison to lean individuals display altered activation patterns in\n      reward-processing brain areas. Interestingly, obese individuals who prove to be capable of\n      losing weight appear to have a stronger connectivity between areas related to food value and\n      to the control of eating behaviour. The same areas are also associated with healthy food\n      choices. Based on these neural differences, brain-related intervention strategies to support\n      weight loss and long-lasting weight maintenance are of particular interest. Such\n      interventions can also be assumed to interact with sleep behaviour against the background of\n      recent findings showing that short or impaired sleep favours increases in food intake and\n      compromises memory functions. Hence, the investigators want to examine the effect on eating\n      behaviour of neurofeedback training-induced up-regulation of functional connectivity between\n      reward- and impulse-related brain areas, with a particular focus on the influence of sleep\n      behaviour on this effect."

(ii) The investigators want to\n      examine whether the strength of this effect depends on regular sleep between training\n      sessions.\n\n      Study design: Two groups of subjects, i.e., carriers and non-carriers of the obesity-risk\n      associated FTO-allele, will participate in four experimental conditions according to a\n      randomized parallel design. Half of the subjects in each group will learn to up-regulate the\n      functional connectivity between the two brain areas, while the other subjects will\n      participate in sham-training sessions. In each group, half of the subjects that underwent\n      the up-regulation and half of the subjects who underwent the sham-regulation condition will\n      enjoy regular night sleep. The other subjects will have a night of complete sleep\n      restriction. Adherence to experimental conditions will be assigned randomly, based on the\n      subjects' enrolment in the study.\n\n      Study population: 120 overweight and obese (BMI 25-40 kg/m2), but otherwise healthy men,\n      18-65 years old.\n\n      Intervention: All subjects will participate in a pre-test day, followed by four\n      neurofeedback-sleep session days and a post-test day. During each neurofeedback-sleep\n      session, subjects will undergo a 45 min real-time-fMRI-brain-computer-interface scan in\n      order to learn to regulate the functional connectivity between the respective two brain\n      areas. Nocturnal sleep after each training session will be kept normal or be restricted in\n      the sleep laboratory.\n\n      Main study parameters/endpoints:\n\n        1. The ability to regulate functional connectivity.\n\n        2. Respective effects on eating behaviour.\n\n        3. The effect of sleep restriction on parameters 1 and 2. Nature and extent of the burden\n           and risks associated with participation, benefit and group relatedness: Participants\n           will be scanned 6 times (fMRI). Functional MRI is a safe and non-invasive technique.\n           Additionally blood will be drawn. This procedure will have a low risk in healthy\n           people."
