Stroke survivors are at\n      significant risk for de-conditioning, elevated inflammatory markers, and insulin resistance,\n      which subsequently increases risk for secondary stroke and cardiovascular disease. Engaging\n      in healthy behaviors, such as physical activity, good sleep hygiene, and nutrition, to\n      facilitate energy balance may help reduce the risk of secondary conditions and ultimately\n      improve physical function and quality of life in stroke survivors. Thus, the specific study\n      aims are to engage potential participants (i.e., stroke survivors) and their families as\n      co-designers to adapt the SystemCHANGE\u2122 comprehensive lifestyle intervention, and then\n      conduct a randomized controlled pilot study to provide preliminary estimates of the\n      intervention's efficacy in 35 stroke survivors."
