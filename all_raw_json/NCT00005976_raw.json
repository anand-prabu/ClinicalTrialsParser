Determine the toxic effects of this treatment regimen in these patients. III. Determine\n      the safety of this treatment regimen at the recommended phase II dose in patients not\n      receiving anticonvulsants.\n\n      IV. Determine the efficacy of this treatment regimen in these patients. V. Assess the\n      pharmacokinetics and metabolism of pyrazoloacridine in these patients.\n\n      VI. Assess the response rate, time to progression, and time to death in patients treated\n      with this regimen.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a three-part, dose-escalation, multicenter study. Patients in study 3 are\n      stratified according to concurrent anticonvulsants (yes vs no).\n\n      STUDY 1: (Study 1 closed as of 03/29/02) Patients receive carboplatin IV over 30 minutes and\n      pyrazoloacridine IV over 3 hours on day 1. Treatment continues every 28 days in the absence\n      of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of carboplatin and pyrazoloacridine until\n      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding\n      that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n      STUDY 2: (Study 2 closed as of 03/29/02) Patients receive the same treatment as given in\n      study 1. Dose escalation is performed as in study 1 to determine the MTD in patients not\n      receiving concurrent anticonvulsants.\n\n      STUDY 3: Patients receive the same treatment as given in studies 1 and 2 without dose\n      escalation.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 4 years, and then\n      annually for 5 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL:\n\n      Study 1: A total of 3-21 patients will be accrued for this study within 6-20 months.\n\n      Study 2: A total of 3-12 patients will be accrued for this study within 3-18 months.\n\n      Study 3: A total of 12-37 patients will be accrued for this study within 15 months."
