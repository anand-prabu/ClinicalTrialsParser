  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Choroidal thinning has been hypothesized to partake in the pathogenesis of age-related
      macular degeneration (AMD), but it is not known if increasing choroidal thickness may
      potentially alter the disease course. Past studies have shown that a single dose of the
      phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitor sildenafil citrate can increase choroidal thickness in
      young healthy patients. The investigators hypothesize that sildenafil may also increase
      choroidal thickness in eyes with AMD and perhaps potentially reduce AMD progression.
      Alternatively, if sildenafil has minimal effect on choroidal thickness in eyes in patients
      with AMD, such results may suggest that choroidal vascular compliance or stiffness is
      reduced in this condition. Patients seen at the Duke Eye Center with a diagnosis of AMD or
      age-matched control subjects with no macular pathology will be administered a single 100mg
      oral dose of sildenafil citrate (ViagraÂ®; Pfizer), and undergo EDI-OCT imaging before and
      after treatment. Images obtained will be used to measure choroidal thickness, as well as
      central macular thickness (CMT) and macular volume (MV). Choroidal thickness changes after a
      single-dose sildenafil treatment in AMD patients will be compared with age-matched control
      subjects using standard statistical methods. By also correlating choroidal thickness changes
      with functional (visual acuity) and anatomical (CMT &amp; MV) changes, the investigators hope to
      further their understanding of the choroid's role in aging and AMD pathogenesis. The safety
      of a single dose of sildenafil citrate will be addressed by excluding any patients with risk
      factors or using medications that are contraindicated for sildenafil as determined by
      careful informed consent and a study questionnaire.
