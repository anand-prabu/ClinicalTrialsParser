      A tonic active epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) in pre-eclampsia (PE) escaped normal hormonal
      control may offer an attractive explanatory model for the pathophysiology of established PE.
      The channel is activated by plasmin. Because microalbuminuria in pregnant pregestational
      diabetes patients predicts the development of preeclampsia, we believe that it is caused by
      plasmin(plasminogen) lose from plasma to the urine. The investigators want to test the
      correlation between measurable plasmin/plasminogen in the urine early in pregnancy and the
      development of preeclampsia in patients with type 1 diabetes.

      Study aim and hypothesis:

      Aim:

      To test if there is a measurable correlation between plasmin/plasminogen abnormally excreted
      by the kidneys to the urine and the development of preeclampsia at pregnant women with Type
      1 diabetes.

      Hypothesis:

      1. The amount of proteases ( plasmin/plasminogen ) excreted in urine predicts the
      development of preeclampsia  at pregnant  patients with type 1 diabetes.

      If we see a correlation between the excretion of plasmin/plasminogen in urine in patients
      with type 1 diabetes and the development of preeclampsia, the proteases might be used as a
      marker for these patients in the diabetes group that develop the disease and eventually also
      as a marker for the severity.

      In these high risk groups it is possible that we would be able to optimize their outpatient
      visits even more in trying to lower the amount of preterm births.

      Study design:

      The study is an observational, longitudinal - prospective study. Women with pregestational
      type 1 diabetes are included when they show up for their first outpatient pregnancy visit
      around the 9th weeks gestation.

      Selection of patients:

      The selection of patients is based on pregnant outpatients with Type 1 diabetes, over 18
      years, from Gynecological- obstetric department, Aarhus University hospital - Skejby, and
      Gynecological- Obstetric department, Odense University Hospital.

      Background information:

      Registration of date of birth, sex, weight, height, hip-waist ratio, and smoking status will
      be noted.

      Furthermore, we will register current medical treatment, duration of diabetes,
      pregestational bloodpressure, parity and HbA1c.

      Also post-partum registration of length of gestation, weight of placenta, way of delivery
      (natural birth or cesarean section), umbilical cord  pH, apgar score and the infant weight
      will be noted.

      Effect variable:

      Clinical:

      Weight, height, BMI, smoking status,  microalbuminuria/proteinuria . Blood pressure
      (systolic, diastolic, mean arterial pressure). Weight of placenta

      Measurements in blood tests:

      Se-creatinine, p-Na+, p-K+. P-plasminogen, P-albumin, Aldosterone.

      Measurements in 50 ml newly &quot;spot urine&quot;:

      Plasmin, plasminogen, ENaC peptide fragment (analyses in location of development,)
      Proteolytic activity, Prostatin, Creatinine, Na+, K+, Aldosterone, Albumin

      Study process:

      Visits, including bloodsampels and spoturine collection:

      Women with pregestational type 1 diabetes are included. In first trimester, around pregnancy
      week 9-14 an urinesampel is collected. Blood pressure is measured and urine
      plasmin/plasminogen, albumin and aldosterone are analyzed.  After that urine- and blood
      samples are collected in pregnancyweek 20, 28,32, 36 and perhaps 38. Plasmin/plasminogen
      analyses, regarding to detect the excretion compared to the development in PE, are made.
      Around pregnancy week 28 a single 24 hour blood pressure measurement are done according to
      observe the daily variation.

      Following outcomes are observed: The development of preeclampsia, defined by hypertension (
      &gt; 140/90 mmHg), and proteinuria ( &gt;0,3 g/24 hour). Preterm delivery and light for
      gestational age.

      Data- analysis methods:

      This is an observational longitudinal-prospective study which includes approximately 130
      pregnant patients with Type 1 diabetes. Patients are included from Skejby and Odense
      University Hospitals in cooperation.

      Results are evaluated statistically by uni - and multivariate logistic regression analysis.

      Population size evaluation:

      Similar (Danish) observational prospective studies of urine- biomarkers (including albumin)
      ability to predict preeclampsia/preterm delivery in patients with pregestational type 1
      diabetes have achieved high significance data with spotsamples at 130 -170 patients. With
      the participation of two centers it seems realistic and adequately to include 130 patients
      within the settings of a Ph. D. study. Every year an amount of 50-60 patients are seen in
      the outpatient ward at Skejby- and Odense Universityhospitals (in all approximately 100-120
      patients).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  singleton gravida,

          -  over 18 years,

          -  with pregestational type 1 diabetes. Gestation week 8-14.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Possible comorbidity like systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), hypertension and
             rheumatoid arthritis are reasons for exclusion regarding investigation of the
             hypothesis.

          2. Organic or systematic diseases with clinical relevance ( ex. Malignity)

        However it has to be mentioned that quite some patients have thyroid diseases with no
        impact on the kidneys nor hypertension and therefore it is possible to include these
        patients.

        Thyroid diseases are NOT a reason for exclusion.
