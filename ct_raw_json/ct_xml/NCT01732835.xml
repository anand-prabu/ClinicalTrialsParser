      This investigation is a prospective, non-randomized, multi-center trial to evaluate the
      extended safety and performance of the HAART model 300 annuloplasty ring when used to
      surgically repair the aortic valve using a 3-D intra-annular mounting frame.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is 18 years of age or older

          -  Subject has tri-leaflet aortic valve morphology

          -  Subject has documented aortic valve disease which may or may not include:

               1. aortic valve insufficiency

               2. aortic root pathology

               3. pathology of the ascending aorta

               4. patients with associated stable one or two vessel coronary disease requiring
                  concomitant coronary bypass

          -  Subject is willing to comply with specified follow-up evaluations, including
             transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) if there are inadequate images by
             transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) to assess the aortic valve

          -  Subject has reviewed and signed the written informed consent form

          -  Subject agrees to return for all follow-up evaluations for the duration of the study
             (i.e.,. geographically stable)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject has pre-existing valve prosthesis in the aortic position

          -  The subject's aortic valve morphology is not tri-leaflet

          -  The subject has active endocarditis

          -  Heavily calcified valves

          -  The subject has mixed stenosis and regurgitation of the aortic valve with predominant
             stenosis

             enroll 4 weeks after discontinuation of antibiotics)

          -  Subjects in whom transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is contraindicated

          -  Low Ejection Fraction (EF) EF &lt; 35%

          -  Life expectancy &lt; 1 year

          -  The subject is or will be participating in a concomitant research study of an
             investigational product or has participated in such a study within the 30 days prior
             to screening

          -  The subject is a minor, an illicit drug user, alcohol abuser, prisoner,
             institutionalized, or is unable to give informed consent

          -  The subject is pregnant or lactating
