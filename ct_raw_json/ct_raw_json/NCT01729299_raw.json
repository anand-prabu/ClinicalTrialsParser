A 240-minute meal tolerance test (MTT) using a dual\n      glucose tracer method will serve as the foundation of each study visit.  One tracer,\n      [6,6-2H2]glucose will be infused intravenously before and during the test meal to quantify\n      fasting endogenous glucose production (EGP), and glucose disappearance during the meal. A\n      second tracer, [U-13C]glucose, will be included in the meal to trace the appearance of oral\n      glucose. The systemic appearance rates of both ingested tracer and total (i.e., ingested and\n      endogenously produced) glucose will be calculated. Using this protocol, we will be able to\n      evaluate a) insulin secretion in response to mixed-meal ingestion, b) glucose appearance and\n      glucose disappearance during meal ingestion,  c) the ghrelin effect on these parameters\n      without GLP-1, and d) the effect of GLP-1 in the response based on the effects with and\n      without Ex-9.\n\n      This dual-tracer method has been used to assess the ability of an individual to dispose of\n      an oral glucose load, and accurately fractionates the appearance of ingested glucose in\n      plasma (Ra meal), EGP, and peripheral glucose disposal (Rd) in this setting 41-42. The\n      [6,6-2H2]glucose and [U-13C]glucose are stable-isotope tracers and are different from\n      radioactive-isotope tracers in that they do not emit radiation.\n\n      All procedures will be performed at the CTRC at the Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical\n      Center (CCHMC)."
