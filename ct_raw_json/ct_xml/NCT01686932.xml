  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vildagliptin and Sitagliptin both belong to the class of DPP-4 inhibitors, but differ in
      their pharmacokinetic profile as well as in their approved application (Vildagliptin, 2x 50
      mg daily, Sitagliptin, 1x 100 mg daily). This leads to distinct results regarding
      postprandial blood-glucose normalization as well as protective properties regarding
      hypoglycemic episodes - especially during the night. Additionally, in type 1 diabetic
      patients a correlation has been described between hypoglycemia and abnormal heart function
      (QTc-elongation), which can have severe consequences for the patients. This study aims for
      the evaluation of the potency of both drugs to prevent and/or reduce hypoglycemic events in
      insulin-dependent type-2 diabetics and furthermore to evaluate the correlation of
      hypoglycemic episodes with changes in heart-function measured by Holter-ECG.

      The hypothesis is tested, if vildagliptin leads to a more favourable glycemic profile than
      sitagliptin and is more potent in protecting from nocturnal abnormalities in heart-function
      caused by undetected hypoglycemic episodes.
