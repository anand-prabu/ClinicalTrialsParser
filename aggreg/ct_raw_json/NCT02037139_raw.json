This study involves a prospective\n      controlled trial comparing the effectiveness of three primary care based protocols for older\n      adults \u2265 60 who screen positive for possible hearing loss in promoting subsequent access  to\n      and use of hearing health care services. The protocols will compare: 1) screening only\n      (standard care control); 2) screening plus an illustrated educational brochure; and 3)\n      screening plus an in-person educational intervention and an illustrated educational\n      brochure.  Screening will be done by primary care personnel.  Participants will be tracked\n      for 8 months to assess outcomes."
