Courses repeat every 10 weeks\n      in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.\n\n      Patients with a complete response (CR) receive 2 additional courses after achieving CR.\n      Patients with a CR except for residual radiographic abnormalities that persist unchanged for\n      2 full courses continue for 4 courses past best response.\n\n      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, weekly for the first 4 weeks of therapy, and then\n      monthly thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-24 patients will be accrued for this study."
