Thus, we\n      hypothesized that: 1.perhaps our present depression-oriented health education was inadequate\n      to promote patients' adherence, diabetes distress might played a more important part than\n      depression in patients' treatment adherence. 2. there might be a high prevalence of diabetes\n      distress in Chinese type 2 diabetes; so, the comparative study between diabetes distress and\n      depresion was conducted.\n\n      Objectives: to explore the relationship of diabetes-related distress and depression\uff0cand to\n      compare the influence of diabetes distress and depression on treatment adherence in Chinese\n      type 2 diabetes .\n\n      Research design and method:we surveyed 200 type 2 diabetic patients from 2 third-class\n      hospitals using the Diabetes Distress Scale, Zung Self-rating Depression Scale, and Revised\n      Treatment Adherence in Diabetes Questionnaire (RADQ)simultaneously."
