            "textblock": "It is apparent that local control for Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) remains a\n      significant problem. Conventional radiation therapy techniques have limitations for the dose\n      that can be delivered to a chest tumor mass due to the adjacent dose limiting organs.\n      Mounting evidence supports the use of hypofractionated stereotactically delivered radiation\n      therapy to control lung cancer with acceptable toxicity profiles.\n\n      Thus the investigators propose to increase the doses of radiation to residual masses of NSCL\n      to a BED > 100 Gy by the addition of two fractions of stereotactically delivered boost\n      radiation therapy to residual disease post-conventional chemoradiation to at least 59.4 Gy\n      in 180 cGy fractions. Using the linear quadratic equation to model doses of radiation\n      therapy, 59.4 Gy would have a BED of approximately 70 Gy. Single fraction stereotactic body\n      radiation therapy (SBRT) of 10 Gy would have a BED of approximately 20 Gy. Thus the addition\n      of two fractions of 10Gy of SBRT to limited volumes of PET residual disease would\n      theoretically result in higher degrees of local control of lung cancer masses, achieving a\n      minimum cumulative BED of approximately 110Gy-equivalent."

Lung cancer kills more Americans than\n      the next three most common malignancies combined.\n\n      Most non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) presents at advanced stages. Only approximately 25%\n      present with stage I/II disease, 40% with stage III and 35% patients present with stage IV.\n      (1) The optimal treatment of stage II/III NSCLC is complex. For those patients who are\n      surgical candidates and a complete resection is technically feasible, radical surgery\n      remains the standard of care. Traditionally, those patients with multiple N2 nodal levels or\n      T4 disease are considered inoperable. Given that the average age of patients diagnosed with\n      NSCLC is in their mid-60's and usually have long smoking histories, many patients are\n      medically inoperable."
