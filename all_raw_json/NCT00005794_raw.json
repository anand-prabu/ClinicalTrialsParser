Treatment continues every 28 days in the absence of unacceptable\n      toxicity or disease progression.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating loading doses and maintenance doses of perifosine\n      until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of each is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose\n      preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxic effects.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 20-30 patients will be accrued for this study."
