Patients are stratified according to\n      participating center, intended smoking behavior during therapy (smoking vs nonsmoking), and\n      planned total radiotherapy dose.\n\n      Patients are randomized to receive radiotherapy once daily, 5 days a week, at one of two of\n      the following times of the day:\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive radiotherapy between 8 and 10 AM (local time).\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive radiotherapy between 4 and 6 PM (local time). Treatment\n           continues for 5-8 weeks, depending on planned total radiotherapy dose, in the absence\n           of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.\n\n      Toxicity is assessed at baseline, at the first fraction of radiotherapy, weekly during\n      treatment, weekly until mucositis has peaked and is improving, and then every 2 weeks until\n      mucositis has improved to less than grade 2.\n\n      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, weekly during treatment and until toxicity has\n      peaked and is improving, every 2 weeks until toxicity is less than grade 2 mucositis, and\n      then at each follow-up visit until week 24.\n\n      Patients are followed at weeks 2-3, 6-8, 12, and 24 and then annually for 3 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 216 patients (108 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this\n      study."
