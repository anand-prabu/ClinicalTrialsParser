Group 1 receives cysteine\n      hydrochloride in drug ingestion period 1 followed by placebo in period 2.  Group 2 receives\n      placebo in period 1 followed by cysteine hydrochloride in period 2.  Both groups ingest\n      placebo for 1 week between the periods.  Each drug ingestion period lasts 8 weeks.\n\n      Follow up phone calls are made at the end of months 1 and 3.  All patients schedule follow\n      up visits at the end of each drug ingestion period."
