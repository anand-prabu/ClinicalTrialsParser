Any other center willing to participate is provided with\n      all the documents to receive its local Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval, and a\n      'local responsible' (LR) is nominated to co-ordinate the project and to be responsible of\n      data collection locally.\n\n      Centers receiving  IRB approval collect data about different types of procedure (adult major\n      and minor surgery, pediatric surgery, obstetric anesthesia, pain management). Data are\n      collected on a specifically designed form, and every center quarterly sent the promoter\n      centre a report including general data and a specific report for every occurred\n      complication.\n\n      Eligibility criteria\n\n      Investigators collect the total number of intervention and the number of regional\n      anesthesia(RA) techniques performed . Patients recorded as \"case\" and \"controls\" had to sign\n      a specifical informed consent. For pediatric patients and patients not able to sign for any\n      reason, a specific form is included in the document, to be signed by parents or any\n      legally-established tutor, as required for every clinical procedure or scientific trial in\n      our country.\n\n      General data\n\n      Total number of interventions, the number of central neuraxial block (CNBs), peripheral\n      nerve blocks (PNBs) and continuous PNBs (CPNBs) performed. CNBs are classified as epidurals,\n      combined spinal-epidurals (CSEs), subarachnoid. PNBs and cPNBs are divided into\n      ultrasound-guided, nerve stimulation-guided and blind techniques.\n\n      Specific data - report for complications\n\n      For each complication a specific report is sent for data analysis, including data concerning\n      cases (patient with complication) and controls (the two following patients undergoing the\n      same type of loco-regional technique).\n\n      Reports are slightly different for CNBs and (c)PNBs. For every patient, the investigators\n      register demographic data (age, ASA-American Society of Anesthesiologists- status, height\n      and weight), data regarding surgical technique (type of surgery,\n      open/video-laparoscopic/robotic approach, election/emergency surgery) and data regarding\n      anti-thromboembolic therapy (drugs, timing of suspension before/after blockade).\n\n      A second part of the report is strictly dedicated to the technique and to the type of\n      complication occurred (and, hence, different in central and peripheral blocks).\n\n      Statistical analysis\n\n      Study population is estimated basing on previous studies of major complications after CNBs,\n      which indicate an incidence of major adverse effects of 4.2 on 100.000 patients. Estimating\n      an incidence of 1:25.000, a number of 25.000 procedures was calculated to be needed for the\n      study, with a confidence interval of 95%.  The primary endpoint was to assess cumulative\n      incidence of adverse effects, while a following case-control analysis will be performed to\n      identify possible risk factors."
