  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to compare induction of labor using a foley catheter
      bulb with a low dose of oxytocin versus a foley catheter bulb with an increasing dose of
      oxytocin.  A foley catheter bulb with or without oxytocin is a common method of labor
      induction in patients whose cervix is not significantly dilated or thinned out (effaced).
      Oxytocin (pitocin) is a medicine used to increase the number and strength of the womb's
      contractions.
