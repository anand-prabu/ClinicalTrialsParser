Assess the toxicity associated with repeated vaccination with recombinant vaccinia virus\n      expressing prostate-specific antigen (rV-PSA) in patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of\n      the prostate.\n\n      II. Determine the optimal dose of rV-PSA given at monthly intervals based on cellular and\n      hormonal immunity.\n\n      III. Determine whether vaccination with rV-PSA is associated with anti-tumor activity.\n\n      IV. Determine whether granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) has an\n      effect on cellular and humoral immunity different from rV-PSA, and whether the addition of\n      GM-CSF has enhanced antitumor effect compared to rV-PSA alone.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is an open label, dose escalation study.\n\n      Patients in cohorts of 3-6 receive 3 vaccinations with rV-PSA at 4-week intervals (days 1,\n      29, 57, and 85) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Response\n      assessment is performed at eight weeks. Patients who discontinue therapy prior to eight\n      weeks are considered unevaluable for response. If dose limiting toxicity is observed in 2 of\n      6 patients entered at a dose level, no further patients are entered at that level and the\n      MTD is defined as the preceding dose level.
