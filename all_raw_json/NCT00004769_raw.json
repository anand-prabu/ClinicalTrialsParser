Examine the interrelationships between muscle wasting (phenotype), the\n      degree of myotonic dystrophy (DM) gene expression (genotype) in patients with DM.\n\n      II.  Characterize the insulin resistance in these patients. III. Assess the glucose uptake\n      in the leg and forearm tissues of these patients.\n\n      IV.  Determine the stability of the DM gene lesion in muscles over a 5-10 year period."

Patients also receive dual x-ray\n      absorptiometry (DEXA) scan and total body potassium count to measure muscle mass.  Patients\n      undergo strength testing and physical fitness screening.  A needle biopsy is performed to\n      investigate the genetic alterations associated with this disease.\n\n      During the second 3-day hospital stay, patients receive an intravenous infusion of insulin,\n      stable isotopic glucose, and stable isotopic glycerol.\n\n      During the third 3-day hospital stay, a catheter is placed in the femoral artery, femoral\n      vein, and in each arm.  Patients receive an infusion of stable isotopic glucose, stable\n      isotopic phenylalanine, and insulin.  Measurements of the balance of amino acids and glucose\n      across the forearm and leg are completed.  Green dye is infused to measure blood flow in the\n      leg."
