    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and serum
      pharmacokinetics of CLG561 in subjects with advanced age-related macular degeneration.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be divided into 4 cohorts, with the subjects in each cohort being administered
      a single IVT dose of CLG561. Progress from one cohort to the next will be time-lagged to
      allow for safety review. Dosing will also be time-lagged within each cohort. Only one eye
      (designated as the study eye) will be dosed per subject. Post-dose safety assessments and
      ocular examination will commence immediately after the IVT injection and continue throughout
      the outpatient visits at pre-determined timepoints. Collection of post-injection blood
      samples will also begin after the IVT injection at pre-determined timepoints.
