  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the effectiveness of a multi-faceted communication
      intervention for family members of critically ill patients to reduce the family members'
      long-term symptoms of depression and anxiety.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One in four elderly Americans die in or shortly after discharge from an intensive care unit.
      An expanding body of literature documents that physician-family communication and
      end-of-life care is poor in intensive care units. These deficiencies are associated with
      high rates of adverse psychological outcomes among surrogates, physician-family conflict,
      and life support decisions that may be inconsistent with patients' goals and preferences.
      There is a lack of information on practical, generalizable interventions that effectively
      improve this important aspect of care for elderly patients and their families.

      The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a multifaceted
      communication intervention as compared to an educational control to improve psychological
      outcomes among family members of critically ill patients, using a randomized, controlled
      trial design.
