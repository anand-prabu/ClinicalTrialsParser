            "textblock": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in New Zealand (40% of all\n      deaths). 37% of New Zealanders suffer from high blood pressure (World Health Organisation\n      2008 figures), a well established modifiable risk factor for CVD. Above 115/75 mmHg, CVD\n      risk doubles for each increment of 20/10 mmHg that blood pressure is raised. An increase in\n      BMI and waist circumference has been associated with an increase in blood pressure. The\n      leaves of the olive plant are rich in plant compounds known as polyphenols. This particular\n      group of polyphenols are known secoiridoids, which are also present in olive oil and olives\n      though at lower concentrations, are only found in this family of plants. Diets high in\n      polyphenols have been found to reduce the risk of chronic diseases. Studies have shown that\n      consumption of phenolic-rich olive leaf extract (OLE) can significantly reduce blood\n      pressure in individuals suffering from high blood pressure (hypertension), with the\n      magnitude of effect being comparable to a commonly used antihypertensive drug. In such\n      trials OLE also resulted in an improved blood lipid (a reduction in total and LDL\n      cholesterol and triacylglycerides) which also reduces CVD risk. One study testing the effect\n      of OLE on individuals with mild or prehypertension (i.e. those with systolic blood pressure\n      in the range 121-139 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure in the range 81-89 mmHg but not\n      taking antihypertensive medication) also found these same improvements. OLE has been\n      indicated to have the potential to improve other cardiovascular risk markers such as\n      vascular function, inflammation, platelet aggregation, oxidation of LDL and glucose\n      tolerance however much of this evidence is derived from animal, in vitro and ex vivo studies\n      and so well designed and controlled human studies are required to verify that these findings\n      are applicable to humans. Therefore OLE supplementation may be a useful dietary strategy for\n      reducing CVD risk in a cohort of overweight prehypertensive individuals.\n\n      The aim of the study is to determine the effect of OLE intake on blood pressure and other\n      CVD risk markers in overweight subjects with mild hypertension and to link any study\n      outcomes with the presence of OLE phenolics in urine"
