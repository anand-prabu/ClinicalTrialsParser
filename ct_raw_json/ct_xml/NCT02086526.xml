  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigator's global hypothesis is that women with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) can
      be separated into subtypes based on their response to metformin.  The investigators propose
      here to use both targeted and non-targeted metabolomic approach to identify pathways
      associated with metformin's effect on insulin sensitivity and endothelial function. This
      pilot project will be the foundation for developing tailored therapeutic approaches to
      Polycystic Ovary Syndrome and identifying novel drug targets.

      The investigators propose to use both targeted and non-targeted metabolomic approaches to
      identify pathways associated with metformin's effect on insulin sensitivity, weight,
      androgens and endothelial function.  This project will be the foundation for developing
      tailored therapeutic approaches to Polycystic Ovary Syndrome and identifying novel drug
      targets.  This pilot project is intended to inform the development of hypothesis and
      specific aims for a future grant application to National Institutes of Health (NIH).
