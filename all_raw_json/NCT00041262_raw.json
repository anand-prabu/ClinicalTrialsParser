Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. It is\n      not yet known which regimen of combination chemotherapy is more effective in treating\n      esophageal cancer.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of two regimens of\n      combination chemotherapy in treating patients who are undergoing surgery for esophageal\n      cancer."

Patients are randomized to one of two\n      treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I (Standard chemotherapy): Patients receive cisplatin IV over 4 hours on days 1-4\n           and fluorouracil IV continuously on days 1-4. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 2\n           courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n        -  Arm II (Infusional chemotherapy): Patients receive cisplatin IV over 4 hours on day 1,\n           epirubicin IV on day 1, and fluorouracil IV continuously. Treatment repeats every 21\n           days for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Patients undergo surgery 4-6 weeks after the last dose of fluorouracil in arm I or anytime\n      after the fluorouracil infusion is completed in arm II.\n\n      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, immediately before starting the last course of\n      chemotherapy, immediately before surgery, 6 weeks post-operatively, and at 6, 9, 12, 18, and\n      24 months after randomization.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 5 years, and then\n      annually thereafter.\n\n      Peer Reviewed and Funded or Endorsed by Cancer Research UK\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 1,300 patients (650 per treatment arm) will be accrued for\n      this study."
