      OUTLINE:  This is a multi-center trial.

      SEQUENCING:

      DNA from archived tumor samples collected at the time of surgery (residual disease post
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy) will be extracted and sequenced. The resulting sequencing data
      will be interrogated for known genomic drivers of sensitivity or resistance to existing FDA
      approved agents.

      CANCER GENOMICS TUMOR BOARD (CGTB):

      Realizing that optimal treatment recommendations cannot be made based on sequencing data
      alone, the CGTB will be responsible for the final treatment recommendation. The CGTB will
      consider the genomic data along with the patient's prior treatment history, ongoing
      toxicities, and comorbidities. Preference will be given to the treatment identified by the
      sequencing data unless a significant clinical or safety contraindication exists for that
      therapy. All participants and investigators will be blinded to sequencing results and CGTB
      deliberations until the time of relapse.

      PARTICIPANTS WITH A CGTB TREATMENT RECOMMENDATION:

      Participants with a CGTB recommendation will be randomized to Experimental Arm A
      (genomically directed monotherapy) or Control Arm B (standard therapy).

      EXPERIMENTAL ARM A (GENOMICALLY DIRECTED MONOTHERAPY):

      Participants randomized to Experimental Arm A will receive an FDA approved drug at standard
      dose for four cycles (12-16 weeks total duration, depending on cycle length).  Clinical and
      laboratory monitoring and dose-reductions will follow the FDA package insert guidelines.

      TOP GENOMIC ACTIONABLE BIOMARKERS/PATHWAYS AND DRUG RECOMMENDATIONS:

        1. PIK3CA, PTEN:  Everolimus

        2. TOP2A:           Doxorubicin

        3. PARP1, BRCA1:  Cisplatin

        4. VEGFA:           Bevacizumab

        5. TYMP:    Capecitabine

        6. SSTR2:    Octreotide

        7. MGMT:          Temozolomide

        8. MYC:            Paclitaxel

        9. EGFR:    Cetuximab

       10. COX2:    Celecoxib

       11. hENT:    Gemcitabine

       12. MET:    Crizotinib

      CONTROL ARM B (STANDARD THERAPY); Currently no standard therapy has proven efficacy in this
      patient population and thus follow-up alone would be considered standard of care. Additional
      therapy is permitted, however, if deemed appropriate by the treating physician.   In the
      event of disease progression on the control arm, patient sequencing results will be
      forwarded to the treating physician.

      PARTICIPANTS WITH NO CGTB RECOMMENDATION:

      Participants may have no CGTB recommendation either because 1) sequencing did not identify a
      matched drug or 2) the matched drug was contraindicated. These participants will be assigned
      to Control Arm B and treated as described above for Control Arm B. As the outcome of
      participants without an 'actionable' genomically directed therapy may differ, the primary
      analysis will include only participants randomized to Control Arm B.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Must have histologically or cytologically confirmed triple negative (ER-/PR-/HER2-)
             invasive breast cancer, clinical stage I-III at diagnosis (AJCC 6th edition) based on
             initial evaluation by physical examination and/or breast imaging prior to study
             registration. NOTE:  ER, PR and HER2 status will be confirmed by central pathology
             review prior to randomization. ER and PR will be considered negative if ≤ 1% of cells
             stain weakly positive. HER2 will be considered negative if scored 0 or 1+ by
             immunohistochemistry (IHC) or 2+ by IHC associated with a fluorescence in situ
             hybridization (FISH) ratio of &lt; 2.0 or &lt; 6 copies per cell.

          -  Must have completed preoperative (neoadjuvant) chemotherapy. NOTE: Acceptable
             preoperative regimens include an anthracycline or a taxane, or both. Participants who
             received preoperative therapy as part of a clinical trial may enroll. Participants
             may not have received adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery prior to randomization.
             Bisphosphonate use is allowed.

          -  Must have completed definitive resection of primary tumor. The most recent surgery
             for breast cancer must have been completed at least 14 days prior (but no more than
             84 days prior) to study registration. NOTE: Negative margins for both invasive and
             ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) are desirable, however participants with positive
             margins may enroll if the treatment team believes no further surgery is possible and
             patient has received radiotherapy. Participants with margins positive for lobular
             carcinoma in situ (LCIS) are eligible. Either mastectomy or breast conserving surgery
             (including lumpectomy or partial mastectomy) is acceptable.

          -  Must have significant residual invasive disease at the time of definitive surgery
             following preoperative chemotherapy.  Significant residual disease is defined as at
             least one of the following:

               1. Residual Cancer Burden (RBC) classification II or III6

               2. Residual invasive disease in the breast measuring at least 2 cm. The presence of
                  DCIS without invasion does not qualify as residual disease in the breast.

               3. Residual invasive disease in the breast measuring at least 1cm with lymph node
                  involvement (does not include metastases in lymph node which are only detected
                  by immunohistochemistry).

          -  Must have an FFPE tumor block with tumor cellularity of 20% or greater. NOTE: Prior
             to randomization, the tumor cellularity will be confirmed by central pathology review
             and percent values will be double checked at Paradigm (a Next Generation Sequencing
             Company).

          -  Whole breast radiotherapy is required for participants who underwent breast
             conserving therapy, including lumpectomy or partial mastectomy. Participants must
             have completed radiotherapy at least 14 days prior (but no more than 84 days prior)
             to study registration.NOTE: Post-mastectomy radiotherapy is required for all
             participants with a primary tumor ≥ 5 cm or involvement of ≥ 4 lymph nodes. For
             participants with primary tumors &lt; 5 cm or with &lt; 4 involved lymph nodes, provision
             of post-mastectomy radiotherapy is at the discretion of the treating physician.

          -  Participants must register within 84 days of surgery (for those participants who do
             not require radiation) or within 84 days of completion of radiation when radiation is
             required.

          -  Age ≥ 18 years at the time of consent.

          -  Written informed consent and HIPAA authorization for release of personal health
             information.  HIPAA authorization may be included in the informed consent or may be
             obtained separately.  NOTE: Central pathology review may be conducted any time after
             definitive surgery. Consenting participants may be pre-registered to the study and
             proceed with central pathology review before full eligibility has been confirmed.
             However ALL of the eligibility criteria must be met and formal study registration
             completed prior to submission of the sample for sequencing.

          -  Must consent to allow submission of adequate archived tumor tissue sample from
             definitive surgery for genomic assessment of tumor.

          -  Must consent to collection of whole blood samples for genomic analysis

          -  Women and men of childbearing potential must be willing to use an effective method of
             contraception (e.g. hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) from the
             time consent is signed until 4 weeks after protocol therapy discontinuation.

          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 14 days
             prior to study registration.   NOTE:  Women are considered not of child bearing
             potential if they are surgically sterile (they have undergone a hysterectomy,
             bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy) or they are postmenopausal for
             at least 12 consecutive months.

          -  Women must not be breastfeeding.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  No stage IV (metastatic) disease, however no specific staging studies are required in
             the absence of symptoms or physical exam findings that would suggest distant disease.

          -  No treatment with any investigational agent within 30 days prior to study
             registration.

          -  No history of chronic hepatitis B or C.

          -  No clinically significant infections as judged by the treating physician.
