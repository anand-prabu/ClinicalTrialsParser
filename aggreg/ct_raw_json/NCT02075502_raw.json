The investigators will test the hypothesis that PAD\n      patients randomized to the exercise program in the community setting incorporating TMC+ will\n      improve walking ability compared with patients who receive the standard of care (exercise\n      advice). Secondary hypotheses include an improvement in claudication onset time (COT),\n      patient-reported outcomes, peak oxygen consumption, functional ability, and an increase in\n      total volume of activity and adherence to exercise (measured with activity monitors) for\n      patients in the TMC+ group. An additional secondary hypothesis is a significant improvement\n      in outcomes for patients receiving a combination of endovascular therapy (ET) and\n      community-based walking exercise."
