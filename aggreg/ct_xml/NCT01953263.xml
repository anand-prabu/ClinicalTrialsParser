  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the safety of autologous muscle fiber fragments for the
      treatment of urinary incontinence due to incompetent outlet (bladder neck/urethra).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible subjects with a diagnosis of urinary incontinence who give consent to take part
      will undergo a biopsy of the muscle from the inner thigh under anesthesia.  During the same
      procedure, muscle fiber fragments will be obtained from the sample and then immediately
      delivered via target injected into the bladder neck sphincter region using an endoscopic
      needle via cystoscope or under ultrasound guidance.  All subjects will be followed at 1
      week, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months post-treatment injection.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult female patients who are not pregnant or lactating/breast-feeding and must be

             method of birth control as determined by the investigator

          -  Patients between the ages of 18 and 75 years

          -  Patients with positive diagnosis of urinary incontinence due to sphincter
             insufficiency caused by acquired (e.g., stress urinary incontinence) and/or
             congenital conditions.

          -  Patients with cystometric capacity of bladder &gt; 100 ml

          -  Patients with normal renal function

          -  Patients with a history of primary incontinence

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a history of hypercontractile bladder, non-compliant bladder,
             hydronephrosis or neurogenic bladder

          -  Patients with an active urinary tract infection as evidenced by positive urine
             culture

          -  Patients who are taking medication that affect urination such as prescription drugs,
             over-the-counter drugs, or dietary supplements, including herbal supplements and
             those taken with teas

          -  Patients requiring concomitant use of or treatment with immunosuppressive agents

          -  Patients with a history of systemic conditions, including but not limited to HIV,
             diabetes and chronic liver disease (including Hepatitis B or C), that the
             Investigator believes may jeopardize the safety of the patient to participate in the
             study

          -  Patients with evidence or diagnosis of any primary muscle disease or coagulation
             disorder (including concomitant anti-coagulation therapy)

          -  Patients who have been treated with any other investigational drug or participated in
             any investigational study within 30 days prior to enrollment in this study

          -  Patients who have been treated with any cellular therapy within 12 months prior to
             enrollment in this study

          -  Patients with urinary incontinence other than the categories being investigated

          -  Patients with significant (&gt;grade 2) pelvic organ prolapse

          -  Patients with vaginal prolapse beyond introitus

          -  Patients with neurological disorders

          -  Patients with abnormal bladder capacity (i.e., less than 100 cc)

          -  Patients with abnormal urologic conditions, including post-void residual, urethral
             stricture and bladder neck contracture, spastic bladder, vesicoureteral reflux,
             bladder stones, bladder tumors, hydronephrosis, other renal impairment
