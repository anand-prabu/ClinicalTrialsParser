Develop a clinically and psychosocially responsive SCP-breast cancer survivors (SCP-BCS)\n      template in English and English-Spanish adopted from American Society of Clinical Oncology\n      (ASCO)-SCP.\n\n      II. Assess the acceptability, utility and format preference (electronic vs paper) of the\n      SCP-BCS template.\n\n      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\n\n      ARM I: Participants receive SCP-BCS template booklet and receive counseling sessions with a\n      patient navigator for 40 minutes twice weekly for 4 sessions.\n\n      ARM II: Participants receive SCP-BCS template booklet and receive standard follow-up care.\n\n      After completion so study treatment, participants are followed up at 6 and 12 months."
