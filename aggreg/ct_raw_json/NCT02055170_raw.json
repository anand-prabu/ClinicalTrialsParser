This information may be of\n      benefit for future treatment strategies, prevention and control.\n\n      In this study, the protein where testosterone binds, called the androgen receptor (AR), will\n      be measured in samples from the patient's biopsy and surgical tumor samples. The\n      investigators will look at a marker of how fast the cancer is growing (Ki67) before using\n      finasteride from your biopsy specimen. Finasteride will be taken from the day of consent\n      until the day of the patient's surgery. This marker will be measured again after using\n      finasteride from the surgical specimen. The investigators will be looking for a decrease in\n      the Ki67 from the patient's biopsy specimen to the surgical specimen as an indicator that\n      this medication is blocking tumour growth."
