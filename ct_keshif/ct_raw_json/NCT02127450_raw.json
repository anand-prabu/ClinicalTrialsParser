Two mechanisms of resistance to CARBA have been identified:\n      membrane impermeability associated with ESBL or cephalosporinase production and\n      carbapenemase (CARBase) production. When CARBase production is suspected or proved, specific\n      hygiene measures have to be applied in any hospital in order to avoid the dissemination of\n      the CARBase-producing strain and insure patient safety. Prevalence rate of non-susceptible\n      (NS) isolates to CARB, the proportion of the two types of mechanisms of resistance to CARB\n      and the factors associated with CARB- NS isolates are still unknown in France. Moreover,\n      detecting CARBase in the routine in any laboratory is difficult. Providing data regarding\n      all of these points will be useful for any hospital and will permit to optimize the\n      management of the patients suspected or proved to harbor a CARBase-producing\n      Enterobacteriaceae isolate."
