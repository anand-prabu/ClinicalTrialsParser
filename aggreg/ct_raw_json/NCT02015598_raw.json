And it was\n      postulated that intermittent hypoxia seems to resemble ischemia-reperfusion.Many study\n      suggest that ischemia-reperfusion represents an oxidative stress causing increased\n      generation of reactive oxygen species, especially superoxide anions.It is one of the most\n      important mechanisms of cardiovascular diseases, including hypertension, coronary artery\n      disease and cerebrovascular accident complication with OSAS.So many individuals approve OSAS\n      is an Oxidative Stress disease.\n\n      Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the first-line of treatment method in\n      moderate/severe OSA.But poor adherence to CPAP treatment is very common.The failure rate\n      with CPAP treatment is more than 50%.So we are searching a new treatment for that patients.\n      Carbocysteine is a antioxidant.It can not only scavenges the free radicals but also\n      replenishes glutathione(GSH)which is has double antioxidant capacity. However, Carbocysteine\n      is cheaper than other which has double antioxidant capacity drugs,such as\n      N-acetylcysteine.The purpose is to evaluate efficacy of oral intake of Antioxidant\n      Carbocysteine witch can reduce oxidative stress and improve the symptom of OSAS.It recover\n      the imbalance in the oxidant-anti-oxidant status may reduce cardiovascular abnormalities in\n      Patients with OSAS."
