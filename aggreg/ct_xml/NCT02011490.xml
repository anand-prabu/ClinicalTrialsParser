  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the plasma pharmacokinetics of a single 4 mg/kg
      intravenous (IV) dose of sugammadex in participants with moderate and severe renal
      insufficiency compared to that in participants with normal renal function. The study
      consists of two parts. In Part 1, participants with renal insufficiency and healthy
      participants will be administered study drug by IV bolus injection into a peripheral vein.
      In Part 2, participants with renal insufficiency and healthy participants will be
      administered study drug as an IV bolus into a peripheral vein, through an IV catheter
      connected to IV tubing with injection port. Subjects who participate in Part 1 of study may
      be enrolled in Part 2, which would reduce the overall number of participants enrolled for
      the study.

          -  Donation of blood or significant blood loss within 56 days prior to dosing, or
             donation of plasma within 7 days prior to dosing

          -  Participation in another clinical trial within 28 days prior to dosing

          -  No participant may be enrolled more than once within Part 1.  Subjects who
             participate in Part 1 of study may be enrolled in Part 2, but participants within
