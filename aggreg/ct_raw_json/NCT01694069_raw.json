            "textblock": "Cystic fibrosis is an inherited disorder leading to chronic pulmonary inflammation and\n      infection. A majority of people with cystic fibrosis have large quantities of bacteria\n      residing in their lungs. One of the most common and harmful bacteria is called Pseudomonas\n      aeruginosa.\n\n      Patients with cystic fibrosis require frequent therapy with intravenous (I.V.) antibiotics\n      to treat lung infections thought to be caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. One of the\n      antibiotics frequently used to treat this bacteria is piperacillin-tazobactam.\n      Piperacillin-tazobactam is thought to be the most effective when there is a constant level\n      of drug in the body. The standard way to administer piperacillin-tazobactam is to give\n      several grams 4 times each day as a 30 minute infusion. An alternative way to give\n      piperacillin-tazobactam is by a continuous infusion; a continuous infusion will make it more\n      likely that drug will remain at a constant level in the body. The objective of this study is\n      to determine if administering piperacillin-tazobactam as a continuous infusion is more\n      effective at treating people having a pulmonary exacerbation of cystic fibrosis than a\n      standard 30 minute infusion, 4 times a day."

If\n      deemed appropriate, patients may be discharged to home where they will continue to receive\n      blinded treatment via an infusion pump.
