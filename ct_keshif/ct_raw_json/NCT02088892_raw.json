            "textblock": "Currently, to assess vaccine efficacy against tuberculosis (TB) there is no alternative to\n      large randomized controlled trials. These efficacy trials for novel TB vaccines are\n      difficult, long and very costly. For this reason there is an urgent need for a valid,\n      reliable, and strong correlate of protection which can help distinguish between candidate TB\n      vaccines undergoing phase I trials, and thereby allow the vaccine development field to\n      advance more quickly, and in a more cost-effective manner.\n\n      This study aims to address the current lack of immunological correlates in the TB vaccine\n      field. As an alternative to phase II field trials, human challenge models can provide an\n      evaluation of preliminary efficacy of vaccine candidates. Challenge models, with their\n      concept of deliberate infectious challenge of human volunteers, have been well established\n      for pathogens such as malaria, typhoid and dengue, and these models have greatly facilitated\n      vaccine development. At present there is no safe human challenge model of Mycobacterium\n      tuberculosis (M. tb) infection to enable proof-of-concept efficacy evaluation of candidate\n      vaccines.\n\n      Whilst scientists cannot use M. tb as a challenge agent to evaluate efficacy in a clinical\n      trial for safety and ethical reasons, they can use another mycobacterium, attenuated\n      Mycobacterium bovis, as a surrogate for M. tb infection. Attenuated Mycobacterium bovis is\n      the mycobacterial strain in BCG and is safe to use in humans. An effective vaccine against\n      M. tb should also be effective against BCG. After injection into humans, BCG replicates, and\n      an effective TB vaccine should reduce this BCG replication. The BCG challenge model is based\n      on this premise. In the human BCG challenge model, BCG is administered intradermally and the\n      degree of BCG growth suppression is quantified by analysing the tissue obtained in a punch\n      biopsy of volunteers' skin over the BCG 'challenge' site.\n\n      This study aims to use two different strains of BCG, each at standard and high dose, to\n      optimise this BCG challenge model."
