To compare these\n      treatments, the investigators use 1998 published Leppilahti-score, Rand-36 quality of\n      life-questionnaire and MRI. The Leppilahti-score includes both subjective and objective\n      items (pain, stiffness, subjective calf muscle weakness, footwear restrictions, active range\n      of motion between ankles, subjective result, isokinetic calf muscle strength). The\n      investigators also study MRI-imaging for both legs and compare including achilles tendon\n      elongation and muscle volume correlations to Leppilahti-score results between these two\n      treatments. Follow-up time is 18 months.\n\n      Hypothesis is that operative treatment offers no benefit in comparison conservative\n      treatment, with identical rehabilitation protocol."
