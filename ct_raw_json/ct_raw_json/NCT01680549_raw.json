Gabapentin, however, has never been studied, to the investigators\n      knowledge, in a prospective randomized fashion in the United States for total knee\n      arthroplasty.  This study will be the first of its kind to truly compare the effects of\n      gabapentin, a drug that has been proven safe in many other areas of medicine, with placebo\n      for total knee arthroplasty by analyzing post-operative narcotic usage, function and sleep\n      quality."
