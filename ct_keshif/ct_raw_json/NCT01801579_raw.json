            "textblock": "Two methods are mainly used to determine the blood pressure at rest, in a non-invasive way,\n      in order to calculate the Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI). The first method, using a manual\n      sphygmomanometer coupled with a Doppler probe, is considered as the reference method. The\n      second method requires at least one automatic sphygmomanometer. Data from the literature\n      show that these two methods are reproducible to assess ABI at rest. Some authors have\n      reported a better reproducibility of measurements with automatic tool. Others consider that\n      the current accuracy of automatic measurement is insufficient to replace the reference\n      method Doppler. Thus, the aime of the present study is to evaluate whether automatic\n      assessment of ABI is as reliable and reproducible as the manual method."
