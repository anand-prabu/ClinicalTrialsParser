The study\n      hypothesis is that vitamin D deficiency (\u226417.5nmol/L) is frequently associated with\n      osteomalacia and will cause low BMD estimation in DXA scan due to insufficient bone\n      mineralization.\n\n      We assume that among these postmenopausal women, Vitamin D treatment will improve bone\n      mineralization and will cause a rapid increase in BMD.  According to the results,\n      bisphosphonates therapy may be an unnecessary treatment.\n\n      The objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of severe vitamin D deficiency and its\n      correction on Bone Mineral Density (BMD) in postmenopausal women."
