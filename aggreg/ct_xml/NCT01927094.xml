    <textblock>
      -  Acute diarrhea continues to be a major cause of childhood morbidity and mortality in
           developed and developing countries.

        -  Prevention and treatment of dehydration are the mainstays of therapy. Rehydration can
           be achieved with oral rehydratation solution (ORS).

        -  Even though ORS has reduced the mortality and morbidity very significantly, it has no
           effect on the duration of diarrhea, stool consistency and frequency and remains
           underused.

        -  ESPGHAN and ESPID published together an evidence based guideline and stated that in the
           management of acute gastroenteritis rehydration is the key treatment and that selected
           probiotics may reduce the duration and intensity of symptoms and can be used as an
           adjuvant to ORS.

        -  Current evidence also indicates that probiotic effects are strain-specific.
           Lactobacillus GG and Saccharomyces boulardii  are the best studied strains. However,
           more research is needed to guide the use of particular probiotic regimens and strains
           and as there is still no evidence of efficacy for many preparations.

      Acute diarrhea continues to be a major cause of childhood morbidity and mortality in
      developed and developing countries. Prevention and treatment of dehydration are the
      mainstays of therapy. Rehydration can be achieved with oral rehydratation solution (ORS).
      Even though ORS has reduced the mortality and morbidity very significantly, it has no effect
      on the duration of diarrhea, stool consistency and frequency and remains underused. ESPGHAN
      and ESPID published together an evidence based guideline and stated that in the management
      of acute gastroenteritis rehydration is the key treatment and that selected probiotics may
      reduce the duration and intensity of symptoms and can be used as an adjuvant to ORS. A
      recent Cochrane review including 56 trials in children concluded that speciÔ¨Åc probiotics
      reduce the duration of diarrhea with about 24 hours and decrease the frequency of defecation
      on the second day. Current evidence also indicates that probiotic effects are
      strain-specific. Lactobacillus LGG and Saccharomyces boulardii  are the best studied
      strains. However, more research is needed to guide the use of particular probiotic regimens
      and strains and as there is still no evidence of efficacy for many preparations. The aim of
      this study was to evaluate effects of different probiotics on the duration of acute
      infectious diarrhea.
