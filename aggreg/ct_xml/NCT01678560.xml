  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) among Veterans is a condition that imparts a great burden to
      the patient in terms of serious co-morbidities and results in a great cost to the VA Health
      Care System to treat the co-morbidities, which include heart disease, stroke and
      neuropsychiatric disorders.  Positive airway pressure (PAP) is used to treat sleep apnea and
      studies have shown a poor adherence to treatment.  The investigators hypothesize that using
      wireless technology will lead to early detection of problems of treatment use and will
      translate into early remedial action which will improve the use and effectiveness of
      treatment, and markedly reduce cost to the VA system.  The investigators will compare two
      technologies; storing the data on secure digital cards to follow the patient versus  using
      secure wireless technology to gather the data, a cloud system to store the data, and staff
      that would be notified in the event of anomalies in treatment use or effectiveness.
