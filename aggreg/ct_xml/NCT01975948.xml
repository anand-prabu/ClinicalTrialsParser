  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Department of Health and Wellness (DHW), along with key stakeholders, are ready to
      launch a demonstration project for another deliverable of the province's mental health and
      addictions strategy, &quot;Together We Can&quot;. The demonstration project is for the Adult Mental
      Health Module of the Practice Support Program (PSP), a training program for family
      physicians developed by family physicians.

      The investigators will be completing a randomized control trial to determine the
      program/tools effectiveness, its power to reduce stigma and its ability to increase the
      comfort level of physicians in providing treatment to those living with mental illness in a
      primary care setting.

      110 Nova Scotia family physicians along with their medical office assistants administrative
      assistants/secretaries will participate to evaluate this program before deciding on whether
      or not it will be implemented on a more permanent basis in Nova Scotia.

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The PHQ-9, developed by Drs. Robert L. Spitzer, Janet B.W. Williams specifically for primary care settings is a self-report instrument which takes only a few minutes to complete. The tool is highly sensitive and specific for the diagnosis of depression, and covers the nine symptom-based DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual) and DSM-5 criteria for major depression. It can also produce dimensional symptom severity ratings. The scale covers a two week time frame, essentially covering current rather than past episodes. The PHQ-9 has been extensively validated and is widely used in primary care as a screening instrument and for monitoring treatment outcomes. A PHQ-9 score &gt;10 has a sensitivity for major depression of 88%, and a specificity of 88%, and a positive likelihood ratio of 7.1.</description>

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>As a measure of occupational functioning, Lam's Employment Absence and Productivity Scale (LEAPS) will be used  . This scale was developed in Canada to assess the workplace impact of major depression.  LEAPS displayed excellent internal consistency as assessed by Cronbach's alpha:  0.89. During scale development, validity was assessed by comparing the LEAPS to the other clinical and work functioning scales, where it showed excellent concordant validity.</description>

    <description>The principal components of the program include: (1) training and (2) practice support.
Training is delivered in three half day workshop-style sessions conducted over a 24 week period.
Practice support is two-fold
Through 3 tools which provide an Assessment tool and 3 different evidence based Supported Self Management tools : 1.  The Cognitive Behavioral Interpersonal Skills Manual  2. The Bounceback program led by the Canadian Mental Health Association, British Columbia Division, which consists of a telephone delivered evidence-based skills program designed to help adults experiencing symptoms of mild to moderate depression 3. The Antidepressant Skills Workbook for patients with mild and moderate depression.
Through a practice support coordinator to ensure participants receive as much benefit as possible throughout the training period and have the guidance they need to incorporate newly acquired tools, skills, and processes into their every-day practice workflow</description>
