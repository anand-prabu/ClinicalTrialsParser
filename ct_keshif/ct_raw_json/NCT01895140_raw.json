We will assess the effectiveness, safety, economic attractiveness and feasibility\n      of implementation of renal nerve denervation for treatment resistant hypertension. This will\n      involve a new model of care which will include a multi-disciplinary team approach to these\n      patients.  Treatment resistant hypertension is defined as patients with uncontrolled\n      hypertension despite being on optimal doses of 3 or more anti-hypertensive medications.\n      Patients will be randomized to either standard treatment or renal nerve denervation and\n      followed for 6 months to determine impact on blood pressure."
