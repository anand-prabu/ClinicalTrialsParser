      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the use of the Aurora Ablation System in
      reducing menstrual blood loss at 12 months post-treatment.  The occurrence of adverse events
      will be assessed along with an assessment of the reduction of uterine bleeding as measured
      by a pictorial blood loss assessment chart (PBLAC) or menstrual diary.

          6. Presence of bacteremia, sepsis, or other active systemic infection

          7. Active infection of the genitals, vagina, cervix, uterus or urinary tract at the time

             section)

         13. Previous endometrial ablation procedure
