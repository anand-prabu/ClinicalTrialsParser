After the DBS system is optimized (during which\n             time the overall medication dose may be reduced to avoid discomfort and complications\n             such as dyskinesias) the medication dose should remain unchanged, if possible, for\n             the duration of the study.\n\n          -  Treatment with carbidopa/levodopa, and with a dopamine agonist at the maximal\n             tolerated doses as determined by a movement disorders neurologist.\n\n          -  Ability and willingness to return for study visits, at the initial programming and\n             after three, six and twelve months of DBS.\n\n          -  Age > 18\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  Subjects with significant cognitive impairment and/or dementia as determined by a\n             standardized neuropsychological battery.\n\n          -  Subjects with clinically active depression, defined according to the Diagnostic and\n             Statistical manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) criteria and as\n             scored on a validated depression assessment scale.\n\n          -  Subjects with very advanced Parkinson's disease, Hoehn and Yahr stage 5 on medication\n             (non-ambulatory).\n\n          -  Age > 80.\n\n          -  Subjects with an implanted electronic device such as a neurostimulator, cardiac\n             pacemaker/defibrillator or medication pump.\n\n          -  Subjects, who are pregnant, are capable of becoming pregnant, or who are breast\n             feeding.\n\n          -  Patients with cortical atrophy out of proportion to age or focal brain lesions that\n             could indicate a non-idiopathic movement disorder as determined by MRI\n\n          -  Subjects having a major comorbidity increasing the risk of surgery (prior stroke,\n             severe hypertension, severe diabetes, or need for chronic anticoagulation other than\n             aspirin).\n\n          -  Subjects having any prior intracranial surgery.\n\n          -  Subjects with a history of seizures.\n\n          -  Subjects, who are immunocompromised.\n\n          -  Subjects with an active infection.\n\n          -  Subjects, who require diathermy, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), or transcranial\n             magnetic stimulation (TMS) to treat a chronic condition.\n\n          -  Subjects, who have an inability to comply with study follow-up visits.\n\n          -  Subjects, who are unable to understand or sign the informed consent"
