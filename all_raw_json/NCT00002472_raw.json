Treatment continues every 3 weeks for 4 courses in the absence of disease\n      progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of 4 courses, patients with\n      nongerminoma who achieve complete response (CR) and all patients with germinoma proceed to\n      radiotherapy. After completion of 4 courses, patients with nongerminoma who achieve less\n      than CR undergo resection of any residual cranial masses, if feasible, and then proceed to\n      radiotherapy. Patients who experience disease progression or unacceptable toxicity during\n      chemotherapy are restaged and proceed directly to radiotherapy.\n\n      Beginning a minimum of 3 weeks after completion of the last course of chemotherapy and after\n      recovering from any toxic effects of chemotherapy, eligible patients undergo a regimen of\n      craniospinal axis irradiation and/or localized cranial or spinal field irradiation based on\n      histology, extent of disease, and response to chemotherapy. Patients with gross spinal\n      meningeal disease after completion of chemotherapy undergo radiotherapy boost.\n\n      Patients are followed every 2 months for 1 year, every 4 months for 1 year, every 6 months\n      for 1 year, and then annually for 2 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-25 patients with germinoma will be accrued for this study\n      within 3-6 years. A total of 12-25 patients with nongerminoma will be accrued for this study\n      within 6-12 years."
