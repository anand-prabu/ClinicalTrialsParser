Highly\n             effective methods of birth control are defined as those which result in a low failure\n             rate (i.e. less than 1% per year) when used consistently correctly such as\n             sterilisation, implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives, some IUDs\n             (hormonal), sexual abstinence or vasectomised partner.\n\n          3. Subjects who are receiving WHO step II or Step III analgesic medication who have\n             constipation induced, or worsened by their opioid medication, as shown by\n\n               1. the subject's medical need of regular intake of laxatives to have at least 3\n                  bowel evacuations per week, or having less than 3 bowel evacuations when not\n                  taking a laxative, respectively.\n\n               2. the subject's self-assessment that their constipation was induced or worsened by\n                  their current pre-study opioid medication.\n\n          4. Documented history of moderate to severe, chronic cancer pain that requires around\n             the-clock opioid therapy (starting dose of oxycodone PR between 20-80 mg/day) & are\n             likely to benefit from WHO step III opioid therapy for the duration of the study.\n             Subjects must be willing to discontinue their current opioid analgesic routine.\n\n          5.

If subjects are\n             having their first cycle of chemotherapy during the 2 weeks before the screening\n             visit or during the double-blind phase of the study they should be excluded from the\n             study.\n\n          8.
