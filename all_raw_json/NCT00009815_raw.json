Combining more than one chemotherapy drug may kill more tumor\n      cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy in treating\n      patients who have advanced solid tumors."

            "textblock": "OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of etoposide when combined with fixed-\n      dose fluorouracil-uracil plus leucovorin calcium in patients with advanced solid tumors. II.\n      Determine possible side effects and toxicity of this regimen in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of etoposide. Patients receive oral etoposide daily\n      on days 1-10 and oral fluorouracil-uracil plus oral leucovorin calcium twice a day on days\n      1-21. Treatment repeats every 28 days for a maximum of 6 courses in the absence of\n      unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating\n      doses of etoposide until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined\n      as the dose preceding that at which 2 or more of 6 patients experience dose-limiting\n      toxicity. Patients are followed at 2 months and then periodically for survival.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 25-30 patients will be accrued for this study."
