This is comparable to the effect on\n      quality of life in patients with severe psoriasis of the skin as well as to  nodulocystic\n      acne patients before treatment with oral isotretinoin.\n\n      The clinical effect of Botulinum Toxin (Btx) A has been established in  three randomized\n      controlled trials (RCT) in axillary hyperhidrosis. One RCT has indicated a positive effect\n      in palmar hyperhidrosis.  Although there is increasing evidence that Btx A and B have a\n      similar effect on hyperhidrosis of other parts of the body (ie hyperhidrosis of the face,\n      trunk, groin and feet) which is reported in case-reports and open studies there is still a\n      great need for more controlled studies. This is why we will carry out this randomized,\n      double-blind, placebo-controlled study to investigate the clinical effect and safety of Btx\n      A in palmar, plantar and inguinal (groins/buttocks) hyperhidrosis and the clinical effect\n      and safety of Btx B in craniofacial and truncal hyperhidrosis, respectively. Besides using\n      the DLQI instrument we will also study Btx A/B to elucidate the impact of this treatment on\n      quality of life using a generic instrument, the effect on anxiety and depressive symptoms,\n      sweating, and patients\u00b4global assessment of therapy."
