Both groups will use assigned toothpaste currently\n      sold on the market. Both groups will each have an investigative mouth rinse to use as well.\n      Participants will have an equal chance of being assigned to any one of the three groups.\n\n      For the next 4 weeks, participants will use their assigned products according to the\n      directions provided. At Visit 1, participants will be supervised while they brush their\n      teeth to ensure they understand the directions. They will also have supervised use of the\n      products at Visit 2.\n\n      Results will be analyzed to assess whether the mouthwashes help to reduce tooth sensitivity\n      during the study."
