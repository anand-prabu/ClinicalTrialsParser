We will also try to find out if the\n      DPR will help patients recover faster from liver surgery.  Lastly, this study will also try\n      to find if direct peritoneal resuscitation decreases levels of signaling chemicals in the\n      blood called 'cytokines' and a protein called high-mobility group protein 1, which is known\n      to cause tissue damage."
