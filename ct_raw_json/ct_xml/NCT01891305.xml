  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the novel oral agent VT-1161 is safe and
      effective in treating patients with moderate - severe tinea pedis (also referred to as
      athletes foot).  VT-1161 has been designed to inhibit CYP51,  an enzyme essential for fungal
      growth.  Inhibition of CYP51 results in the accumulation of chemicals know to be toxic to
      the fungus.  CYP51 is the molecular target of the class of drugs referred to as 'azole
      antifungals'.  All currently approved azole drugs have poor selectivity for CYP51 and this
      results in many of the side effects associated with the azole antifungals.    The safety
      profile of the class similarly limits use in chronic treatment of non-life-threatening
      fungal infections.   A safer antifungal drug would improve treatment options for infections
      seen in otherwise healthy individuals where significant side-effect risks are unacceptable.
