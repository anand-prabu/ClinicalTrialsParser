      This phase II trial studies how well T cell depleted donor peripheral blood stem cell
      transplant works in preventing graft-versus-host disease in younger patients with high risk
      hematologic malignancies. Giving chemotherapy and total-body irradiation before a donor
      peripheral blood stem cell transplant helps stop the growth of cancer cells. It may also
      stop the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. When the healthy
      stem cells from a donor are infused into the patient they may help the patient's bone marrow
      make stem cells, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Sometimes the
      transplanted cells from a donor can make an immune response against the body's normal cells.
      Removing a subset of the T cells from the donor cells before transplant may stop this from
      happening.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Estimate the time to discontinuation of systemic immunosuppression in pediatric
      recipients of cluster of differentiation 45RA positive (CD45RA+) T cell-depleted peripheral
      blood stem cell transplant (PBSCT).

      II. Estimate the probability of graft failure in pediatric recipients of CD45RA+
      T-cell-depleted PBSCT.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Estimate and compare to an appropriate historical cohort the probability of chronic
      graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (National Institutes of Health [NIH] criteria) requiring
      treatment with systemic pharmacological immunosuppression in pediatric patients who receive
      CD45RA+ T cell depleted PBSC.

      II. Estimate the probability of acute GVHD grade II-IV.

      III. Estimate the probability of steroid refractory acute GVHD.

      IV. Evaluate immune reconstitution.

      V. Estimate the probability of transplant-related mortality by day 100.

      VI. Estimate the probability of relapse.

      OUTLINE:

      CONDITIONING REGIMEN: Patients undergo total body irradiation (TBI) twice daily (BID) on
      days -10 to -7, receive thiotepa intravenously (IV) over 4 hours on days -6 and -5 and
      fludarabine phosphate IV over 30 minutes on days -6 to -2.

      TRANSPLANT: Patients undergo CD34+ enriched, CD45RA+ T cell-depleted allogeneic PBSCT on day
      0.

      POST-TRANSPLANT IMMUNOSUPPRESSION: Patients receive tacrolimus IV hours or orally (PO) every
      12 hours beginning on day -1 and continuing through day 50 with taper. Patients also receive
      methotrexate IV on days 1, 3, 6, and 11.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for up to 5 years.

             other known liver function abnormality do not necessarily require GI consultation and
             may be included on the protocol

          -  Patients with a life expectancy &lt; 3 months from co-existing disease other than the
             leukemia or RAEB

          -  Donors who are HIV-1, HIV-2, human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV)-1, HTLV-2 seropositive

             21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1271 for donation of a HCT/product (P) will be

             need) or with 21 CFR 1271.65(b)(i) (allogeneic use in a first-degree or second-degree
