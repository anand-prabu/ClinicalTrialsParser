Our primary outcome is the frequency of adverse\n      events, particularly bladder and rectal complications, which may occur as a result of this\n      procedure. Secondarily, the study will allow us to begin to determine its effectiveness in\n      diminishing obstructive symptoms associated with BPH.\n\n      Duration of investigation\n\n      The investigation will enroll 30 patients, with a target enrollment period of less than 12\n      months. Each patient will be consented for follow-up up to 5 years, but each patient will\n      reach the first important safety endpoint 1 week after treatment and the first clinical\n      efficacy assessment 3 months after treatment.\n\n      Objectives\n\n      To determine the safety and effectiveness of prostate artery embolization for the treatment\n      of BPH.\n\n      Description of study type\n\n      This is a prospective observational non-comparative study of an initial cohort of 30\n      patients.\n\n      Study Population\n\n      The patients will be recruited from the urology practice at Georgetown University and from\n      other urologists in the area and by patient self-referral. The study also will be announced\n      on a study website, the content of which will be approved by the IRB at Georgetown\n      University Medical Center.\n\n      The primary outcome is the absence of complications to the bladder, rectum or other pelvic\n      structures detected in the first week after therapy. Each patient will be judged free of\n      these adverse events or not. For those with an adverse event, the complication will be\n      scored using the Society of Interventional Radiology (SIR) definitions. Descriptive\n      statistics will be used to summarize these events, along with patient demographics and\n      initial clinical status.\n\n      Appropriate parametric and non-parametric tests will be used to assess change in laboratory\n      measures, urine flowmetry parameters, and scores from the IPSS and IIEF. Changes in prostate\n      volumes and the estimated volume of devascularized tissue will be calculated for each\n      patient and outcomes from the different embolics will be compared. Appropriate paired\n      parametric and non-parametric tests will be used to determine statistical significance. A p\n      value of 0.05 will be considered statistically significant."
