One group exercised regularly (5 or more hours/week) before onset and continued\n      doing so with the same regularity (group A). The second group either did not perform\n      physical activity or did so sporadically (group S).\n\n      Consultations were initially performed on a weekly basis for the first month, then once a\n      month for the remaining period. In each consultation, patients were asked about diet\n      accomplishment, glycaemia monitoring, insulin injections and exercise performance. All\n      individuals from group A declared to practice regularly intervallic routines, playing team\n      sports (basketball for n=1 and soccer for n=6). Only one individual declared to perform\n      aerobic exercise (long distance running and swimming). At the end of the first year a second\n      blood sample was extracted in the same conditions from each individual to determine the same\n      parameters. Exercise routine accomplishment and follow-up of diet and insulin injections was\n      followed monthly during one more year. At the end of this period, the study was considered\n      finished and the last blood extraction was performed in order to measure the same\n      parameters. Other subjects were excluded because they were not capable to provide data\n      required for study follow up."
