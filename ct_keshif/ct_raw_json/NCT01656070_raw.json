            "textblock": "There is increasing evidence that hypovitaminosis D is common in the general population.\n\n      Low dietary intake of vitamin D and reduced exposure to sunlight are probably the major risk\n      factors.  A high prevalence of hypovitaminosis D has been described in HIV-infected  adults,\n      and children. HIV infection itself and antiretroviral (ARV) treatment may be responsible for\n      alteration of vitamin D metabolism.  For instance, studies have shown a significant decrease\n      in serum 25-hydroxyvitamin-D [25(OH)D] concentration in adults receiving  non-nucleoside\n      reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). Whatever the cause(s) of hypovitaminosis D,\n      because of the importance of vitamin D in bone health, randomized controlled trials (RCT)\n      have been performed to test whether vitamin D supplementation can improve vitamin D status\n      and bone mineral metabolism in HIV-infected children and adolescents.\n\n      Along with its effects on bone metabolism, vitamin D is an important modulator of the immune\n      system. The vitamin D receptor (VDR) is found in high concentrations in activated T\n      lymphocytes, in small amounts in monocyte/macrophage cells while B lymphocytes do not\n      contain detectable amounts of VDR.\n\n      Experimental studies have shown that the active di-hydroxylated metabolite of vitamin D\n      [1,25(OH)2D] is able to skew the T cell compartment into a more anti-inflammatory state,\n      with inhibition of Th1 and Th17 cells and promotion of Th2 and T regulatory (Treg) subsets.\n\n      In the context of HIV infection, in which Th1 subpopulations are devoted to inhibit viral\n      replication, 16  any alteration of the Th1/Th2 balance would be of concern.\n\n      Although all the biological effects of vitamin D are mediated by the 1,25(OH)2D, it is the\n      25(OH)D to be routinely quantified because of its longer half-life.17 However, HIV-infected\n      subjects may have a defective 1\u03b1-hydroxylation of 25(OH)D.  Thus, it is important to\n      evaluate the effects of vitamin D supplementation both in terms of 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)2D\n      responses.\n\n      This repeated-measures parallel-group RCT is aimed to test wether a 12-month oral\n      supplementation with cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) is able: 1) to increase serum 25(OH)D and\n      1,25(OH)2D levels and, 2) to affect T-cell phenotype in vertically HIV-infected children and\n      young adults with hypovitaminosis D and stable HIV-disease.\n\n      Main outcome: to determine the frequency of  hypovitaminosis D at 12-month of follow-up\n      among subjects supplemented with oral cholecalciferol versus subjects receiving placebo.\n\n      Secondary outcome: to investigate correlations - if any - between serum vitamin D\n      concentration and markers of immune activation (i.e. Th1-, Th2-, Th17- and Treg-lymphocytes\n      count, T-lymphocyte VDR expression)"
