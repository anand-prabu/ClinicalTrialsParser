Other purposes of the study are to determine in a\n      population of HIV seropositive persons with cytomegalovirus (CMV) viremia, the safety,\n      tolerance, and patient acceptability of oral ganciclovir given for 28 days, to collect\n      preliminary laboratory evidence for antiviral activity and effectiveness of three dose\n      regimens of oral ganciclovir based on blood and urine cultures of CMV, and to relate\n      antiviral activity to dosage and to serum ganciclovir levels.\n\n      CMV retinitis is an important sight-threatening opportunistic infection which affects about\n      10 to 15 percent of people with AIDS. A previous study has shown that treatment with\n      ganciclovir resulted in a significant delay in time to first retinitis progression compared\n      to untreated controls. More studies are warranted to evaluate effects at different doses."

Twelve\n      individuals are treated at each dose level. In group B, 12 patients with AIDS and CMV\n      retinitis receive oral ganciclovir therapy. These 12 patients must have received an\n      induction course of intravenous ganciclovir for 4 weeks prior to study entry and must have\n      stable CMV retinitis. Measurements for both groups include pharmacokinetics, safety, and\n      tolerance (history, physical examination, hematology, and serum chemistry), and CMV blood\n      and urine cultures. In addition, there are weekly ophthalmologic evaluations for individuals\n      in the group B study."
