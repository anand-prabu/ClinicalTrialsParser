            "textblock": "Thirty three asthmatic subjects (>18 years, both sexes) who have stable asthma will be\n      recruited to undergo methacholine challenges for a randomized, crossover, observational\n      study. The objective of this study is to compare the methacholine PC20 of a modern delivery\n      aerosol system, the Trudell AeroEclipse*II BAN nebulizer, to that of the current \"gold\n      standard\", the English-Wright nebulizer. Subjects will inhale methacholine using both\n      nebulizing systems on separate visits and the PC20 values will be compared.   The results\n      from these experiments will give us a better indication of whether the modern AeroEclipse*\n      II BAN nebulizer might be sufficient to replace the current \"gold standard\" Wright nebulizer\n      in clinical settings.\n\n      Baseline Spirometry\n\n      Baseline FEV1 and VC will be registered using an electronic spirometer meeting ATS\n      requirements.\n\n      Screening\n\n      A medical history will be conducted by interview and asthma medications will be reviewed on\n      this V1.  Subjects will also undergo a Methacholine Challenge to determine their PC20 and\n      therefore their eligibility into the study.\n\n      Methacholine Challenge\n\n      Challenges will be carried out after a minimum 8-hour washout of short-acting \u00df2-agonist.\n      Subjects will perform methacholine challenges on 2 separate days at the same time of day, at\n      least 24-hours apart and all within a 2-week period.  At  V2, subjects will be randomly\n      assigned to use either the Wright nebulizer or the AeroEclipse*II BAN nebulizer.\n      Methacholine inhalation from the Wright nebulizer will be performed as follows.  Subjects\n      are instructed to wear noseclips and to breathe normally from the mouthpiece during the\n      2-minute inhalation period.  Subjects inhale normal saline, then doubling concentrations of\n      methacholine for 2 minutes each always starting at a dose of 0.03 mg/ml.  Spirometry is\n      measured with an electronic spirometer meeting ATS requirements. FEV1 is measured at 30 and\n      90 seconds after each inhalation and the highest FEV1 will be used to calculate the % fall\n      from baseline.  There is a 3 minute interval between the end of one inhalation dose and\n      start of the next inhalation dose.  The test is terminated when a fall in FEV1 of 20% of the\n      baseline value occurs and the methacholine PC20 is calculated.  The same protocol will be\n      applied to methacholine inhalation using the AeroEclipse*II BAN nebulizer with the exception\n      that the 2-minute tidal breathing will be reduced to 20 seconds and the interval between the\n      end of one inhalation dose and start of the next inhalation dose is 3 minutes and 40\n      seconds.  Subjects will return to the lab on V3 to complete a methacholine challenge using\n      the alternate nebulizer from the one used on V2.\n\n      DATA ANALYSIS\n\n      The methacholine PC20 values will be log-transformed before performing summary statistics.\n      The PC20 values will be compared by paired t-test."
