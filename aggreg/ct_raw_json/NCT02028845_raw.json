Background\n\n             -  Advanced guidewires with a U-shaped tip could effectively cross the long or\n                multi-occlusive segment smoothly and go into the distal outflow vessel.\n\n             -  The guidewire looping technique is a safe and effective method for the\n                recanalization of the occluded lesions in infrapopliteal vessels.\n\n        2. Objective - To compare the performance a loop-tipped guidewire with a straight-tipped\n           guidewire in achieving successful deep biliary cannulation.\n\n        3. Design\n\n           - Prospective randomized trial.\n\n        4. Setting:\n\n           - Tertiary-care medical center\n\n        5. Patients\n\n           - This study will involve 192 patients with biliary diseases which require endoscopic\n           retrograde cholangiopancreatography.\n\n        6. Intervention - Cannulation of bile duct by using a loop-tipped guidewire or a\n           straight-tipped guidewire\n\n        7. Main outcome measurements - Compare the cannulation success rate, the duration of the\n           cannulation, immediate and late complications."
