      Study Participation:

      If you agree to take part in this study, you will fill out a questionnaire, complete an
      interview, and information will be collected from your medical record.

      For the questionnaire, you will answer questions about your quality of life, mood, social
      support, stress, diet, lifestyle, and demographic information (such as your age and race).
      The questionnaire should take about 60-90 minutes to complete.

      The interview may be done during a routine visit at MD Anderson or by phone.  A trained
      interviewer will ask you questions about the amount of stress you may be having or have had
      in the past.  It should take about 25-30 minutes to complete the interview.

      Information collected from your medical record will include the status of the disease, if
      the disease has gotten worse, any treatments you have received, and any side effects you may
      have had.  This information will help researchers learn how specific treatments may affect
      patients.

      If you are already enrolled in a protocol in which you will be having tumor tissue collected
      for future analysis, the information gathered in those studies will be used together with
      the data collected for this study to learn if behavioral factors relate to your tumor tissue
      test results.

      Length of Study:

      Your study participation will be over after completing the questionnaire and interview.

      Other Information:

      For quality control purposes, a random sample of interviews may be tape recorded.  Before
      any information is recorded, you will be asked for your permission.

      The tape recording will be done by members of the study staff.  Your audiotape will be given
      a code number.  No identifying information (such as your name and medical record number)
      will be recorded on the audiotape.

      This is an investigational study.

      Up to 210 participants will be enrolled in this multicenter study.  Up to 90 will take part
      at MD Anderson.
