This halves the wavelength of the emitted laser to 532 nm and doubles its frequency. The emitted light is a visible green light, which is strongly absorbed by red tissues and hemoglobin; this renders a blood rich organ such as the prostate gland to be an excellent target. Prostate tissue is vaporized leaving an appropriate cavity for voiding."

There, small polyvynil alcohol plastic beads are injected to block the blood flow to the prostate.  By doing so, the prostate undergoes an ischemic injury and there is reduction in gland size and relief of obstructive symtpoms."
