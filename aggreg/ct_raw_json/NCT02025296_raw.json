            "textblock": "The use of telemedicine (also known as connected health, e-health, or telehealth) has been\n      proven to be beneficial in chronic disease management. Now, the classic concept of\n      telemedicine has been evolving to ubiquitous (u)-healthcare system with advanced information\n      technologies which provides real-time individualized feedback using a monitoring device\n      attached to the internet or a mobile phone system.\n\n      A few studies showed that adopting a u-healthcare system helped patients improve their blood\n      glucose control and reduced hypoglycemia or weight gain. In a previous study, supervised\n      telemonitoring was effective for blood pressure control in hypertensive patients in primary\n      care settings. A recent study showed that telemonitoring with pharmacist's help achieved\n      better blood pressure control compared with usual care during 12 months of intervention.\n\n      A clinical decision support system (CDSS) is the key to this system, building up an\n      individualized CDSS rule engine is the crux of the u-healthcare system because current\n      glucose control status, antidiabetic medications, lifestyle, and severity of hypoglycemia\n      vary between individual patients.\n\n      Recently, our u-healthcare team generated a new multidisciplinary u-healthcare system by\n      upgrading the CDSS rule engine, and integrating a physical activity-monitoring device and\n      dietary feedback into a comprehensive package. With this integrated system, we investigate\n      the effect of individualized multidisciplinary u-healthcare service combined with exercise\n      monitoring and dietary feedback on glucose control with less hypoglycemia in Korean elderly\n      population."
