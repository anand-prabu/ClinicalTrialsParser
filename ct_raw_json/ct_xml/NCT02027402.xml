  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During laparoscopic surgery for an acutely inflamed gallbladder, most surgeons routinely
      insert a drain. However, no consensus has been reached regarding the need for drainage in
      these cases, and the use of a drain remains controversial. This study is coordinated to find
      out the surgical outcomes and perioperative morbidity according to the insertion of drain
      after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Inverstgators expect that the routine use of a drain
      after laparoscopic cholecystectomy for an acutely inflamed gallbladder will have no effects
      on the postoperative morbidity.
