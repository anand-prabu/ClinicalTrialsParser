Patients must have an HIV-1 RNA <100 copies/mL for \u22653\n      months on their first HIV treatment regimen.  Prior regimen modifications for reasons other\n      than virologic failure are acceptable if any previously achieved virologic suppression has\n      been maintained. A Trofile\u00ae DNA will be used to document exclusive CCR5 tropism.  Patients\n      with history of dual/mixed or CXCR4-tropic HIV-1 are excluded from participation.  Patients\n      with prior exposure to Selzentry\u00ae are also excluded.  Patients that qualify for\n      participation will discontinue the PI, NNRTI, or Integrase inhibitor portion of their\n      regimen and begin Selzentry\u00ae 600mg QD.  Patients will continue the two (2) NRTIs from the\n      previous treatment regimen.\n\n      The primary endpoints is:  the percentage of HIV positive patients with undetectable viral\n      load (HIV-1 RNA <100 copies/mL) at Week 24.\n\n      Secondary endpoints are:  the safety and tolerability of once-daily Selzentry\u00ae through Weeks\n      24 and 48(as measured by clinical and laboratory adverse events and regimen satisfaction\n      questionnaire), the percentage of HIV positive patients with undetectable viral load (HIV-1\n      RNA < 100 copies/mL) at Week 48, the change from baseline in CD4+ T-cell counts at Weeks 24\n      and 48, the change from baseline in inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein) at Weeks 24\n      and 48, and assessment of resistance-associated mutations or viral tropism changes from\n      baseline, if any, emerging at virologic failure."
