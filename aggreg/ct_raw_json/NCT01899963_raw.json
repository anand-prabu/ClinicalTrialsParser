            "textblock": "In this province, optometrists are often responsible for contacting the retinal specialists'\n      office to arrange patients to be examined for suspected emergencies or more routine\n      referrals related to the eye. This is often done by faxing a referral form to the\n      specialists' office, where the retinal specialist will examine the information presented in\n      the referral form and make a decision on when the patient should be seen. This current\n      method has some important considerations, such as the difficulty of transmitting clear\n      images of the back of the eye over fax.  Having this information could help the retinal\n      specialist in determining when the patient should be seen, especially in terms of booking\n      additional tests or when treatment should be given.\n\n      Teleophthalmology is a branch of telemedicine that delivers eye care through digital\n      equipment and telecommunications technology. It offers some unique advantages, such as the\n      ability to be integrated with electronic health records, the ability to be viewed by\n      multiple members of the health care team, and potentially reduce wait times and travel times\n      to the ophthalmologist.\n\n      However, there is no comparison known to the study team between whether patients being\n      referred from optometrists to retina specialists through a teleophthalmology system will be\n      treated earlier than patients through a conventional fax system. This study aims to examine\n      and provide more information on this topic."

            "textblock": "Within the province of Ontario, there are a limited number of retinal specialists for a\n      large and geographically diverse population of 13.5 million people in 2012.  Because the\n      majority of these specialists are located in larger urban centers, many rural patients have\n      difficulty travelling the significant distance from their communities to the city.\n      Currently in Ontario optometrists are responsible for triaging retinal eye diseases;\n      emergency referrals such as endophthalmitis are organized by same-day telephone\n      consultations, while more routine referrals are scheduled by fax.\n\n      This current method of triage has particular important considerations.  Because of the\n      limited number of retinal specialists long wait times can lead to permanent vision loss if\n      the referral is inaccurate, where the patient should have been seen and treated sooner\n      instead of later such as the case of wet age-related macular degeneration (wAMD) and\n      Diabetic Macular Edema (DME).  In addition, essential vision tests such as fluorescein\n      angiography (FA) are often available only in a hospital setting rather within physician or\n      optometrists' office. For patients from rural or remote communities, this inconvenience\n      could result in lost wages, a long return trip back the next day or even an overnight stay.\n\n      Teleophthalmology is a branch of telemedicine that delivers eye care through digital\n      equipment and telecommunications technology. It offers some unique advantages, such as the\n      ability to be integrated with electronic health records, the ability to be viewed by\n      multiple members of the health care team, and potentially reduce wait times and travel times\n      to the ophthalmologist.  Within Canada, there have been different teleophthalmology\n      initiatives to provide access to specialists to optometrists and primary care practitioners\n      particularly in rural and remote areas, improving ophthalmologic care and reducing\n      unnecessary patient travel expenditures. These teleophthalmology systems can include fundus\n      and Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) images to aid the ophthalmologist in more accurately\n      diagnosing and triaging the referral. Hanson et al. in a retrospective case series noted\n      that tele-referrals to retinal specialists from optometrists reduced average travel time,\n      travel distance and the number of office visits to retina specialists while improving\n      efficiency of clinical examination, testing, and treatment.\n\n      However, there currently is no research known to the study team that actively compares the\n      time to treatment for patients based on teleophthalmology referral and assessment versus a\n      conventional paper referral system from optometrists to retinal specialists. For conditions\n      like wAMD and DME related to Diabetic Retinopathy that are often referred via\n      teleophthalmology, the difference in time to treatment could prevent vision loss. The\n      inclusion of fundus and OCT images in teleophthalmology could also improve triage accuracy\n      and prioritization of referrals and appointments to the retinal specialist.  This study\n      focuses on comparing the time to treatment for a tele-retinal referral system to a paper\n      referral system by focusing on two prevalent retinal conditions: wet AMD and DME. The\n      results could demonstrate that tele-ophthalmology can reduce the time to treatment for\n      patients with wet AMD and DME in Ontario, improving access to retinal specialists and\n      allowing for more efficient triage of patients."
