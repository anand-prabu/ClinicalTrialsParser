      Hypothesis

        1. To define whether stimulation of ATGL and suppression of G0/G1 switch gene occur in the
           initial phases of diabetic ketoacidosis and thus can be identified as the primary
           mechanisms behind this life threatening condition.

        2. Make a human model for studying ketoacidosis.

      The investigators plan to reduce in their regular insulin over night. In the morning we
      administer endotoxin, which together with a relative lack of insulin will initiate
      ketogenesis - a state of ketoacidosis. On another occasion strict glycemic control is
      imposed by means of intravenous insulin. The testing is done two separate days with at least
      3 weeks in between and patients are admitted to hospital the evening before the day of
      testing. The investigators use isotopic tracers to determine metabolic fluxes and analyse
      fat (ATGL, G0/G1 switch gene) and muscle biopsies.
