Through the\n      intervention, the investigators will tailor voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) for HIV\n      to the ANC setting and provide a continuum of psychosocial support for pregnant women\n      through: (1) a standardized health education video before HIV pre-test counseling; (2) HIV\n      pre- and post-test counseling sessions that prepare women for decisions related to testing,\n      serostatus disclosure and anti-retroviral (ARV) prophylaxis and help women plan strategies\n      for sexual risk behavior change; (3) two additional post-test counseling sessions postpartum\n      focusing on legal education and referral, partner testing, sexual risk behavior change and\n      family planning decisions and; (4) an active referral system to post-test support groups run\n      by a clinically trained staff psychologist and (5) an active referral system to legal\n      services run by a lawyer at the clinic.\n\n      Through this intervention trial the investigators will be testing the following hypotheses:\n\n      H1:  Women receiving the intervention will have significantly lower sexual risk of HIV at 14\n      weeks and 9-months post-partum as compared to women in the control arm.  Sexual risk of HIV\n      will be measured by: STI incidence (Trichomonas vaginalis, Neisseria gonorrhea and\n      Chlamydia), consistent condom use, unprotected sex in past 30 days, and unprotected sex\n      since delivery.\n\n      H2: Women receiving the intervention will report significantly better outcomes related to\n      prevention of mother to child transmission (PMTCT) service uptake at 14 weeks and 9 months\n      post-partum as compared to women in the control arm.  PMTCT service uptake will be measured\n      by acceptance of HIV VCT among HIV-positive and HIV-negative women; acceptance of ARVs,\n      adherence to national infant feeding guidelines, and family planning use among HIV-positive\n      women.\n\n      H3:  Women in the intervention arm will report significantly better psychosocial outcomes at\n      14 weeks and 9 months post-partum as compared to women in the control arm.  Psychosocial\n      outcomes will be measured by: perceived social support, emotional distress, and partner\n      violence among HIV-positive and HIV-negative women."
