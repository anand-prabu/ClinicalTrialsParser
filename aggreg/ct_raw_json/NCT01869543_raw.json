Each participant will receive true air\n      filtration for a year and a placebo for a year. During the placebo period a sham filter will\n      be used that removes very little of the particles.  Measures of health effects will include\n      days of symptoms, unplanned utilization of the healthcare system for asthma-related illness,\n      short-term medication use, peak exhaled flow, spirometry, and exhaled nitric oxide (eNO)."
