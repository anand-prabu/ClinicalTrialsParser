  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite aggressive CPR training, the outcome of cardiac arrest is not good. The problem is
      method of education. So, the investigators want to add the dispatcher-assisted CPR
      simulation into conventional CPR training. In this study, the investigators aim is to
      investigate the effect of newer CPR training program.

  <detailed_description>

      The training program focuses on working in team with dispatcher, performing all steps from
      recognizing cardiac arrest to performing CPR, together with the dispatcher. The one hours
      training session is split into four parts:

        1. Video self-instruction manikin practice (30 min), including a brief introduction to
           AED.

        2. Practice in pairs (15 min). Practicing the dispatcher and rescuer role in a simulation
           to enhance learning.

        3. Debriefing. Questions, answers and reflection (15 min).

        4. Homework. Leaflet with tasks like learn how to activate the speaker function on your
           own phone.

      The main difference between DA-BLS and traditional BLS training is that DA-BLS provides the
      scenes and interactive experiences on calling EMS and receiving CPR instruction via
      telephone speaker function, following up the skill training by scenario simulation training.
