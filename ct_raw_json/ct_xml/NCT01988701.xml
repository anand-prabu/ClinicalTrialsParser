      This research trial studies lymphocyte profiles and activation status in patients with
      graft-versus-host disease. Studying samples of blood in the laboratory from patients with
      cancer may help doctors identify and learn more about biomarkers related to
      graft-versus-host disease.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore and assess changes in subsets and activation status of B-, T,-, and natural
      killer (NK) lymphocytes in peripheral blood following allogeneic stem cell transplant and
      how they may be associated with clinical events with an ultimate future goal of conducting a
      larger successor study to identify potential therapeutic targets based on its findings.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the feasibility of obtaining and comparing patients with chronic
      graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) with time-matched stem cell transplant (SCT) patients
      without cGVHD and identify logistical challenges with obtaining and processing samples in
      each of the subgroups of interest for these analyses.

      II. To assess and explore differences in lymphocyte subsets (B-, T-, and NK) between those
      with vs. without cGVHD.

      III. To assess and explore differences in cytokines in patients with cGVHD vs. those
      without.

      IV. To describe lymphocyte subsets and activation and explore how these may be related to
      specific clinical manifestations of cGVHD.

      OUTLINE:

      Blood samples are analyzed for activation status of B lymphocytes, T lymphocytes, and NK
      lymphocytes via flow cytometry, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), enzyme-linked
      immunosorbent spot (ELISPOT), immunoblot, and microarray assays.
