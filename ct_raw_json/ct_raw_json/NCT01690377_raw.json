As\n      such they are currently used in clinical vaccination protocols in cancer patients, and both\n      immunological and clinical responses have been observed. Several subsets of dendritic cells\n      have been characterized in the peripheral blood. One such subset is referred to as\n      plasmacytoid dendritic cells (PDC). To date PDC have not been evaluated for their capability\n      to induce anti-tumor immune responses in patients. For this reason the investigators will\n      perform a safety and efficacy study with PDC in stage IV melanoma patients."
