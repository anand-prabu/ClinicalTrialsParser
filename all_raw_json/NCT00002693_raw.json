Patients are stratified according to\n      prior bone marrow transplant (BMT) (yes vs no).\n\n        -  Induction: Patients receive carboplatin and topotecan IV 3 times a day on days 1-5.\n           Patients may also receive filgrastim (G-CSF) beginning on day 7 or 14. Retreatment is\n           based on results of marrow exam on day 10-14. Patients with less than 5% blasts undergo\n           a second marrow exam upon blood count recovery or on day 26-30, whichever is earlier.\n           Patients with at least 5% blasts after day 21 receive one more course, in the absence\n           of unacceptable toxicity and at the discretion of the investigator. Patients with no\n           greater than 5% blasts begin G-CSF if blood counts are not recovered, then proceed to\n           consolidation.\n\n      Cohorts of 1-6 patients receive escalating doses of topotecan until the maximum tolerated\n      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of up to\n      6 patients experience dose limiting toxicity. Patients with prior BMT will not be entered at\n      any level until 3-6 patients with no prior BMT tolerate that level.\n\n        -  Consolidation (begins around day 42 of last Induction course): Patients with ALL/AML in\n           complete remission (CR) or CML in chronic phase receive 2 additional courses (same\n           doses) 6-8 weeks apart.\n\n      Patients experiencing a relapse after CR lasting at least 6 months may receive additional\n      treatment.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-20 patients without and 2-20 patients with prior bone\n      marrow transfer will be accrued for this study over 2-2.5 years."
