Additionally, it was hypothesized that dental anxiety and stress related to caries\n      infiltration will be significantly less than dental anxiety related to a conventional\n      restorative procedure. The study will be a controlled clinical trial with a split mouth\n      design and blind evaluation of the outcome (caries progression). Caries progression will be\n      evaluated annually, 12, 24, and 36 months after treatment."
