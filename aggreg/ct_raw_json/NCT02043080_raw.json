In addition, the Determine\n      TB-Lipoarabinomannan (LAM) Ag\u00ae will be used to model added diagnostic value when used alone\n      or in combination with Xpert MTB/RIF, within the TB diagnostic algorithm for HIV infected\n      patients in Zambia.\n\n      A quasi-experimental \"before-after\" study design will be used at two similar peri-urban\n      district hospitals. Each site will initially implement the Standard of Care (SOC) phase, in\n      which a prospective cohort of HIV-infected adult and paediatric TB suspects will be screened\n      for TB according to the current standard of care in Zambian HIV care clinics. This will be\n      followed by a 4-week \"intervention wash-out\" period to allow completion of the diagnostic\n      work-up of all patients recruited during the last month of the SOC phase.\n\n      The second phase (Xpert MTB/RIF phase) will start immediately following the \"intervention\n      wash-out\" period.  In this phase, a second cohort of HIV-infected adult and paediatric TB\n      suspects will be screened for TB using the Xpert MTB/RIF algorithm.  Each phase will last\n      approximately 6 months, or until the target sample size for adults is reached. Mycobacterial\n      culture will be performed during the study to confirm TB diagnosis and determine whether\n      appropriate treatment was given.  \"Appropriate treatment\" means the patient was initiated on\n      ATT within 4 weeks of screening initiation for culture-positive patients or a correct\n      diagnosis of not having TB in culture-negative patients.  Culture results will be released\n      from the CIDRZ Lab for patient care as soon as results are available.\n\n      During both study phases participants will be asked to submit a urine sample for testing\n      with the Determine TB-LAM Ag\u00ae assay. Urine specimens will be collected at the study site and\n      all procedures will be carried out at the CIDRZ Central Laboratory in Lusaka using standard\n      laboratory protocols and quality assurance procedures. Since Determine TB-LAM Ag\u00ae has not\n      yet been endorsed by the World Health Organization (WHO) nor approved by the Zambian\n      Ministry of Health for TB diagnosis, results from the Determine TB-LAM Ag\u00ae assay will not be\n      used for patient care."
