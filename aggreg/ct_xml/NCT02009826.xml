  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous research has suggested central nervous system inflammatory activity to be
      critically involved in disease development and progression in schizophrenia, with a complex
      interplay of inflammatory mechanisms leading to the development of brain abnormalities and
      medical symptoms related to schizophrenia. However, the mutual interactions of different
      inflammatory pathways and their relation to disease course have not been sufficiently
      studied. This study therefore aims to explore the interaction of neuroinflammatory
      mechanisms in patients with schizophrenia and to assess whether the inflammatory activity in
      schizophrenia is state-dependent and occurs mainly during psychotic episodes.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Be a man or woman between 18 and 40 years of age, inclusive.

          -  Have signed an informed consent document indicating that they understand the purpose
             of and procedures required for the study and are willing to participate in this
             study.

          -  Be medically stable on the basis of physical examination and vital signs performed at
             Screening.

          -  Be medically stable on the basis of clinical laboratory tests performed at Screening.
             If the results of the serum chemistry panel, hematology, or urinalysis are outside
             the normal reference ranges, the subject may be included only if the investigator
             judges the abnormalities or deviations from normal to be not clinically significant
             or to be appropriate and reasonable for the population under study.

          -  Be willing and able to adhere to the prohibitions and restrictions specified in the
             protocol.

        Schizophrenia subjects:

          -  Fulfill DSM-V criteria for the schizophrenia spectrum (DSM-V #295.1-295.6, 295.9,
             298.9)

          -  Be admitted to hospital for first-episode psychosis or acute relapse of psychosis, as
             defined by:

        total score of ≥14 on the positive scale of the &quot;Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale&quot;
        (PANSS) and at least a score of 5 on 1 item or a score of 4 on 2 &quot;psychotic&quot; PANSS items
        P2, P3, P5 or G9 at Screening.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             nicotine or caffeine, within 6 months before screening.

             within 6 months before screening.
