  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Following cataract surgery, an intraocular lens (IOL) is implanted in the eye. The majority
      of people develop an operable cataract when they are over the age of 50. Occasionally people
      under 50 years develop a cataract requiring an operation. The visual demands in this age
      group are very different due to both physiological and lifestyle factors. Traditionally IOLs
      are focussed for distance vision and additional spectacles are worn for near vision. Under
      the age of 45 years we have the ability to naturally change the focus of our eyes and do not
      require additional reading glasses. This is known as accommodation. By removing the
      cataractous lens and replacing it with an IOL with a fixed single focus, both eyes work
      together for distance vision but only the unoperated eye is able to change focus for
      different working distances. This study aims to establish whether a multifocal IOL implanted
      in one eye is able to complement the accommodation in the other eye so the 2 eyes work more
      effectively together. This may enhance depth perception and improve the quality of vision.
      Depth perception is important for more comfortable vision on the computer screen, when
      reading and for jobs that require good depth perception.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant is willing and able to give informed consent for participation in the
             study.

          -  Male or female, aged 18 - 45.

          -  Cataract operation required in one eye only, either due to the presence of cataract
             affecting visual function, or in combination with surgery which is likely to cause
             visually significant cataract.

          -  Expected visual improvement in operable eye of at least 6/12.

          -  Fellow eye with a VA of at least 6/9.

          -  Astigmatism of 1.0D or less.

          -  Target of emmetropia in the operated eye.

          -  Intact posterior capsule with planned implantation into the capsular bag.

          -  IOL power required 10 - 30D.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pre-existing amblyopia or squint.

          -  Significant diabetic retinopathy.

          -  Macular off retinal detachment with metamorphopsia or poor visual prognosis.

          -  Other macula or ophthalmic pathology affecting macula function resulting in poor
             visual prognosis.

          -  Pregnancy, lactating or planned pregnancy during the study period.
