    <textblock>
      If someone is diagnosed with a pituitary tumor that causes acromegaly (too much growth
      hormone) the treatment is to have it surgically removed.  This study has two phases.

      The first phase provides medical treatment with a drug that will be provided for 3 months
      before surgery to see if complications of surgery are reduced and to see whether or not
      remission improves following surgery if you have this medical treatment. The drug
      administered is approved by the FDA for long-term treatment of acromegaly.  It is not
      routinely administered before surgery, and is therefore experimental as used in this way.
      All other procedures performed during this research are standard of care with the exception
      of the 3 questionnaires to be completed at each visit.

      The second phase of this study is from 3 months until 12 months after surgery and is only
      for people who do not go into remission after the operation.  This phase assesses the
      possible remission of acromegaly after resuming the drug treatment for an additional 3 to 9
      months. The drug will be prescribed by your physician as part of your regular medical care
      and will not be included as part of the study.  All other procedures performed during this
      research are standard of care with the exception of the 3 questionnaires to be completed at
      each visit.

      The study lasts approximately 16 months - 3 month before surgery and 12 months after
      surgery.
