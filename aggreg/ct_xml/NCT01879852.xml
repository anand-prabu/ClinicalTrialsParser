  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, randomized, single-blind (evaluator) study. Enrolled patients had a
      traumatic meniscal tear and underwent meniscectomy. The study included 6 weeks (12 visits)
      of standard or quadriceps intensive rehabilitation. The objective of the study was to
      determine the effect of quadriceps intensive rehabilitation on knee function and articular
      cartilage.

    <time_frame>Baseline to post-rehabilitation and baseline to 1 year post-surgery</time_frame>

    <time_frame>Baseline to 1 year post-surgery</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>A magnetic resonance image (MRI) of the knee will be acquired and software will be used to quantify tibial articular cartilage volume.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in single leg forward hop index</measure>
    <time_frame>Post-rehabilitation to 1 year post-surgery</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Three trials of the single leg forward hop will be collected on each side. The distance across trials will be averaged. The single leg hop index will be computed as [(distance on the surgical side/distance on the non-surgical side) *100]</description>

    <measure>Change in urinary concentrations of C-terminal crosslinking telopeptide of type II collagen (CTX-11)</measure>
    <time_frame>Post-rehabilitaton to 1 year post-surgery</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Early-morning, second void, fasting urine samples will be collected and stored. Concentrations of CTX-II will be determined with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and corrected for creatine concentration. Creatinine concentration will also be determined with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.</description>

    <measure>Changes in lower extremity loading symmetry</measure>
    <time_frame>Post-rehabilitation to one year post-surgery</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Subjects will perform a drop vertical jump from a 20.32 cm step. The peak vertical ground reaction force on each side will be calculated. Lower extremity loading symmetry will be calculated as [(surgical side force/non-surgical side force) * 100]</description>

    <measure>Changes in pro-inflammatory cytokines</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to post-rehabilitation and baseline to one year post-surgery</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Early morning, fasting blood samples will be acquired and stored until analysis. Concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin1-beta) will be analyzed with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.</description>
