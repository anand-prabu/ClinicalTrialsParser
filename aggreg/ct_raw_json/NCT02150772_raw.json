Currently available\n      pre-operative tests are unable to rule out malignancy in a subset of patients and diagnostic\n      thyroid surgery is necessary. Therefore, there is a need to develope the diagnostic tools\n      for pre-operative diagnostic work-up of thyroid nodules.\n\n      The study will investigate a novel ultrasonographic technique called Shear Wave Elastography\n      (SWE) in the pre-operative evaluation of thyroid nodules.\n\n      Aim:\n\n      To evaluate the diagnostic value of SWE in the pre-operative diagnosis of thyroid nodules in\n      a tertiary surgical center.\n\n      Perspectives:\n\n      An optimization of the pre-operative risk-stratification and diagnosis of thyroid nodules\n      can reduce unnecessary thyroid surgery, with a reduction in morbidity and better use of the\n      economic and surgical resources."
