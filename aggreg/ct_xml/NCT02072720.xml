  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main question of this study is if and when VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor)
      expression in the tumor is upregulated during chemoradiation and if bevacizumab inhibits
      subsequent vessel growth in the tumor.

        -  Therefore the first aim of this study is to identify the time point of induction of
           VEGF in the tumor tissue of esophagus carcinoma during chemoradiation (after 1,2,3 or 4
           weeks of chemoradiation).

        -  If we identify increased expression of VEGF at a certain time point, our second aim is
           to determine if we can inhibit the subsequent tumor vessel growth by administration of
           bevacizumab.
