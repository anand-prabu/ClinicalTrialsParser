The safety profile of the 1790GAHB vaccine is evaluated in comparison to that\n      of placebo (GAHB-Placebo), constituted by an aluminum hydroxide suspension having the same\n      concentration as study vaccine formulations. A total of 50 eligible subjects will be\n      assigned to one of five sequential cohorts of 10 subjects each.\n\n      Within each cohort, in an observer-blind fashion, subjects will be randomized to receive\n      three vaccinations, four weeks apart, of either 1790GAHB vaccine (at five antigen\n      concentrations) or GAHB placebo. A Data Safety Monitoring Board will be in place to receive\n      a summary of all safety data obtained during one week follow-up post-first vaccination with\n      the lower dose. Based on evaluation of the safety data, the Data Safety Monitoring Board\n      will make a recommendation, as to whether the next cohort should be vaccinated with higher\n      antigen concentration or not.\n\n      Expected duration of the study for an individual subject is 9 months. Each subject will be\n      followed-up for 6 months after the 3rd vaccination."
