  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      On exposure to hypoxia (low oxygen) the normal response is for pulmonary arterial systolic
      blood pressure (PASP, blood pressure through the lungs) to increase. We have previously
      shown that raising iron by giving an infusion of iron into a vein reduces this pressure rise
      and that lowering iron by giving a drug that binds iron, magnifies this response. This is
      potentially a clinically important observation since iron-deficient people may be at
      increased risk of pulmonary hypertension if exposed transiently or permanently to hypoxia
      due to lung disease or residence at high altitude; furthermore if this were true then
      intravenous iron could be an important treatment in this patient group in the event of
      hypoxic exposure. The observed effects of iron on PASP are likely to be because iron levels
      affect oxygen sensing. Low iron levels make the body behave as if exposed to low oxygen by
      inhibiting the breakdown of the family of oxygen-sensing transcription factors, 'hypoxia
      inducible factor' or HIF.  This includes one of the body's normal responses to low oxygen
      levels - raising blood pressure through the lungs.

      This study will answer the question (1) do iron-deficient volunteers have a greater rise in
      PASP with hypoxia than those who are iron-replete, and (2) does giving intravenous iron
      cause a greater reduction in the rise in PASP in those who are iron-deficient than
      iron-replete?  The purpose of this study is not to test the safety or clinical efficacy of
      iron which is already known.
