      This phase I trial studies the side effects and the best dose of ipilimumab in treating
      patients with relapsed hematologic malignancies after donor stem cell transplantation.
      Monoclonal antibodies, such as ipilimumab, can block cancer growth in different ways. Some
      block the ability of cancer to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and help kill them
      or carry cancer-killing substances to them.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of ipilimumab administered to patients with
      relapsed hematologic malignancies following allogeneic stem cell transplantation. (Phase I)
      II. To characterize the toxicity of ipilimumab administered at the MTD in this patient
      population. (Phase Ib)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess response rate by simple descriptive summary statistics. II. To assess
      progression free and overall survival by the Kaplan-Meier method.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the phenotypic and functional effects of ipilimumab on immune cells.

      II. To assess tumor glucose metabolism using whole-body fludeoxyglucose F 18-positron
      emission tomography (FDG-PET) with optional dual time-point imaging.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      INDUCTION PHASE: Patients receive ipilimumab intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes on day
      1.Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      MAINTENANCE PHASE: Patients receive ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes every 12 weeks beginning
      at week 24 and then at weeks 36, 48, and 60 in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 1 year.
