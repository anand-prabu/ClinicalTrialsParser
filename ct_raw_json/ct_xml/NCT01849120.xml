  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neonates and infants that have cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) for
      congenital heart disease are at great risk for experiencing life-threatening low cardiac
      output syndrome (LCOS) in the first 24 hours after surgery. The poor perfusion and
      inadequate oxygen delivery that occurs may result in multiple organ failure and death. It is
      LCOS that is responsible for the majority of early postoperative deaths in this population
      of neonates and infants. Improved pediatric probes placed in peripheral locations using near
      infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) may permit continuous monitoring of venous saturations
      reflecting overall perfusion and oxygen balance in the tissues. Following parental or
      guardian consent, 30 neonates and infants scheduled to undergo surgery for congenital heart
      disease will be enrolled. At the end of surgery, four EQUANOX Advance 8004CB probes will be
      placed on the flank, lower extremities and the forehead. Continuous NIRS saturations will be
      monitored and stored for analysis. Point of care (POC) lactates will be obtained after
      admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) every 2 hours for the first 24 hours
      postoperatively, then once at 48 hours. The association between NIRS oxygen saturation and
      POC lactate values will be assessed using mixed linear models taking into account the
      repeated measures design. Exploratory analyses will be performed to assess whether NIRS
      oxygen saturation is associated with outcomes such as days in ICU, adverse events and
      mortality.

      The ability to use noninvasive, continuous monitoring for overall perfusion and cardiac
      output will allow better and earlier therapy for neonates and infants following cardiac
      surgery.
