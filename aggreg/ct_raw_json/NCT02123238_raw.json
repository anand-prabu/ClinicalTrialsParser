These patients will be randomized 1:1:1 to standard of\n      care (0 degree bed angle), 30 degree bed angle, or 60 degree bed angle.  Acute hypoxic\n      events will be analyzed pre and post-op in the randomly assigned bed position.  PACU nurses\n      will also be surveyed for patient-favored non-supine positioning (30 vs. 60 degrees).  Stage\n      2 will be a larger, powered trial to evaluate the efficacy of just one bed angle (30 or 60\n      degrees) based on the Stage 1 results."
