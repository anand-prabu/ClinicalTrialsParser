  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Laryngeal mask airway (LMA) is widely used in children.The appropriate time to remove
      laryngeal mask airway is still inconclusive.Sore throat is one of common complications after
      general anesthesia. Sometimes postoperative sore throat affects patients' satisfaction and
      daily activities. It can be correlated with dysphagia and may limit oral intake especially
      in children.The incidence of postoperative sore throat after laryngeal mask airway insertion
      varies from 5.8-34% in adult(13) and 17.5% in pediatric.Somehow, almost the studies of
      postoperative sore throat after laryngeal mask airway removal were done in awake state. Our
      study object to test that post operative sore throat after LMA removal in deep anesthetized
      children is lower than awake children.

      Patients age between 6-12 years who have ASA physical status I-II and scheduled for elective
      surgery will be enrolled in this study and randomly assigned into two groups (group A =
      awake group and group D = deep anesthetized group) by using computer-generated randomization
      table. The patients who have the following problems: active airway disease, risk of
      aspiration, intra-peritoneal or airway surgery will be excluded.

      At the day of surgery, demographic data will be recorded by nurse anesthetist. Visual analog
      scale (VAS) will be used as a tool for evaluating preoperative sore throat.

      At the operating room, after standard monitoring and pre-oxygenated with 100% oxygen via
      tight anesthetic face mask for 5 minutes. Propofol (3-5 mg/kg) and fentanyl(1-3 ug/kg) will
      be used for induction. After the patient is apnea and loss of eyelash reflex, appropriate
      size of classic LMA ,which is prepared by fully deflated to forms a smooth &quot;spoon-shape&quot; and
      be lubricated by water based jelly, will be applied with standard LMA insertion technique.
      Once LMA is in the right position, air will be inflated to the cuff of LMA, for keeping cuff
      pressure between 40-60 cmH2O. Air, O2 and Sevoflurane  â‰¥ 1minimal alveolar concentration
      (MAC) will be used to keep the patient anesthetized. Performer of LMA insertion and number
      of insertion attempts will be recorded.

      At the end of surgery, LMA will be removed with the technique which is followed by the group
      assignment, group D and group A. After that, patient will be transferred to post anesthetic
      care unit (PACU).

      At PACU, After the patient is fully awake, the blind investigator will ask the patient to
      evaluate post operative sorethroat  by using Visual analog scale (VAS) (0-10). Dysphagia
      (discomfort when swallowing) using dysphagia score (0 = able to eat normal diet / no
      dysphagia, 1 = able to swallow some solid foods, 2 = able to swallow only semi solid foods,
      3 = able to swallow liquids only, 4 = unable to swallow anything / total dysphagia),
      dysphonia (discomfort when speaking such as hoarseness) using dysphonia score (0 = no
      hoarseness, 1 = mild/no hoarseness in the time of interview but had it previously, 2 =
      moderate/only is felt by the patient or their parents, 3 = severe/recognizable in the time
      of interview) Any adverse events will be evaluated at 1 hour in PACU. Then the evaluation
      will be repeated by telephoned interview at 24 and 72 hours respectively.
