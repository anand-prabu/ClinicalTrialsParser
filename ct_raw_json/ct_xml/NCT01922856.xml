      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female age 18 through 50 years (inclusive).

          -  General good health, without clinically significant medical history, physical
             examination findings or clinical laboratory abnormalities per clinical judgment of
             PI.

          -  Negative pregnancy test. Pregnancy at any time will result in not receiving any or
             additional investigational product. Females of childbearing potential must agree to
             use an efficacious hormonal or barrier method of birth control during the study.
             Abstinence is acceptable. Female subjects unable to bear children must have this
             documented (eg, tubal ligation or hysterectomy) or must have negative pregnancy
             tests.

          -  Willingness to participate in the study after all aspects of the protocol have been
             explained and written informed consent obtained.

          -  Completion of a training session and demonstrated comprehension of the protocol
             procedures, knowledge of ETEC-associated illness, and by passing a written
             examination (70% passing score).

          -  Availability for the study duration, including all planned follow-up visits.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        General

          -  Presence of a significant medical or psychiatric condition which in the opinion of
             the investigator precludes participation in the study. Some medical conditions which
             are adequately treated and stable would not preclude entry into the study. These
             conditions might include stable asthma controlled with inhalers or mild hypertension
             stably controlled with a single agent.

          -  Significant abnormalities in screening hematology, or serum chemistry as determined
             by PI or PI in consultation with the research monitor and sponsor.

          -  Presence in the serum of HIV antibody, HBsAg, or HCV antibody.

          -  Evidence of IgA deficiency (serum IgA &lt; 7 mg/dL or below the limit of detection of
             assay).

          -  Evidence of current excessive alcohol consumption or drug dependence (a targeted drug
             screen may be used to evaluate at the clinician's discretion).

          -  Evidence of impaired immune function.

          -  Recent vaccination or receipt of an investigational product (within 30 days before
             vaccination).

          -  Any other criteria which, in the investigator's opinion, would compromise the ability
             of the subject to participate in the study, the safety of the study, or the results
             of the study

        Research Related Exclusions Applicable to Vaccination and Challenge Participation

          -  History of microbiologically confirmed ETEC or cholera infection in last 3 years.

          -  Occupation involving handling of ETEC or Vibrio cholerae currently, or in the past 3
             years.

          -  Symptoms consistent with Travelers' Diarrhea concurrent with travel to countries
             where ETEC infection is endemic (most of the developing world) within 3 years prior
             to dosing, OR planned travel to endemic countries during the length of the study.

          -  Vaccination for or ingestion of ETEC, cholera, or E coli heat labile toxin within 3
             years prior to dosing.

        Research Related Exclusions Not Applicable to Challenge-Only Participants

          -  Exclusionary skin history/findings that would confound assessment or prevent
             appropriate local monitoring of AEs, or possibly increase the risk of an AE.

          -  History of chronic skin disease (clinician judgment).- History of atopy such as
             active eczema.

          -  Acute skin infection/eruptions on the upper arms including fungal infections, severe
             acne, or active contact dermatitis.

          -  History of significant allergic reactions to any vaccines and allergies that may
             increase the risk of AEs (Well-controlled seasonal allergies responsive to
             antihistamine medication or intranasal steroids are not exclusionary per clinician
             determination).

        Study-specific Exclusion Criteria

          -  Abnormal stool pattern (fewer than 3 per week or more than 3 per day).

          -  Regular use of laxatives, antacids, or other agents to lower stomach acidity.

          -  Use of any medication known to affect the immune function (eg, systemic
             corticosteroids and others) within 30 days preceding the first vaccination or planned
             use during the active study period.

          -  Known allergy to two of the following antibiotics: ciprofloxacin,
             trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and penicillin.
