With the far infrared ray applied to the 'phantom limbs' in amputees and\n      the corresponding normal legs in healthy subjects, the sensation of (phantom) limb will be\n      assessed for each subject using the techniques of fMRI and meridian response. By analyzing\n      the data collected from both groups, the investigators expect both hypotheses will be\n      supported by the results of experiments in this project."
