Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of\n      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed at 4 weeks. Patients with complete or partial response or stable\n      disease are also followed every 3 months until relapse or death.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-18\n      months."
