            "textblock": "Research has shown that weight loss has many short-term benefits, such as improvements in\n      blood pressure, but we do not know if attempts to lose weight over the long term are\n      beneficial.  Some studies even suggest that losing weight may lead to health problems such\n      as gall bladder disease and bone loss.  Look AHEAD will help us understand the long-term\n      effects of weight loss on health, and see if it helps reduce heart attacks and strokes.\n\n      We hope to learn the long-term benefits and risks of a program designed to achieve and\n      maintain weight loss.  The study will consist of two groups of volunteers.  One group will\n      be asked to eat fewer calories and increase their physical activity.  This group will be\n      compared to a second group who will receive diabetes support and education.  Both groups\n      will receive medical monitoring.  In addition to heart attacks and stroke, Look AHEAD will\n      study the effects of the interventions on other factors relating to heart disease, on\n      diabetes control and complications, and on relative costs and quality of life associated\n      with the interventions.  Overall, this study will help doctors in the future in advising\n      their patients who have diabetes about losing weight.\n\n      About 5,000 men and women in 19 cities around the country will take part in the study.  The\n      study will last 9 to 11.5 years: the length of time will depend on when the individual\n      starts the study."
