  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis for this trial is that the incidence of a pre-defined composite of common
      systemic hypersensitivity adverse events for Flublok recipients is non-inferior to that
      reported for licensed IIV recipients.  Another hypothesis is that the safety and
      reactogenicity of Flublok is clinically acceptable, i.e. consistent with the overall safety
      profiles previously observed with Flublok and with the licensed comparator.

      The ACIP recommends that all people aged 6 months and older be immunized to prevent
      influenza.  Currently the only approved influenza vaccine across the entire age group is
      inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV).  A Biologics Licensing Application (BLA) for Flublok
      was approved by the FDA for influenza immunization of adults 18-49 years of age. Additional
      safety and, ultimately efficacy, data is needed to support use in adults ≥50 years of age,
      an important age group as adults ≥65 years of age are among those at increased risk of
      influenza complications.

             based on medical history, if appropriate

          3. Able to understand and comply with planned study procedures

          4. Provides written informed consent prior to initiation of any study procedure.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Known contraindication to either study vaccine (see product package inserts)

          2. Receipt of any other influenza or other vaccine within 30 days prior to enrollment in
             this study.

          3. Receipt of any new medication within 30 days prior to enrollment in this study

          4. Plans to participate in any investigation involving an investigational product during
             this study.

          5. Pre-existence of atopic dermatitis or any other cutaneous disorder that could
             complicate the evaluation of potential primary endpoints.

          6. Any clinical or social circumstance that in the opinion of the investigator could
             interfere with compliance with study procedures or interfere with the interpretation
             of clinical data.
