This should be recorded on the Case\n             Report Form (CRF).\n\n          -  The subject must be willing to wear the study lenses for at least 8 hours per day, 7\n             days per week.\n\n          -  The subject must be a current successful soft contact lens wearer in both eyes\n\n          -  The subject must appear able and willing to adhere to the instructions set forth in\n             this clinical protocol.\n\n          -  The subject's subjective refraction must result in a vertex corrected spherical\n             contact lens prescription in the range of -1.00D to -6.00D in each eye.\n\n          -  The subject's refractive astigmatism must be less than or equal to 0.75D in both\n             eyes.\n\n          -  The subject must have best corrected visual acuity of 20/30 (6/9) or better in each\n             eye.\n\n          -  The subject must require a visual correction in both eyes (no monofit or monovision\n             allowed).\n\n          -  The subject must have normal eyes with no evidence of abnormality or disease.  For\n             the purposes of this study a normal eye is defined as one having:\n\n               1. No amblyopia.\n\n               2. No evidence of lid abnormality or infection (including\n                  blepharitis/meibomitis).\n\n               3. No conjunctival abnormality or infection.\n\n               4. No clinically significant slit lamp findings (i.e. stromal edema,\n                  vascularization, infiltrates or abnormal opacities).\n\n               5. No other active ocular disease.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  Any ocular or systemic allergies or diseases that may interfere with contact lens\n             wear.\n\n          -  Any systemic disease, autoimmune disease, or use of medication, which may interfere\n             with contact lens wear.\n\n          -  Clinically significant (Grade 3 or 4) corneal edema, corneal vascularization, corneal\n             staining, or any other abnormalities of the cornea which would contraindicate contact\n             lens wear.\n\n          -  Clinically significant (Grade 3 or 4) tarsal abnormalities or bulbar injection which\n             might interfere with contact lens wear.\n\n          -  Any ocular infection.\n\n          -  Any corneal distortion resulting from previous hard or rigid gas permeable contact\n             lens wear.\n\n          -  Pregnancy or lactation.\n\n          -  No extended wear in the last 3 months.\n\n          -  Diabetes.\n\n          -  Infectious diseases (e.g. hepatitis, tuberculosis) or an immunosuppressive disease\n             (e.g. HIV).\n\n          -  Employee or family member of the staff of the investigational site."
