  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Healthy men and women will consume either 2000 mg of American ginseng daily (four 500 mg
      pills will be taken at four different times during the day always with food/meals) or a
      placebo (4 cellulose) for four weeks prior to engaging in a 40 minute downhill treadmill jog
      (12% decline) at a speed of 7 miles per hour.  Participants will consume one pill with
      breakfast, one pill with lunch, one pill with dinner and another pill with a snack either
      between meals or prior to bedtime. The exercise will be consist of five, eight minute bouts
      of jogging with two minutes of rest/recovery in between. The degree of muscle soreness will
      be assessed using a Biodex strength testing machine (isometric and concentric isokinetic
      torque), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and a self-rating of perceived soreness on a
      scale from zero to ten.  All of the above measures will be taken before and several times
      after the downhill jogging protocol.
