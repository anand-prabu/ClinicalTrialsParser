  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab administered to participants
      with incurable advanced biomarker-positive solid tumors that have not responded to current
      therapy or for which current therapy is not appropriate. The hypothesis is that
      administration of pembrolizumab to participants with some types of solid tumors will result
      in a clinically meaningful response rate.
