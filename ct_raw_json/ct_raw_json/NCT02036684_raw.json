Each session will include: a 5-minute warm-up, 25 minutes of aerobic exercise, 25 minutes of resistance training (5 exercises targeting major muscle groups), and a 5-minute cool-down. Training intensity progression will occur throughout the intervention. Participants will be provided with resistance bands, a stability ball, and an exercise mat. The PFMX prescription will include a gradual increase in PFMX exercises from 20 per day during weeks 1-2, 60 per day during weeks 3-4, and 100 per day during weeks 5-6. The total number of repetitions of the PFMXs will be divided equally between the rhythmic and sustained contractions."

            "textblock": "Radical prostatectomy is the most common and effective treatment for localized prostate\n      cancer. Unfortunately, radical prostatectomy is associated with significant adverse effects,\n      such as urinary incontinence, sexual dysfunction, and reduced physical function that\n      collectively diminish health-related quality of life which may persist for up to two years\n      postoperatively. The primary objective of this trial is to assess the feasibility of\n      conducting of a multi-site randomized controlled trial to test the effect of a comprehensive\n      prehabilitation program versus standard care for men with prostate cancer undergoing radical\n      prostatectomy. We hypothesize that men with prostate cancer undergoing radical prostatectomy\n      in the comprehensive prehabilitation program (full-body exercises and pelvic floor muscle\n      exercises) will report better health-related quality of life, urological symptoms, and\n      physical fitness, physical activity, and pain, as well as a shorter postoperative length of\n      stay than participants receiving standard preoperative care (pelvic floor muscle exercises\n      alone). Our secondary objective is to report estimates of efficacy on several clinically\n      important outcomes for this population that will be used for sample size calculations in an\n      adequately powered trial."
