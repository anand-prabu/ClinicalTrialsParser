  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The waveform assessment of an athlete's speech production has a high probability of showing
      abnormalities after brain injury (concussions) which could be used not only for diagnosis of
      the concussion, but for recovery of the brain.  The aim of this study is to investigate this
      possibility using the Cobweb automated application system for acoustic processing.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients diagnosed or suspected of having a sports concussion seen in a clinical
             setting

          -  Ages 6 -21

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have physical injuries to their lips, tongue or oral cavity will be
             excluded until they have healed.

          -  Patients with hearing or speech abnormalities who cannot consistently produce the
             stimulus materials.

          -  Non-native speakers who cannot read the materials or produce the stimuli
             consistently.

          -  Patients who cannot read the materials or produce the stimuli consistently due to
             their age.
