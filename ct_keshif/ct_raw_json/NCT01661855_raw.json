Only the associated\n      symptom of irritability has 2 drugs with FDA indications whereas no systematic data exists\n      on the pharmacologic treatment of anxiety in ASD, and response to rates to stimulants for\n      hyperactivity are lower than what is seen in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder\n      (ADHD). In addition, there are no biological markers of treatment response identified in\n      this population at this point.  This study will examine the potential efficacy and safety of\n      riluzole for core and associated symptom domains of autism and will explore biological\n      markers of safety and treatment response."

Ability to obtain written informed consent from the participant, if developmentally\n             appropriate. If a participant does not have the capacity to consent, ability to\n             obtain assent  (if developmentally appropriate), as well as written informed consent\n             from their parent(s)/legal guardian.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          1. Pregnant female patients; sexually active female patients on inadequate birth\n             control.\n\n          2. Patients with a serious medical condition that, based on QI judgement, might\n             interfere with the conduct of the study, confound interpretation of the study\n             results, or endanger their own well-being. Patients with evidence or history of\n             malignancy or any significant hematological, endocrine, cardiovascular (including any\n             rhythm disorder), respiratory, renal, hepatic, or gastrointestinal disease, not\n             including mild common pediatric diseases in these areas that are stable (e.g. mild\n             asthma, constipation etc). Patients with unstable epilepsy (i.e. seizures occurring\n             within the last 6 months), or patients with epilepsy who are not on stable doses of\n             antiepileptic medications (i.e. dose changes within the last 3 months).\n\n          3. Patients with hypersensitivity to riluzole or any components of its formulation.\n\n          4. Patients with one or more of the following:  HIV, HBV, HCV, hemophilia (bleeding\n             problems, recent nose and brain injuries), abnormal blood pressure (hypotension or\n             hypertension),  drug abuse, immunity disorder, major depressive episode or psychosis.\n\n          5. Patients unable to tolerate venipuncture procedures for blood sampling.\n\n          6. Patients receiving concomitant medications that specifically target the glutamate\n             system (e.g. memantine, d-cycloserine), or decrease the elimination of riluzole (e.g.\n             theophylline, quinolones), less than 30 days prior to the screening visit.\n\n          7. Patients actively enrolled in another intervention study.\n\n          8. Patients who are unable to swallow pills.\n\n          9. Patients who have elevated liver enzymes 3 times the normal amount before the study\n             begins.\n\n         10. Patients with a genetic syndrome(s) that is known to be associated with autism (e.g.,\n             Fragile X, Williams Syndrome, Down Syndrome, Prader-Willi, etc.).
