            "textblock": "Background:\n\n      - Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a rare type of lung disease that occurs almost\n      exclusively in women. In LAM, muscle tissue grows in the lungs and starts to block the flow\n      of air. It is a progressive disease, and in severe cases may require a lung transplant. One\n      possible treatment to improve breathing in people with LAM is inhaled albuterol. Albuterol\n      can be given in a metered dose inhaler (MDI) or with a nebulizer. Researchers want to\n      compare these methods to see which method best improves lung function in women with LAM.\n\n      Objectives:\n\n      - To see whether a nebulizer or MDI can better improve lung function in women with LAM.\n\n      Eligibility:\n\n      - Women at least 18 years of age who have impaired lung function because of LAM.\n\n      Design:\n\n        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. No lab tests\n           will be needed for this study.\n\n        -  Participants will have a 3-day overnight stay at the National Institutes of Health.\n           Those who are using long-acting inhalers will have to stop taking these drugs 1 week\n           before the study.\n\n        -  Participants will receive either the nebulizer or two or four puffs of the inhaler.\n           Four puffs of albuterol is a higher dose than is normally prescribed, and is being\n           tested on this study.\n\n        -  Participants will have each treatment around the same time of day on each of the 3\n           days. Before and after taking the albuterol, participants will have lung function\n           tests."

            "textblock": "We have reported that approximately one third of patients with lymphangioleiomyomatosis\n      (LAM) who have airflow obstruction respond to bronchodilators such as albuterol, a\n      Beta2-adenergic receptor agonist, with an increase in forced expiratory flow in one second\n      (FEV1) of 12% and 200 ml above baseline values. Others however, have questioned these\n      findings, reporting instead, a low rate of response of only six percent. Contrasting with\n      our study, in this study albuterol was administered with a metered dose inhaler whereas in\n      ours it was given by nebulizer. We propose to measure changes in lung function after\n      administration of albuterol, respectively by metered inhaler and nebulizer, for 3\n      consecutive days in 150 LAM subjects.  Our hypothesis is that albuterol administered by\n      nebulization will produce a greater increase in FEV1 than two puffs of inhaled albuterol. If\n      this hypothesis is confirmed, then we may recommend that patients with LAM and airflow\n      obstruction use as a method of drug administration a nebulizer, rather than a metered dose\n      inhaler."
