In Phase I trials Carfilzomib demonstrated substantial\n      antitumor activity while exhibiting tolerable side effects.\n\n      Carfilzomib has been approved by the FDA for patients with multiple myeloma. The drug,\n      however, is not approved for the use with CRPC patients. This trial will evaluate the\n      tolerance and effectiveness of Carfilzomib in men with metastatic progressive CRPC following\n      chemotherapy and androgen inhibitors."
