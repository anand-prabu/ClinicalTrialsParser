However, its unclear how best to incorporate adherence education and support\n      programs into VA HIV outpatient care. We implemented and evaluated a pharmacist program\n      (ACE) and a Pager reminder program to support adherence in veterans with HIV.\n\n      Methods:\n\n      We used a quasi-experimental design with pre-post evaluation at four VA Centers.  Three\n      treatment conditions (ACE, Pager, Usual Care) were rolled-in sequentially over two study\n      phases, allowing for group comparisons between conditions. ACE is a multi-component\n      manualized 4-session, individual patient education and support program by trained\n      pharmacists. The Pager intervention used alphanumeric pagers to remind patients of dosing\n      times. Electronically-monitored medication adherence (MEMS), self-report questionnaires, and\n      pharmacy refill records were collected. Qualitative site interviews were collected before\n      and after interventions to assist with program evaluation. Multilevel mixed models were used\n      to analyze main study outcomes over time. Secondary analyses compared subgroup who actually\n      received all ACE sessions (\ufffdas treated\ufffd) to controls.\n\n      Status:\n\n      Project has been completed and Final Report submitted to HSR&D CO."
