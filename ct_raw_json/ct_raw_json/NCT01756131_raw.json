A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters\n             outside the reference range for the population being studied may be included only if\n             the Investigator and the GSK Medical Monitor agree that the finding is unlikely to\n             introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures.\n\n          -  Male or female between 18 and 55 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the\n             informed consent.\n\n          -  Females of childbearing potential with a negative pregnancy test (serum or urine) at\n             screen and at Day -1, and agrees to use one of the contraception methods listed in\n             the protocol for an appropriate period of time (as determined by the product label or\n             investigator) prior to the start of dosing to sufficiently minimize the risk of\n             pregnancy at that point.  Female subjects must agree to use contraception until the\n             investigational product is undetectable.\n\n          -  Body weight greater than or equal to 50 kilograms (kg) for men and greater than or\n             equal to 45 kg for women and body mass index (BMI) within the range 18.5-31.0\n             kilograms per meters squared (inclusive).\n\n          -  Average QTcB or QTcF less than 450 milliseconds (msec); or QTc less than 480 msec in\n             subjects with Bundle Branch Block.\n\n          -  Capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the\n             requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  As a result of the medical interview, physical examination, or screening\n             investigations, the Investigator considers the subject unfit for the study.\n\n          -  A positive pre-study Hepatitis B surface antigen, positive Hepatitis C antibody, or\n             positive test for HIV antibody result within 3 months of screening\n\n          -  High-risk behavior for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection including one of\n             the following risk factors within six months before entering the study (day 1):\n             Unprotected vaginal or anal sex with a known HIV infected person or a casual partner,\n             engaged in sex work for money or drugs, acquired a sexually transmitted disease, high\n             risk partner currently or in the previous six months.\n\n          -  The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational\n             product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current\n             study: 30 days, 5 half-lives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the\n             investigational product (whichever is longer).\n\n          -  Exposure to more than four new chemical entities within 12 months prior to the first\n             dosing day.\n\n          -  Use of prescription or non-prescription drugs, including vitamins, herbal and dietary\n             supplements (including St John's Wort) within 7 days (or 14 days if the drug is a\n             potential enzyme inducer) or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first\n             dose of study medication, unless in the opinion of the Investigator and GSK Medical\n             Monitor the medication will not interfere with the study procedures or compromise\n             subject safety.\n\n          -  History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof or a\n             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the Investigator or GSK\n             Medical Monitor, contraindicates their participation.
