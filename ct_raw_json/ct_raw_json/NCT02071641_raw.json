            "textblock": "Targeted therapies are associated with (acquired) resistance after a median of 5-11 months\n      of treatment, resulting in disease progression, while almost no tumors are intrinsically\n      resistant in the first line setting. The investigators recently published that tumor cell\n      resistance to sunitinib may be directly related to lysosomal sequestration of sunitinib.\n      This resistance mechanism was shown to be transient, since a drug-free culture period could\n      normalize the lysosomal storage capacity for sunitinib and resulted in recovery of drug\n      sensitivity.\n\n      In two reports it has been suggested that patients with metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma who\n      responded to sunitinib in the first-line setting may benefit from rechallenge with sunitinib\n      after failure of second-line treatment. However, these data are retrospective. A prospective\n      trial to investigate a rechallenge with sunitinib is needed to determine whether this\n      strategy is of benefit for patients with mRCC with prior clinical benefit to sunitinib but\n      who stopped treatment because of overt clinical resistance."
