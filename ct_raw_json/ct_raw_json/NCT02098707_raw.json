Berg Balance Scale (BBS) will be\n      performed to assess static and dynamic balance abilities. In order to determine some\n      variables as index of postural stability, the investigators will use a stabilometric\n      platform. With respect to the average centre of gravity the standard deviation (SD) of trunk\n      sway will be calculated: total, in antero-posterior (AP) and in medio-lateral (ML)\n      direction. The investigators can obtain a statokinesigram, that is the layout of a line\n      connecting the successive positions of the center of pressure during the recording, and the\n      area of the ellipse containing 90% of the sampled positions of the center of pressure.
