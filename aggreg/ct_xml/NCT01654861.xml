  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      -  The combination of gemcitabine and HDIVC is safe and may favorably change the clinical
           course for an individual patient.

        -  The combination of gemcitabine and HDIVC is synergistic in anti-tumor effect as seen in
           preclinical models, where HDIVC creates a pro-oxidative effect that adds to the
           anti-tumor effect of gemcitabine.

        -  The combination of gemcitabine and HDIVC may improve Progression Free Survival (PFS).

        -  The dosage schema of 1.2 g /kg bolus infusion followed by lower dose of 0.3 g / kg
           infusion may create sustained elevation in Vitamin C plasma levels for increased
           cytotoxic effect.

        -  The addition of HDIVC &amp; oral supplementation of Vitamin C to standard treatment with
           gemcitabine may improve quality of life for patients with comparison to prior to
           treatment start of this protocol.

        -  CA 19-9 and inflammatory markers may show trends for patients in this trial.

    <description>Adverse events, whether volunteered by the study subject, discovered by the investigators during questioning, or detected by physical examination, laboratory tests, or other means will be collected and recorded at each visit.  Events will be recorded from the time the consent is signed until 4 weeks after the study protocol is discontinued.  Subjects experiencing Grade 4 neutropenia, Grade ≥3 thrombocytopenia, or Grade 2 peripheral neuropathy who do not recover will have treatment protocol discontinued.</description>

    <description>CT and PET scans will be performed at baseline and then every two months.  Target and Non-Target Lesions will be identified and recorded at baseline.  When subsequent scans are performed, anti-tumor responses will be assessed using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST).</description>
