    <textblock>
      This study is being done to evaluate single incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) for
      colorectal diseases, compared to multi-port laparoscopic surgery. This study is also
      intended to standardize the SILS technique for colorectal diseases

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To report the experience of SILS procedure in the treatment of colorectal disease.

      II. To standardize the SILS technique.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo single incision laparoscopic surgery with GelPort® attachment.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 2 weeks, 3 and 6 months,
      and at 1 year.

             treatment schedule

          -  Patients with disease processes limited to the right colon; this will include Crohn's
             disease, polyp disease, and cancers of the right colon

          -  American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) =&lt; 3

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Inability to obtain informed consent

          -  Previous right colon surgery

          -  Previous extensive abdominal surgery that would limit the laparoscopic approach

          -  Stage IV disease at surgery

          -  Metastatic disease diagnosed by computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging
             (MRI), or nuclear imaging

          -  Any condition which precludes compliance with the study (Investigator discretion)

          -  Co-morbid condition(s) that could limit the subject's ability to participate in the
             study or to comply with follow-up requirements, or that could impact the scientific
             integrity of the trial
