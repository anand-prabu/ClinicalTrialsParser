  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients post total hip arthroplasty (THA) remain at high risk of developing Deep Vein
      Thrombosis (DVT) during the recovery period following surgery despite the availability of
      effective pharmacological and mechanical prophylactic methods. The use of calf muscle
      neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) during the hospitalised recovery period on this
      patient group may be effective at preventing DVT. However, the haemodynamic effectiveness
      and comfort characteristics of NMES in post-THA patients immediately following surgery have
      yet to be established.

      The main objectives are:

        1. To establish if patients in the early post-operative period have tolerance for NMES.

        2. To determine if applying NMES to patients immediately post-THA increases venous outflow
           from the lower limb over resting conditions.

    <description>Duplex Doppler ultrasound will be used as the outcome measure. Both legs will be measured for hemodynamic performance in the popliteal vein by placing the probe at the popliteal fossa.
Measurements of peak venous velocity (cm/s), popliteal vein diameter (cm), time averaged mean velocity (TAMEAN, cm/s) and volume flow (ml/min) will be recorded.
Doppler measurements will be taken initially at rest, before the application of NMES and once again when the NMES session had commenced.</description>

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Measurements will be taken at 3 time points (before application of NMES, after application of NMES had begun and at the end of the protocol).
The measurement consists of asking patients to mark their level of comfort using a 100mm, non-hatched visual-analogue-scale (VAS).
A VAS of 30 mm or less will be categorised as mild pain, between 31 and 69mm as moderate pain and scores of 70mm or greater as severe pain.</description>
