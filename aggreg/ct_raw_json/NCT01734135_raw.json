Furthermore, treatments are available to improve survival and reduce\n      hospitalization if the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is < 40%.  Accordingly,\n      guidelines recommend an LVEF measure for patients with suspected heart failure.  Prior work\n      has demonstrated that patients with high BNP values do not always have a measure of left\n      ventricular ejection.\n\n      Hypothesis:  A reminder to patients with BNP and no imaging may prompt providers to order\n      appropriate imaging potentially leading to 1) identification of unsuspected depressed\n      ejection fraction and 2) more appropriate treatment."
