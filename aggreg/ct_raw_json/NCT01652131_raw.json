Blood samples will be taken at time 0 (after induction of anesthesia and before initiating infusion) and then every 5 minutes for half an hour and then every 15 minutes up to 90 minutes. Blood samples will be processed in the Institution's laboratory. Urine will be measured at the end of the intervention. With these data kinetic parameters will be estimated for each patient."

Besides, obese patients represent a\n      particular group of subjects as they theoretically with-hold a constant inflammatory\n      response and that would modify the way solutions behave intravenously, that is how long they\n      remain inside.\n\n      Having said this, we wish to describe the way colloid solutions behave in this group of\n      patients by taking serial blood samples in 12 obese patients after a colloid infusion, to\n      calculate plasma dilution curves based on hemoglobin dilution and therefore infer the time\n      it remains intravascularly.\n\n      All this in the hope this information will help, in the near future, to establish a more\n      objective way to use these solutions and avoid possible complications due to\n      over-administration."
