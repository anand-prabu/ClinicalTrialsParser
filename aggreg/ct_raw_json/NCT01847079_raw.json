            "textblock": "PROBIC\n\n      Rationale: Procalcitonin measurements can reduce the number of blood cultures in the ICU.\n\n      Objective: The investigators suggest that PCT is a marker for blood stream infection in all\n      patients in the ICU in whom attending physicians/ intensivists order blood culturing in the\n      suspicion of microbial infection. The investigators want to demonstrate that its use for\n      guiding blood culturing is cost-effective and safe compared with blood cultures alone.\n\n      Study design: Prospective, non- inferiority, multicenter, single-blinded, cluster-\n      randomised cross-over clinical trial.\n\n      Intervention (if applicable): The intensive care units will be allocated into two groups: a\n      control group (blood culture) and the intervention group (procalcitonin).\n\n      Main study parameters/endpoints: Safety, expressed as mortality at day 28 and 90, with a\n      mortality difference not exceeding a between groups difference of 10% by non-inferiority\n      analysis.\n\n      Cost-effectiveness, expressed in euro, calculated by deducting costs of procalcitonin\n      testing from saved blood cultures compared with standard treatment spending on blood\n      cultures in the control group.\n\n      ICIS\n\n      Rationale: The aim was to evaluate the Intensive Care Infection Score (ICIS) in predicting\n      microbial infection and its sequelae in critically ill patients in whom attending\n      physicians/ intensivists order blood culturing in the suspicion of microbial infection.\n\n      Objective: Because of the complexity of the pathophysiology of systemic inflammation it is\n      unlikely that a single parameter will have sufficient diagnostic accuracy for infection.\n      Therefore we will study combining parameters producing a diagnostic score.\n\n      Study design: Prospective, multicenter, cohort trial. Supplement for the control arm of the\n      ProBIC study.\n\n      Intervention (if applicable): Blood is drawn for daily routine laboratory measurements and\n      collected in K3EDTA aliqnots. The ICIS score is composed of five blood-cell derived\n      parameters which can be extracted using the same aliqnots.\n\n      Main study parameters/endpoints: To develop and evaluate a blood- cell derived score to\n      enable the diagnosis of microbial infection, its likelihood, its invasiveness and severity."
