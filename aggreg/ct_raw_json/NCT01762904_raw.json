It has been shown that 2% chlorhexidine\n      in solution with 70% isopropyl alcohol has greater activity than chlorhexidine in aqueous\n      solution. The constant use of triclosan causes resistance of some microorganisms on some\n      antibiotics.It has been shown that 0.5% of triclosan in 60% alcohol isopropyl chlorhexidine\n      is more effective than alcohol. The aim of the study is to know if 2% chlorhexidine has more\n      residual effect than triclosan 1%, both antiseptic diluted in 70% isopropyl alcohol."
