  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Affective disorders, such as postpartum depression (PPD) and other reproductive-related mood
      disorders, are common and constitute a significant burden for women, children, and society.
      However, little is known about the neurobiological mechanisms underlying depressive
      disorders in women. The long-term goal of this research is to 1) advance our understanding
      of the biological mechanisms underlying both the triggering of and susceptibility to
      depressive disorders in women; and 2) permit the prediction of those at risk for PPD. The
      objective of the current project is to examine whether those with a past episode of PPD (at
      &quot;high risk&quot; for recurrence) show differences in emotional arousal and reward processing
      domains relative to healthy control women (without a history of PPD) under baseline and
      hormone withdrawal-precipitated conditions. The central hypothesis is that reproductive
      hormone changes are associated with dysregulation of the neural circuits underlying
      emotional arousal and reward processing and consequent depressive symptoms in high-risk
      women. The rationale for the proposed study is that employing a scaled down model of
      puerperal hormonal events in high-risk women permits the identification of a group of
      individuals homogeneous for reproductive related affective dysfunction and, hence, the best
      opportunity for disentangling the specific changes in brain function due to reproductive
      hormones from those accompanying reproductive hormone-precipitated affective dysfunction.
      Moreover, identifying a neurophysiologic biomarker for hormone-related affective dysfunction
      provides a clear pathway for examining mechanisms of susceptibility to affective dysfunction
      across disorders. The investigators plan to accomplish the objectives of this application by
      pursuing the following specific aims: 1) to assess the effects of simulated postpartum
      reproductive hormone withdrawal, compared to baseline, on corticolimbic circuit activation
      in high-risk and control women; and 2) to examine the effects of reproductive hormone
      withdrawal, compared to baseline, on reward circuit activation in high-risk and control
      women. An additional exploratory aim is to identify a neural biomarker, characterized by
      corticolimbic and reward circuit dysfunction, that can be used to predict the onset of PPD.
      The proposed study involves experimentally manipulating reproductive hormones in euthymic
      women to create a scaled down version of the changes that occur at the puerperium. This
      endocrine manipulation paradigm will be used to examine the neurocircuitry underlying the
      regulation of affect and reward processing under baseline and hormone
      withdrawal-precipitated conditions among women who are expected to experience
      hormone-related affective dysregulation (n=15) and controls (n=15). In short, the
      investigators expect that relative to baseline, high-risk women will show greater
      dysregulation in neural circuits responsible for emotion processing and reward processing
      during hormone withdrawal than low-risk control women. The expected outcome of this research
      is the identification of neural circuits underlying both the susceptibility to and mediation
      of hormone-related affective dysfunction. Understanding these neurobiological mechanisms
      will subsequently improve the ability to identify those at risk for PPD, which may
      strengthen prevention efforts and ultimately prevent the deleterious effects of maternal
      depression on offspring.

For both tasks, the BOLD response will be examined within a priori selected regions of interest, including corticolimbic regions for the Emotional Face Matching Task and the ventral striatum for the Monetary Reward Task. Contrasts of interest will include negative versus neutral face blocks in the Emotional Face Matching Task, and win versus non-win outcomes in the Monetary Reward Task.

    <description>Following baseline assessments, participants will receive five monthly intramuscular injections of leuprolide acetate (Lupron) 3.75 mg. After the second month of Lupron-alone treatment, high plasma levels of estradiol and progesterone will be attained via micronized progesterone and estradiol tablets for eight weeks (with continued Lupron administration). Estradiol will be started at a dose of 4 mg/day and increased progressively up to 10 mg/day. Progesterone will be started at 400 mg/day and increased progressively up to 800 mg/day. After eight weeks of hormone replacement, active hormone tablets will be replaced with placebo to induce a precipitous drop in plasma estradiol and progesterone levels. Lupron will maintain hypogonadal levels for a four-week withdrawal phase. Participants will then be followed for eight weeks additional while unmedicated.</description>
