    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a goal-directed resuscitation therapy
      within the first 8 hours after major abdominal cancer surgery reduces postoperative
      complications compared to a standard therapy.

    <description>A target value of a cardiac index (CI) greater than 2.5 L/min/m2 and a mean arterial pressure of 70 mmHg will be sought.
The first step will be fluid resuscitation with 200ml aliquots of Lactated Ringer's solution plus human albumin 20% 50 mL whenever the CI is lower than 2.5 L/min/m2. The fluid challenge will be stopped if the CVP rises by more than 4 mmHg during the infusion period or CI increases less than 10%.
When the CI is lower than or equal to 2.5L/min/m2 despite of fluid challenge, dobutamine will be initiated with increasing doses up to 20mcg/kg/min.
The final step will be red blood transfusion to reach a hematocrit higher than 28%.
If necessary, norepinephrine infusion will be used to maintain a mean arterial pressure above 70 mmHg.</description>
