      The purpose of this study is to determine whether transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic
      shunt (TIPS) combined with large spontaneous portosystemic shunts embolization are effective
      in the prevention of refractory hepatic encephalopathy (HE).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) has been used for more than 20 years
      since 1988 to treat some of the complications of portal hypertension, especially variceal
      bleeding and ascites refractory to conventional therapy. However, this procedure has two
      major disadvantages: shunt dysfunction and hepatic encephalopathy (HE). Notabley, the use of
      expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE)-covered stent has significantly reduced the risk of
      shunt dysfunction, but the post-TIPS HE remains a problem even with these new stents.

      The incidence of post-TIPS HE ranges between 5% and 35% HE during the first year and tends
      to be particularly frequent during the first months after TIPS and less common with time.
      Meta-analysis has that increased age, prior HE and higher Child-Pugh class/score were the
      most robust predictors for post-TIPS HE.

      There is no consensus on the management of post-TIPS HE. Episodic HE after TIPS can be
      treated traditionally. The cornerstones of the treatment of this type of HE are the
      identification and treatment of the precipitating event and the general support of the
      patients. Refractory HE not responding to standard treatment is, in our opinion, the most
      important problem faced when a patients has to be treated with TIPS. In some cases, the
      occurrence of this complication may deeply reduce the patient's quality of life and the cure
      may be worse than the disease. Refractory HE can be treated by reducing the diameter of the
      stent or by occluding the shunt. However, the procedure is not without dangers and may not
      solve the problem in all patients, and the complications of portal hypertension, such as
      varices or refractory ascites, which were supposed to be managed by the TIPS, may recur as a
      consequence of shunt reduction or occlusion.

      Besides, there are no established methods or drugs to effectively prevent the occurrence of
      HE after TIPS. One possibility is the use of stents with a small diameter, since post-TIPS
      HE was related to the amount of blood shunted. Riggio et al. compared the incidence of HE
      after TIPS created with 8-or 10-mm PTFE-covered stents and the study was stopped because of
      higher complications due to portal hypertension after TIPS in the 8-mm group. Our center
      performed a RCT to evaluate the effectiveness of L-ornithine-L-aspartate (LOLA) on plasma
      ammonia in cirrhotic patients after TIPS.  Another RCT reevaluateing the effect of TIPS with
      8- or 10-mm covered stent for the prevention of variceal rebleeding in cirrhotic patients
      was also undergoing.

      But for those with large spontaneous portosystemic shunts(SPSS), embolization might also
      represent a therapeutic target.SPSS is, as the name implies, potential communications
      between the portal venous circulation and the systemic venous circulation that can open,
      develop, and potentially grow to enable flow within them when one of these circulations
      (portal or venous) has high pressure or is obstructed or both in an effort to reduce
      pressure or bypass an obstruction or both. SPSS mainly include splenorenal shunt,
      gastrorenal shunt, paraesophageal vein, paraumbilical vein, et al. For patients with
      decompensated cirrhosis, the portal vein pressure increased significantly and some blood
      were diverted to the systemic circulation by collateral vessels between the splenorenal
      vein, short gastric veins, posterior gastric vein, and so on, namely SPSS. The nature
      history of SPSS in patients with liver cirrhosis is still unclear. Most patients were
      diagnosed by chance.

      Previous reports have suggested that the incidence of SPSS was 16% in patients with liver
      cirrhosis and portal hypertension and the incidence of refractory HE was about 46%. A study
      published in 2005 revealed that about 71% of the patients with cirrhosis with refractory HE
      have large SPSS. Therefore, the presence of a SPSS not only provides an explanation for the
      persistence or recurrence of HE despite an acceptable liver function, it might also
      represent a therapeutic target. Nowadays, several series have reported embolization of large
      SPSSs for the treatment of chronic therapy-refractory HE.To date, no data was about the
      safety and efficacy of embolization of large SPSS in the prevention of post-TIPS HE.

    <description>TIPS was performed in a conventional fashion or in combination of percutaneous transhepatic or transsplenic approach. Postoperatively, intravenous heparin (8,000-12,000 u/d) for five days, warfarin for six months to one year and lifelong aspirin were routinely prescribed at dosages to achieve an international normalized ratio (INR) of up to two times the upper limit of normal for the prevention of shunt dysfunction. Intravenous arginine and branched-chain amino acids and antibiotics were administered for five days as prophylactics for encephalopathy and operation-related infection, respectively. TIPS revision was planned if any evidence of shunt dysfunction was seen; thereafter, long-term anticoagulation was prescribed.</description>
