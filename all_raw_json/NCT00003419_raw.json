Antiviral therapy acts against the HIV virus and\n      may be an effective treatment for Kaposi's sarcoma.\n\n      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well antiviral therapy works in treating\n      patients with slowly progressing HIV-related Kaposi's sarcoma."

Patients may receive either 2 RTIs or 2 RTIs plus 2 PIs. Treatment\n      continues for 12 weeks, then progression is assessed.\n\n      Patients with stable or regressing Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) with a viral load of greater than\n      500 copies of RNA/mL may continue with the therapy (if the viral load has decreased by\n      greater than 2 logs) or may modify therapy (if the viral load has decreased less than 2\n      logs). Patients with progressive disease may begin chemotherapy but continue to receive the\n      antiretroviral therapy. Treatment continues for at least 48 weeks.\n\n      Patients are followed every 8 weeks until week 48.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: This study will accrue a total of 14-25 patients."
