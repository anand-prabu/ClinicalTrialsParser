Vandetanib is not approved by the FDA for use in treating breast cancer.\n      This study will compare vandetanib to a placebo.\n\n      The proposed study is designed to determine the change in Ki-67 expression on paired breast\n      cancer samples obtained before and after treatment with vandetanib.  Other tumor markers\n      including RET, TUNEL and phosphorylation specific levels of ERK1/2, AKT and mTOR will also\n      be assessed on the paired samples.\n\n      Subjects who have a core biopsy of the breast which demonstrates invasive breast cancer and\n      requires surgical excision of the lesion will be eligible for inclusion in the study.  The\n      tyrosine kinase inhibitor, vandetanib 300 mg, will be given once a day for 14 days prior to\n      surgery.   Following surgery, tissue markers would be analyzed on each of the paired\n      samples, allowing for rapid assessment of in vivo response to TKI treatment."
