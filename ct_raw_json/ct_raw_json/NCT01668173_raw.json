HSP90 is found in both\n      normal and cancer cells, but the investigators think it is more important in cancer cells.\n\n      This study will see if AUY922 helps people with myelofibrosis, essential thrombocythemia and\n      polycythemia vera. This study will also see if AUY922 is safe in people with myelofibrosis,\n      essential thrombocythemia and polycythemia vera. It will find out what effects, good and/or\n      bad, AUY922 has on the patient and the disease. The researchers hope that this study will\n      help them to find better treatments for primary myelofibrosis, essential thrombocythemia and\n      polycythemia vera."
