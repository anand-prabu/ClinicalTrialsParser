Subject:\n\n               -  Has an FEV1/FVC <0.7 at screening; and\n\n               -  Has a post-bronchodilator FEV1 at screening of between 30% and 80% (inclusive)\n                  of the predicted normal value.\n\n          3. Subject demonstrates at screening at least a 120 mL increase in FEV1 within 1 hour of\n             receiving 500 \u00b5g of ipratropium bromide from a PARI LC Sprint\u00ae nebulizer.\n\n          4. Females of non-childbearing potential. All male subjects must agree to use a highly\n             effective method of birth control with partners of childbearing potential during the\n             study and for 1 month after completion of study dosing.\n\n          5. Subject (or care giver) is able to properly prepare and administer study medication.\n\n          6. Subject is willing and able to give written informed consent to participate.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  1. Subject has had a COPD exacerbation or lung infection within 6 weeks before\n             randomization.\n\n             2. Subject has had an initiation of treatment, or a change in dose, of an inhaled or\n             oral corticosteroid, or long-acting beta2 agonist (LABA), or long-acting muscarinic\n             antagonist (LAMA) within 4 weeks before the qualifying ipratropium bromide response\n             test.\n\n             4. Subject is taking daily maintenance inhaled/systemic corticosteroids (>1000 \u03bcg of\n             fluticasone propionate equivalent or \u226510 mg prednisone).\n\n             5. Subject has an uncontrolled hematologic, immunologic, renal, neurologic, hepatic,\n             endocrine, or other disease or condition based on information gathered from the\n             medical history, physical examination, or laboratory findings that might place the\n             subject at undue risk or potentially compromise the results or interpretation of the\n             study.\n\n             6. Subject has a history of significant cerebrovascular disease, coronary artery\n             disease, or cardiac arrhythmias.  Subject has a history (or family history) of\n             congenital prolonged QTc syndrome or has an abnormal clinically significant\n             electrocardiogram (ECG) at screening, including QTcB value >450 msec (males) or >470\n             msec (females); or shows evidence of clinically significant rhythm abnormality.\n\n             7. Subject has a known hypersensitivity to TD-4208 or similar drug class. 8. Subject\n             has a history of alcoholism or drug abuse within 2 years prior to screening."
