  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare a minimal invasive operation in local anesthesia with sclerotherapy
      for symptomatic testicular hydrocele within 6 months after randomization. Thirty days
      complication rates will be assessed. The hypothesis is that surgery will lead to faster cure
      while sclerotherapy would be cheaper and have less complications.

    <textblock>
      Testicular hydrocele is a common disorder even though it´s exact prevalence is unknown. In
      areas with filariasis it´s endemic.

      Hydrocele is a benign condition where fluid accumulates in between two layers of tunica
      vaginalis (embryologically, the peritoneum), surrounding the testicle. The cause is unknown
      but inflammatory conditions is believed to induce these changes. The pathogenesis of
      hydrocele is believed to be a nonbalanced secretion and resorption of fluid.

      Diagnosis of hydrocele is easy since the patient presents with an enlarged scrotum and
      clinical investigation including palpation and transillumination of the scrotum confirms the
      diagnosis. A scrotal ultrasound might be indicated to rule out a malignancy or if the
      diagnosis is unclear.

      Treatment for hydrocele is only indicated when the patient has symptoms since all treatment
      modalities carries risk of complications, such as hematoma, infection, pain and even
      infertility concerns has been raised.

      Operative management is considered the golden standard of treatment when considering
      recurrence but less invasive procedures such as sclerotherapy is frequently used, mainly due
      to cost and complications issues.

      Lord´s procedure has in several series shown low frequency of complications and excellent
      recurrence  rates. However, Lord´s procedure and sclerotherapy has not been tested head to
      head and the optimal treatment for hydrocele is yet to be determined.

      This study aims to compare these techniques and evaluate the results within 1 year after
      randomization on cure, complication rates and various secondary descriptive outcomes.

      The investigators aim to adhere to CONSORT.

    <description>Patients who are randomized to surgery will undergo an emptying of the hydrocele to allow for clinical examination of the testicle. The amount will be measured and inspected. No sclerotherapy will be instilled. If patients are cured by this simple measure, they will be classified as cured by this and analyzed as cured by surgery, in intention to treat analysis.</description>
