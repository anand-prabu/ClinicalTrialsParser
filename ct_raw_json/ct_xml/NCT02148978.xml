  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a chronic disease characterized by recurrent pulmonary infections
      and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. The vast majority of patients with CF will develop
      pancreatic endocrine insufficiency over time manifested as altered glucose metabolism. The
      presence of overt diabetes in patients with CF is associated with adverse clinical outcomes.

      The underlying pathophysiology of cystic fibrosis related diabetes (CFRD) is still a matter
      of investigation. In addition to localized tissue damage developing similar to that of the
      exocrine pancreas, additional mechanisms may be involved. The investigators have recently
      shown that insulin secretion in patients with CF is significantly altered prior to the
      development of diabetes. This phenomenon is associated with reduced secretion of gut derived
      incretins (specifically GIP). The blunting of incretin induced insulin secretion (whether
      due to a deranged interaction of gastrointestinal contents with enterocytes resulting in
      reduced secretion or due to rapid clearance of such peptides) may be a major underlying
      driver of altered glucose metabolism in such patients.
