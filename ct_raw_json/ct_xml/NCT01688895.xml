  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The initial objective of this protocol is to assemble a well-documented group of patients
      with confirmed diagnoses of the erythropoietic protoporphyrias, including autosomal
      recessive Erythropoietic Protoporphyria (EPP) and X-Linked Protoporphyria (XLP) for
      clinical, biochemical, and genetic studies. The long-term objectives are (1) to conduct a
      longitudinal investigation of the natural history, complications, and therapeutic outcomes
      in people with erythropoietic protoporphyria, (2) to systematically investigate the
      psychological effects of the erythropoietic protoporphyrias on children and adults, and (3)
      to investigate the correlation between the identified genotypes and the resulting clinical
      presentation, also determining the possible interaction of other genetic markers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The porphyrias are a group of rare metabolic diseases that may present in childhood or adult
      life and are due to deficiencies of enzymes in the heme biosynthetic pathway.  The most
      common manifestations are related to accumulation of intermediates in the pathway and
      usually occur as acute neurological attacks (as in the acute or hepatic porphyrias), or
      cutaneous photosensitivity (as in the cutaneous porphyrias, including the erythropoietic
      protoporphyrias).  Multiple mutations have been identified in each of the porphyrias
      [Anderson, 2001].  The risk of disability or death from these disorders is significant, in
      part because diagnosis is often delayed due to lack of adoption of diagnostic testing in
      clinical practice.  Moreover, the natural history of these disorders is not well described
      and it is not known what determines differences in outcomes.  New therapies are needed.  For
      existing therapies, high-quality evidence on short and long term efficacy and safety is
      generally lacking [Sood 2008].  Therefore, the purpose of this study of a large group of
      patients with EPP and XLP is to provide a better understanding of the natural history of
      these disorders, as affected by available therapies, and to aid in developing new forms of
      treatment.  Much of the data collected on subjects as participants in the Longitudinal Study
      of the Porphyrias will be accessed for this study specific to the investigation of the
      erythropoietic protoporphyrias.  To maximize the information that can be informative in our
      objectives, additional data will be collected, including additional biochemical findings and
      EPP-specific psychosocial parameters.

      The Office of Rare Diseases (ORD) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) established a
      Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) in collaboration with other NIH Institutes
      and currently has funded 19 rare diseases clinical research consortia and one Data
      Management and Coordinating Center. The Porphyrias Consortium was created as part of the
      RDCRN, to study the human porphyrias. The Porphyrias Consortium is a consortium of the
      academic institutions listed in the participating institutions table. All Centers in the
      Porphyrias Consortium are participating in this study.  Additional centers may be added if
      funding is available.

        Subjects will be recruited from the following resources:

          1. Patients followed by one of the Investigators

          2. The American Porphyria Foundation (APF)

          3. The Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) Contact Registry

          4. Non-study Physician referrals

          5. Self-referrals, including family members of individuals diagnosed with Porphyria
             (proband) and other individuals who may have heard about the study from other
             subjects or prospective subjects.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        All subjects must also be enrolled in the Longitudinal Study of the Porphyrias.

        Diagnostic criteria:  #1 (a) AND [#2 (a and/or b) OR #3 (a or b or c)]

          -  Clinical features - a or b required

               1. A history of nonblistering cutaneous photosensitivity.

               2. A diagnosis of EPP or XLP in a relative.

          -  Biochemical findings ('a' is required)

               1. A marked increase in erythrocyte protoporphyrin [total erythrocyte
                  protoporphyrin &gt;200 ug/dL, or more than 1.5-fold increase (relative to ULN of 80
                  ug/dL)], with a predominance of free protoporphyrin (85-100% in EPP and 50-85%
                  in XLP).  Note: Methods in some laboratories for measuring free erythrocyte
                  protoporphyrin (FEP) actually measure zinc protoporphyrin, so cannot be relied
                  upon for diagnosis or characterizing the phenotype in EPP and XLP.

               2. Increased plasma porphyrins in almost all cases and a fluorescence emission peak
                  at ~634 nm.

               3. Normal urinary porphyrins (except in patients with hepatobiliary impairment),
                  and normal ALA and PBG.

          -  Molecular findings - one of the following:

               1. A disease causing FECH mutation trans to the IVS3-48C&gt;T low expression FECH
                  allele

               2. Two disease-causing FECH mutations

               3. A gain-of-function ALAS-2 C-terminal deletion/exon 11 mutation (in XLP).

        Others who may be enrolled

          -  Relatives who may be asymptomatic but may share genetic traits, including
             disease-causing mutations, as demonstrated by DNA studies in an index case.

          -  Possible but unconfirmed cases that meet some but not all diagnostic criteria for a
             definite diagnosis; these are likely to be informative as a comparison group.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  cases with elevations of porphyrins in urine, plasma or erythrocytes due to other
             diseases (i.e. secondary porphyrinuria or porphyrinemia), such as liver and bone
             marrow diseases [Gibson 2000].

          -  patients with a prior diagnosis of porphyria that cannot be documented by review of
             existing medical records or repeat biochemical or DNA testing.
