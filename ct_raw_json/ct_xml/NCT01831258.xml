  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Conceptually, awareness of pressure occurs only during wakefulness. Thus reducing the
      pressure during wakefulness may improve therapy comfort and potentially adherence without
      compromizing therapy efficacy. SensAwake™ is a unique pressure relief technology developed
      by Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare which detects irregularity in the flow signal indicative of
      the transition from sleep to wake. When the transition from sleep to wake is detected the
      device promptly reduces the pressure to help facilitate a return to sleep.

      The purpose of this study is to compare adherence and sleep quality outcomes in patients
      treated by CPAP with and without SensAwake technology.

      It is hypothesised that participants with SensAwake on will have improved adherence and
      sleep quality.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Aged 18-75 years with moderate-to-severe OSA (AHI equal to or greater than 10 per
             hour).

          -  Successful in-lab titration polysomnography (PSG)

          -  General (at home) sleep habits of:

          -  At least 7 hours in bed on most nights

          -  Lights out at 12 midnight or earlier

          -  Fluency in both written and spoken English.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants prescribed and fitted with any PAP device in the past 2 years

          -  Contraindicated for CPAP or AutoCPAP therapy.

          -  Any known factor or disease that might interfere with treatment adherence, study
             conduct or interpretation of the results such as severe psychiatric disease, history
             of non adherence to medical regimens, or unwillingness to comply with study
             requirements as determined by the principal investigator.

          -  Other significant sleep disorder(s) that would interfere with their ability to wear
             CPAP as determined by the principal investigator.

          -  Patients who are prescribed hypnotics and sedating medications.

          -  Any surgery of the mouth, nose, sinuses or airways (for OSA, snoring or otherwise) in
             the past 12 months.

          -  If participants are required, by the nature of their employment, to comply with
             therapy. For example truck drivers or airline pilots.

          -  If the physician objects to their patient taking part in the study.
