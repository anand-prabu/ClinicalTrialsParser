While EPG has also been shown to be capable of revealing the details of\n      linguopalatal interactions during swallowing, its applicability in swallowing therapy has\n      not been evaluated to date.  This study will determine if EPG can facilitate bolus\n      propulsion in patients presenting with swallowing problems of the oral phase.  Seven\n      patients with oral dysphagia will be selected to serve as subjects based on specific\n      inclusion and exclusion criteria, and each will be custom-fitted with a pseudo-palate.  Each\n      patient will undergo four 45-minute sessions of biofeedback training with emphasis on\n      developing systematic front-to-back anchoring of the tongue against the palate during\n      propulsion of liquid and semisolid boluses.  Ultrasound imaging will be used to determine\n      swallow durations and identify oral deficits of swallowing before the EPG biofeedback\n      training, and to identify any changes that may result from the training.  Quantitative\n      measurements will also be made of the swallow-related EPG contact timing and pattern before\n      and after training and compared for each individual subject as a function of training and\n      bolus volume.  Appropriate statistical analyses will be conducted."
