Whether this is one combined pain syndrome, where for\n      instance deep pain leads to cutaneous hyperalgesia, or two isolated synchronous pain\n      conditions, is unknown. By Giving pain free subjects an intense non-harmful electrical\n      stimulation in deeper tissues in the groin and recording the skin sensory function, this\n      hypothesis will be tested"
