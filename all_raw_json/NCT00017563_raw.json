Treatment\n      repeats once a week for a total of 4 courses.\n\n      Patients receive escalating doses of mitoxantrone until the maximum tolerated dose is\n      determined. (Phase I completed as of 2/15/02)\n\n      Patients undergo prostatectomy 2-4 weeks after completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients will be accrued for this study."
