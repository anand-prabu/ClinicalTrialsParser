Assess the therapeutic activity of temozolomide (TMZ) in patients with\n      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with or without brain metastases, untreated by\n      chemotherapy for metastatic disease. II. Characterize the acute side effects of temozolomide\n      in these patients. III. Assess the duration of response in responding patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is an open label, nonrandomized, multicenter study. Temozolomide is given by\n      oral doses that are equally fractionated over 5 days and repeated every 4 weeks. Patients\n      with brain metastases: Treatment is discontinued if there is progression of disease in both\n      sites (brain and nonbrain) or if there is progression of disease of the brain lesion and\n      stable disease of the other target lesions. Patients with progressive disease of the brain\n      target lesions with contemporary evidence of response in the other target lesion can receive\n      further temozolomide, in addition to nonchemotherapy medical treatment of the brain\n      metastases (steroids, mannitol, etc.). Patients with progressive disease in the other target\n      lesions with contemporary evidence of response of the brain target lesions can receive\n      further temozolomide therapy, in addition to specific local radiotherapy of the nonbrain\n      lesions. Patients without brain metastases: Treatment discontinues if there is clear cut\n      progression occurring before the first disease evaluation (8 weeks after treatment start).\n      For stable disease, the patient is treated for a minimum of 8 weeks and evaluated\n      thereafter. Treatment, in most cases, is for a minimum of 2 cycles and may continue for a\n      maximum of 6 cycles in the absence of disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or patient\n      refusal. All patients are followed every 6 weeks for survival.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A minimum of 24 evaluable patients and a maximum of 70 evaluable patients\n      will be accrued for this study."
