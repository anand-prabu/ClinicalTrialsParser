            "textblock": "The incidence of unresectable and obstructive  gastric cancer patients ranges in the\n      literature from 5 to 30 % . In such cases, gastro-entero anastomosis is traditionally\n      performed and can improve the quality of life by relieving the symptoms of impaired oral\n      intake without having a high surgical risk. Unfortunately, up to 25% of these patients may\n      develop impaired gastric emptying syndrome.  Gastric partitioning was originally described\n      by Devine in 1925 as a method of antral exclusion and complete division of the stomach\n      accompanied by a gastro-entero anastomosis in the proximal gastric pouch for the management\n      of difficult duodenal ulcers. This procedure has been modified along the years and was\n      adopted for the palliative treatment of gastric cancer. The advantages of the partitioning\n      includes: better gastric emptying, avoidance of direct tumor invasion of the gastro-entero\n      anastomosis, less contact between the ingested food and the tumor with less blood lost and\n      improved survival. Retrospective not randomized studies have been published demonstrating\n      the effectiveness of the procedure."

The first jejunal loop approximately\n      40 cm from the angle of Treitz will be used.

The gastric partitioning is\n      done 5 cm proximal to the lesion along the greater curvature towards the lesser curvature\n      above the incisura using linear cutting stapler. The partitioning is performed horizontally\n      and preserve a narrow tunnel along the lesser curvature that is calibrated with a orogastric\n      tube gauge 32. Subsequently, a pre-colic gastro-entero anastomosis is performed in the\n      proximal gastric chamber created by the partitioning. The anastomosis is done along the\n      posterior wall, with at least 5 cm of length using the first jejunal loop approximately 40\n      cm from the angle of Treitz.
