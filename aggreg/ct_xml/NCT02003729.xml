  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Home Sleep Study of ApneaDx is a pragmatic, multi-centre randomized double-blinded two
      arm non-inferiority trial primarily designed to assess the effectiveness and
      cost-effectiveness of management of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)after diagnosis based on
      ApneaDx™  a portable monitor as compared to based on polysomnography (PSG) and to evaluate
      the agreement between home sleep study with Apnea Dx™ and in-laboratory sleep study with PSG
      in patients being referred to sleep clinics with suggestive OSA symptoms.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Ontario, approximately 130,000 sleep studies were conducted in 2008, which is twice the
      number of sleep studies reported in 1999. In 2008, Ontario spent approximately $40 million
      on polysomnography (PSG) testing alone, despite the fact that access to PSG remained
      limited, with an average waiting time of approximately 3.5 months for an in-laboratory sleep
      study and approximately 12 months from referral to appropriate treatment.  Portable monitors
      (PM) have been developed in an effort to substitute for the more costly and labor intensive
      clinic-based PSG. As of 2011, there are over 40 PM commercially available in the United
      States with different configurations for cardiorespiratory and neurophysiologic signals.

      At the request of the Ontario Health Technology Advisory Committee (OHTAC), a panel that
      makes recommendations to the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care about the uptake
      and diffusion of health technologies, the Toronto Rehabilitation Institute convened an
      expert panel in 2007 to explore alternative approaches to the diagnosis of obstructive sleep
      apnea (OSA). Members of the expert panel suggested that despite the availability of a large
      number of PMs, home assessments are problematic as technicians are required to ensure
      continuous placement of electrodes for reliable testing. They also suggested that a good
      screening tool was not available at that time. The Toronto Rehabilitation Institute
      therefore undertook a research study that eventually led to the development of the ApneaDxTM
      PM.

      ApneaDx™ is a new PM that uses a microphone to record breath sounds and an acoustical
      analysis algorithm of breath sounds to determine the (Apnea Hypopnea Index) AHI. Results
      from preliminary studies suggest that the AHI derived from ApneaDx™ approximates that from
      PSG. In preliminary studies, it appears that for the diagnosis of sleep apnea, home sleep
      study with ApneaDx™ is simple and reliable even when conducted by untrained users.

      This study evaluates the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of management of OSA diagnosed
      based on a home sleep study with ApneaDx™. This study will be conducted by the Toronto
      Health Economics and Technology Assessment (THETA) Collaborative. Data from this study will
      be used to support practice recommendations regarding the use of a home sleep study with
      ApneaDxTM as input for diagnosis of OSA by the OHTAC and reimbursement considerations by the
      Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care.
