  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Given the cost of treating eating disorders and the substantial morbidity and mortality
      associated with these disorders, prevention of eating disorders has considerable public
      health significance.  Female athletes represent an important population for prevention due
      to their risk for the female athlete triad, which includes inadequate energy intake,
      irregular or cessation of menses, and osteoporosis. The proposed randomized controlled trial
      will provide important information regarding the efficacy, acceptability, and feasibility of
      implementing a brief eating disorder prevention and healthy living program within an
      existing social system of female athletes.

    <textblock>
      Given the cost of treating eating disorders (EDs) and the substantial morbidity and
      mortality associated with these disorders, prevention of EDs has considerable public health
      significance.  Research supports the use of a Healthy Weight (HW) program targeting small
      lifestyle modifications in the prevention of ED onset and in reducing ED risk factors.
      Studies show that HW can be tailored for specific social systems (e.g., sororities) which
      can facilitate dissemination and that undergraduate peer-leaders can implement these
      programs. Interventions that can be administered affordably by endogenous providers are more
      likely to be disseminated, as indicated by the large scale dissemination of a peer-led ED
      prevention program by a national sorority.  Another target social system for dissemination
      of ED prevention is collegiate athletics. Research suggests that disordered eating among
      female athletes is prevalent, and that this group is at greater, or at least equal, risk for
      developing EDs as non-athlete females. Disordered eating is especially dangerous in female
      athletes because it increases risk for the Female Athlete Triad (i.e., low energy
      availability/disordered eating, menstrual disorders, and decreased bone mineral
      density/osteoporosis) and subsequent injury. Moreover, the triad puts athletes at risk for
      serious long-term health consequences, such as osteoporosis, reproductive disorders, and
      cardiovascular disease. Despite this, efforts aimed at prevention of EDs among this group
      remain surprisingly limited. A pilot study with female athletes suggests that a modified
      version of HW can be successfully implemented by peer-leaders within the constraints of a
      competitive athletics program with positive effects at 12 month follow-up. The proposed
      study is a randomized controlled trial of the HW intervention among female athletes. 500
      female collegiate athletes from three sites will be randomized to either the HW prevention
      program or a brochure waitlist control condition using group (cluster) randomization based
      on teams. Participants will complete surveys and telephone interviews at pretest, posttest,
      and at 6 and 12 month follow-ups. The investigators will examine; (1) the efficacy of HW in
      reducing empirically supported ED risk factors relative to a waitlist brochure control
      condition at one year, (2) whether HW impacts secondary outcomes, including knowledge and
      identification of the female athlete triad, treatment seeking for the triad, affect, and
      health care utilization, and (3) whether positive effects for HW replicate the effects from
      the pilot study at one year, and two years for the HW condition only.
