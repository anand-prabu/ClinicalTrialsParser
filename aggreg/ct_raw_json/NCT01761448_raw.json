The innovated Guided\n      Exercise- (GEx)- System consists of a sensor that monitors vital parameters during exercise\n      training sessions used in combination with software that provides feedback to the patient\n      based on the training prescription provided by the doctor and the level exertion monitored.\n      This main trial follows a pretrial in which the used ECG sensor was validated at hospital\n      during rehabilitation phase II and the practicability of the vest with this integrated ECG\n      sensor and the possibility of technical problems of this innovative GEx- system were tested\n      in real-life of the patient during phase III at home (ID 11-094)."

They will report their daily activity by diary. The control group\n      will only report their physical activities by diary without using the Gex- System.
