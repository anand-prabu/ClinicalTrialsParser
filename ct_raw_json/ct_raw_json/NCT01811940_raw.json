Subjects will be randomized to receive\n      either placebo or MAS-ER and topiramate. This proposal will test the hypothesis that MAS-ER\n      and topiramate will promote cocaine abstinence. Participants who are randomized to the\n      combination medication arm will have their dose titrated to 60 mg MAS-ER daily (over 2\n      weeks) and 200 mg topiramate a day (over 6 weeks) and maintained on this dose through week\n      13 of the trial. During week 14, participants will be tapered off both medications. All\n      participants will receive a supportive behavioral treatment that emphasizes study procedure\n      adherence. Starting in week one, all patients will receive incentives for compliance with\n      study procedures on an escalating reinforcement schedule similar to that developed\n      previously and not contingent on urine results. The purpose of the lead-out is to blind\n      patients to the exact point of medication discontinuation and to provide naturalistic data\n      on the effects of medication discontinuation. Moreover, a 3 month follow-up will be\n      conducted to determine what happens to cocaine use after treatment discontinuation."
