  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sports-related concussions are common in adolescent-athletes. Prolonged recovery after
      concussion or post-concussion syndrome (PCS) is a public health problem. This project will
      determine the effectiveness of an aerobic exercise program for management of PCS and it will
      evaluate the influence of exercise on biologic correlates of PCS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Concussion or mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is a public health problem and it is
      imperative that efficacious treatment protocols be developed to reduce the morbidity
      associated with PCS in adolescents. In adolescent athletes, timely return of normal
      neurocognitive function and return to sports safely is critical to normal development. The
      proposed study will fill a critical gap by systematically evaluating the potential efficacy
      of an aerobic training intervention for management of PCS in adolescents. To our knowledge,
      this will be the first randomized controlled study to evaluate the efficacy of aerobic
      training for treatment of PCS in adolescents as soon as four weeks after injury. The study
      will also improve our understanding of the pathophysiology of PCS and the biologic influence
      of aerobic training on PCS. The proposed study will fill a critical gap and inform the
      development of larger studies to assess the efficacy, and if proven efficacious,  optimize
      the timing and intensity of aerobic training treatment protocols, thus transforming the care
      and limiting the adverse public impact of this condition.

    <description>Children with PCS who are eligible for the study will be randomized to a progressive, sub-symptom exacerbation, cycling aerobic training intervention or stretching comparison intervention. Children with PCS that meet criteria for the intervention trial will complete a baseline evaluation followed by a one week run-in-period (week 0-1) prior to their first intervention visit. After the initial intervention visit, weekly visits will be completed for at least 6 additional weeks (i.e., at least 6 weeks of aerobic training). An individualized home exercise program 5-6 days per week will also be developed. Children will be provided with a home stationary cycle to complete the home program.</description>

    <description>Children in the stretching intervention will complete a series of full body stretches of the shoulders, arms, chest, back, legs, and feet 5-6 days per week and will return weekly to review the stretching program. The minimum duration of the stretching intervention will also be 6 weeks</description>
