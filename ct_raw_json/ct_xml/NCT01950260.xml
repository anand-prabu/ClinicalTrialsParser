  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will try to answer the question of whether early treatment with levothyroxine at 4
      weeks after radioactive iodine for Graves'disease will prevent overt hypothyroidism (low
      thyroid hormone levels).

It will be increased to 50 mcg/day 2 weeks later and then adjusted at 8 weeks post RAI based on a full face-to-face clinical and biochemical evaluation.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria target all adult patients (ages 18-70 years) with GD who will receive
        RAI for treatment of GD. Patient with clinically manifest GO will be excluded from the
        study. We will also exclude patients with recent (&lt;1 yr.) history of arrhythmias or any
        history of ventricular arrhythmias, those with preexistent cardiomyopathy, those with
        malnutrition and those with psychiatric history that could get worse if patient remains
        persistently hyperthyroid. Patients unlikely to return for the planned follow-up visits,
        to comply with the blood drawing schedule and with the completion of the hypothyroid-HDQL
        and TQS questionnaires will also be excluded.
