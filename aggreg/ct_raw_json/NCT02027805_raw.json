The antibodies are directed against T-cell\n      antigens 'cluster of differentiation 3 antigen' (CD3) and CD7. Previous in vitro studies\n      have demonstrated that this particular immunotoxin-combination, named T-Guard, acts\n      synergistically in eliminating T cells with a preference for killing activated T-cells. In a\n      subsequent clinical pilot-study, T-Guard has generated encouraging results when applied as\n      third-line therapy for patients suffering form steroid-resistant acute Graft-versus-Host\n      Disease (GVHD). Extensive biological and clinical responses could be noted in the absence of\n      severe acute toxicities. Building on these results, the current study aims at evaluating the\n      safety and efficacy of T-Guard for treating steroid-resistant GVHD when administered in an\n      earlier phase of the disease process, i.e. as second-line instead of as third-line therapy."

The treatment consists of a standard dose of 4 infusions T-Guard (4 mg/m2), given\n      48-hours apart over a 4-hour period. The intended follow-up period is 6 months.\n\n      The primary objective is to determine the efficacy of T-Guard, 4 weeks after the first\n      infusion (Day 28), in inducing an objective clinical response in patients with acute GVHD\n      refractory to standard first line corticosteroid therapy.\n\n      Secondary objectives are:\n\n        -  To evaluate the overall safety and efficacy of T-Guard during the first 6 months after\n           imitation of therapy;\n\n        -  To determine the pharmacokinetic profile of T-Guard;\n\n        -  To determine the immunogenicity of T-Guard.\n\n      Exploratory objectives are:\n\n        -  To study the specificity and kinetics of the treatment-induced depletion and subsequent\n           repopulation of lymphocyte subsets;\n\n        -  To evaluate diagnostic and predictive GVHD biomarkers relative to treatment outcomes."
