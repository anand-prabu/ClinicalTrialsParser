To assess the two year recurrence-free survival in patients with uterine leiomyosarcoma\n      treated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy including defining the patterns of\n      recurrence in patients with uterine leiomyosarcoma who were treated with this regimen.\n\n      OUTLINE:\n\n      CHEMOTHERAPY: Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes\n      on days 1 and 8 and docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4\n      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      RADIATION THERAPY: Beginning week 10, patients undergo 3 fractions of brachytherapy or\n      intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) over 3 weeks. Patients then undergo external\n      beam radiation therapy (EBRT) once daily (QD) 5 days a week for 5 weeks.\n\n      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years,\n      every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter."
