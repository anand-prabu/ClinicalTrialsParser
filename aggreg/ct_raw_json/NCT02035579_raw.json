Children with PCS that meet criteria for the intervention trial will complete a baseline evaluation followed by a one week run-in-period (week 0-1) prior to their first intervention visit. After the initial intervention visit, weekly visits will be completed for at least 6 additional weeks (i.e., at least 6 weeks of aerobic training). An individualized home exercise program 5-6 days per week will also be developed. Children will be provided with a home stationary cycle to complete the home program."

In adolescent athletes, timely return of normal\n      neurocognitive function and return to sports safely is critical to normal development. The\n      proposed study will fill a critical gap by systematically evaluating the potential efficacy\n      of an aerobic training intervention for management of PCS in adolescents. To our knowledge,\n      this will be the first randomized controlled study to evaluate the efficacy of aerobic\n      training for treatment of PCS in adolescents as soon as four weeks after injury. The study\n      will also improve our understanding of the pathophysiology of PCS and the biologic influence\n      of aerobic training on PCS. The proposed study will fill a critical gap and inform the\n      development of larger studies to assess the efficacy, and if proven efficacious,  optimize\n      the timing and intensity of aerobic training treatment protocols, thus transforming the care\n      and limiting the adverse public impact of this condition."
