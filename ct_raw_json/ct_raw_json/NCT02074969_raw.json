One hundred\n      patients are randomized to the gamma nail and 100 are randomized to the proximal femoral\n      nail for treatment fixation. A 1:1 randomization is performed using sealed envelopes (200 in\n      total), which are opened by the surgeon immediately before the operation.\n\n      Patients missing an informed consent form, incomplete chart, or showing a pathologic\n      fracture are getting excluded from final comparisons.\n\n      Patients anthropometric data as well as pre-injury mobility assessments, and ASA will be\n      documented. Furthermore the time from admission to going to surgery, surgery length, length\n      of stay and mobility assessment at dischargement are recorded.\n\n      After surgery the stay in the hospital is documented precisely and patients are scheduled\n      for next appointments 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months and 1 year after surgery.\n\n      Postoperative X-rays are measured precisely to determine the Tip-Apex Distance (TAD), the\n      Parkers-Ratio, the Singh-Score and the Neck-Shaft-Angle of the injured and contralateral\n      side. Rates of complications as cut-out and reoperation-rates are evaluated. All\n      intra-operative complications are noted and included in the chart."
