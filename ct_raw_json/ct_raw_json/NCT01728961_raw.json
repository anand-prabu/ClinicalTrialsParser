The brand of AL used in this study is Coartem\u00ae Dispersible. This study will\n      compare the blood levels of AL in co-infected children who already take NVP prescribed by\n      their doctor with the co-infected children who do not take anti HIV medicines because they\n      do not meet national guidelines to start them.  The study will also assess the safety of\n      using both medications (AL and NVP) in children."

Malaria\n      accounts for up to 3 million deaths each year, of which 90% occur in Africa where malaria is\n      the leading cause of mortality in young children. Artemisinin-based combination therapy\n      (ACT) are the mainstay of antimalarial therapy throughout much of the world, yet pediatric\n      pharmacokinetic data on the most widely adopted ACT regimen, artemether/lumefantrine (AL)\n      are lacking. Of equal importance is the assessment of key drug-drug interactions in HIV\n      co-infected children as ARVs are known to affect the metabolic enzyme activity responsible\n      for ACT elimination. This study proposes to investigate the drug-drug interaction between\n      the antimalarial artemether/lumefantrine and nevirapine based antiretroviral (ARV) treatment\n      for HIV in children co-infected in resource limited settings."
