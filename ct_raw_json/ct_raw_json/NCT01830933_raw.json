Our goal is to implement a tablet-PC\n      (personal computer) based breast cancer risk education (BreastCare) intervention in the\n      primary care setting that estimates a woman's individual risk for breast cancer and provides\n      her and her physician with personalized breast cancer risk information and recommendations\n      for action."
