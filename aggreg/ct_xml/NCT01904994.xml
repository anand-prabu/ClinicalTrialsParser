  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite increased HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) infection testing in Africa, many
      patients never enroll in subsequent HIV care after testing or remain in care after an
      initial enrollment. This study's aim is to improve linkage to HIV care and retention in HIV
      care through the use of feasible, evidence-based, and practical interventions. The study
      takes place in Swaziland, the country with the highest HIV prevalence (24%) in sub-Saharan
      Africa. The study will randomize groups of HIV testing sites and affiliated clinics to
      either standard of care or a combined intervention strategy (CIS) which consists of point-of
      care CD4 (cluster difference 4)testing at time of HIV testing, fast-track HIV medications
      for those who are eligible for treatment,mobile phone appointment reminders, care bags
      filled with health prevention materials, and financial incentives. The study outcomes are
      linkage to and retention in care as well as cost effectiveness, feasibility of
      interventions, and patient acceptability of interventions.

  <detailed_description>

      Linkage of patients from HIV testing to HIV care programs and their retention once enrolled
      in care are essential to HIV program effectiveness in terms of prevention of HIV;related
      morbidity and mortality and prevention of HIV transmission. Linkage and retention rates in
      HIV programs in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) are suboptimal, with less than half of patients who
      test positive successfully linking and remaining in care at 1 year. This study is a two-arm
      cluster site;randomized trial to compare the effectiveness of a novel combination package of
      evidence;based interventions, the combination intervention strategy (CIS), compared to
      standard of care (SOC) on linkage and retention of HIV;positive patients from point of
      testing to retention in care. CIS will include 1) point of care CD4+ count assays at HIV
      testing sites; 2) accelerated ART initiation for eligible patients; 3) provision of a basic
      care and prevention package (BCPP); 4) short message service (SMS) reminders for clinic
      appointments; and 5) financial incentives for linkage and retention. The primary aim is to
      evaluate the effectiveness of CIS as compared to SOC on the combined outcome of rapid
      linkage to HIV care within 1 month and retention in care at 12 months among adults testing
      positive for HIV. Secondary aims include evaluation of the effectiveness of CIS compared to
      SOC on each of linkage to HIV; retention in care; time to ART initiation; HIV disease
      progression and mortality; patient acceptability; association between baseline
      characteristics and outcomes, and comparison of cost effectiveness.
