    <textblock>
      This is a two arm Phase III trial in first- and second-line HER2 negative patients with
      locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer. The primary endpoint is overall survival
      (OS), and the objective is to test for the superiority of eribulin mesylate over standard
      weekly paclitaxel. Patients will be randomized between the experimental and control arm with
      equal allocation (1:1) within strata defined by prior adjuvant taxanes, hormone receptor
      status, and line of therapy. Subjects will continue protocol directed therapy until
      documentation of disease progression, development of unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of
      consent. Those who discontinue study treatment without radiological progression will be
      followed with repeat imaging studies every 12 weeks. All subjects will be followed until
      death, withdrawal of consent, or study termination.
