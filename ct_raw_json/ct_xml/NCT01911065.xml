  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With increasing age, immune responses to vaccination begin to decline. A decrease in
      vaccination success rates is already evident in the 6th and 7th decade of life. With the
      changing demographics of the US population, this decline in immune function is a major
      health concern.

      The study of the immune responses to the naturally-acquired chicken pox virus and to the
      shingles vaccine will provide an important opportunity to learn more about the aging immune
      system and may lead to an improvement in vaccination strategies and identification of ways
      to improve vaccine responses in older individuals

      The objective of this protocol is to identify immune signatures that are associated with
      effective or poor vaccine responses to naturally-acquired herpes zoster virus and the zoster
      (shingles) vaccine, Zostavax.

      The study is divided in 2 specific cohorts.

      In the first cohort (cross-sectional study), the objective is to examine the influence of
      age and inherited factors on the varicella zoster virus (VZV)-specific immune response in
      those with a naturally-acquired VZV immunity (a prior history of chicken pox). Volunteers in
      this cohort will be identical twins and non-twins  40-49 years of age and will not be
      vaccinated with the licensed zoster vaccine. (Zostavax vaccine is approved only for
      individuals who are 50 years and above)

      In the second cohort (vaccination study), healthy identical twin and non-twins who are 50
      and above will be vaccinated with the licensed zoster vaccine, Zostavax. We will compare
      age-related and inherited vaccine responses focusing on factors that control the initiation
      of the T-cell immune response and T cell signatures at peak response that correlate with T
      cell memory development and antibody production. To assess VZV viremia, we will test for VZV
      by PCR at  5 study time points.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Otherwise healthy adult, 40-49 years of age (Cross-Sectional study)or 50 years of age
             and older (Vaccination study). If a volunteer cannot participate in the Vaccination
             study after screening, may be considered for Cross-Sectional study.

          -  History of prior chicken pox infection or living within the continental U.S. for past
             30 years

          -  Willing to complete the informed consent process

          -  Availability for follow-up for the planned duration of the study (Cross-Sectional
             study: 1 visit; Vaccination study: 5 visits within 4-5 weeks)

          -  Acceptable medical history and vital signs

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of shingles within 5 years of enrollment

          -  Prior vaccination with Zostavax vaccine for prevention of shingles
