The inclusion of patients is expected to last until 12 months from the\n      approval of the Ethics Committee and ANVISA.\n\n      Follow up will last at least 2 weeks for each included patient.

After 2 consecutive weeks using the investigational product (+2 days), the patients\n      will be evaluated again, particularly for the parameters under study, this is, quantity and\n      severity of angina episodes and adverse events. The selected patients shall also be 18-80\n      years old of both genders, with proved diagnosis of stable angina through clinical exams\n      such as ECG, physical effort tests or similar.  Patients will receive 20mg monocordil\n      tablets (Baldacci Laboratories).\n\n      The evaluations will take place in two opportunities: one at the visit of medical evaluation\n      and recruitment in the study (along with the deliver of the study medication and a diary)\n      and the second one after 2 weeks (+2 days) of use of 20mg monocordil tablets for medical\n      evaluation and discharge of the study (return of the diary and medication accountability)."
