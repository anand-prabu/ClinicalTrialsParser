Several\n      different underlying diseases, conditions, or combinations of medicines may contribute to\n      OH; therefore the cause of the condition varies among individuals. Some studies have shown\n      that OH is associated with an increase in the rate of death, but it is not clear what role\n      OH plays in increased morbidity. By studying what the prevalence of OH is in a generalized\n      veteran population we expect increase clinical awareness of the degree of the problem so\n      that patient care might be improved."
