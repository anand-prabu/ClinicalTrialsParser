Determine the duration of response in these patients.\n      III. Determine the acute side effects in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive ecteinascidin 743 (ET-743) IV over 24\n      hours every 3 weeks. Treatment continues for at least 2-6 courses in the absence of disease\n      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 6 weeks until disease\n      progression and every 12 weeks after disease progression.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 28-44 patients will be accrued for this study."
