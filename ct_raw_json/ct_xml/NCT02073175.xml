  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Visual Analog Scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessment will be done on day-5 postpartum or within the first 18 months postpartum (depending on which group subject belongs to). On the assessment day, the VAS will be administered  before and after sad mood indcution and compared</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>

The change in VAS before versus after sad mood induction is the change score in VAS. The change score on the day with active dietary supplement is compare to the change score of the subjects who have not received any supplement and have been recently recruited</description>

    <measure>Change in Profile of Mood States (POMS) Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessment will be done on day-5 postpartum or within the first 18 months postpartum (depending on which group subject belongs to). On the assessment day, the POMS will be administered  before and after sad mood indcution and compared</time_frame>
