            "textblock": "Background:\n\n      Several clinical studies show high rates of anxiety and depressive  disorders in Chronic\n      Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), that suggest common underlying pathogenetic mechanisms\n      of COPD and depressive disorders. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of\n      aerobic exercise, proposed in the context of pulmonary rehabilitation, in a sample of COPD\n      depressed patients without psychopharmacological treatment, through the correlation of some\n      psychopathological variables and physical/pneumological parameters.\n\n      Methods:\n\n      The investigators have designed an observational longitudinal trial. The trial will be\n      prospective 6-weeks randomized clinical study to evaluate the impact of aerobic exercise on\n      depressive symptoms in 154 patient affected by COPD and depression, assessed by Hamilton\n      Depression Rating Scale (HDRS). The investigators will also monitor anxiety, quality of life\n      and neurocognitive function.\n\n      Outcome measures:\n\n      The investigators compare the variation of HDRS total score, as primary outcome measure, in\n      two groups (A, B) of COPD depressed patients matched for: COPD status; depressive status;\n      age; gender. Only the participants randomized in study group A will receive a 6-weeks\n      aerobic exercise intervention.\n\n      Statistical analysis:\n\n      All tests are two-tailed and a p value 0.05 was considered significant. The difference\n      between the two groups will be evaluated with Student's T test for normally distributed\n      data, and with Mann-Whitney's U test, for those with not normal distribution. The normality\n      of  distribution will be evaluated with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Any correlations among\n      the variables under evaluation will be assessed by Spearman r correlation. Variables will be\n      compared using the Chi-squared test or Fisher exact test for categorical variables.\n\n      Discussion:\n\n      There is a strong correlation between physical activity and mental health. Several data have\n      suggested that aerobic exercise shows significant effects, comparable to pharmacotherapy and\n      to psychotherapy, on reducing depressive symptomatology. The goal of our study is to propose\n      an effective intervention to reduce the risk of severe depression in this special\n      population, evaluating  the variation of  HDRS total score after the aerobic exercise\n      intervention."
