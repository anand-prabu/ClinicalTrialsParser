      Type of study:

      This is a prospective randomized controlled study that was done in department of obstetrics
      and gynecology of Assiut University Hospital.

      Aim of the work:

        1. To study the effect of antioxidants in cases of oligohydramnios.

        2. To study the effect of antioxidants on mode of delivery and neonatal outcome.

        3. To commence special recommendations from the study about the use of antioxidants in
           cases of oligohydramnios of unknown cause and cases of oligohydramnios associated with
           pregnancy induced hypertension.

      Inclusion criteria:

      Patients with gestational age between 30-34 weeks with:

        -  Oligohydramnios of unknown cause.

        -  Oligohydramnios assosiatd with Pregnancy induced hypertension (PIH).

      Exclusion criteria:

        1. Premature rupture of membranes.

        2. Oligohydramnios in postdates pregnancy (&gt;41 weeks).

        3. Fetal anomalies.

        4. IUGR.

        5. Patients using non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

      Assessment of the patients:

      The target population was assessed to find the participating women suitable for the study,
      this assessment was done to verify inclusion criteria and to exclude any women has any of
      the exclusion criteria.

      Ultrasongraphic evaluation:

      Ultrasongraphy was done for estimation of amniotic fluid index by measuring the vertical
      diameter of the pockets of amniotic fluid in four sections of the uterus and add them
      together. This gives them a number known as amniotic fluid index (AFI). If the AFI is less
      than 5 centimeters, the pregnant woman has oligohydramnios

      Composition of omega-3 plus:

      Soft gelatineous capsule (Sedico medical company) each capsule contains:

        -  Fish oil (30) % (Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) 18 % / Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) 12 % )
           natural source of Omega 3 Fatty acids.

        -  Wheat germ oil (Tocopherol: N.N.T. 0.22 %) which is rich and natural source of Vitamin
           E (protects the oils from oxidation. besides its well known that requirements of
           vitamin E increases with increased dietary amounts of polyunsaturated fatty acids).

    <description>Treatment was started immediately and continued for two weeks. The patients were randomized to receive either a daily dose of omega-3 plus as antioxidant once daily for two weeks or a daily placebo then stored in envelopes numbered from 1 to 140. The envelopes were numbered and randomized according to computer-generated randomization tables to ensure an equal number of patients in each arm. Throughout the trial, access to the randomization code was available only to the pharmacist who manufactured the placebo and packed the envelopes and was not available to any of the treating physicians or patients.</description>
