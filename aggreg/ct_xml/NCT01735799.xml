    <textblock>
      Since both pathologies (PCOS and NAFLD) involve disturbed carbohydrate economy, which
      revolve around insulin resistance, it is tempting to examine the specific &quot;liver profile&quot; of
      women with PCOD. Furthermore, it would be of great importance if lean women who suffer from
      PCOD would be revealed to shere cardiovascular risks with their more overweight peers.

      Patients - women who will be diagnosed with PCOD following their initial referal to our
      fertility clinic. Controls - normal ovulatory women who approached our fertility clinic due
      to either unexplained or male factor infertility.

      Workup - history for menstrual pattern; Clinical evaluation for features of
      hyperandrogenism; ultrasonographic documentation of ovarian morphology; follicular phase
      hormonal profile for validation of the diagnosis and for ruling out other pathologies which
      may cause anovulation.

      Liver profiling - The following blood tests will be used for the biochemical profiling:
      fasting glucose and insulin, CRP, HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, AST, ALT, GGT, LDH,
      alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, ferritin, HBA1C and micro albumin
      ratio.

      FibroScan® will be used to measure liver stiffness.
