Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combining fenretinide, paclitaxel, and\n      cisplatin in treating patients who have solid tumors that have not responded to previous\n      therapy."

On day 8 of course 1, patients also receive\n      fenretinide once in the morning. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for a maximum of 8 courses\n      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve\n      complete response receive 2 additional courses.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of fenretinide until the maximum tolerated\n      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2\n      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-24 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year."
