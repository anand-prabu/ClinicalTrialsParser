            "textblock": "Background: Although efforts by VA providers and researchers have improved diabetes care\n      quality for Veterans, individuals with persistent poorly-controlled diabetes mellitus (type\n      1 or type 2 diabetes with hemoglobin A1c >9.0% for > 1 year despite receipt of medical care)\n      have proven refractory to these widespread improvements, and remain at high risk for\n      complications and accrued costs. Prior research has illustrated that medication regimen\n      complexity, suboptimal self-care, and comorbid depressive symptoms interact to perpetuate\n      suboptimal control among individuals with PPDM. Current models of clinic-based diabetes care\n      do not meet these Veterans' needs. Without the implementation of care delivery strategies\n      that target this population's unique barriers to improved diabetes control, these Veterans\n      will continue to be left behind by progress in diabetes management throughout VA, and will\n      remain at high risk for complications and high costs. We propose using existing local Home\n      Telehealth services to implement Advanced Comprehensive Diabetes Care, a patient-centered,\n      evidence-based intervention combining medication management, self-care behavior support, and\n      depressive symptom management to Veterans with PPDM.\n\n      Objectives:  The specific aims of this RRP are to: 1) evaluate the effectiveness of the\n      Advanced Comprehensive Diabetes Care among Veterans with persistent poorly-controlled\n      diabetes; 2) utilize a mixed method formative evaluation to assess our main implementation\n      strategy, the use of existing Home Telehealth services to administer the intervention; and\n      3) generate data we will use to refine local intervention implementation and inform the\n      development of an SDP proposal evaluating broader implementation of the Advanced\n      Comprehensive Diabetes Care intervention.\n\n      Methods: We propose a pilot Effectiveness-Implementation Hybrid trial to study the Advanced\n      Comprehensive Diabetes Care intervention in Veterans with persistent poorly-controlled\n      diabetes. After baseline evaluation, 50 Veterans will be randomly assigned into intervention\n      (n = 25) or control groups (n = 25). Veterans randomized to the intervention will be\n      enrolled in the Home Telehealth program at Durham VAMC and will receive the study\n      intervention (telehealth-based medication management, self-care behavior support, and\n      depressive symptom management) for 6 months. Intervention-group Veterans with no depression\n      on baseline assessment will not initially receive the depressive symptom management\n      component, but will be monitored for new symptoms throughout the study. Veterans randomized\n      to the control arm will receive diabetes educational materials and management per their\n      primary provider. The primary effectiveness outcome for this study will be hemoglobin A1c.\n      Secondary effectiveness outcomes will include measures of diabetes self-care, self-reported\n      medication adherence, and depressive symptoms. This RRP will also include a mixed method\n      formative evaluation to qualitatively and quantitatively assess patient-level,\n      provider-level, and organizational barriers and facilitators influencing intervention\n      implementation. Formative evaluation data will be analyzed during the study to consider\n      whether adjustments to the intervention or its implementation may be indicated, and findings\n      will also be used to inform future implementation efforts."
