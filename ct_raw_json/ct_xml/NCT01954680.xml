    <textblock>
      The main aim of this study is to test a new, non-medication potential treatment for bipolar
      disorder in children and adolescents.

      In the study, children and adolescents with bipolar disorder will come to our lab at Bradley
      Hospital 2-times per week for 8-weeks to &quot;play&quot; a custom computer &quot;game&quot; designed to retrain
      the brain--to build a skill that my work has shown is impaired in children/adolescents with
      bipolar disorder.

      Before and after this 8-week trial, children will have a special magnetic resonance imaging
      (MRI) scan.

      This is a test of feasibility--meaning we want to see if the 8-week trial results in brain
      changes.

      If it does, we will conduct a second study to see if it improves how bipolar children
      function--i.e., if it helps their illness.

      Prior studies have shown that &quot;computer assisted cognitive remediation&quot;--meaning using
      computer &quot;games&quot; to build up a skill that has been shown to be impaired in a specific
      disorder--can result in improvement in psychiatric illnesses--including schizophrenia.

      This will be the first National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)-funded study to use this
      &quot;retrain your brain&quot; approach in children and adolescents with bipolar disorder.

      During this first study, we are seeking 12-15 children and adolescents with bipolar disorder
      to:

        -  come to our lab at Bradley Hospital in East Providence R.I. twice per week (each
           lasting 1 hour) to &quot;play&quot; a special computer game for a total of 8 weeks

        -  to have a special MRI before and after this 8-week trial to see if our &quot;game&quot; improves
           brain activity

        -  it does NOT matter if your child is already on medications--they can continue during
           this study

        -  all children/adolescents with bipolar disorder are welcome--as long as they do NOT have
           implanted metal (no braces, no cochlear implants, etc) because of magnetic resonance
           imaging (MRI) safety.

      This is a test of feasibility--meaning we want to see if the 8-week trial results in brain
      changes.

      If it does, we will conduct a second study to see if it improves how bipolar children
      function--i.e., if it helps their illness.

This same approach has shown great success in many psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia.
This is the first such study in children/adolescents with bipolar disorder.</description>
