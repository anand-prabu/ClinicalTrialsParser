            "textblock": "The NRP is becoming more and more a self learning program followed by a written test and\n      practical hands-on evaluation; but the way the practical skills are taught and practiced has\n      not been uniformly determined.\n\n      The current strategies for teaching involve resuscitation instructors. There are several\n      difficulties in the developing world to achieve the objective of having a provider trained\n      in neonatal resuscitation in every delivery. Part of this problem is due to the lack of\n      instructors and-or budget constraint in addition to logistic difficulties.\n\n      Our Hypothesis is that a well developed self administered video complemented by a self\n      practice using a mannequin will allow providers to reach at least similar performances on\n      the initial steps and mask ventilation for neonatal resuscitation.\n\n      Objectives:\n\n      The aim of this study is to test the hypothesis that a self administrated video jointly with\n      a mannequin give similar results than the current Neonatal Resuscitation Program (NRP), a\n      pre-validated Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE)hands-on course provided by a\n      certified instructor.\n\n      Specific aim:\n\n      To compare the effectiveness of two different teaching strategies on the quality of the\n      ventilation of a mannequin, using a mask by NA\u00cfVE providers. In two different moments,\n      approximately 15 minutes after having taken  the course and at a mean of 3 months\n      afterwards.\n\n      Two different groups of novice  providers will be randomly selected to receive one of the\n      following teaching strategies:\n\n      A. A Video based Self instruction with simultaneous video triggered practice with a\n      mannequin without instructor feedback (Spanish in South America, English in North America)\n      on initial steps and adequate mask ventilation for neonatal resuscitation.\n\n      B. A pre standardized hands on lesson will be offered by a NRP certified instructor followed\n      by a debriefing session per a pre-validated OSCE protocol (current standard).\n\n      Afterwards, all the subjects will be invited to ventilate a mannequin with a standardized\n      instruction (tbd  for example\u20262 minutes ventilation, rate 40 to 60 and the necessary\n      pressure to slightly reach chest rising). This performance will be digitally recorded.\n\n      Two independent certified instructors will evaluate the performance, blinded to the assigned\n      group. A previously validated OSCE (objective structured clinical evaluation) performance\n      evaluation grid will be used. The gold standard will consist on a high quality performance\n      done by an NRP instructor."
