            "textblock": "Chronic Rhinosinusitis (CRS) refers to a pathological condition where the sinonasal mucosa\n      is inflamed for greater than 12 weeks(1). It is associated with a constellation of symptoms,\n      including facial pain, anosmia, and nasal congestion. It has been estimated that CRS affects\n      close to 5% of the Canadian population(2). When medical therapy fails, patients are often\n      referred to Otolaryngology- Head and Neck Surgeons for consideration of surgical management.\n      Endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) is one of the mainstays of therapy for CRS that has failed\n      medical management(3). Traditionally, the microdebrider has been the go-to tool for\n      performing these surgeries, but recently the Coblator (ArthroCare, Austin, Texas) has begun\n      to define its' role in surgery. By using bipolar radiofrequency energy to ablate tissue\n      (with temperatures up to 60\u02da C)(4), theoretically the Coblator will result in less bleeding\n      than so-called \"cold\" surgical techniques (i.e. the microdebrider). In a retrospective study\n      by Eloy et. al, patients with CRS and nasal polyposis had a statistically significant amount\n      of less intraoperative blood loss when the Coblator was used in their surgery, than those\n      patients who underwent surgery with the microdebrider. The investigators plan to further\n      investigate this in a randomized, controlled fashion"
