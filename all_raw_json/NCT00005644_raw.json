Treatment continues every 4 weeks for a minimum of 3\n      courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then\n      annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10-27 patients will be accrued for this study within 10-27\n      months."
