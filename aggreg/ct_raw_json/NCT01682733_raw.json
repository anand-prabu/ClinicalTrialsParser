The investigators aim to recruit ten subjects with a body\n      mass index between 30-40 for this study.  Vertical sutures will be performed using the\n      endoscopic suturing system to deploy 10-17 interrupted full thickness sutures. Botulinum\n      toxin(approximately 30 units) will be injected around the sutures insertion sites in half of\n      the subjects randomly to slow down muscular grinding of the stomach to see if it improves\n      durability of the procedure."
