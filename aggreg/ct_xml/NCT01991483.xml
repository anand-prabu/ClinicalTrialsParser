    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety of LY2928057 and how LY2928057 affects hemoglobin in
      hemodialysis participants.  This study will involve multiple doses of LY2928057 given during
      a 6 week period either after a participant discontinues or reduces treatment to stimulate
      red blood cells.  The study will last about 20 weeks for each participant.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who have been receiving adequate
             maintenance hemodialysis (3 times weekly) for at least 12 weeks prior to screening
             (meaning participants Kt/V is greater than 1.1 [K equals dialyzer clearance of urea,
             t equals dialysis duration time, V equals volume of distribution of urea, which is
             approximately equal to the participants total body water]) and who are willing to
             stop or reduce their stable erythropoiesis stimulating agent (ESA) dose for
             approximately 2 weeks prior to the first administration of the study drug

          -  Have a hemoglobin value greater than or equal to 9.0 grams per deciLiter (g/dL) and
             less than or equal to 12 g/dL at screening and greater than or equal to 9 g/dL and
             less than or equal to 11.5 g/dL, prior to dialysis after ESAs have been stopped or
             reduced for 1 to 3 weeks (that is, before randomization to LY2928057 or placebo). The
             difference between the hemoglobin values at the above 2 time points must be less than
             or equal to 1.5 grams

          -  Have a body mass index (BMI) of 18.5 to 45 kilograms per square meter (kg/m^2)
             inclusive at screening

          -  Have a transferrin saturation (TSat) greater than or equality to 15 percent and
             ferritin greater than 40 nanograms per  milliliter (ng/mL) at screening

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any cause of anemia other than renal disease

          -  A history of hyporesponsiveness to ESA
