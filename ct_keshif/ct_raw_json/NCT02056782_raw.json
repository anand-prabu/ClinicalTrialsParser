To evaluate the safety and tolerability of ODSH in patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia\n           (AML) receiving cytarabine and idarubicin induction or cytarabine consolidation\n           chemotherapy.\n\n        2. To determine whether there is preliminary evidence of an effect of ODSH on time to\n           transfusion-independent platelet recovery in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) patients\n           receiving cytarabine and idarubicin induction or cytarabine consolidation chemotherapy.\n\n      Secondary Objectives:\n\n        1. To determine whether there is preliminary evidence of an effect of ODSH on remission\n           rate following cytarabine and idarubicin induction in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)\n           patients.\n\n        2. To determine whether there is preliminary evidence of an effect of ODSH on improving\n           platelet nadir counts in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) patients receiving cytarabine and\n           idarubicin induction or cytarabine consolidation chemotherapy.\n\n        3. To determine whether there is preliminary evidence of an effect of ODSH on decreasing\n           the number of platelet transfusions in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) patients receiving\n           cytarabine and idarubicin induction or cytarabine consolidation chemotherapy.\n\n        4. To determine whether there is preliminary evidence of an effect of ODSH on reducing\n           overall side effects of chemotherapy in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) patients receiving\n           cytarabine and idarubicin induction or cytarabine consolidation chemotherapy.\n\n      Enrollment for newly diagnosed, previously untreated acute myeloid leukemia. Acute\n      promyelocytic leukemia and acute megakaryoblastic leukemia subtypes are excluded.\n\n      All patients will receive standard induction chemotherapy with cytarabine 100 mg/m2/day by\n      continuous intravenous infusion over 24 hours daily for 7 days (D 1-7) plus idarubicin 12\n      mg/m2/day by intravenous injection daily for 3 days (D 1-3).
