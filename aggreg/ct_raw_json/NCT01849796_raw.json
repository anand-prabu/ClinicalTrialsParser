To deliver excitatory (anodal) tDCS over the motor cortex, the main electrode will be placed over the motor cortex on the hemisphere contralateral to the major source of pain. The second electrode will be placed on the skin overlying the supraorbital region ipsilateral to the affected area. To deliver inhibitory (cathodal) tDCS, the main electrode will be placed over the somatosensory cortex on the hemisphere contralateral to the major source of pain. The second electrode will be placed on the skin overlying the supraorbital region ipsilateral to the affected area. The current will be delivered at the intensity of 2mA for 20 minutes. To deliver sham, the current will be delivered for 30 sec only to elicit tingling skin sensation but no cortical excitability changes.",
