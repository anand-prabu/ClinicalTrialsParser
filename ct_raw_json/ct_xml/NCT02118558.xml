      This trial is a prospective, single center, unblinded, randomized, controlled study to
      assess the safety and efficacy of negative pressure wound therapy in preventing infections
      after TKA surgery . The study will enroll 316 patients that will undergo TKA. patients will
      be randomized to the treatment group and undergo the study intervention - (NPWT) The
      intervention will take place at the end of the surgery. The  Patients that are randomized to
      the control group will receive standard treatment. Both groups will be assessed at  two
      weeks and six weeks. period.
