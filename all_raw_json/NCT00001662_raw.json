The brain cells responsible for releasing\n      glutamate are damaged in Alzheimer's disease and other conditions affecting thinking and\n      reasoning.\n\n      Researchers would like to see if giving patients a drug that attaches to AMPA receptors\n      improves the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.\n\n      CX516 (Ampalex) is a test drug that affects the AMPA receptors.  This study will investigate\n      the effectiveness and safety of CX516 on patients with Alzheimer's disease.\n\n      Patients will be given capsules of CX516 or placebo (sugar pill that neither harms nor\n      helps) for up to 16 weeks in different amounts.  The effectiveness of the drug will be\n      measured by neurological tests.   Safety will be monitored by frequent check-ups and lab\n      examinations."

It is unknown whether stimulation of these receptors in patients with\n      Alzheimer's disease and dementing disorders will improve cognitive function.  To determine\n      whether positive modulation of AMPA receptors, active in animal models of dementia, can\n      improve cognitive function in demented patients, CX516, at a dose of 900mg TID, will be\n      administered orally for 12 weeks in patients with dementia.  In this randomized, controlled\n      proof-of-principle study, drug-induced alterations in intellectual function will be measured\n      by standardized neuropsychological tests.  Safety will be monitored by frequent clinical\n      assessments and laboratory tests."
