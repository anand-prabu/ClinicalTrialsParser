Patients are randomized to receive succimer in\n      addition to standard treatment (arm I) or standard treatment only (arm II).\n\n      Succimer is administered orally 3 times a day for 7 days, then twice daily for 19 days.\n      Patients may receive up to 3 courses.\n\n      Standard treatment consists of a medical history and physical examination, environmental\n      assessment with modification to reduce lead exposure, dietary modifications to decrease lead\n      absorption, the use of a daily multivitamin and mineral supplement with iron, developmental\n      screening and intervention, and frequent follow up of lead levels.\n\n      If blood lead level rises above 45 mcg/dL, patient receives succimer regardless of treatment\n      arm originally assigned.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3-4 weeks for 2 months, then every 3 months for 6 months, and\n      then every 6 months thereafter."
