An important causal factor for the\n      development of the disease is an autoimmune cellular response against bacteria in the colon.\n\n      As a possible treatment, manipulation of the bacterial flora has been studied using the\n      probiotic bacterium Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN). Studies on UC patients have shown\n      that treatment with EcN is equally good at maintaining remission as the standard treatment\n      with mesalazine. Furthermore, treatment with antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin have been\n      studied for treatment of UC and some, but shortlived, effect has been described.\n\n      Patients are randomized to one of four treatment-arms: ciprofloxacin-EcN,\n      ciprofloxacin-placebo, placebo-EcN or placebo-placebo.\n\n      Disease activity are quantitated with Colitis Activity Index (CAI) and quality of life by\n      the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ). Also, dietary interviews to examine the\n      patients' dietary intake are completed and the patients' fecal-calprotectin-concentrations\n      will be measured.\n\n      Hundred subjects with ulcerative colitis will be recruited for the study. Standard medical\n      care and therapies will be continued throughout the study"
