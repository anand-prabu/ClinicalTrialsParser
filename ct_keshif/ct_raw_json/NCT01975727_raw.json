            "textblock": "This study is divided into a main study and three adjunct protocols:\n\n      Main study:\n\n      Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) are frequent adverse effects of surgery and\n      anesthesia. Dexamethasone is well established for the prophylaxis of PONV, but the efficacy\n      of dexamethasone for the treatment of established PONV symptoms remains unknown. The primary\n      objective of the main study is to test the antiemetic efficacy of dexamethasone for the\n      treatment of established PONV in adults undergoing surgery under general anaesthesia, and to\n      test for dose-responsiveness. The secondary objective is the evaluation of the potential\n      adverse effect profile of dexamethasone, No prophylactic antiemetics are allowed.\n      Premedication, conduct of anesthesia and postoperative analgesia will be at the discretion\n      of the responsible anesthesiologist. Patients who have received their assigned study drug\n      and who continue to experience PONV will receive antiemetic rescue treatment (ondansetron,\n      droperidol). The minimum delay between administration of the study drug and rescue is 60 min\n      (to ensure that dexamethasone has the scope to show antiemetic efficacy). Primary efficacy\n      endpoint: Complete absence of any nausea and/or vomiting (including retching) in a\n      previously nauseated or vomiting patient within 24 hours after administration of the study\n      treatment. Secondary endpoints: Time to treatment failure; quality of sleep during the first\n      postoperative night (numerical rating scale ranging from 0 = no sleep at all to 10 =\n      excellent sleep); blood glucose (in the morning after administration of study drug); any\n      minor or major adverse effects during 24h.\n\n      Adjunct protocol 1:\n\n      In therapeutic PONV trials, efficacy is usually quantified using a dichotomous outcome, i.e.\n      a previously nauseous or vomiting patient stays totally PONV-free over a given period of\n      time (for instance, 24 hours). This outcome is valid for the endpoint vomiting (including\n      retching): a previously vomiting patient stays completely vomiting-free after treatment. For\n      nausea, the situation is different. A patient may suffer from severe nausea, and, after\n      treatment, the degree of nausea may significantly decrease although nausea may not disappear\n      completely. Nevertheless, such a treatment may be regarded as efficacious. A very similar\n      context can be found in the postoperative pain setting where an efficacious analgesic may\n      decrease the degree of pain to a significant extent although the pain does not disappear\n      completely. In analgesic trials, efficacy is therefore not expressed as a dichotomous\n      outcome (pain - no pain) but as a continuum on a 0 to 100 mm visual analogue scale. Patients\n      with moderate to severe postoperative pain (VAS \u22653/10) would be randomised to receive an\n      experimental or a control (placebo) intervention and relief would be then recorded over\n      time. Outcomes are expressed as maximum pain relief, area under the time-analgesic effect\n      curve for pain intensity (i.e. summed pain intensity difference, or SPID), or summed pain\n      relief (TOTPAR). AIM: To apply the methodology acute pain trials to the measurement of the\n      anti-nausea efficacy of antiemetic drugs. To investigate the variability of responses based\n      on measurement of nausea intensity using a visual analogue scale compared with a 4-point\n      categorical scale. METHODS: Patients of the main study protocol will be asked to rate their\n      degree of \"baseline\" nausea on a 100 mm visually analogue scale ranging from 0 mm = no\n      nausea at all to 100 mm = worst possible nausea, and on a 4-point categorical scale (none,\n      moderate, severe, intolerable). Subsequently, after having received the assigned study drug,\n      patients will be asked to score their degree of nausea on VAS every 15 minutes until 60\n      minutes after administration of the study drug (i.e. until they would receive the rescue\n      medication).\n\n      Adjunct protocol 2: Pharmacogenetics of PONV.\n\n      Knowledge about the mechanisms underlying inter-individual differences in PONV is needed to\n      better identify patients who are at risk of PONV. Some of the variability seen with nausea\n      and vomiting in cancer or migraine without aura may be associated with genetic variation\n      either in genes related to the mechanisms of nausea/vomiting or in genes related to opioid\n      action. In cancer patients receiving opioids, the inter-individual differences in nausea and\n      vomiting were associated with genetic markers represented by single nucleotide polymorphisms\n      of candidates in the opioid- or nausea/vomiting signalling pathways that modulate\n      neurotransmission by metabolising the catecholamine dopamine. A possible role has been\n      suggested for catechol-O-methyl-transferase (COMT) which is a key modulator in the\n      metabolism of endogenous monoaminergic neurotransmitters, and hence of opioidergic\n      neurotransmitters. The COMT enzyme possesses a frequent non-synonymous polymorphism that\n      encodes for the substitution of valine (Val) by methionine (Met) at codon 158 (Val158Met).\n      The SNP rs4680 (c.472G > A) is a missense mutation leading to a four-fold reduction of the\n      COMT enzyme. Individuals with the Val/Val genotype have the highest activity of COMT, those\n      with the Met/Met genotype have the lowest activity of COMT, and heterozygous individuals are\n      intermediate.11,12 Pathways involving specific neurotransmitters and their receptors are\n      likely to be involved in PONV, for instance, dopamine, acetylcholine, histamine,\n      cannabinoids, substance P, and 5-hydroxytryptamine. The role of dopamine is pivotal in\n      nausea and vomiting; dopamine D2 receptor blockade, in the area postrema, has an antiemetic\n      effect. In patients receiving COMT inhibitors, the enhanced dopaminergic activity leads\n      dose-dependently to frequent and severe nausea and vomiting. AIM: To compare COMT genotype\n      of patients with PONV to PONV-free controls and to assess the possible relationship between\n      genetic factors and dexamethasone response. A greater proportion of COMT-deficient allele is\n      expected in PONV patients as compared to PONV-free controls. METHODS: The study population\n      consists in all patients with PONV that are included in the main study (n=560). The control\n      group will be 560 consenting patients but who do not develop PONV. COMT genotyping: Genomic\n      DNA will be extracted from 200 \u00b5l of whole blood using the QIAamp DNA blood mini kit\n      (QIAGEN, Hombrechtikon, Switzerland). The COMT Val158Met polymorphism (rs4680) will be\n      genotyped using a commercially available TaqMan\u00ae SNP genotyping assay (C_25746809_50,\n      Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK). Twenty-five \u00b5l reactions will be performed using 50 ng\n      of template DNA, pre-designed PCR primers and TaqMan\u00ae MGB probes (FAMTM and VIC\u00ae\n      dye-labelled) according to the manufacturer's instructions in TaqMan\u00ae Universal PCR Master\n      Mix using an iCycler iQ detection system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Analyses: The\n      investigators will analyse allele and genotype frequencies, Hardyweinberg equilibrium,\n      linkage disequilibrium and haplotypes. The individual SNPs and haplotypes association with\n      of occurrence of PONV will be categorized and will be analyzed by Fisher exact test or\n      Chi-square test and regression analysis (logistic, univariate and multivariate). Gene-gene\n      interactions relation with that of PONV will be assessed by multivariate regression\n      analysis. Analyses will be performed using Haploview software v1. (Broad Institute,\n      Cambridge, USA) and SPSS (version 19; SPSS Inc, Chicag0, IL).\n\n      Adjunct protocol 3: Role of non-smoking status as a predictive factor of PONV.\n\n      BACKGROUND: Non-smoking status has consistently been reported to be an independent\n      predictive risk factor of PONV. At first view, this empirical observation is interesting.\n      However, there are two unresolved issues. Firstly, it remains unclear, why non-smoking\n      patients are at a increased risk of PONV, and consequently, smoking patients are\n      \"protected\". For instance, the investigators failed to show any benefit of (short-term)\n      perioperative transcutaneous nicotine administration for the prevention of PONV. Secondly,\n      no PONV risk score has shown satisfactory sensitivity and specificity, largely limiting\n      their clinical applicability. It has been argued that one weakness of these scores was that\n      non-smoking status was ill defined and was treated in a purely dichotomous fashion. For\n      instance, it remains unclear from what length of abstinence the formerly PONV-protective\n      effect will be lost in an ex-smokers. Also, it remains unknown whether \"heavy\" smokers\" are\n      more protected. Finally, there are various ways to consume tobacco; tobacco snuffing was\n      also shown to decrease the risk of PONV. AIMS: 1. To test whether the risk of PONV differs\n      between non-, ex- and current smokers. 2. To test whether there is a dose-effect\n      relationship between the amount of tobacco smoking, and the risk of PONV. 3. To test in\n      ex-smokers for a relationship between the duration of smoking cessation and the risk of\n      PONV. METHODS: Patients who participate in the main study will be asked, pre-operatively, to\n      fill in a questionnaire regarding smoking habits. Patients will be classified into\n      non-smokers (exposed or not to passive smoking), ex-smokers (stop >1 month; exposed or not\n      to passive smoking; substituted), and smokers. Variables related to PONV and to smoking\n      (potential confounders) will be recorded."
