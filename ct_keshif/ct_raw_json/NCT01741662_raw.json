Materials and Methods The LEA study is based on the constitution of a multi-centric\n      prospective cohort in 11 university hospitals: Bordeaux, Clermont-Ferrand, Grenoble, Lyon,\n      Paris (Trousseau, Robert Debr\u00e9, St Louis), Marseille, Montpellier, Nancy, Nice, Rennes. Are\n      inclued in LEA all the children diagnosed and treated for acute leukemia since January 1980\n      (incident and prevalent cases), surviving  at month 24 for the AML and ALL grafted in\n      complete remission and at month 48 for the ALL not grafted in first complete remission.\n\n      The LEA Psy-Cog study rests on a sample of the LEA cohort. Are included the patients\n      12-17-years-old from the PACA-Corse sub-cohort (administrative district of 4 million of\n      people which corresponds to the Marseille and Nice centers). Patients from this two centers\n      are the patients with the more important length of survey, allowing us to produce a not\n      biaised estimation of prevalence rate. Finally, the choice of this subsample is supported by\n      the proximity of the Mediterranean Center for Adolescent in Marseilles, specifically\n      dedicated to the psychological follow-up of children suffering from cancer."
