Interferon alfa may interfere with the growth of cancer cells.\n      Combining chemotherapy with interferon alfa may kill more cancer cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining bexarotene with interferon\n      alfa in treating patients who have cutaneous T-cell lymphoma."
