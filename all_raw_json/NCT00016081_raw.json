It\n      is not yet known if ribavirin is more effective than standard therapy in preventing\n      pneumonia in patients who have respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection following stem\n      cell transplantation.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of ribavirin with that of\n      standard therapy in preventing pneumonia in patients who have RSV infection following stem\n      cell transplantation."

Patients\n      are stratified according to engraftment status (pre vs post) and transplant type (HLA\n      matched-related allogeneic, syngeneic, or autologous vs HLA mismatched-related or unrelated\n      allogeneic). Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive standard supportive care for immunocompromised patients with\n           upper respiratory tract infections. Patient also receive aerosolized ribavirin by face\n           mask, mist, or oxygen tent over 2 hours 3 times daily on days 1-10.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive standard supportive care as in arm I. Treatment continues in\n           the absence of progression to pneumonia or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed at days 14 and 28.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 90 patients (45 per arm) will be accrued for this study."
