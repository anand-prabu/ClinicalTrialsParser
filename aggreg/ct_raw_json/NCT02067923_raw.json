Anti-CD3 monoclonal\n      antibody is a humanized antibody that is commonly used to prevent organ rejection.  It was\n      give in order to determine whether anti-CD3 mAb treatment can halt the progression of newly\n      diagnosed type 1 diabetes.\n\n      The overall hypothesis of this study is there will be less change in c-peptide levels of the\n      previously treated group versus the control group."

The first few subjects went on\n      the trial late in 2005 and the last subjects were enrolled in 2009.The mixed meal tolerance\n      tests will coincide with approximately 4 years and 6 years post ITN027AI study completion\n      for each participant. Those participants, who completed the ITN027AI study in 2007 and 2008,\n      will only have a single MMTT.\n\n      We plan to enroll approximately 77 subjects at 5 sites who were previously active with\n      ITN027AI.. Both the drug treated and the control group participants will be invited to\n      participate. Along with Yale University these sites include, the University of\n      California-San Francisco, University of Colorado-Barbara Davis, Benaroya Research Institute,\n      and Pacific Northwest Research Institute -University of Washington. The investigators of\n      each of these sites will be asked to contact their patients who were originally on the\n      ITN027AI study.\n\n      Subjects will be contacted via email or phone to see if they would be interested in\n      participating on this Abate follow-up study. Eligible participants will come to the Yale\n      University Church St. Research Unit or other participating ITN study site for either 1 or 2\n      mixed meal tolerance tests to determine their current c-peptide status.  The available sites\n      for participants to go to include:  Yale University, University of California-San Francisco,\n      University of Colorado-Barbara Davis Center, Benaroya Research Institute and Pacific\n      Northwest-University of Washington.\n\n      This first visit will consist of the following: an explanation of the study, an assessment\n      of inclusion/exclusion criteria and documentation of informed consent.  If the subject meets\n      the inclusion/exclusion criteria, a complete medical history will be obtained, physical\n      examination including vital signs, urine pregnancy test if a female of childbearing\n      potential and an assessment of concomitant medications.  The subject will then have a  Mixed\n      Meal Tolerance Tests (MMTT) with a possible 2nd MMTT  with C-Peptide and glucose\n      measurements a year later based on how long it has been since they were on the ITN027AI\n      Study.The subject will also have a 4 hour urine collection for C-peptide and creatinine\n      during this MMTT. If a repeat MMTT is done a year later then another 4 hour urine sample\n      during the MMTT will be collected for C-peptide and Creatinine measurement."
