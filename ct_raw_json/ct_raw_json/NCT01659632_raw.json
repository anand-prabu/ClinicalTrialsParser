Symptoms of advanced gastric cancer are\n      weight loss, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, anorexia dysphagia, gastrointestinal\n      bleeding. Gastric cancer found according to warning symptoms such as gastrointestinal\n      bleeding, weight loss usually can not be cured. Therefore, early gastric cancer can not be\n      detected and impossible to treatment if endoscopy is performed according to the warning\n      signs. National gastric cancer screening is conducted in men and women of more than 40 years\n      old. The purpose of screening for gastric cancer is discovering a case of possible cure, so\n      increasing the survival rate. The purpose of this study is review of the feasibility of\n      screening for gastric cancer."
