However, few patients are aware of the importance to quit at the stage, or\n      they have difficulties to quit by self.\n\n      Aim: Test the effectiveness of a tailored and targeted smoking cessation intervention\n\n      Hypothesis: We hypothesize that improving risk communication could significantly increase\n      the quit rate of smoking cancer patients\n\n      Design: Cluster randomized controlled trial\n\n      Setting: Outpatient clinics in Queen Mary Hospital and Tuen Mun Hospital (Clinical Oncology\n      Departments)\n\n      Subject: Smoking patients who have diagnosed cancer with stable condition and treatments\n\n      Intervention: At baseline, intervention group receives:\n\n        1. health warnings of smoking from oncologists/nurses based on a special design leaflet;\n\n        2. a patient-centred counseling from nurse counselors with emphasis on risk perceptions of\n           smoking to cancer prognosis; and\n\n        3. examination of exhale CO level. They will receive up to 8 more telephone counseling\n           within 1 month by nurse counselor to reinforce the importance to quit and assist to\n           solve any barriers. Control group receive standard care and a generic self-help smoking\n           cessation booklet.\n\n      Outcome: Primary outcome is the self-reported 7-day point prevalence quit rate at 6-month\n      follow up. Secondary outcomes include:\n\n        1. change in risk perceptions of smoking;\n\n        2. change in the intention to quit;\n\n        3. validated 6-month quit rate;\n\n        4. patient's smoking reduction by at least 50% compared to baseline;\n\n        5. quit attempt(s);\n\n        6. change in health related quality of life; and\n\n        7. cancer recurrence rate at 6-month.\n\n      Significance: This study develops and validates practical smoking cessation interventions\n      targeted to cancer patients to improve their cancer prognosis and in long-term, increase\n      their survival time."

            "textblock": "Smoking causes many types of cancer in general. Past studies have shown that current smokers\n      have increased risk of cancer, and most lung cancers are attributable to smoking. Cancer\n      (malignant neoplasm) is the number one killer in Hong Kong, which leads to nearly one-third\n      of all deaths each year. Cancer patients who continue smoking would result in extra risks of\n      all cause mortality, cancer recurrence and second primary cancer as well as reducing\n      survival time (Chen et al., 2010). Smoking could also reduce the efficacy of clinical and\n      medical treatment of cancer including radio- and chemo-therapies (Benninger et al., 1994;\n      Browman et al., 1993) and increase the risk of treatment related side-effects (Rugg et al.,\n      1990).\n\n      Cancer patients may present an excellent \"teachable moment\" for smoking cessation\n      interventions, as their current illness could largely be due to smoking. However, few\n      smoking cessation programs target on this vulnerable group and only one-third of oncology\n      nurses would assist cancer patients quit smoking. Healthcare professionals have the\n      responsibility to assist this vulnerable group to quit smoking. Recent randomized controlled\n      trials (RCT) suggested behavioral intervention may help cancer patients quit smoking, but\n      they are limited by small sample size. No RCT study has ever been done in Hong Kong.\n\n      This study can make an important contribution to evidence-based practice by testing the\n      effectiveness of a tailored smoking cessation intervention targeting cancer patients. The\n      results primarily serve the purpose to support the development of clinical practice\n      guidelines and interventions to promote smoking cessation in cancer patients to improve\n      their cancer prognosis and, in the long-run, increase their survival time and quality of\n      life."
