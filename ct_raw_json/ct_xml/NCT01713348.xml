  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To understand if Multiple Daily Injections (MDI) managed subjects can improve glycaemic
      control by;

        1. regularly checking and understanding Continuous Glucose data &amp; trend arrows at times
           other than the standard pre-meal bolus calculation test times and

        2. review of their glucose profiles (inc. hypoglycaemic risks) with their HCP and
           adjusting behaviours &amp; therapy from interpretation of the Continuous Glucose profiles.
