Any abnormality in screening hematology and/or blood chemistry laboratory values\n             according to the toxicity grading scale.  Subjects with stable Grade 1 abnormalities\n             for hemoglobin, leukocyte count, and platelets may be considered eligible at the\n             discretion of the investigator.\n\n         17.

Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory\n             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or\n             investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of\n             study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the subject\n             inappropriate for entry into this study."
