      1. Part A: Subjects will receive Patritumab or placebo with erlotinib. Progression-free
           survival will be the primary outcome. Subjects will need to have Epidermal Growth
           Factor Receptor (EGFR) wild-type, locally advance or metastatic NSCLC and have their
           cancer progressed after at least one prior systemic anti-cancer therapy, available
           recent or archival tumor specimen and may not have had previous EGFR-targeted regimen,
           anti-HER2 (Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2), anti-HER3, or anti-HER4 therapy.
           Subjects may have high heregulin or low heregulin.

        2. Part B: Subjects will receive Patritumab or placebo with erlotinib. Overall survival
           will be the primary outcome. Subjects will need to have EGFR wild-type, locally advance
           or metastatic NSCLC and have their cancer progressed after at least one prior systemic
           anti-cancer therapy, available recent or archival tumor specimen and may not have had
           previous EGFR-targeted regimen, anti-HER2, anti-HER3, or anti-HER4 therapy.  Only
           subjects with high heregulin will be enrolled.
