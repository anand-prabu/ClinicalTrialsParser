  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      MTF116086 is an open-label, randomised, parallel-design study in subjects with type II
      diabetes. The study is site-based, with local pharmacies serving as the sites and
      pharmacists as principal investigators for the sites. All subjects will enter an initial
      8-week observational phase during which purchase behaviour and compliance with usual
      metformin use will be observed and recorded. At the end of the observational phase, subjects
      will be randomised to one of the two arms (metformin small pack vs. metformin large pack)
      for a 20-week interventional phase. The medication in the interventional phase is provided
      to the subjects free of charge. HbA1c will be collected for all subjects during Week 0, Week
      8, and Week 28. Subjects will be asked questions about their tablet compliance, their
      satisfaction with the pack size they received and reasons for missing doses throughout the
      interventional phase by the pharmacist. The pharmacy visit on Week 28 will be end of the
      study.

    <description>HbA1c will be assessed for all subjects at three time points: enrolment (Week 0), baseline (Week 8), and end of study (Week 28). During the corresponding pharmacy visit for each of these time points, HbA1c will be tested with a point-of-care device, which requires a finger prick to obtain blood and provides an immediate result upon analysis in the device</description>

    <description>All subjects in the study will be initially followed for an 8-week observational phase during which subjects will visit the pharmacy and purchase metformin following their usual routines. After 8-weeks subjects will be randomised to one of the 2 treatments arms. Subjects in the metformin small pack arm will receive medication free of charge in a small pack. Dosing of metformin will not be dictated by the protocol. Subjects will remain on their prescribed dose of metformin throughout the study, unless a change is recommended by their physician.</description>
