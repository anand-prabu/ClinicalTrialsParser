Persons receiving prophylactic antiplatelet medications, e.g., low-dose\n             aspirin, and without a clinically-apparent bleeding tendency, are eligible.\n             Assessment of risk of injection complications should be made in the context of\n             individual subject risk of H5N1 virus infection.\n\n          -  An acute evolving neurological disorder or Guillain Barr\u00e9 Syndrome within 42 days of\n             receipt of prior seasonal or pandemic influenza vaccine.\n\n          -  Administration of an inactive vaccine within 14 days or of a live attenuated vaccine\n             within 30 days before the first dose of study vaccine.\n\n          -  Planned administration of any vaccine other than the study vaccine before Day 42.\n\n          -  Any known or suspected allergy to any constituent of influenza vaccines or component\n             used in the manufacturing process of the study vaccine including a history of\n             anaphylactic-type reaction to consumption of eggs; or a history of severe adverse\n             reaction to a previous influenza vaccine.\n\n          -  Known pregnancy or a positive urine beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (\u03b2-hCG) test\n             result before the first vaccination.\n\n          -  Lactating or nursing women.\n\n          -  Any condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, prevents the subject from\n             participating in the study."
