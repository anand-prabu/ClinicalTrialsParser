TMX-101 is being developed as a potential\n      treatment  for patients with non-invasive bladder cancer, including patients with CIS\n      bladder cancer.\n\n      Following confirmation of CIS by histology, patients will receive weekly instillations of\n      TMX-101 for 6 weeks.  Five to seven weeks after the last instillation, biopsies and cytology\n      will be performed.   Response to treatment will be determined based on cytology and tissue\n      sample histology findings."

Pathologically-proven, recurrent, primary, secondary or concomitant carcinoma in situ\n             disease, defined by having either Ta or T1 with CIS, or CIS alone. In cases with T1\n             tumor lesions, muscularis propria tissue should be in the resected specimen to\n             confirm that it is tumor-free.\n\n          3. Patient has undergone mapping of the bladder between Days -28 and -14, with at least\n             one biopsy providing pathological confirmation of CIS of the bladder.  Slides must be\n             available for a central pathology review.\n\n          4. Patient has undergone bladder washing for cytology between Days -28 and -1.
