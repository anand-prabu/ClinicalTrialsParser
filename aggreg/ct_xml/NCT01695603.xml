  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Comparison of the ability of a new automated ventilatory mode named Intellibrain to maintain
      capnia and oxgen partial pressure within predefined ranges in comparison to the control of
      capnia and oxgen partial pressure obtained by using standard controlled ventilation modes in
      brain injured patients. Comparison of the numbers of alarms and required settings
      modifications observed with each ventilatory mode.
