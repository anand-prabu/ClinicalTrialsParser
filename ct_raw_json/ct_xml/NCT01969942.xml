      The purpose of this study is to examine the toxicity of using allogeneic stem cell
      transplantation for treatment of subjects with relapsed or refractory Ewing Sarcoma (ES) and
      rhabdomyosarcoma.  Donors will consist of either Human Leukocyte Antigen identical (HLA)or
      9/10 (A, B, C, DR, DQ [A, B, C, are Class I markers for HLA and DR and DQ are Class II
      markers for Matching for Transplant for Donors to match with recipient]) matched related or
      unrelated donors.  Specifically, we will examine:

        -  The toxicity of allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT) in this patient population, as
           related to incidence of grade 3-4 acute Graft Verse Host Disease (GVHD).

        -  The incidence of transplant related mortality at 100 days.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients aged 0-30 years with relapsed or therapy refractory Ewings sarcoma or
             rhabdomyosarcoma, excluding patients with brain metastases.

          -  Patients who have received a prior autologous stem cell transplant are eligible.

          -  Related and unrelated marrow and peripheral blood stem donors must be 9/10 or 10/10
             (HLA A, B, C, DR, DQ) matched with the recipient.

          -  Patients with an isolated local recurrence of their tumor (in the site of the primary
             tumor) greater than 1 year after completing therapy are excluded, as these patients
             could be cured with local therapy alone.

          -  As a part of the standard of care for pre-transplant evaluation, subjects will be
             tested for exposure to viral agents such as hepatitis B, C, Human T-Lymphotropic
             Verse (HTLV)-1/2, and HIV.

          -  Subjects testing positive for HIV may be rejected as candidates for transplantation,
             based on the clinical judgment of the stem cell transplant physician.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Organ dysfunction: Patients who have the following levels of organ system dysfunction
             are not eligible:

               -  Cardiac: Ejection Fraction less than 50 precent

               -  Renal: Est. Creatinine Clearance less than 50 Hepatic: Bilirubin greater than
                  3.0

               -  Pulmonary: Diffusing Capacity for Carbon Monoxide (DLCO) less than 70 precent,
                  or for patient who cannot cooperate with pulmonary function testing, O2
                  saturation less than 95 precent on room air.

          -  Performance status:

               -  Lansky performance less than 70;

               -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) status greater than 2

          -  Pregnant females will not be allowed to participate in this study.
