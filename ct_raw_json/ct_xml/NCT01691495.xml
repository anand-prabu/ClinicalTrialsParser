      Fondaparinux is an anticoagulant used in the prevention and treatment of thromboembolic
      disease. It has recently been approved in the European Union (EU) for the treatment of
      patients with isolated superficial vein thrombosis (SVT), i.e. without concomitant deep vein
      thrombosis (DVT), of the lower limbs. As part of EU approval, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK)
      committed to evaluate physicians' adherence to fondaparinux prescribing information
      regarding proper diagnosis and dosing for the treatment of SVT.

      The primary objective is to evaluate physicians' adherence to fondaparinux prescribing
      information for the treatment of patients with SVT without concomitant DVT.

      The study is designed as a non-interventional, retrospective chart review of patients
      prescribed fondaparinux to treat their SVT. The study will be conducted in several EU
      countries.
