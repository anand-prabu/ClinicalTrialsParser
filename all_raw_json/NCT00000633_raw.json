To compare safety and\n      immunogenicity of two different schedules of gp160 administration. To examine the effects of\n      gp160 and hepatitis B vaccine (Engerix-B) on various markers of viral load and on selected\n      immune parameters.\n\n      Potentiation of a patient's immune response to HIV might possibly prolong the period of\n      clinical latency and protect the patient indefinitely. Preliminary results from a study of\n      Immuno-AG recombinant gp160 vaccine in healthy volunteers not infected with HIV suggest that\n      the vaccine is safe and produces antibodies against the virus. Because another previous\n      study failed to demonstrate a specific anti-HIV response in patients injected with a\n      recombinant vaccinia virus containing HIV-1 genes, this study is also testing the\n      immunotherapeutic role of other immunizations (such as hepatitis B vaccination) that would\n      be expected to induce a nonspecific immune response in HIV-infected persons."
