Preoperative chemoradiotherapy with\n      cisplatin plus 5-fluorouracil is the standard in Western countries in esophagus cancer. But\n      in China because of its toxic reaction, most of patients stop the halfway.Preoperative\n      chemotherapy with Capecitabine\uff08Xeloda\uff09 plus oxaliplatin\uff08 ELOXATIN\uff09 is another promising\n      regimen. The purpose of this study is to confirm the difference of Capecitabine\uff08Xeloda\uff09 plus\n      oxaliplatin \uff08 ELOXATIN\uff09over Single drug Capecitabine\uff08Xeloda\uff09 with chemoradiotherapy as\n      preoperative therapy for squamous cell carcinoma of esophagus. A total of 300 patients will\n      be accrued from Henan province in China within 3 years. The primary endpoint is overall\n      survival and the secondary endpoints include progression-free survival, R0 resection rate,\n      response rate, pathologic complete response rate and adverse events."
