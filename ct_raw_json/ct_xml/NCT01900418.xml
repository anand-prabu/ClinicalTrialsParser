  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For post-menopausal women diagnosed with hormone-receptor positive breast cancer tumors,
      aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are the standard adjuvant hormone treatment to prolong
      disease-free survival and time-to-recurrence.  Unfortunately, joint pain/stiffness/achiness
      (arthralgia) is a common side-effect of AIs.  This &quot;proof-of-concept&quot; study explores how an
      evidence-based physical activity (PA) program- the Arthritis Foundation's Walk with Ease
      (WWE) program- can be adapted for breast cancer survivors on AI therapy to: 1) Help them
      maintain or achieve recommended levels of PA, 2) reduce their joint pain/stiffness/achiness,
      and 3) thereby enable them to remain on AI therapy as prescribed.
