      The PORTICO clinical trial is a prospective, multi-center, randomized-controlled clinical
      study, designed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the St. Jude Medical (SJM)
      Portico Transcatheter Heart Valve and Delivery Systems (Portico) via the transfemoral and
      transapical delivery methods, in high and extreme risk cohorts.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The PORTICO clinical study is limited to two subject cohorts with severe, symptomatic aortic
      stenosis who are determined to be at high or extreme operative risk for surgical aortic
      valve replacement. The operative risk determination of study candidates will be based on the
      Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) Adult Cardiac Surgery Risk Calculator.

      The PORTICO trial will include a maximum of 1610 subjects (930 subjects in the high risk
      [randomized] cohort, 680 subjects in the extreme risk [randomized] cohort) at up to 40
      investigational sites.

      In addition, at least one roll-in subject per investigational site for transfemoral access
      and at least one roll-in subject per investigational site for each alternative access will
      be enrolled into a Roll-in Registry; up to 100 subjects will be enrolled in a Valve-in-Valve
      registry.

      Study subjects will undergo clinical evaluation at Discharge, 30 days, 6 months, 1 year, and
      annually up to 5 years after the index procedure.
