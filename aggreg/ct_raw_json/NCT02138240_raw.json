            "textblock": "The obesity epidemic disproportionately affects the 1.2 million U.S. households living in\n      public housing, where nearly 50% of adults are obese and have a two-fold greater risk of\n      hypertension. Using an ecologic framework, we propose that neighborhood social network\n      factors likely promote unhealthy lifestyle behaviors that contribute to this disparity. The\n      overall objective of this proposal is to identify social network factors that promote\n      healthy diet, physical activity and healthy weight among public housing residents. We focus\n      on the social network - the connections among people within a community - as theoretical\n      work suggests that social networks have an important influence on health behaviors. However,\n      no previous studies have examined lifestyle behaviors in a social network analysis or\n      targeted these behaviors with a social network intervention. Our aim for this work is: 1) To\n      develop a social network intervention to facilitate lifestyle behavior change and pilot test\n      it in residents of public housing developments as in Baltimore, MD. We hypothesize that a\n      social network intervention will be feasible and acceptable in promoting healthy lifestyle\n      change, and that this intervention will alter lifestyle behaviors among public housing\n      residents."
