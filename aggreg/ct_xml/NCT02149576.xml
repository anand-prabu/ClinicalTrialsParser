  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After curative lung cancer surgery, there is a risk of recurrence of the primary cancer, or
      development of a new cancer. Historically, patients who have undergone curative lung cancer
      surgery have been monitored with chest radiographs (CXR). Unfortunately, 70% of such
      patients still die of lung cancer. As a result, there has been interest in other methods of
      surveillance in order to detect recurring or new cancers earlier and have more success in
      treating them. One such technique is Low Dose Computed Tomography (LDCT), which is currently
      the standard of care and surveillance at this institution. This pilot study aims to
      determine whether regimented, intensive, short interval LDCT surveillance leads to higher
      rates of detection and treatment of recurring lung cancers. The study group will be followed
      up according to a regimented surveillance program using LDCT. The study group will be
      compared to a group of historical controls whose follow up after surgery was not
      standardized, but rather left up to the discretion of the individual surgeon. If the results
      of this study show improvements in detection and treatment of recurrent cancers, it will
      allow for a larger trial to study the effects of the LDCT surveillance program on lung
      cancer survival.

      The study question aims to determine whether for survivors after curative surgery for Stage
      I and Stage II lung cancer, a structured Surveillance Program with Low Dose CT can increase
      the rate of detection and treatment of recurring or new cancers when compared to historical
      non-structured surveillance with CXR. This study will also determine if it is warranted to
      pursue a larger scale randomized controlled trial to further investigate optimal LDCT
      surveillance follow-up intervals and long-term lung cancer survival.

    <description>This cohort will follow a strict schedule of Low Dose Computed Tomography Imaging scans and clinical visits 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery. At each encounter, a history, physical examination, and review of the LDCT results will be performed. Patients with normal clinical and imaging findings will proceed to the next scheduled clinical encounter. Patients with abnormal findings will be managed according to predetermined algorithms.</description>

    <description>The control group will be a retrospective cohort taken from 1-year before the implementation of the LDCT surveillance program. The post-operative follow-up of these participants was not standardized, but rather left up to the discretion of the individual surgeons, and involved chest radiograph imaging as opposed to Low Dose Computed Tomography.</description>
