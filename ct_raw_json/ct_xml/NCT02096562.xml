  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Outpatients who undergo knee surgery are designated two different clinical study groups.
      Group A receives common wrapping after surgery to the first postsurgical day and will be
      provided with compression stockings for the following 10 days, while group B only receives
      common wrapping and will not be provided with compression stockings.

      The investigators are going to investigate the effect of compression stockings on
      postsurgical swelling and formation of edema on outpatients.

    <textblock>
      The investigators are planing on investigate the effect of compression stockings on
      postsurgical swelling and formation of edema. For this purpose the investigators devide
      outpatients who have undergone knee surgery to two different clinical study groups. Group A
      receives a common compression bandage after surgery to the first postsurgical day and
      receives compression stockings afterwards for the following 10 days, while Group B only
      receives a common compression bandage to the first postsurgical day. Group A will be
      instructed to wear compression stockings for 24 hours on the first two postsurgical day,
      afterwards at least for 8 hours a day.

      Preoperatively the investigators are going to determine the volume and circumference of both
      legs using the Bodytronic 600 by Bauerfeind. Subsequently the measurement will be repeated
      on the first, forth and tenth postsurgical day. The investigators are going to measure the
      range of motion, also the patients of both groups will be asked to mark pain and tension on
      a visual analog scale and write down the amount of time they have been lying, sitting and
      standing each day. Group A will document the amount of time for how long they were wearing
      compression stockings each day.
