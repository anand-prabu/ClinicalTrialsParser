    <textblock>
      This is an extension study to investigate long term safety and efficacy of SyB C-1101 when
      orally administered every 3 weeks, twice daily for 14 consecutive days to the patients who
      have completed  6 cycles in the study 2012002 whose purpose is to investigate tolerability
      of SyB C-1101 when administered orally in patients with recurrent/relapsed or refractory
      myelodysplastic syndrome.

PR: All CR criteria met, except following: Bone marrow: Blasts decreased by ≤50% compared to base-line but still &gt;5% (peripheral blood findings must be normal same as CR)
marrow CR:  Bone marrow: ≤5% blasts and decreased by ≥50%, but peripheral blood findings do not meet criteria for CR (Hematological improvement: Hematologic improvement responses should be noted, such as: Marrow CR with Hematologic improvement-erythroid, marrow CR without Hematologic improvement.)</description>

    <description>SyB C-1101（rigosertib sodium） will be administered orally twice daily for 14 consecutive days, followed by 7-day observation period. The treatment period of 21 days (14 days of administration + 7 days of observation) constitutes 1 cycle.
The dose at cycle 6 in the study 2012002 will be the dose (if needed, the dose can be reduced) at the first cycle in this study (cycle 7).
From cycle 8 on, the dose of SyB C-1101 will be reduced, delayed, or discontinued according to adverse events and results of observation at the previous cycle.</description>
