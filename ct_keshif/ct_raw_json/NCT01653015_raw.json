The goal of this randomized clinical trial\n      is to determine whether immunizing children in Hutterite colonies with LAIV can provide\n      increased community-wide protection over TIV. Children aged 3 to 15 years in Hutterite\n      colonies from Alberta and Saskatchewan will be randomized to one of two regimens: TIV or\n      LAIV. The primary outcome of this study will be laboratory-confirmed influenza as detected\n      by PCR in all participants (i.e vaccine recipients and nonrecipients). Secondary outcomes\n      will include influenza-like illness, hospitalization, pneumonia, death, antibiotic use,\n      absenteeism."

Other specific objectives are to determine\n      if LAIV reduces influenza in the healthy children and adolescents immunized and if LAIV\n      reduces the following relative to TIV in all participants: influenza-like illness,\n      antimicrobial prescriptions, physician-diagnosed otitis media, school or work-related\n      absenteeism, physician visits for respiratory illness, lower respiratory infection,\n      pneumonia, hospitalizations, and death.
