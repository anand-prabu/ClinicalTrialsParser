The pathogenesis of CIN does not well\n      understood. The probable one is the contrast media makes the afferent vessel in glomeruli\n      constrict and results in renal shut down. Limb ischemic preconditioning, a procedure that\n      makes muscles become ischemic and adapt themselves to produce some cytokines for signaling\n      the vessel more dilated. After the reperfusion, these cytokines are getting back to systemic\n      circulation and effect the afferent vessel in glomeruli to become more dilated and prevent\n      CIN."
