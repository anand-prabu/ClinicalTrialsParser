      This randomized clinical trial compares multimedia psychoeducation to print education in
      preparing patients with cancer for decision making about clinical trial participation.
      Multimedia psychoeducation includes a DVD and written materials with a combined focus on
      knowledge and attitude change, and may be an effective method to help patients prepare for
      decision making about clinical trial participation. It is not yet known whether a multimedia
      psychoeducation is more effective than print education in preparing patients for decision
      making about clinical trials.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the effect of intervention assignment on patients' preparedness for decision
      making about clinical trial participation.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the effect of intervention assignment on indicators of the quality of
      patients' decision making about clinical trial participation.

      II. To examine mechanisms by which multimedia psychoeducation (MP) exerts its expected
      positive effects on preparedness for decision making.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore the effects of intervention assignment on clinical trial participation.

      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Participants undergo a print educational intervention during which they meet with a
      site coordinator and are instructed to read the National Cancer Institute (NCI) booklet
      titled Taking Part in Cancer Treatment Studies, comprised primarily of information about the
      nature and conduct of cancer clinical trials.

      ARM II: Participants undergo a multimedia psychoeducational intervention during which they
      meet with a site coordinator and are instructed to view a digital video disk (DVD) and read
      a booklet titled Clinical Trials: Are They Right For You? Participants are encouraged to
      watch the DVD and read the booklet again at home.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 3-7 and 49-56 days.

    <description>Mediational analyses will be conducted if, as expected, intervention assignment is significantly associated with decision quality as measured by the total score on the Decision Conflict Scale. Path coefficients for the mediator model and bootstrap confidence intervals for effects will be estimated to determine the significance of a potential mediator using methods described by Preacher and Hayes. Estimation (using MPlus Version 6 or later) will be through Full Information Maximum Likelihood using the bootstrap procedure to obtain standard errors and 95% confidence intervals.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Be able to speak and read English

          -  Be diagnosed with cancer

          -  Have been determined to be eligible for a specific phase II or III therapeutic
             clinical trial open for enrollment at the participating Community Clinical Oncology
             Program (CCOP) site

          -  Have been informed of their eligibility for a specific phase II or III therapeutic
             clinical trial

          -  Be capable of providing written informed consent for study participation

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants must not have been asked previously to participate in another
             therapeutic cancer clinical trial

          -  Participants must not have already made a decision to participate in the phase II or
             III therapeutic clinical trial for which they were informed of their eligibility

          -  Participants must not have documented or observable visual, auditory, psychiatric, or
             neurological disorders that would interfere with study participation (e.g.,
             blindness, deafness, psychosis, or dementia)

          -  Participants must not be eligible only for phase I trial; these patients are excluded
             because few of these trials are offered at CCOP sites and because their design and
             goals differ considerably from those of phase II and III trials
