    <textblock>
      Visual assessment of a coronary artery narrowing (called stenosis) seen on angiography is
      conventionally used to infer how likely the stenosis will limit blood flow (called ischemia)
      under conditions of increased demand (e.g exercise). This is based on animal work and data
      from humans with simple single vessel disease with no co-existing conditions. These data
      have been extrapolated to more complex patients/ complex disease but clearly over-simplifies
      the situation in the majority of patients cardiologists treat.

      Pivotal work by DeBruyne, Pils and colleagues in the 90's convincingly showed that pressure
      derived measurements, called FFR, from the coronary artery during a cardiac catheterization,
      more accurately identify stenoses that would cause ischemia compared to visual assessment
      alone. A strategy of FFR guided coronary stenting with drug eluting stents significantly
      improved outcomes and reduced costs compared to visual assessment alone (FAME trial).
      Deferring treatment based on FFR has been shown to be safe (DEFER Trial). FFR has excellent
      sensitivity and specificity. A FFR of &lt;=0.80 was used as this identified ischemia causing
      lesions 90% of the time. Therefore, the concept of FFR guided percutaneous revascularisation
      and treatment deferral has a robust evidence base to support it.

      Coronary bypass grafting (CABG) is traditionally based solely on a visual assessment of
      angiography images. SPY® Infrared Fluorescence Angiography (NIRF, FDA approved 2005) is used
      by some cardiac surgeons to assess the patency of bypass grafts in real-time in the
      operating room, as a surrogate for immediate traditional coronary angiography. Dr. Ferguson
      observed that regional myocardial perfusion (RMP) image data was also captured in these
      video sequences.

      Study Hypotheses:

        1. In patients who are likely CABG candidates, target vessel epicardial coronary arteries
           (TVECAs) with FFR &lt;0.80 will not demonstrate an increase in RMP despite an anatomically
           patent bypass conduit during SPY® imaging

        2. In TVECAs with an increase in RMP during SPY® imaging, cardiac catheter laboratory
           measures of coronary physiology from that TVECA, namely one or a combination of FFR,
           CFR, HSR and HMR, will correlate with the SPY® data on myocardial perfusion, and
           suggest a potential mechanism for this physiologic response to TVECA grafting.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age &gt;18&lt;80

          -  Patients with stable angina or NSTEMI with total CK rise of &lt;1000 U/litre

          -  Patients where all 3 vessels would normally be safely assessed with a pressure wire
             study i.e. generally 40-70% lesions.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Emergent status, or Cardiogenic shock

          -  LVEF &lt;40%

          -  History of actively malignant disease

          -  Patient needing concomitant valvular surgery or other cardiac structural
             reconstructive surgery

          -  As is standard of care, those vessels that are extremely tortuous, very small calibre
             and/or heavily calcified would not have such wires passed down them. Furthermore,
             those vessels that are 80-90+% stenosed, with &lt;TIMI3 flow, which we would not
             normally pass a diagnostic physiology pressure wire with no intention of proceeding
             with PCI (due to risk of vessel occlusion by the wire) would not be studied with
             ComboXT wire.
