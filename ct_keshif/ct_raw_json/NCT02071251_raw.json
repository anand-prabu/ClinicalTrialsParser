These lead to worse\n      patient quality of life, more outpatient and emergency room visits, readmissions and home\n      services, with an estimated increase in costs of at least $3500 per complication. Surgical\n      site infections are associated with increasing body mass index.  There is limited and\n      conflicting data of the utility of multiple surgical interventions to decrease the risk of\n      surgical site complications. The investigators explored the effect of a prospective care\n      pathway for closure of vertical abdominal wounds on patient's wound complications."
