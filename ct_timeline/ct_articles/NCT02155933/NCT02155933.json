Too much testosterone in the blood can possibly lead to a problem called polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). People with PCOS have abnormal menstrual periods, excess facial and body hair, and too much testosterone in their blood. On the other hand, some girls with too much testosterone in their blood do not develop PCOS. We do not know why some of these girls develop PCOS and why some do not.<br/>\n<br/>The purpose of this research study is to find out whether too much testosterone can cause problems with other hormones that can lead to the development of PCOS. This study may help us understand more about the causes of PCOS.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>Detailed description</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"bigdent\" colspan=\"2\">\n<p>The polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common disorder marked by irregular ovulation and hyperandrogenism. Hyperandrogenemia during adolescence can be a forerunner of adult PCOS. However, the progression of hormonal abnormalities leading to PCOS are unclear. We will examine hormonal profiles (e.g., LH, FSH, progesterone, testosterone, estradiol) during pubertal maturation in adolescent girls with and without elevated plasma androgens. The working hypothesis is that, in pubertal girls without hyperandrogenemia, overnight rises of P are associated with a reduction of LH frequency during the waking morning hours. However, in pubertal girls with hyperandrogenemia, LH frequency will be higher than normal during both the day and night, despite similar or higher P levels. The studies will involve frequent blood sampling over 18 hours. We will assess differences in hormone parameters between time blocks (1900-2300 h, 2300-0300 h, 0300-0700 h, 0700-1100 h) in individuals to evaluate day-night changes. We will compare such changes between those with hyperandrogenemia and those without hyperandrogenemia.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>Study type</th><td>Observational</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>Study design</th><td>Case-Control</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>Study design</th><td>Cross-Sectional</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>Primary outcome</th><td>Measure: Difference in mean LH frequency when awake (18:00-23:00 and 07:00-12:00) and when asleep (23:00-07:00) in girls with and without hyperandrogenemia<br/>Time Frame: Time frame for the study will be 18 hours (Sampling begins at 1800 hrs and proceeds through 1200 hours the following day).<br/>Safety Issue?
