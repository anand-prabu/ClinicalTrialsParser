One of the greatest challenges in the\n           science of aging and exercise is to understand whether and to which extent exercise and\n           active life-style may postpone the onset of disability and/or reverse physical\n           impairments.\n\n        -  Maintenance/improvements of physical function and mobility should be considered as\n           primary targets for independent living, active engagement in societal challenges, and,\n           more in general, when promoting \"active ageing\".\n\n        -  The aim of this study is to collect preliminary data to identify the feasibility and\n           sustainability of an \"active life-style intervention\" in older adults with reduced\n           mobility receiving a preventive home visit from the public health care authority.\n\n        -  This study will represent the base for a larger phase III parallel group study\n           implemented in the public health care setting, with the specific aim of improving\n           physical function and delay the onset of functional impairment in older adults."
