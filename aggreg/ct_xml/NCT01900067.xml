  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigation was designed as an Open-Label, Multicenter, Randomised, Controlled
      Investigation to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of the BARRIER® EasyWarm Active
      Self-Warming Blanket Used for Continuous Active Warming to Prevent General Anaesthesia
      Induced Hypothermia During the Perioperative Surgical Period. Null hypothesis (H0): There is
      no difference between the two study populations (interventional treatment group versus
      control treatment group) regarding the average of core body temperature measurements during
      the perioperative phase.Alternative hypothesis (H1): The average of core body temperature
      measurements during the perioperative phase is significantly higher in the interventional
      group compared to that of the control group.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Gender: Both men and women are included into the study

          2. Subjects' age: Subjects must be at least 18 years old to be included into the study

          3. Type of anaesthesia: Only subjects receiving general anaesthesia are included into
             the study

          4. Type of surgery: Subjects undergoing only the following three types of surgical
             procedures (i.e. inclusive of laparoscopic procedures) are included into the study:

               -  Gynaecological

               -  Orthopaedic

               -  Ear, nose and throat (ENT)
