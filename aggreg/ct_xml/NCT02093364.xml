    <textblock>
      The purpose of this focused registry is to evaluate the clinical implications of the RHP
      position (relative to the articulations) regarding functional and radiographic parameters in
      patients treated with the RHP with a straight and curved stem.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 18 years or older

          -  Use of a short-or long-stemmed DePuy Synthes Radial Head Prosthesis due to any of the
             following indications:

               -  Fresh fracture of the radial head which is not amendable to an adequate

                  Form
