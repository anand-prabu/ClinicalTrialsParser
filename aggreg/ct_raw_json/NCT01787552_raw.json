Dose escalation will be dependent on the available toxicity\n      information (including adverse events that are not DLTs), PK, PD, and efficacy information,\n      as well as the recommendations from the Bayesian Logistic Regression Model (BLRM). In the\n      Phase II part of the study approximately 46 patients will be enrolled: 18 patients will be\n      enrolled into Stage 1, if following an interim analysis the minimum number of responders are\n      observed, 28 additional patients will be enrolled into stage 2. If less than the minimum\n      number of responders are observed in Stage 1 then further enrollment will be halted.\n      Approximately 82 patients will be enrolled in the entire study."
