Prior to enrolling in the study, participants\n      will have a chest X-ray. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive LDMTX or placebo\n      for 24 weeks. Participants will continue taking their antiretroviral (ARV) medications as\n      usual; ARVs will not be provided by the study. At study entry, participants will undergo a\n      medical and medication history, physical examination, blood collection, and adherence\n      assessments.
