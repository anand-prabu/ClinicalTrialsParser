Treatment\n      repeats every 2 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n      Patients with complete surgical resection of disease receive a total of 6 courses of\n      combination chemotherapy.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of oxaliplatin until the maximum tolerated\n      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2\n      of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicity.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-40 patients will be accrued for this study."
