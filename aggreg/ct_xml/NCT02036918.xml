  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate patients with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer
      (mCRPC) undergoing treatment with sipuleucel-T for evidence of treatment-associated immune
      activation in lymph nodes and peripheral blood.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study of mCRPC patients planning to undergo therapy with sipuleucel-T
      immunotherapy.  Consenting patients will be randomized 3:1 between immediate sipuleucel-T
      immunotherapy followed by lymph node biopsy (the post-treatment experimental group) or
      immediate lymph node biopsy followed by sipuleucel-T immunotherapy (the pre-treatment
      control group).  Peripheral blood will be collected before, during, and after treatment with
      sipuleucel-T and evaluated for evidence of sipuleucel-T induced immune activation.  Lymph
      nodes collected at biopsy will also be evaluated for evidence of sipuleucel-T induced immune
      activation.  Patients will be followed for 3 months for safety and 6 months for disease
      progression.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age ≥ 18 years

          2. ECOG performance status 0 or 1

          3. Life expectancy of ≥ 6 months

          4. Minimally-symptomatic or asymptomatic, castrate-resistant metastatic prostate cancer,
             as evidenced by all of the following:

               1. Histologically-confirmed diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the prostate

               2. Evidence of adequate androgen deprivation, as evidence by one of the following:

                    -  Bilateral orchiectomy

                    -  Ongoing LHRH agonist (e.g. leuprolide, goserelin) and serum testosterone
                       &lt;50 ng/dl

                    -  Ongoing LHRH antagonist (e.g. degarelix) and serum testosterone &lt;50 ng/dl

               3. Evidence of prostate cancer resistance to castration, as evidenced by one of the
                  following:

                    -  2 consecutive PSA levels that are ≥ 50% above the PSA nadir achieved on ADT
                       and obtained at least 1 week apart

                    -  CT or MRI based evidence of disease progression (soft tissue or nodal)
                       according to PCWG2 criteria or RECIST 1.1 criteria, or at least 1 new bone
                       scan lesion as compared to the most immediate prior radiologic studies.

               4. Presence of non-visceral metastases on imaging

                  following permissible exceptions:

                    -  Bladder outlet obstruction secondary to locally recurrent prostate cancer

          5. Radiographic evidence of lymphadenopathy, defined as a lymph node greater than 1 cm

          5. Extensive prior surgery/radiation present that would render the biopsy highly complex
             and the risk of intraoperative injury high

          6. Any chronic medical condition requiring daily corticosteroids or other
             immunosuppressants

          7. Solid organ transplantation requiring immunosuppression

          8. Visceral (e.g. lung, liver) metastases

         13. Administration of any investigational therapeutic within 30 days of registration

         14. Any condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude participation
