        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Other than renal impairment, subjects should be in good health as determined by past
             medical history, physical examination, vital signs, electrocardiogram, (except for
             additional inclusion criteria for renal impaired patients).

          -  Subjects must have a BMI between 18 kg/m2 and 34 kg/m2 and weight at least 50 kg and
             no more than 120 kg.

               -  Additional criteria for renal impaired subjects: - Subjects must have stable
                  renal disease without evidence of renal progressive disease defined as moderate
                  renal impairment (eGFR 30-59 mL/min/1.73m2) or severe renal impairment (eGFR
                  15-29 mL/min/1.73m2).

               -  Additional criteria for matched healthy control subjects: - Matched to at least
                  one renal impaired subject by gender, race, age (± 10 years), and weight (±
                  20%).

          -  An estimated GFR as determined by MDRD equation within normal range as determined by
             eGFR ≥ 90 mL/min/1.73m2

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Significant illness, including infections, or hospitalization within the 2 weeks
             prior to dosing, except for the renal impaired subjects who due to their renal
             disease may be affected by significant medical problems which require frequent
             hospitalizations.

          -  Any surgical or medical condition that may significantly alter the absorption,
             distribution, metabolism, or excretion of drugs, or which may jeopardize the subject
             in case of participation in the study

          -  Subject has a medical history of cardiac disease and/or clinically significant ECG
             abnormalities within 6 months prior to screening.

          -  Subject has an active or a history within 6 months prior to screening of clinically
             significant hematologic, endocrinologic, pulmonary, cardiovascular, hepatic, or
             allergic disease, medically documented (other than clinical conditions associated
             with renal impairment for the renal impaired subjects only).

          -  - Additional exclusion criteria for renal impaired subjects: - Severe albuminuria &gt;
             300 mg/day.

          -  Subjects undergoing any method of dialysis.

          -  Subjects with renal impairment due to hepatic disease (hepatorenal syndrome).

          -  Subjects with clinically significant abnormal findings, not consistent with clinical
             disease, upon physical examination, ECG or laboratory evaluation.

          -  Use of any prescription or non-prescription medication that has the potential to
             interact with buparlisib within two weeks prior to dosing or during the study.

          -  - Additional criteria for matched healthy control subjects: - Use of any prescription
             or non-prescription medication or vitamins during 14 days prior to dosing.

        Other protocol-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.
