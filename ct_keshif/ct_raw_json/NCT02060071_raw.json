            "textblock": "Degenerative aortic valve (AV) stenosis (AS) is the most common valvular disease and\n      increases in prevalence with age. Severe aortic valve stenosis accounts for considerable\n      disease and death, especially in older patients. Aortic valve stenosis is the primary\n      indication for valve replacement in western countries, and the number will only increase as\n      elderly people are a growing subpopulation.  Measures to identify AV disease earlier, to\n      identify factors that influence disease progression and treat AV disease pharmacologically\n      or with less invasive approaches would be a significant improvement over the current\n      standard of care. These advances will only be possible with a better understanding the\n      mechanisms underlying valve development and disease. Preliminary data suggest a novel\n      pathophysiological concept for impaired valvular endothelial cells regeneration, leading to\n      the progression of age-associated calcific AV disease and a potential treatment target is\n      the disrupted endothelial cell layer of the valve leaflet.\n\n      The research objectives are:\n\n        1. To assess the number and function of endothelial progenitor cellss and apoptotic\n           endothelial progenitor cellss in patients with mild, moderate and severe aortic\n           stenosis.\n\n        2. To study the association between aortic stenosis progression, severity, symptoms and\n           left ventricular function and the number and function of circulating endothelia\n           progenitor cells. By understanding the correlation between valve severity, left\n           ventricular longitudinal function and endothelial progenitor cells we will indentify\n           high risk patients population that need early intervention. We hope to add new\n           information on the pathogenesis of aortic stenosis and to indentify factors that\n           predict disease progression."
