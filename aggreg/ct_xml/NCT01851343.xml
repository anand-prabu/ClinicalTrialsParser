      Background:

      - Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) are cells that can develop into other tissue types,
      including bone, cartilage, marrow, and blood cells. However, BMSCs  are not    stem cells
          there is no evidence that after infusion into another person that BMSCs change into any
      other cells. Research suggests that BMSCs can travel to different parts of the body and work
      with immune cells to reduce inflammation and help repair damaged tissues. BMSC infusions
      have been used in tests to treat moderate to severe inflammatory bowel disease, like Crohn's
      disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC). These tests have shown some good results, but more
      research is needed to study their safety and effectiveness. Researchers want to see how well
      BMSC infusions work to treat CD and UC. The BMSCs will be collected from volunteer donors.

      Objectives:

      - To look at the safety and effectiveness of BMSC infusions for moderate to severe CD and
      UC.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals between 18 and 65 years old with moderate or severe inflammatory bowel disease
      (CD or UC) that has not responded to standard treatment.

      Design:

        -  Participants will have two screening visits. The first will be 15 to 30 days before the
           first BMSC infusion. The second will be within 14 days of the first BMSC infusion.

        -  At the first screening visit, participants will have a physical exam and medical
           history. They will provide blood, urine, and stool samples. They will also give
           information about their symptoms and quality of life.

        -  At the second screening visit, participants will have their vital signs (like blood
           pressure and heart rate) measured. They will also provide blood samples, and have a
           colonoscopy with biopsies.

        -  During treatment, participants will have one BMSC infusion per week for 4 weeks. Blood
           and urine samples will be collected at each treatment visit.

        -  One week after the last infusion, participants will have a study visit. The tests from
           the first and second screening visits will be repeated.

        -  There will be six follow-up visits at 1, 2, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after the last
           study visit. Participants will repeat the tests from the first screening visit.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Crohn   s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), the 2 major sub-types of inflammatory
      bowel disease (IBD), are chronic, life-long conditions characterized by relapsing
      inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. CD has a predilection for the small bowel and
      the proximal large bowel; however, it can affect the gastrointestinal tract discontinuously
      anywhere. UC mainly affects the distal colon but can involve the entire colon as well. In
      spite of advances in IBD therapeutics, a significant number of patients continue to have
      symptoms while on conventional medications. The current protocol proposes to study infusions
      of allogenic bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) for the treatment of active IBD.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of BMSC infusions in subjects with IBD
      and to examine the host clinical and immunologic response to BMSCs. BMSCs possess
      multi-lineage differentiation potential in bone marrow, and aid in the repair of damaged
      tissue. They suppress the lymphocyte immune response and target sites of inflammation to
      promote healing through tissue regeneration. Studies are underway examining the utility of
      BMSCs to treat several conditions including neurologic disorders, myocardial infarctions,
      rheumatologic disorders, and gastrointestinal disorders including acute
      graft-versus-host-disease and IBD. Progress in the understanding of the cell populations
      involved in the pathogenesis of IBD and the discovery of the potential immunologic and
      regenerative characteristics of BMSCs have created a new potential direction for IBD
      therapy.

      This phase I study will enroll subjects with moderate-to-severe IBD who are refractory to or
      intolerant of standard therapy. Under the guidance of the NIH Bone Marrow Stromal Cell
      Transplantation Center, the Cell Processing Section of the Department of Transfusion
      Medicine at the Clinical Center has developed a procedure for collecting, expanding, and
      cryopreserving clinical grade BMSCs under an FDA Drug Master File. Marrow will be aspirated
      from volunteer donors participating on protocol 10-CC-0053 who have passed the standard
      screening for blood and marrow donors; BMSCs will be expanded in vitro. Since it is not
      necessary to HLA-match BMSC donors with their recipients, a BMSC repository will be used as
      the source of BMSCs for this study.

      In Arm 1, the safety of the BMSC infusion dosage (4 x 106 cells/kg/dose   10%) and schedule
      (once a week for 4 weeks) will be evaluated in 3 non-overlapping IBD subjects. Once safety
      is established in these subjects, subsequent subjects in Arm 2 will be enrolled without
      overlap restriction. Subjects will return to the clinic for safety and response assessments
      at 28, 56, 84, and 112 days after the first infusion. Additional safety visits will be
      performed at 180, 360 and 720 days after the first infusion. Safety will be monitored by a
      Data and Safety Monitoring Board. Response to study drug will be assessed in all patients by
      changes in symptom scores, endoscopic/histologic findings, quality of life scores, and
      immunologic/laboratory parameters. Fifty subjects will be evaluated over a 5-year period.

          3. Have a diagnosis of CD or UC that has been endoscopically or radiographically
             confirmed at least 6 months prior to screening.

          4. Have either active CD symptoms as defined by a CDAI score between 220 and 450,
             inclusive, as measured for 7 consecutive days during screening, or active UC as
             defined by a SCCAI score greater than or equal to 6.

          5. The patient must have failed or was intolerant to standard IBD medications. This is
             defined as the patient either had an inadequate response (i.e., persistence of
             symptoms) or lost response (i.e., recurrence of symptoms) to: 1) either steroids or
             immunomodulators and 2) anti-TNF therapy.

             a. Steroids

             i. Oral prednisone taper that began at a dose of greater than or equal to 40 mg/d (or
             equivalent) with continuous steroid use at any dose for at least 4 weeks.

             ii. Oral budesonide greater than or equal to9 mg/d for at least 4 weeks.

             (e.g., leukopenia, abnormal transaminases, etc.), or (2) allergic reaction (e.g.,
             anaphylaxis, immediate or delayed hypersensitivity reactions, or comparable). In all
             cases, discontinuation of the treatment must have been due to inadequate response or
             intolerance and not due to drug supply considerations.

             Note that potential study subjects may currently be receiving steroids or
             immunomodulators if the dose has been unchanged for the past 4 weeks for steroids or,
             in the case of immunomodulators, the dose has been unchanged for the past 3 months
             for azathioprine, 3 months for 6-mercaptopurine and 2 months for methotrexate.

               2. Two months washout prior to baseline for adalimumab, etanercept, and infliximab.

               3. One month washout prior to baseline for cyclosporine, mycophenolate,

             pimecrolimus, tacrolimus, and any other systemic immunosuppressants.

          3. Pregnant or breastfeeding. Serum pregnancy test must be negative at screening for

             female subjects of childbearing potential. Urine pregnancy test must remain negative

             at each of the four infusion visits.

          4. Has clinically significant systemic infection (e.g., chronic or acute infection,
             urinary tract infection, upper respiratory tract infection) within three months of
             screening and no opportunistic infection within six months of screening. Has a
             history or presence of recurrent or chronic infection (e.g. viral infections
             [including hepatitis B or C, HIV], bacterial infections, systemic fungal infections,
             or syphilis).

          5. Has a positive Quantiferon-TB Gold (QFT-G) test, indicating tuberculosis infection,
             at time of screening. A QFT-G will not be done in a subject who has received
             tuberculosis vaccination; these subjects will be eligible to participate if latent
             tuberculosis can be excluded with a chest x-ray (CXR).

          6. Received an agent not approved by the FDA for marketed use in any indication or any
             small molecule inhibitors (e.g., Naltrexone) within 90 days of beginning the
             screening CDAI diary or at any time during the screening window. This includes
             medications used to treat IBD as an off-label use (at the discretion of the
             investigator).

          7. Has abnormal hematological and biochemical parameters, including:

               1. Neutrophil count &lt; 1500 cells/mm(3).

               2. Hemoglobin &lt; 9 g/dL.

               3. Platelet count less than or equal to150,000 cells/mm(3).

                  anticoagulation medications.

               7. If total bilirubin is greater than 1.2 mg/dL, then direct bilirubin can be no
                  more than 70% of the total, up to a direct bilirubin of 2.0 mg/dL.

          8. Has active infection with enteric pathogens as evidenced by positive microbiological
             culture of stool.

          9. Has active cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. CMV polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
             testing will be performed on biopsies taken during the time of initial colonoscopy in
             order to exclude CMV.

         10. Has a history of low-grade or high-grade colonic mucosal dysplasia.

         11. Has a history of uveitis or iritis within the previous two months. This is due to the
             concern that BMSCs may home to sites of active inflammation.

         12. Had bowel surgery other than perianal (e.g., fistulotomy, seton placement, abscess
             drainage) within 6 months prior to beginning the CDAI screening diary or drawing
             screening blood samples.

         13. Has surgical changes to gut anatomy that preclude administration of clinical activity
             indicies including but not limited to ileostomy, colostomy, or subtotal colectomy
             with ileorectal anastomosis.

         14. Has known or suspected short bowel syndrome.

         15. Requires parenteral or total parenteral nutrition.

             past 5 years.

         17. Unwillingness or inability to comply with study requirements.

         18. Has any medical or psychiatric condition that, in the opinion of the investigator,
             contraindicates participation in this protocol.

         19. Has only small bowel IBD that is inaccessible by standard colonoscopy to obtain
             research biopsies. For this reason patients with only upper gastrointestinal IBD are
             also excluded.

         20. Refuses to abstain from using COX-2 inhibitors or NSAIDs throughout the 4 week study
             drug infusion period.
