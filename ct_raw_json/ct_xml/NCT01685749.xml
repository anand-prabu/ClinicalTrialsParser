  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stingray injuries can be a hazard shared by many types of beachgoers. Stingrays often lie in
      the sand and when stepped on by the unsuspecting beachgoer their tail snaps foreword,
      resulting in a barbed stinger injecting venom into the victim. Little exists in the current
      literature on the natural history of stingray injuries. Most of the existing literature
      looks at the incidence of stings, and to a certain extent the demographic of people who seek
      care. To our knowledge no study has attempted to collect a more inclusive population of
      those people who are stung and follow them prospectively to determine the incidence of
      medical intervention, infection, etc.

      This study aims to describe and quantify the natural history of stingray injuries and to
      better understand their time course and medical requirements. The study setting will be Seal
      Beach, which reports some of the greatest number of annual stingray injuries for any single
      beach on the pacific coast. Participants will be identified by the Seal Beach lifeguards who
      are believed to treat the majority of stingray injuries suffered at the beach. Eligible
      persons will be consented for participation over the phone by research personnel. If
      enrolled in the study they will receive a phone call by research personnel one week and one
      month after the injury that will collect information about the symptoms they have
      experienced and the medical interventions they have received, if any. This study is strictly
      observational in nature and will not involve any interventions on the part of study
      personnel or alter the manner in which or types of medical assessments or treatments.

    <description>This study is descriptive in nature. The primary outcome of this study is the understanding of the natural history of stingray injuries and their treatment. This will be achieved using strictly descriptive statistics of the incidence and duration of particular symptoms, medical evaluations, and treatment. Means, proportions, and confidence intervals of these statistics will be calculated.</description>
