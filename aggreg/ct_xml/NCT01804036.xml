  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine whether Mind-Body Bridging (MBB), a mindfulness training program
      is more effective than a common sleep medication, Zolpidem, in treating insomnia. It will
      also investigate whether MBB is additionally beneficial for co-morbid conditions such as
      stress, PTSD, depression, etc, compared with that of Zolpidem.

    <textblock>
      Sleep disturbance in active duty military personnel is highly prevalent and contributes to
      reduced performance of military duties. Under extreme conditions, army personnel could
      endanger themselves and their comrades. Increasingly, non-pharmacological treatments for
      insomnia are showing promise as complementary and alternative medicine treatments. Many of
      these awareness training programs (ATPs) perform as well as, or even better than,
      medications. This study will determine whether Mind-Body Bridging (MBB), an ATP that teaches
      awareness/mindfulness and cognitive skills, is more effective than a common sleep
      medication, Zolpidem. The study will also determine whether MBB exhibits additional benefits
      in co-morbid mental health conditions, including, stress, PTSD, depression, etc, compared
      with that of Zolpidem. This will offer soldiers additional treatment options for insomnia in
      the hope that it will improve both sleep and other common comorbidities.

    <description>The PCL-M is a well-validated 17-item self-report measure to assess PTSD severity among military personnel; both male and female, to assess military-related PTSD.  Reliability evidence is very good.  Items are based on DSM criteria (DSM-IV criteria for the latest version) and are rated on a 5-point Likert-type scale that allows the derivation of a quantifiable total score.</description>

    <description>The CES-D is one of the most common validated screening tests for helping an individual to determine his or her depression quotient. The 20-item test measures depressive feelings and behaviors during the past week.</description>
