            "textblock": "In patients with advanced ovarian cancer (FIGO stage III-IV), a percentage between 50% and\n      80% had lymph node metastases at diagnosis, mainly in  para-aorto-caval (48 %) and iliac\n      areas (49%). In 1988, FIGO has included lymph node metastasis in stage IIIC, although some\n      authors argue that only node involvement constitutes a clinical course different from IIIC\n      cancer patients with abdominal diffusion.\n\n      Although it has been demonstrated that lymphadenectomy is technically feasible and\n      relatively safe in this subset of patients, however, it is burdened by a certain percentage\n      of complications including limphocyst, lymphedema, hemorrhage, ranging from 6% to 45%. In\n      addition, the actual therapeutic role is still controversial and it is not clear whether\n      this surgical procedure should be part of the staging of these tumors. Retrospective studies\n      have shown a benefit on overall survival in patients with ovarian cancer who underwent\n      lymphadenectomy associated with optimal debulking (residual tumor <1 cm). In a recent\n      publication by SEER is found that the number of lymph nodes removed during surgery for\n      advanced ovarian cancer is an independent prognostic factor.\n\n      In the literature there is only one prospective randomized study on lymphadenectomy in\n      advanced ovarian cancer without node lesions macroscopically observed (bulky nodes) during\n      the first surgery. The authors reported a significant benefit in terms of disease free\n      survival (DFS), but not in terms of overall survival (OS) in patients who underwent\n      systematic lymphadenectomy and who had a residual tumor <1 cm. Patients with intra-abdominal\n      residual tumor <1 cm could theoretically not benefit from a systematic lymphadenectomy since\n      most of lymph node metastases undetectable to  intraoperative assessment are smaller than 1\n      cm.\n\n      About 20% of ovarian cancer patients stage III-IV, however, are not operable at the time of\n      diagnosis because of the spread of the disease. In these cases, the gold standard treatment\n      consists of submitting  the patient to Interval Debulking Surgery (IDS) after neoadjuvant\n      chemotherapy. The prognosis of these patients compared to those who are subjected to primary\n      surgery, with the same residual tumor after surgery, is currently a topic of controversial\n      debate. Recently, a multicenter, randomized EORTC showed no difference in prognosis between\n      primary surgery and Interval Debulking Surgery in a population stratified by residual tumor.\n      There are few retrospective studies that consider  the presence of lymph node metastases in\n      patients undergoing Interval Debulking Surgery: the percentage of lymph node metastases in\n      this subset varies from 37.5% to 75%.\n\n      The purpose of the study is to assess whether systematic pelvic and aortic lymphadenectomy\n      should be part of standard surgical procedures in patients with ovarian cancer who underwent\n      surgery after neoadjuvant chemotherapy with intra-abdominal residual tumor <1 cm.\n\n      All patients candidate for Interval Debulking Surgery which do not present bulky nodes at\n      surgery and which have an intra-abdominal residual tumor <1 cm at the end of the surgery\n      will be enrolled in the study.\n\n      The baseline assessment of patients is to perform general blood tests, CA 125, CT thorax,\n      abdomen, pelvis, anesthetic assessment and, if eligible, the patients will be subjected to\n      the treatment above.\n\n      The enrollment period will last for 2 years until the achieving of 65 patients as the study\n      population. The median follow-up of 6 months for all patients for the primary objectives and\n      a median of 36 months for the secondary objectives."

The lateral boundaries of lymphadenectomy were delineated superficially by the fascia covering the psoas muscle and deeply by the fascia covering the internal obturator and levator ani muscles. Lymph nodes along the external iliac vessels were removed en bloc with those adjacent to the common iliac vessels. Aortic lymphadenectomy dissection began at the aortic bifurcation by removing the superficial intercavoaortic, precaval, and preaortic nodal groups. Lymph nodes located lateral to the vena (i.e., paracaval nodal group) were separated from the vena cava, then removed en bloc. Lymph nodes behind the vena cava are removed if enlarged. Removal of the lateroaortic nodes was performed up to the level of the left renal vein.",
