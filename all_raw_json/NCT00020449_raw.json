Interleukin-12 may kill tumor cells by stopping blood\n      flow to the tumor and by stimulating a person's white blood cells to kill the tumor cells.\n      Combining chemotherapy with interleukin-12 may kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining liposomal doxorubicin with\n      interleukin-12 in treating patients who have AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma."

Beginning concurrently with the initiation of LipoDox,\n      patients also receive interleukin-12 (IL-12) subcutaneously twice weekly (at least 3 days\n      apart) for up to 3 years.\n\n      Patients with refractory disease are transferred to the paclitaxel salvage therapy regimen\n      comprising paclitaxel IV continuously on days 1-4 once every 3 weeks until a major response\n      is achieved. Beginning concurrently with the initiation of paclitaxel salvage therapy,\n      patients also receive IL-12 as above for up to 3 years.\n\n      Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients\n      achieving a complete response may discontinue IL-12 administration. If necessary, IL-12\n      treatment may resume at a later time.\n\n      Patients are followed at 4 weeks.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24-36 patients will be accrued for this study within 2-4\n      years."
