            "textblock": "Musculoskeletal sprain/strain injuries and disorders (MSID) have a major impact on health,\n      quality of life and societal productivity. Early intervention for pain following acute MSIDs\n      may prevent secondary complications of chronic pain, disability, reduced quality of life or\n      lost productivity. The investigators goal is to evaluate the efficacy of a computer-based\n      self-management intervention for reducing pain and improving function in persons treated in\n      on-site physical rehabilitation centers.\n\n      The specific aims are:1) evaluate the efficacy of a computer-based self-management\n      intervention in reducing pain and self-efficacy and  function in high risk MSID patients; 2)\n      determine long term impact during a six month follow-up period; and 3) determine whether\n      reductions of pain and improved function translate into reductions in lost work time days\n      away from work, restricted work days, worker's compensation costs and re-injury rates during\n      the 6 month follow-up.\n\n      Persons with sprain/strain injuries at risk for poor pain control will randomized to either:\n      1) control condition - standard care in the rehabilitation center plus computer exposure or\n      2) standard care plus computer-based self-management pain intervention.  Assessment will be\n      at baseline, treatment completion, 3 and 6 months. The primary outcome measures are\n      self-efficacy, pain and physical/psychosocial functioning and secondary outcome measures are\n      days away from work, restricted work days worker's compensation costs and re-injury rates.\n      The investigation will also provide unique and valuable information regarding patients\n      acceptance and use of computer-based interventions following acute injury.  By establishing\n      the utility and efficacy of computer-based pain management interventions for MSID the\n      investigators have the potential to improve the health and quality of life of persons with\n      injuries, improve productivity and develop new methods for health care delivery."

The two\n      groups are: 1) standard care in the rehabilitation center with control computer exposure\n      (SCCE) and 2) standard care plus computer-based self-management pain (CBSM) intervention.\n      The study will examine the short- and long-term effects of these interventions on pain and\n      physical and psychosocial functioning and productivity (DAW, RWD, WC costs and re-injury) in\n      200 completing patients with strain/sprain MSID. Outcome data will be collected at baseline,\n      after treatment, and at 3 and 6 month follow-up.  All outcome assessments will be\n      administered by computer.\n\n      Pain Management Following Musculoskeletal Injury Study.  The study is comprised of two\n      phases: Phase I Planning/Development and Phase II Intervention.\n\n      During Phase I Planning/Development, the study investigators  1) identified technology\n      partner to aid in computerization of intervention; 2) identified sites for study\n      implementation; 3) developed consent forms and tracking procedures; 4) developed computer\n      based self-management (CBSM) pain intervention; 5) developed computer based educational\n      materials for the control condition; 6) beta tested intervention materials; 7) developed\n      recruitment materials; 8) developed outcome assessment procedures measures.\n\n      During Phase II Intervention, the study investigators will 1)complete IRB review at each of\n      the study sites; 2) train study personnel, and upon approval from each of the IRBs; 3)\n      initiation of study subject recruitment and intervention.  Phase II will begin June 2011 and\n      be completed by June  2013.\n\n      During Phase II a total of 200 patients will be enrolled in the study.\n\n      Control Group Individuals with acute MSID, in the employers with on-site rehabilitation\n      centers, are initially seen by the plant medical office and, if appropriate, referred for\n      rehabilitation services.  Patients are given an initial evaluation by the treating physical\n      or occupational therapist and a treatment plan is implemented.  The typical patient is seen\n      for an average of approximately 9 visits over a four-week period.  However, patients can be\n      seen as long as indicated. SCCE is seen as the appropriate control condition for several\n      reasons.  First, denying patients care is not ethically appropriate.  Second, this is type\n      of rehabilitation and injury education is the care typically received by acute MSID patients\n      and is the current standard of practice. Currently the education is provided in written\n      brochures and handouts. The addition of computer interaction for presenting this education\n      controls for threats related to differential time spent in treatment and the novelty of\n      computer supplement to care. The computer exposure will be administered over 8 sessions\n      during the average 4-week period patients are receiving their standard on-site\n      rehabilitation care.  Patients will come to the center to receive their standard care and\n      then interact with the computer for the 25-30 minute control condition.  The primary goal of\n      this condition is to provide a control for computer exposure. Briefly, the first session\n      will concentrate on establishing the patient's ability to interact with the computer. The\n      materials will provide general education regarding the injury and methods for preventing\n      re-injury.  This condition will not provide teaching and practice of specific pain\n      management and coping management skills.  This control computer education activity will\n      equalize the computer exposure of the two groups and the duration of time devoted to injury\n      care.\n\n      Intervention Group:  Will receive the same medical care and physical therapy treatment as\n      the control group. In addition the computer-based self-management program (CBSM)\n      intervention will be administered over 8 sessions during the average 4 week period patients\n      are receiving their standard on-site rehabilitation care.  Patients will come to the center\n      to receive their standard care and then interact with the computer for the 25-30 minute CBSM\n      intervention.  The primary goals of treatment include developing skills for managing acute\n      injury and related pain including:  reducing fear avoidance beliefs and catastrophizing,\n      improving mood, increasing perceptions of control and self-efficacy, maintaining activity\n      and reducing pain. The intervention materials are based on the investigators work in the a\n      self-management program for persons with limb loss and those shown effective in other\n      secondary prevention studies in MSID, specifically the Pain Disability Prevention Program\n      (PDPP) develop by Sullivan.  While the PDPP has been evaluated on persons who have been out\n      of work for six weeks or more and this study targets individuals who are more recently\n      injured, the content of the intervention is appropriate for the study population. Each\n      session focuses on specific topics and sets of skills. Skills are presented and modeled by\n      computer-based video during sessions, audio will be used to explain models and teach skills\n      such as relaxation training. This will supplement any written materials and minimize the\n      need for reading. Patients are instructed to practice and apply skills between sessions.\n      Patients will also be given specific feedback about their progress in working through the\n      CBSM modules. As all CBSM takes place within the on-site rehabilitation center, staff are\n      available to provide assistance if necessary.  The sessions initially focus on pain, which\n      is a primary motivator to the patient, expand the focus to cognitive and emotional factors\n      related to pain and disability and finally move to increasing activity. A home activity will\n      be assigned at completion of the session. The home activity will be printed out for the\n      patient to take home and will be available to the participant through the study website from\n      remote locations. The study intervention and home activities will be refined using focus\n      group and pilot testing methods."
