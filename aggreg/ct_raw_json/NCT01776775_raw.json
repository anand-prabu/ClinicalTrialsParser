            "textblock": "Postoperative seroma formation is one of the most common complications after ventral hernia\n      repair with mesh. Although some seromas may not have clinical impact postoperative seroma\n      formation often causes pain and discomfort and may even compromise wound healing. Abdominal\n      binders (also called trusses, girdle, ostomy belt, longuette or abdominal belt) (AB) are\n      commonly used in abdominal and plastic surgery to prevent seroma formation and diminish pain\n      and discomfort after operation. The primary aim of the present study is to investigate the\n      effect of postoperative abdominal binders after laparoscopic incisional hernia repair on\n      postoperative pain, discomfort and quality of life. Secondary, we register seroma formation.\n      A randomized, controlled, investigator-blinded study supplemented with blinded statistical\n      analysis. We include 60 (2x30) incisional hernia repairs. Patients are randomized either to\n      abdominal binder or no abdominal binder (controls). The abdominal binder is worn from\n      immediately after the operation and continuously for 7 days and nights. All patients have a\n      standardized operation with standardized intra- and postoperative medication regimen.\n      Endpoints measurements are clinically detectable seroma formation scored with seroma\n      classification system bu\u00fd S. Morales-Conde, pain scored with self-registrations with VAS,\n      and quality of life scored with EQ-5D, recurrence and other complications are also\n      registered. Patients are followed until 90 days after the operation."
