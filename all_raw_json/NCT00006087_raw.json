Determine the efficacy of a lung cancer risk assessment questionnaire\n      combined with spirometry testing in identifying a statistically significant number of\n      persons with high-risk behaviors for the development of lung cancer. II. Determine the\n      sensitivity of these screening techniques in identifying a population at high risk for the\n      development of lung cancer. III. Determine the number of patients necessary to screen in\n      order to identify the high-risk population eligible for this study. IV. Determine the lead\n      time bias of CT scans versus chest x-rays in these patients. V. Determine the efficacy of\n      spiral CT scanning of the chest in detecting early lung cancers not visible on chest x-rays\n      in patients at high risk for lung cancer. VI. Compare annual spiral CT scanning versus\n      annual chest x-rays in detecting lung cancer in these patients. VII. Compare survival and\n      fatality in these patients with these detection methods.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to one of two screening arms. Arm I: Patients receive\n      routine medical care, an annual nursing assessment, and an annual chest x-ray. Any new\n      abnormality identified is further evaluated through standard acceptable medical\n      interventions. Arm II: Patients receive routine medical care, an annual nursing assessment,\n      and an annual spiral CT scan of the chest. If an abnormal mass greater than 10 mm in\n      diameter or 5-10 mm in diameter and highly suspicious for malignancy is detected, chest\n      x-ray and tissue diagnosis is obtained. If the abnormal mass is 10 mm or less in diameter, a\n      thin section high resolution image of the mass is obtained. If this image is normal or\n      benign, annual spiral CT scanning is continued. If the image is indeterminate, a repeat high\n      resolution scan is performed in 3 months. If the image is unchanged at 3 months, annual\n      spiral CT scanning is continued. If the mass is larger at 3 months, chest x-ray and tissue\n      diagnosis is performed. Screening continues for 5 years in the absence of disease detection.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A minimum of 1,000 patients (500 per screening arm) will be accrued for\n      this study."
