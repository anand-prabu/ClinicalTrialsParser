Choices will include treadmill, stationary\n      bike, game bike, or ambulating at varying intensities throughout hospital; Balance\n      Activities: Standing on bosu ball while performing UE activity (throwing, catching with\n      another ball, Frisbee, etc.).  Standing on one leg or B LE's will be determined by patients\n      currently level.\n\n      If Day 1 is a Tuesday or Thursday, day 2 will constitute: 5-10 minutes of aerobic activity\n      at warm up level (11-13 on Borg, and 4-6 on PCERT)x resistance training for UE:  biceps,\n      triceps, lattisimus, rhomboids/mid-trap, thoracic expansion exercises, and other muscles\n      based on patient needs; resistance training for LE: quadriceps, hamstrings, gluteals\n      (especially maximus and medius), and other muscles depending on patient need, core and\n      abdominal strengthening, Stretches for flexibility depending on the patients individual\n      needs: Thoracic expansion stretches will be done with every pt. supine and sidelying.\n      Stretches are held for 10 seconds and repeated 10 times, Hamstring stretches will be\n      performed if pt unable to reach line with sit and reach test."
