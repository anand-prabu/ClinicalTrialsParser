  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that treatment with a new recently launched
      6-monthly injection of hormone therapy is as good and as safe as the standard 3-monthly
      hormone therapy injections available for treating prostate cancer. The study will also aim
      to answer whether both doctors and patients would prefer treatment with a 6-monthly
      injection rather than injections every 3 months.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must give written (personally signed and dated) informed consent before
             completing any study related procedure.

          -  Patients must be 18 years old or over.

          -  Patients must have a documented diagnosis of locally advanced or metastatic prostate
             cancer suitable for hormonal treatment

          -  Patients must be medically castrated with serum testosterone ≤ 0.5ng/mL

          -  Patients must have received at least two injections of a 3- monthly LHRH agonist by
             the time of the screening tests

          -  Patients must be stable on a 3-monthly LHRH agonist injection with stable PSA levels
             between screening and baseline (i.e. the baseline value must either be lower or less
             than 25% higher than the Screening value or if ≥25% higher, ≤0.5ng/mL higher than the
             screening value).

        In addition:

          -  For patients with locally advanced prostate cancer (M0), LHRH agonist injection (any
             formulation) must have been initiated within the last 3 years from Baseline,

          -  For patients with metastatic prostate cancer (M+) and a Gleason score

             ≤ 7, LHRH agonist injection (any formulation) must have been initiated within the
             last 2 years from Baseline,

          -  For patients with metastatic prostate cancer (M+) and a Gleason score &gt; 7, LHRH
             agonist injection (any formulation) must have been initiated within the last 12
             months from Baseline.

          -  Patients must have an estimated life expectancy of at least twelve months according
             to the investigator's assessment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients will not be included in the study if:

          -  Patients have had previous surgical castration.

          -  Patients are, in the opinion of the investigator, unable to comply fully with the
             protocol and the study instructions.

          -  Patients have received investigational drug(s) or treatment(s) within 30 days prior
             to study entry or will require a concurrent treatment with any other experimental
             drugs or treatments.

          -  Patients have had a diagnosis of any other cancer without a history of
             stability/remission within five years of screening, with the exception of
             non-metastatic basal cell carcinoma.

          -  Patients currently taking additional anti-androgen therapy as part of an active
             hormonal control therapy.

          -  Patients scheduled to receive palliative radiotherapy during the course of the study.

          -  Patients receiving an LHRH agonist as neo-adjuvant to radiotherapy or adjuvant to
             radiotherapy.

          -  Patients receiving LHRH agonist as adjuvant to surgery.

          -  Patients scheduled to undergo radical prostatectomy during the course of the study.

          -  Patients with known hypersensitivity to LHRH agonists, their analogues or any or any
             other component of the products to be administered.
