    <textblock>
      Among non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome patients submitted to early invasive
      strategy and randomized for the transfemoral or transradial approach, the AngioSeal vascular
      closure device would decrease the prevalence of vascular complications at puncture site,
      reaching the non-inferiority criterion when compared to the radial access.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Antithrombotic therapy and percutaneous or surgical myocardial revascularization procedures
      are the basis of the treatment of patients admitted with non-ST-segment elevation acute
      coronary syndrome. However, the desired reduction of the recurrence of ischemic events has
      as complication an increased incidence of bleeding. Since arterial puncture followed by the
      insertion of an introducer has become the standard method to perform invasive cardiovascular
      procedures, complications related to vascular access have become an important bleeding site.

      Among the strategies to decrease vascular complications, the transradial approach is a well
      stablished alternative to the transfemoral approach. For its part, vascular closure devices
      were introduced to decrease vascular complications, homeostasis time and ambulation time of
      patients submitted to invasive procedures by the transfemoral access. Rapidly incorporated
      to the clinical practice, such devices to date have shown conflicting results with regard to
      their safety and efficacy. The inconsistency of data proving its safety limits its routine
      adoption as strategy to prevent vascular complications, requiring evidences through
      adequately designed randomized studies for this end.

    <description>Both transradial and transfemoral coronary angiography will be performed by the Judkins technique using arterial introducers with 6 French diameter and pre-molded catheters for selective catheterization of left and right coronary arteries.Percutaneous coronary intervention will be indicated when a culprit lesion is identified, with stenosis diameter severity ≥ 70%, with high probability of angiographic success, being ideally performed immediately after coronary angiography and left ventriculography. Patients with multiarterial coronary disease will be submitted to percutaneous coronary intervention after agreement among cardiologist, interventional cardiologist and thoracic surgeon. Procedures will be performed according to recommendations and provisions of current guidelines.</description>
