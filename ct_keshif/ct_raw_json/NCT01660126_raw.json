            "textblock": "Subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) is a common condition (818%)among older men and women.\n      Although by definition SCH comprises biochemically mild thyroid hormone deficiency without\n      overt symptoms, it is a possible contributor to multiple problems in older age. Thyroid\n      hormone has effects on numerous physiological systems, including the vascular tree, heart,\n      skeletal muscle and brain. Therefore, thyroxine substitution to overcome thyroid hormone\n      deficiency has the potential to give multisystem benefits to older people with SCH.\n\n      Small studies have reported reduced atherosclerosis and improved heart function with\n      thyroxine replacement, but no large clinical trials have been performed. Therefore the\n      available evidence is limited, leading to major variations in guidelines and clinical\n      practice, with uncertainty regarding the indications for screening and treatment. The\n      investigators propose a multicentre randomised placebo controlled trial to assess the impact\n      of thyroxine replacement in 3,000 older adults with persisting SCH(excluding those in whom\n      it is a temporary phenomenon who are unlikely to benefit). The investigators will include\n      older men and women with a wide age range and of varying health status. Outcomes include\n      cardiovascular events, health related quality of life, muscle strength and executive\n      cognitive function over 3 years of follow up. Blood and urine samples will be stored in a\n      biobank, to allow future research on causes of ill health in older people with SCH.\n\n      The investigators have the support of patient advocacy groups and a consortium with the wide\n      range of expertise and experience required to conduct large scale multicentre clinical\n      trials. The proposal explores the multisystem and quality of life benefits to older people\n      of a tailored approach to management of SCH.\n\n      This clinical trial should definitively clarify whether thyroxine treatment for SCH provides\n      benefits that are relevant for patients. This trial will provide strong evidence with the\n      potential to improve clinical practice, reduce health care costs and promote healthy ageing\n      of older adults."
