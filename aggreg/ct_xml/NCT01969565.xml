The study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of carfilzomib in combination with dexamethasone. Carfilzomib will be administered at a dose of 20 mg/m2, with a dose escalation to 36 mg/m2 after Days 1 and 2 of Cycle 1 in level 1; and at a dose of 20 mg/m2, with a dose escalation to 45 mg/m2 after Days 1 and 2 of Cycle 1 in level 2 in subjects with multwill be given as a fixed dose of 20 mg PO/IV (1, 2, 8, 9, 15, 16, 22, and 23) for cycles 1 to 4 and for subsequent cycles.iple myeloma who are newly diagnosed and treatment naïve.
