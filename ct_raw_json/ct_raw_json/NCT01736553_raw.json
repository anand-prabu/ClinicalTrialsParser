The study is still enrolling eligible infants with SMA.\n\n      Aim 1. To establish the validity of putative physiological SMA biomarkers in the immediate\n      postnatal period. A longitudinal, natural history examination of physiological markers of\n      muscle innervation will be performed in healthy and SMA infants.  The first week of life is\n      the ideal first time point, with visits occurring at scheduled visits up to the age two.\n      Compound motor action potential (CMAP) amplitude and electrical impedance myography (EIM)\n      will be examined and will be correlated with motor function. Each of these is associated\n      with muscle innervation and provides information on the number and function of lower motor\n      neurons in the spinal cord, the cellular target of SMA therapeutic interventions. This trial\n      will establish the natural history of these putative SMA biomarkers as the disease evolves\n      in affected infants. Moreover, our approach will allow for measurements in pre-symptomatic\n      and early symptomatic subjects and determine their predictive value.\n\n      Aim 2. To establish the validity of putative molecular SMA biomarkers in the immediate\n      postnatal period.SMN2 copy number is a valid, predictive molecular SMA biomarker; however,\n      it is fixed, and therefore not useful as a biomarker of clinical progression or response to\n      therapy. SMN mRNA and protein expression is variable in different cell types and, in mice,\n      naturally decreases with age postnatally. In this study, SMN expression levels will be\n      measured longitudinally in SMA patients and controls. Additional putative molecular SMA\n      markers that have been identified to correlate with motor function will be determined in an\n      effort to distinguish between predictive markers that change prior to development of\n      weakness and those that change as a consequence of weakness."

However, it has undergone independent safety testing by Intertek and has been used in more than 200 individuals, including 92 pediatric subjects ages 3-12, without any adverse events (AEs). EIM non-invasively measures the impedance of skeletal muscle. We anticipate that EIM will thus likely be able to assist in quantifying the severity of the disease affecting various muscle groups as well as in measuring changes in the disease over time.

In the AIMS, the impact of neurological components on motor development is reflected by a sequence of motor skills, which are used as the basis of assessment. (Piper, Darrah et al. 1994).  The scale follows the principles of dynamical systems because motor skills are tested by observing infants as they move into and out of 4 positions: prone, supine, sitting, and standing.
