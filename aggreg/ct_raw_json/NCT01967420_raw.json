            "textblock": "A first episode of psychosis is defined as the first experience of positive symptoms, such\n      as hallucinations and delusions, and the behaviour that accompanies it. This is associated\n      with problems in many areas of cognition\u037e the ability to acquire knowledge and\n      understanding. These cognitive symptoms have been found to have a large impact on daily\n      functioning (e.g. accessing education or employment and maintaining relationships) and\n      cannot effectively be treated with medication. Cognitive remediation (CR) is a therapy that\n      aims to improve cognition and, through generalisation of this, improve daily functioning and\n      quality of life. Although it is an area of deficit, social cognition, the ability to\n      perceive and understand emotional states, is often not targeted in cognitive remediation.\n      However, interventions which have focused on providing social cognition training (SCT)\n      alongside CR have shown large improvements in daily functioning.\n\n      This study aims to look at the effectiveness of a combination of CR and SCT to improve\n      cognition and functioning when compared to CR alone. The target population will be those who\n      are experiencing their first episode of psychosis. Participants will be recruited from an\n      Early Intervention in Psychosis service which is an NHS service set up to provide rapid\n      treatment for those experiencing psychosis.\n\n      Participants will take part in a ten week CR or CR+SCT intervention which will consist of\n      spending 90 minutes a week in a small group setting working through a series of computer\n      games which aim to improve cognition. Interviews and questionnaires regarding daily\n      functioning, cognition, quality of life and symptoms will be used before and after the\n      intervention. Participants will be asked to attend follow-up interviews 6 months after the\n      intervention has ended to complete the measures again to see if any beneficial effects have\n      lasted."
