Unlike local caregivers, distance caregivers often receive little, if any,\n      professional support and have limited communication with the oncology team. Using a\n      computer-based communication intervention to allow distance caregivers the opportunity to\n      participate in a physician visit, have questions and concerns addressed, and meet members of\n      the oncology team may help reduce stress."

What is the relationship of primary stressors (type and stage/grade of cancer, and\n      patient quality of life [QOL]) and structural factors/stressors (age, gender, race, and\n      education) with patient and caregiver psychological outcomes at baseline? II. What are the\n      effects of the Communication with Long Distance Caregivers Offering a Supportive Electronic\n      Resource (CLOSER) intervention on distance caregiver psychological outcomes (anxiety and\n      distress), controlling for primary stressors (type and stage/grade of cancer, and patient\n      quality of life), distance caregiver structural factors/stressors (caregiver age, gender,\n      race, and employment), and baseline anxiety and distress? III. What are the effects of the\n      CLOSER intervention on patient psychological outcomes (anxiety and distress), controlling\n      for primary stressors (type and stage/grade of cancer, and patient quality of life),\n      distance caregiver structural factors/stressors (caregiver age, gender, race, and\n      employment), and baseline anxiety and distress? IV. What is the feasibility (time, cost,\n      resources and acceptability to patients, caregivers and clinicians) of using Adobe Connect,\n      a computer-based web communication system, with the distance caregiver, the parent with\n      advanced cancer, and the health care providers together in a routine follow-up oncology\n      office visit? V. What is the experience of being a distance caregiver participating in the\n      CLOSER intervention?\n\n      OUTLINE: Participants are assigned to 1 of 2 arms.\n\n      ARM I: Participants receive usual care for 5 weeks. During the week 5 office visit, distance\n      caregivers are not present.\n\n      ARM II: Participants receive usual care for 5 weeks. During the week 5 visit, distance\n      caregivers virtually attend using the CLOSER intervention with computer video and audio\n      connection.\n\n      After completion of study, participants are followed up within 48-96 hours."
