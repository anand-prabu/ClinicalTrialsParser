One vial (100 MU) of BoNTA will be reconstituted with 2.0\n      mL of 0.9% sterile saline solution.  Similarly, one vial (100 MU) of BTXCo will be\n      reconstituted with 2.0 mL of 0.9% sterile saline solution.  2.5 units of the respective\n      neurotoxin will be administered to three sites in the crow's feet area on each side (7.5\n      units total for one side), 2.5 units to two locations of the forehead on each side (5 units\n      total for one side), and 5.0 units to two locations in the glabella on each side(10 units\n      total for one side).  The duration of the study will be 4 months.  The followup visits after\n      the initial injections will be at 3 days, 2 weeks, 3 months, and 4 months after the initial\n      treatment.  At each of these visits, standardized digital photographs of the treated facial\n      area will be taken.  Both static and dynamic photos will be taken of each region.  At the\n      conclusion of the study, three independent raters will individually perform blind\n      assessments of the photographs according to the Validated Assessment Scaled for the Upper\n      Face published by Flynn et al 2012."
