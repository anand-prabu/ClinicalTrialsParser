This study will\n      investigate the effectiveness of adding either Behavioral Activation or Supportive Therapy\n      to the standard acute psychiatric inpatient care. Subjects with different psychiatric\n      diagnoses and elevated depressive symptoms are assessed and randomized after admission.\n      Therapists from the nearest outpatient facility initiate 12 sessions of Behavioral\n      Activation or Supportive Therapy as soon as possible. The 12 sessions are delivered twice\n      weekly at the inpatient unit or at the outpatient facility, depending on whether the patient\n      is admitted or discharged. Treatment as usual interventions(medications, nursing etc.) are\n      not manipulated in the study. The main assessment points are pre-, post, 6 months follow-up\n      and 12 months follow-up. The main outcome measure and some process measures are also\n      administered at session 3, 6 and 9."
