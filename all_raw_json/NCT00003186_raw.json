Confirm that injection of isosulfan blue into the mucosa or serosa\n      immediately adjacent to a colorectal cancer results in the lymphatic transport of that agent\n      initially to a specific regional lymph node that can readily be identified on visual\n      inspection, dissected, and histologically evaluated for the presence or absence of\n      metastatic disease.\n\n      OUTLINE: All patients receive an injection of isosulfan blue into peritumor serosa upon\n      intraoperative identification of the primary tumor, prior to mesenteric mobilization. If\n      colonoscopy is otherwise indicated, the injection may be delivered to the peritumor mucosa\n      via colonoscopy during the case. The mesentery adjacent to the injection is inspected and\n      the lymphatic pattern and nodes demonstrated by the isosulfan blue are diagrammed and\n      photographed. The sentinel node(s) are surgically dissected and evaluated. If needed, a\n      second injection of isosulfan blue may be given. Prior to mobilization of liver for\n      resection of metastases, isosulfan blue is injected subcapsularly around the metastatic\n      lesion.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: There will be 10 patients accrued into this study."
