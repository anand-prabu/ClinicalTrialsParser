    <description>The visual assessment evaluates seven clinical signs: erythema, edema, wheal vesiculation, ulceration, hemorrhage, purpura, and crusting.  Each sign is assigned a score of 0 to 3, where a score of 0 is associated with no expression of the clinical sign and a better outcome, and a score of 3 is associated with severe expression of the clinical sign and a worse outcome.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and female subjects between 18 and 89 years old.

          -  Have at least a total of 10 non-hypertrophic actinic keratoses (AKs) on the face and
             scalp

          -  The subjects are in good health

          -  The subjects have the willingness and the ability to understand and provide informed
             consent for the use of their tissue and are able to communicate with the investigator

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects under 18 years of age and over the age of 89

          -  Subjects who are pregnant or lactating

          -  Subjects with sensitivity to cold

          -  Subjects with use of topical medications such as corticosteroids, alpha-hydroxyacids
             or retinoids 2 weeks before study entry

          -  Subjects who received previous treatment of target AKs

          -  Subjects whose target treatment area was within 5 cm of an incompletely healed wound
             or within 10 cm of a suspected basal-cell or squamous-cell carcinoma

          -  Subjects with use of medications or other treatments that could interfere with
             evaluation of the treatment area within 2 months before study entry (e.g., topical
             medications, artificial tanners, immunosuppressive medications, immunomodulating
             agents, cytotoxic drugs, ultraviolet B phototherapy, other therapies for actinic
             keratoses, or oral retinoids)
