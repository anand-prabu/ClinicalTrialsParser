The French Association of Urology\n      does not recommend at this time for lack of evidence deemed sufficient.\n\n      For foreign companies Urology (EAU , AUA) , the use of calcium channel blockers or alpha\n      blockers in the treatment of symptomatic lower ureteral stones (4 to 10mm ) is recommended\n      (grade 1A) .
