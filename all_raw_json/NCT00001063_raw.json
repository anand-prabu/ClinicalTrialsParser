To compare the safety of d4T/AZT.

It is reasonably assumed that the benefit of an antiretroviral agent in terms of\n      delaying clinical disease progression is directly related to its ability to achieve and\n      sustain viral suppression; thus, this study measures effects on viral load and CD4 count."
