  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well ixazomib works in treating patients with relapsed or
      refractory acute myeloid leukemia. Ixazomib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking
      some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the best response including complete remission (CR), CR with incomplete
      recovery (CRi), and partial remission (PR) after 3 cycles of treatment with MLN9708
      (ixazomib) in patients with nucleophosmin (NPM)1-mutated acute myeloid leukemia (AML)
      (following the LeukemiaNet1 guidelines for response criteria).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the duration of remission in all responders after treatment with MLN9708
      defined as the time of documented remission until relapse.

      II. To determine the 1 year overall survival, which will be measured from time of study
      entry to the earlier of death from any cause or end of follow up at 1 year.

      III. To establish toxicity and tolerability of MLN9708 treatment in AML, including
      non-hematologic toxicities grade 3 or above as specified by Common Terminology Criteria for
      Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive ixazomib orally (PO) on days 1, 4, 8, and 11. Treatment repeats every 21
      days for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
