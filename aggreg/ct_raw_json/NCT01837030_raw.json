            "textblock": "Although the American Gastroenterological Association suggests that patients with obscure GI\n      bleeding undergo a capsule endoscopy after a negative esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and\n      colonoscopy, current recommendations from the British Society of Gastroenterology argue that\n      unless there is an inadequate response to iron therapy, further imaging of the small bowel\n      is probably not necessary.  Several studies have demonstrated that this approach is\n      reasonably safe.  Furthermore, Laine et al demonstrated that when patients with obscure GI\n      bleeding were randomized to either capsule endoscopy or dedicated small bowel contrast\n      radiography, the rates of further bleeding, measured by subsequent hospitalization and blood\n      transfusion events, were similar between the two groups. No study has randomized patients\n      with obscure GI bleeding to receive capsule endoscopy vs. conservative therapy with oral\n      iron.\n\n      This study is a single center prospective randomized control trial comparing the utility of\n      performing capsule endoscopy compared to conservative management with oral iron therapy as\n      the initial course of action in patients with non-severe obscure occult or obscure overt\n      gastrointestinal bleeding. All patients will be recruited in the G.I. clinic, the endoscopy\n      unit, or during inpatient consults after negative upper endoscopy and colonoscopy. The study\n      will be explained to patients who qualify at that time. During this visit, patients will be\n      questioned with regard to lower or upper G.I. symptoms, including abdominal pain, dyspepsia,\n      nausea, vomiting, weight loss, diarrhea, change in stool character, melena and intermittent\n      hematochezia.  All patients will be started on standard dose oral iron therapy after\n      informed consent.  If the patient is already taking iron supplements, their dose with be\n      adjusted to the standard regimen after informed consent.  Patients will then be randomized\n      to undergo capsule endoscopy or not. For patients randomized to undergo capsule endoscopy,\n      all subsequent evaluation and treatment will be determined by capsule findings (i.e. capsule\n      directed management) and standard of care at our institution.\n\n      Patients will be followed for 1 year.  Follow up lab draws will occur at 1, 3, 6 and 12\n      months.  They will consist of a complete blood count (CBC) and ferritin and can be performed\n      at either the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) or an outside facility or office.\n      If performed outside of MUSC, a standard medical records release form will be utilized to\n      obtain the lab information.  Patients will be provided with a paper card indicating their\n      date of enrollment in the study.   This card will be kept by the patient for the entire 12\n      month follow up period and will be collected at the end of the follow up period.  The card\n      will have an area where the patient can write the date of their first blood transfusion\n      after enrollment.  There will also be numerical checkboxes that the patient will check off\n      for each unit of packed red blood cells (RBCs) they receive during the 12 month follow up\n      period.  Telephone calls will be made to each patient every 3 months after enrollment to\n      inquire about hospitalizations and bleeding related procedures (including endoscopy,\n      capsule, small bowel radiology, interventional radiology and surgery).  Records of these\n      hospitalizations and procedures will be obtained using a standard medical records release\n      form."
