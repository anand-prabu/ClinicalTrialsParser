            "textblock": "Women seeking emergency contraception (EC) frequently report multiple recent episodes of\n      unprotected sex.  Although high sensitivity urine pregnancy tests effectively rule-out\n      pregnancy resulting from sex that occurred more than 14 days ago, clinicians are frequently\n      concerned that pregnancy may result from unprotected sex that occurred <14 days prior to IUD\n      placement. Placement of a copper IUD within 5 days of unprotected sex is a highly effective\n      form of EC.  Among 52 Chinese women who reported unprotected intercourse 5-7 days prior to\n      copper IUD insertion, no pregnancies occurred. However, the effectiveness of the copper IUD\n      when unprotected sex occurs 7-14 days prior to IUD placement is unknown. Intrauterine\n      pregnancies rarely occur with a copper IUD in place. As some clinicians are concerned about\n      injuring a pregnancy that occurs with an IUD in place, women who have had unprotected sex\n      7-14 days prior to requesting IUD placement are typically told they must use another, less\n      effective, contraceptive for 2+ weeks and then return to obtain an IUD. To remove this\n      barrier to emergency placement of a copper IUD, we propose to study rates of pregnancy when\n      a copper IUD is placed \"any time a urine pregnancy test is negative.\" We believe that\n      simplifying guidance regarding the recommended timing of copper IUD placement has the\n      potential to significantly increase the number of women offered \"same-day\" IUD service."
