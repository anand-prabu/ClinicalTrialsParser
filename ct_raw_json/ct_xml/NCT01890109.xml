  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, stratified, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study in
      female subjects with HFs associated with menopause. This study will evaluate the efficacy of
      AMG 334 as measured by reduction from baseline in the frequency and severity of daily HFs at
      weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16 after a single dose of AMG 334.

      This is a randomized, stratified, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study in
      female subjects with HFs associated with menopause. This study will evaluate the efficacy of
      AMG 334 as measured by reduction from baseline in the frequency and severity of daily HFs at
      weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16 after a single dose of AMG 334.

      Study Phase: 1b

      Primary Objective:

      To evaluate the frequency of moderate to severe daily HFs at week 4 after a single dose of
      AMG 334 in female subjects with HFs associated with menopause.

      Secondary Objectives:

      To evaluate changes in the severity of daily HFs at week 4 after a single dose of AMG 334 in
      female subjects with moderate to severe HFs associated with menopause.

      To evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of AMG 334 in female subjects with
      HFs associated with menopause

      To characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of AMG 334 after a single subcutaneous (SC)
      dose in female subjects with HFs associated with menopause

      Hypotheses:

      This study will test the hypothesis that the vasodilation associated with capsaicin-induced
      dermal blood flow (DBF) provides a good model for the vasodilation associated with HFs;
      therefore AMG 334 doses that cause DBF inhibition will be safe and well tolerated, and will
      be effective in the reduction of the frequency and/or severity of HFs.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  female subjects with hot flashes associated with menopause between 45 and 65 years of
             age, inclusive, with no history or evidence of clinically relevant medical disorders
             as determined by the investigator in consultation with the Amgen physician.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History or evidence of clinically significant disorder (including psychiatric),
             condition or disease that, in the opinion of the Investigator or Amgen physician
             would pose a risk to subject safety or interfere with the study evaluation,
             procedures, or completion.
