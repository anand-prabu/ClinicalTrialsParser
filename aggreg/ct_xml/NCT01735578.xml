    <textblock>
      Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is the most common gastrointestinal emergency encountered in
      the newborn intensive care unit and represents a significant cause of morbidity and
      mortality in infants born prematurely.  Among possible risk factors, a strong association
      between elective RBC transfusions in premature infants with anemia and the subsequent
      development of NEC has been consistently observed (6-11).  However, a significant (and
      increasing) number of VLBW infants with anemia are managed with erythropoiesis stimulating
      agents (such as Epo) and iron and do not receive RBC transfusions during their hospital
      stay. The present study proposes to study this particular group of VLBW infants that remain
      with low (&lt;28 %) hematocrit while receiving full enteral feedings.

      The investigators hypothesize that significant anemia in VLBW infants will be associated
      with a baseline low cerebro-splanchnic oxygenation ratio (CSOR) (&lt;0.75) as measured by NIRS,
      and that nasogastric feedings (NGF) in those particular patients will lead to further
      decreased splanchnic oxygenation. The investigators further postulate that CSOR values will
      be significantly lower among VLBW that develop NEC as compared to infants that do not.

    <textblock>
      Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is the most common gastrointestinal emergency encountered in
      the newborn intensive care unit and represents a significant cause of morbidity and
      mortality in infants born prematurely.  This disease complicates the management of
      approximately 6 - 10% of very low birthweight (VLBW) infants and can result in significant
      feeding intolerance, intestinal perforation and/or death despite aggressive treatment (1).
      The sequence of events leading to NEC appears to be multifactorial and complex (2,3).  While
      epidemiologic studies have identified multiple factors that appear to increase an infant's
      risk for the development of NEC, other than prematurity, no single predictive risk factor
      has been clearly delineated (4,5).

      Among possible risk factors, a strong association between elective RBC transfusions in
      premature infants with anemia and the subsequent development of NEC has been consistently
      observed (6-11).  Possible explanations for transfusion-associated NEC have been proposed:
      1) the physiological impact of anemia that can initiate a cascade of events leading to
      ischemic-hypoxemic mucosal gut injury predisposing to NEC (10); 2) increased splanchnic
      blood flow following RBC transfusion leading to reperfusion injury of gut mucosa.

      A significant (and increasing) number of VLBW infants with anemia are managed with
      erythropoiesis stimulating agents (such as Epo) and iron and do not receive RBC transfusions
      during their hospital stay. The present study proposes to study this particular group of
      VLBW infants that remain with low (&lt;28 %) hematocrit while receiving full enteral feedings.

      Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) is a non-invasive, FDA approved, bedside technology that
      allows determination of regional oxygen saturations (rSO2) in tissues such as the gut
      mesentery. Using NIRS, the oxygenation status of hemoglobin in tissues located 2-4 cm below
      the skin can be determined and recorded continuously (12). For instance, Dave et al. used
      NIRS to demonstrate that splanchnic rSO2, but not cerebral rSO2, increases after feeds in
      the stable prematurely born infant tolerating full bolus orogastric feedings (13). Of
      importance, the average hematocrit in this study group was 37% (±7) and therefore these
      babies had no significant anemia.

      While no normative values exist for mesenteric rSO2 in premature infants, recent studies
      have explored NIRS use in determining gut hypoxia and ischemia (14). Abdominal NIRS was used
      to detect alterations of intestinal rSO2 and perfusion in premature piglets that developed
      NEC (15).  In a prospective cohort study of 40 neonates with medical or surgical acute
      intraabdominal pathology, a cerebro-splanchnic oxygenation ratio (CSOR) of less than 0.75
      predicted gut ischemia with 90% sensitivity (16).

      While these studies support a role for NIRS monitoring of mesenteric rSO2, it is not clear
      whether 1) VLBW with significant anemia have perturbations in intestinal oxygenation and
      perfusion, and 2) alterations in mesenteric rSO2 predict the development of NEC in VLBW
      infants.

      We hypothesize that significant anemia in VLBW infants will be associated with a baseline
      low CSOR (&lt;0.75) as measured by NIRS, and that nasogastric feedings (NGF) in those
      particular patients will lead to further decreased splanchnic oxygenation. We further
      postulate that CSOR values will be significantly lower among VLBW that develop NEC as
      compared to infants that do not.
