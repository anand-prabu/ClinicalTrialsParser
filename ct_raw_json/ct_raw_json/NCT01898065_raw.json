This\n      strategy is particularly suitable for prostate cancer where tumor hypoxia plays a major role\n      in the resistance of these tumors to radiation.\n\n      In order to develop intratumoral hypoxia targeting by radiotherapy dose-painting areas, we\n      should characterize changes in hypoxia before treatment and during radiotherapy.\n\n        -  If hypoxia does not change during radiotherapy, radiotherapy dose-painting strategy by\n           an \"integrated\" boost is performed.\n\n        -  If hypoxia varied (increasing or incomplete regression), a \"final\" boost strategy of\n           radiotherapy dose-painting(IMRT, stereotactic brachytherapy or high dose rate) after a\n           first fractionated IMRT could be considered.\n\n      This study should show that PET imaging with fluoromisonidazole (18F-MISO) is an available\n      tool to physicians in assessing tumor hypoxia."
