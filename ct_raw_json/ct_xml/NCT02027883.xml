  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As the indications for ICD implantation expand, minimizing implant time is critical.  Also,
      patients receiving biventricular ICDs are sometimes more unstable and minimization of
      sedation time is crucial.  Multiple induction attempts, with a 1-Joule shock, can cause
      disruption in lead position.  Therefore limiting the number of attempts will allow for
      better lead stability throughout the procedure and a more straightforward implant process.

      Investigator proposes a detailed documentation of success rates from various VF induction
      methods during implant of Medtronic defibrillation capable devices.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our clinical experience has found that attempts to induce patients receiving ICDs at implant
      using the nominal Medtronic T-shock settings are not always effective at inducing
      ventricular fibrillation.  When this results, a change to the parameters for T-shock is made
      before reattempting to induce ventricular fibrillation in patients undergoing ICD
      implantation.

      Another available induction method is 50 Hz Burst.  &quot;The 50 Hz Burst induction is designed
      to induce VF by delivering a rapid burst of pacing pulses. The amplitude and pulse width of
      these pulses are selectable, but the pacing interval is fixed at 20 ms.&quot;2    If multiple
      attempts using the T-shock method are unsuccessful, 50 Hz Burst provides an additional
      method for inducing ventricular fibrillation.  It is a less desirable method since it can
      result in very fine VF that is difficult to identify the initiation of possibly resulting in
      longer times in VF causing higher defibrillation threshold or in undersensing due to the
      fine nature of the rhythm.

      T-shock has been found to be a fast and reliable method for inducing ventricular
      fibrillation in ICD implants.   Greater success of inducing ventricular fibrillation using
      the T-shock method has been found when the energy of the T-shock was higher and the coupling
      interval was shorter.   In addition, increasing the shock strength increases the window of
      vulnerability.   For the T-shock method to be most efficient, initial success at inducing
      ventricular fibrillation, and therefore a reduced number of attempts, is important.  This
      requires a better understanding of the optimal programmed settings for the initial T-shock
      induction attempt.

      Moreover, in recent years, ICD indications have grown to include primary prevention
      patients.  These patients may have different vulnerable periods than patients previously
      evaluated to develop Medtronic nominal settings.

      Our clinical experience has found that the nominal T-shock settings are only effective at
      inducing ventricular fibrillation approximately seventy-five percent of the time.  However,
      a detailed collection of success rates has not been performed.
