(Phase I of the study closed to accrual\n           as of 09/19/2003).\n\n        -  Determine the toxic effects of this drug in these patients.\n\n        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in patients receiving EIAEDs.\n\n        -  Determine the efficacy of this drug in terms of 6-month progression-free survival of\n           these patients.\n\n        -  Determine the safety profile of the phase II dose of this drug in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study. Patients are stratified according to\n      concurrent enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (EIAEDs) (yes vs no) and disease type (for\n      phase II only) (benign meningioma vs malignant meningioma vs hemangiopericytoma vs\n      glioblastoma vs other anaplastic glioma). (Phase I closed to accrual as of 09/19/2003).\n\n      Patients receive oral gefitinib once daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the\n      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients (who are receiving EIAEDs) receive escalating doses of gefitinib\n      until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose\n      preceding that at which at least 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting\n      toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed at 2 weeks.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A minimum of 30 patients will be accrued for the phase I portion of this\n      study within 10 months . (Phase I closed to accrual as of 09/19/2003). A total of 48\n      patients will be accrued for the phase II portion of this study within 6-8 months."
