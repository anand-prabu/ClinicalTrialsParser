  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The increasing prevalence of overweight and obesity among the population contributes to
      increased incidences of chronic metabolic diseases. Healthcare costs related to these
      diseases are rising; prevention or delay of onset of disorders associated with overweight is
      needed. Food ingestion exerts a transient suppressive effect on appetite and further food
      intake by releasing gastrointestinal hormones. Proteins have been shown to be more satiating
      than carbohydrates and fat. Intraduodenal administration (via a naso-duodenal intubation) of
      pea protein has been shown to reduce food intake and increase satiety hormone levels in
      humans, in contrast to orally dosed (unprotected) pea protein. In the present study we aim
      to investigate the effects of human gastric fluid on the degradability of five different
      protected pea protein products. Further, in an ex vivo experiment on freshly obtained human
      duodenum tissue applying Ussing chamber technology; we aim to investigate the intestinal
      satiety hormone release by the five different prototypes. The prototype that is less
      degraded by human gastric fluid and is most effective in intestinal satiety hormone release
      will be used in a future clinical trial.

    <description>First, in vitro digestion will be conducted for the gastro-resistent protein in order to calculate the degree of hydrolysis of food proteins by o-phthaldialdehyde method (OPA). First, OPA solution and serine standard solution will be prepared. Samples are analyzed after the in vitro digestion. Measurements are made on 96 well microplates, each sample is analyzed twice. The absorbance is measured on spectrophotometer. The degree of hydrolysis corresponds to the amount of amino groups released during enzymatic digestion.</description>
