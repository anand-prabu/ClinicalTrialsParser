Anesthesia is maintained with volatile agents (sevoflurane, desflurane) and reinjection of rocuronium and sufentanil as needed.\nRobotic assisted laparoscopic interventions are realised with Da Vinci surgical robot, known to assure a minimally invasive approach with good results in urologic surgery. The system consists of an ergonomic surgeon console, a patient cart with four interactive robotic arms, a 3D high resolution visualization interface and specific EndoWrist articulated tools."

The diagnostic of subclinical alteration of kidney function is possible with the novel biomarkers, such as neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin (NGAL). Modified NGAL values can be detected in patients urine and serum  at 6 hours from the renal injury.\nIn our study, we assessed the renal function  by determining basal creatinine and follow the creatinine values 4 days postoperative. Acute kidney injury (AKI)is defined as a 0.3 mg/ml rise in serum creatinine from baseline, according to the AKIN criteria.\nNGAL is measured (with ELISA technique) at 6 hours and 12 hours from the induction of the anesthesia.\nThe incidence of AKI will be compared in the different anesthesia techniques for robot assisted urogenital laparoscopic surgery.",
