            "textblock": "Psychotherapeutic agents are often administered without sufficient testing to children and\n      adolescents, often on a long-term basis, to reduce aggression. Many pressures, including\n      managed care, will increase the utilization of pharmacotherapy in the outpatient setting to\n      treat serious problems. Lithium is the most promising agent for the treatment of aggression\n      in children and adolescents. However, it has not been shown that lithium is an effective\n      treatment for these patients in the outpatient (non-hospital) setting, or on a long-term\n      basis. The purpose of this study is to examine the long-term effects of lithium used to\n      treat children and adolescents with aggressive conduct disorder (severe aggression).\n\n      The proposed study is a two-phased clinical trial of lithium for the treatment of aggression\n      in conduct disorder. Both phases are double-blind and placebo-controlled with randomization\n      and employ a parallel groups design. Phase 1 contains a short-term 8-week controlled trial,\n      with twice as many subjects randomized to lithium as placebo, increasing the pool of\n      potential lithium responders to continue to Phase 2.  In Phase 2, lithium responders from\n      Phase 1 enter a 6-month long-term controlled trial.  Every attempt is made to define\n      responders to lithium."
