Up to 60 subjects (ages 6-17 yrs) will be randomized to receive either ganaxolone or\n      placebo for 6 weeks and then cross over to the opposite treatment for another 6 weeks. The\n      aim of the study is assess the safety, tolerability and efficacy of ganaxolone for treatment\n      of anxiety and attention in subjects with FXS. The hypothesis is that ganaxolone treatment\n      compared to placebo will improve anxiety and attention as measured by the several\n      neuropsychological and psychometric tests."

The primary aim of the\n      study is to assess efficacy of ganaxolone treatment compared to placebo on clinical\n      behaviors such as anxiety and attention as measured by Clinician's Global\n      Impression-Improvement (CGI-I). The key secondary efficacy measure is the Pediatric Anxiety\n      Scale (PARS). Other secondary efficacy measures include the visual analog scale (VAS),\n      Anxiety, Depression, Attention, and Mood Scale (ADAMS), Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham-IV\n      Questionnaire (SNAP-IV), and Aberrant Behavior Checklist- Community Edition (ABC-C).\n      Tolerability and safety will be monitored by routine vital signs, physical/neurological\n      exams, ECGs, clinical laboratory and adverse event assessments."
