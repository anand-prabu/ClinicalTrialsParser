It is now known, persistent infection with an oncogenic\n      Human papillomavirus (HPV) type is a necessary precursor of cervical cancer and evidence is\n      showing HPV testing is a potential, safe and effective alternative to cytology testing (The\n      Pap smear). This study is evaluating the feasibility and acceptance of HPV self-collection\n      vs. VIA in a cohort of women from Kisenyi, Uganda."
