  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a diagnostic study that makes pictures of organs of the
      body using magnetic field and radio frequency pulses that can not be felt. The purpose of
      this study is to determine if a new imaging method can help tumor evaluation in the brain.
      The extra images will be obtained using Diffusion Kurtosis Imaging (DKI) to assess early
      treatment response in patients with brain metastasis, and will be compared to methods
      currently being used.
