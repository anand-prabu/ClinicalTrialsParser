  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bevacizumab has been found to prolong progression free survival in first line, and more
      recently, in second line treatment for platinum sensitive ovarian cancer patients who had
      not received prior treatment with bevacizumab.

      Recently reported data suggest that patients with colon cancer who receive bevacizumab in
      more than one line of therapy (beyond progression) have better results. In ovarian cancer,
      the role of bevacizumab administered in both first and second-line therapies needs to be
      defined.

      This study aims to evaluate whether administering bevacizumab in combination with
      chemotherapy in second-line therapy to patients with recurrent ovarian cancer who have
      received first-line bevacizumab will be more effective than chemotherapy alone.
