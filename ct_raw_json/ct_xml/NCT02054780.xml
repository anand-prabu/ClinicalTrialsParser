      The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of two types of counseling,
      Psychosocial Counseling and Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, in addressing
      outcomes of orphans and vulnerable children including mental and behavioral health,
      well-being, social support, and HIV risk behaviors. The study will be conducted in Lusaka,
      Zambia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of TF-CBT compared to PC
      in improving a range of OVC outcomes including HIV risk behaviors but also mediating factors
      which constitute important outcomes - well-being, mental health, functioning, and caregiver
      health and support. The study design also includes measurement of the impact of factors that
      may moderate effects - age, gender, religion, ethnicity, HIV knowledge and attitudes,
      education, and physical health. This is an effectiveness trial in that the interventions
      will be provided by MoH and organizations already providing services to OVC.

      Assessments: Study instruments will be administered using an Audio Computer Assisted
      Self-Interviewing (ACASI) system developed by Tufts University. The Tufts ACASI system
      allows the responder control to navigate and answer sensitive questions privately and
      discreetly. It was developed using Macromedia Authorware (v7.0) and can be programmed in any
      language by having a native speaker record the screen text. The Tufts ACASI system offers
      both live interview and data entry modes and can deliver a variety of question types,
      including yes/no, single-answer multiple choice (select one answer), and multiple-answer
      multiple choice (select all that apply) questions which allow numeric keypad entry, as well
      as scale questions which allow the user to click on a point along a scale, and text entry
      for interviewer-administered, open-ended questions

      Procedure: In the first part of this study, the research staff will ask Home Based Care
      Workers (HBCWs) of the Archdiocese of Lusaka (our partnering organization) to introduce the
      study to families under their care. This visit can take place during the regularly scheduled
      home visits conducted by the HBCWs. Research staff will ask the HBCWs to use a recruitment
      script to introduce the study to both the adolescent and his/her caretaker. If the
      adolescent and/or caretaker are not interested in hearing more about the study, their
      information will not be passed on to study staff and we will have no contact with that
      family. If, however, the adolescent and caretaker indicate to the HBCW that they are
      interested in hearing more about the study, the HBCW will note their interest and schedule a
      follow-up appointment in which they will return to the home with one of our study assessors.

      Each of the study assessors (interviewers; 4-10) will then go with an HBCW to the families'
      homes that indicated interest in the study. The assessors will present the consent forms,
      and if the caregiver and child respond yes to the consent, they will administer the
      screener. This screener will be scored immediately and if the child is determined eligible
      for the study, the assessor will ask if they are able to complete the full assessment
      battery at this time (approximately 2 hours) or if they would like to schedule a separate
      time to complete this. If a separate time/date is preferred, the assessor will schedule that
      with the family. Most assessors should be able to complete the screening and assessment
      procedures for all 3-7 families expected from each HBCW in one week.  If a particular HBCW
      has a high number of families (&gt;=9) under their care who are interested, then an additional
      week of assessments may be necessary.  The HBCW will not be present during the consent or
      assessment process.

      The assessor will conduct the adult consent and caretaker permission process with the
      caretaker first.  Consent and permission will be obtained at this time for all parts of the
      study-- screening, interview using ACASI, and intervention. In all cases, the caretaker will
      have to provide consent to participate in the interview and intervention for him/herself and
      will also have to provide permission for the adolescent to participate in the screening,
      interview, and intervention. For these cases, in the response section the assessor will
      indicate if the caretaker consents to participate in each of the sections
      (screening/interview and intervention) separately and gives permission for their adolescent
      to participate in each of the 3 sections (screener, interview and intervention) separately.

      If the adolescent is found to be eligible after the screening interview (through the results
      of either the adolescent screening, caretaker screening, or both), then the assessor will
      allocate a sequential study number to the adolescent. At this time, the assessor will ask
      the adolescent and caregiver if they are able to complete the assessment battery at this
      time, or if they prefer to set up another day/time to complete it. When the baseline is
      designated to be completed, the assessor will set up two notebook computers for the baseline
      interview: one for the adolescent and one for the caretaker. The adolescent and caretaker
      will complete the interview simultaneously but separately (in separate rooms), with the
      assessor not present but close by in case of problems or questions. On completion of the
      baseline interview the assessor will let the family know that someone from their nearest MoH
      clinic will contact them. The results will be tabulated and checked at the main office, with
      the locally based project director allocating group assignments (based on a pre-determined
      random sequence number order sent by U.S. based PIs), and assigning counselors to families.
      Both interventions will be available at all study sites. Neither assessor, caretaker, nor
      adolescent will know which intervention the adolescent will receive.

      This study will also enroll adolescents who do not have a primary caretaker or who live in
      child headed households.  In these situations the person that is the caretaker has to
      declare that he/she is the principal caregiver or they have been charged with the
      responsibility of making sure the adolescent receives care. For any child headed households
      or street youth, the ministry of community and social welfare should be contacted.  In these
      cases the ministry usually has the adolescent themselves consent before they could be
      involved.

      At the end of each day all assessors will report the allocated study IDs to the on-site
      Study Director, who will send them to the PIs who retain the confidential master list
      linking study IDs to interventions based on random assignment (see below). She will respond
      with the allocations for those study IDs. These data will be used to inform the clinics
      which intervention each new participant will receive prior to their first visit.

      Whether or not an adolescent agrees to join the study s/he will have access to other
      services under the Archdiocese of Lusaka.  These services include Psychosocial Counseling,
      Home Based Care services, medical and education support, VCT, Community Sensitization
      Campaigns, Behavioral Change, livelihood support, TB care, awareness programs on
      communicable diseases. The adolescent will also have access to the HIV prevention strategies
      available at the MoH clinics including, VCT, counseling, safe sex interventions and primary
      care services. For those in the study, we will monitor utilization of these services and
      include that information as a variable in the analysis, to determine their effects as
      potential moderators of treatment effects.

      The adolescent will either go to a MoH clinic or a different, pre-identified community
      center for their first appointment with their counselor to receive either TF-CBT or PC.
      Later sessions will either be at the clinic or at another location that the counselor and
      family agree on, and locations can vary from week to week if necessary and feasible. The
      caretaker will also participate in these sessions (if they have consented to participate in
      the study along with the adolescent). Because the Archdiocese of Lusaka sites are deeply
      embedded into the community, other neighborhood structures—such as churches—may be used as
      meeting points.

      Follow-up Assessments with both adolescent and caretaker will be done at 0 and 6 months
      after completion of the interventions. If one treatment shows substantially greater efficacy
      at 6 months it will be offered to those that received the other intervention and the 12
      month assessment will be done only with the group originally allocated to the more effective
      intervention.

      We expect to have 3-4 study contacts with research participants and their caregivers:

        1. Baseline interview

        2. Follow-up at 0 months

        3. Follow-up interview at 6 months

        4. Follow-up interview at 12 months.

    <description>The curriculum &quot;Psychosocial Care and Counseling&quot; (PC) was developed for HIV Infected Children and Adolescents. The goal is to enable health care providers to provide safe supportive counseling and support services to HIV infected youth and their families. The course materials are designed to be adapted to different cultures and needs. The 14 modules cover child development, family systems, communicating with children, disclosure and adherence and legal/ethical issues. The course teaches basic counseling skills with children such as listening and play. It explores and challenges barriers to care such as caregivers' fear and reluctance to disclose an HIV positive diagnosis to a child, discussing adolescent sexuality, and practical issues such as inadequate legislation governing child rights. The curriculum was adapted for Zambia and endorsed by the MoH.  PC is considered an &quot;enhanced&quot; model of a Psychosocial Support program for OVC.</description>

    <description>We propose using TF-CBT to address stress related problems (SRP) and reduce HIV risk behaviors. Given evidence on the link between abuse/trauma and elevated HIV risk, researchers have called for more overlap between evidence-based MH treatments like TF-CBT and HIV prevention programs. Recent trials have provided direct evidence that CBT may be effective in HIV prevention.  TF-CBT has eight components including: Psychoeducation, Relaxation, Affective Modulation, Cognitive Coping, Trauma Narrative, In-vivo Exposure (if needed), Conjoint parent-child session, and Enhancing Safety Skills. This cognitive behavioral therapy teaches skills such as how to think about situations differently in order to feel better. It also includes helping a child face the fear and anxiety of the traumatic situations, rather than avoid them. Based on earlier pilot projects, the MoH has endorsed TF-CBT in Zambia.</description>

    <description>We propose using TF-CBT to address stress related problems (SRP) and reduce HIV risk behaviors. The rationale is that OVC lack behavioral and cognitive skills and intention necessary to use the available information and resources to prevent HIV. For example, internalizing problems (e.g., depression, anxiety) are related to HIV risk through low self-efficacy, poor assertiveness skills, and reduced ability to negotiate safe sex. Given evidence on the link between abuse/trauma and elevated HIV risk, researchers have called for more overlap between evidence-based MH treatments like TF-CBT and HIV prevention programs.  Some studies have found that skills-oriented interventions reduced HIV-risk behaviors among minority and troubled youths. An intervention study using CBT increased condom use and decreased high-risk sexual behaviors among runaway youths in a short-term follow-up evaluation. However, these studies were done in Western countries; their relevance to OVC in Africa is unproven.</description>
