The major cause of vision loss in this disease is due to the\n      development of choroidal neovascular membrane formation (CNVM).  Several clinical trials\n      have proven that eyes with \"well-defined\" CNVM or lesions that can be readily demarcated\n      with fluorescein angiography can be successfully treated with laser photocoagulation.\n      However, up to 87% of eyes present with \"ill-defined\" CNVM or lesions that cannot be well\n      demarcated on fluorescein angiography and are not amenable to laser photocoagulation.  No\n      beneficial treatment for this form of choroidal neovascularization has been established.\n\n      Histopathologic study has demonstrated the presence of inflammatory and reparative responses\n      in the retina of patients with ill-defined choroidal neovascularization.  Since\n      corticosteroids have been shown to downregulate many of the cellular factors involved in\n      both inflammation and repair, the present study is designed to assess the ability of\n      corticosteroid injection around the eye to prevent severe vision loss associated with\n      \"ill-defined\" choroidal neovascularization in the setting of age-related macular\n      degeneration.  The study will be organized as a randomized open label control clinical trial\n      involving 2 phases.  Phase 1 involving 40 patients will establish the feasibility and safety\n      of this treatment modality.  Phase 2 will place emphasis on efficacy of the study."
