      A randomized, controlled, parallel group design will be used to test whether a Secondhand
      Smoke Exposure program initiated in the hospital and completed in the home using
      motivational interviewing plus motivational incentives (MI+) is more effective than
      Conventional Care (CC) with  Neonatal Incentives Care Unit Infants' parents.
