Subjects\n      in this study will undergo an 8-week double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Subjects will\n      be regular cannabis-users who are not currently seeking treatment for cannabis dependence.\n      Subjects will participate in each of 8 conditions, lasting 5 weekdays each (an ABACADAE\n      study design); four smoke as usual conditions (SAU) and four cannabis abstinence conditions.\n       During each abstinence condition (B, C, D, E conditions), subjects will be allocated to one\n      conditions including self-titration of placebo, fixed dose of placebo, self-titration of\n      SATIVEX (up to a max of 40 sprays per day, equal to 108mg THC) or fixed dose of SATIVEX (40\n      sprays per day).  Each medication phase will be followed by a washout period where\n      individuals will be requested to smoke cannabis as usual (A condition). The experimental\n      conditions will be: type of SATIVEX\u00ae spray used (active vs placebo), and titration regimen\n      (fixed or self-titrated). This pilot study will allow us to demonstrate the feasibility of\n      our approach and to determine the sample size to use secondarily for a larger study. Our\n      ultimate goal is to determine optimal conditions to use for a subsequent randomized\n      controlled trial assessing the efficacy of SATIVEX\u00ae in treatment of Cannabis dependence\n      among treatment-seeking subjects."
