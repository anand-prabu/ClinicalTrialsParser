As there is no \"gold standard\" FOT-device, each setup\n      will be compared to all other setups.\n\n      Secondary study questions are: 1) is there a specific comfort (or discomfort) associated\n      with the different measuring devices 2) Guidelines state that full chin and cheek support\n      should be applied when measuring the human respiratory impedance. What is the influence of a\n      partial cheek support?"
