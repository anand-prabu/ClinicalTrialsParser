            "textblock": "With the advent of effective antiretroviral treatment for HIV has come a marked increase in\n      the number of persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA), with the highest prevalence since the\n      epidemic began of more than 1.2 million. While PLWHA survive longer, they also experience\n      increased burdens of chronic conditions related to lifestyle factors, treatment side\n      effects, and age. PLWHA are a population at great risk for high symptom burden, impaired\n      coping and social functioning, decreased quality of life, and inadequate end-of-life care.\n      The remarkable shift in attitudes towards HIV, from an inevitably fatal disease to a chronic\n      condition, has been accompanied by a lessening emphasis on symptom management and\n      end-of-life planning. However, while mortality from AIDS-defining conditions has decreased,\n      PLWHA continue to have unaddressed needs for coordinated care, symptom management and\n      proactive advance care planning.  Palliative care, focused on comprehensive management of\n      physical, psychological, social, and spiritual needs of persons with incurable, progressive\n      illnesses, is a health service uniquely designed to meet these needs. This research project\n      will test a model of early palliative care for PLWHA at high risk of mortality and\n      morbidity. First, focus group methods will be used to explore views of PLWHA regarding their\n      needs for symptom management and social support, and attitudes towards advance care planning\n      and end-of-life concerns. We will then conduct a randomized trial of a novel HIV Navigation\n      Program, which will be a modification of an existing navigation program that uses trained\n      and experienced volunteers as a core component, offered by a large, comprehensive hospice\n      and palliative care organization. The specific aims of this study are 1) to identify needs\n      and preferences for palliative care and advance care planning of PLWHA, in order to tailor\n      an existing Patient Navigation Program to the specific needs of PLWHA with chronic\n      conditions; and 2) to test the effect of an HIV Patient Navigation Program intervention on\n      outcomes of quality of life, symptom burden, coping ability, and advance care planning; and\n      3) to determine if effectiveness of the HIV Navigation Program intervention differs by age,\n      gender, ethnicity, education, income level, and level of palliative care service need.\n      Because of the increasing prevalence of HIV coexisting with chronic conditions, there is an\n      urgent need to assess palliative care needs and preferences of PLWHA and design effective\n      interventions. This interdisciplinary study will test, at the community level, a novel\n      health service designed to meet the unique needs of chronically ill PLWHA, and improve and\n      support advance care planning. Results from this study will increase understanding of who\n      are PLWHA at highest risk for need of palliative services and provide a model for providing\n      early palliative care support for PLWHA."
