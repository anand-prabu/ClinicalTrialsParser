The\n      investigator's previous study showed that safflower oil reduced trunk fat mass in women with\n      diabetes.  The investigators believe safflower oil can also attenuate criteria of metabolic\n      syndrome through reduction in trunk fat mass."

The rationale for conducting this research study is that there are few effective\n      strategies that target changes in body composition and metabolism as a means to attenuate\n      metabolic syndrome.  The investigators plan to test the central hypothesis and accomplish\n      the overall objective of this research by pursuing the following three specific aims.\n\n      Specific Aim 1:  Quantify the extent that linoleic acid reduces trunk adipose mass in women\n      with metabolic syndrome.\n\n      Specific Aim 2:  Measure changes in visceral adipose tissue\n\n      Specific Aim 3:  Determine the time-dependent effect of linoleic acid to increase\n      adiponectin levels."
