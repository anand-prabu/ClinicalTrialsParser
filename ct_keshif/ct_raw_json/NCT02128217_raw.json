The name of this new drug is sofosbuvir (SOF), and it will replace\n      pegylated-interferon alfa (PEG-IFN, a drug given as a weekly injection under the skin). SOF\n      will be given in combination with ribavirin (RBV), a drug approved by the Food and Drug\n      Administration (FDA).   All participants in this study will be monitored while on treatment\n      at weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12. All participants will be evaluated for a sustained virologic\n      response (SVR) (undetectable HCV RNA levels) 1, 2, 4, and 8 (for the 8-week regimen) or 12\n      (for the 12-week regimen) weeks after starting study treatment.
