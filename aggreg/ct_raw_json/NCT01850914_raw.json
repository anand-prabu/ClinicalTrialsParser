The overall objective of this work is to describe cardio- and cerebrovascular risk\n      factors and vascular disease in shunted INPH-patients compared to an age- and sex matched\n      elderly population, as well as the impact of vascular risk factors and vascular co-morbidity\n      on clinical symptoms and outcome of surgery in INPH-patients. The hypothesis is that\n      INPH-patients have a higher level of vascular risk factors and subclinical organ damage than\n      a normal elderly population, and that the higher the level of existing vascular risk\n      factors, the more severe the symptoms of the hydrocephalic disease."
