The patient is ambulatory, community-dwelling male or non-pregnant female and is aged\n             between 18 and 70 years at the Screening Visit. Lactating females must agree not to\n             breastfeed.\n\n          3. Sexually active female patients of childbearing potential must agree to use one of\n             the following methods of birth control from the date they sign the ICF until the\n             conclusion of the trial:\n\n             a. Hormonal contraception (i.e. oral contraceptive, contraceptive implant, or\n             injectable hormonal contraceptive) b. Double-barrier birth control (e.g. condom plus\n             intrauterine device, diaphragm plus spermicide) c. Surgical sterilization (i.e.\n             bilateral oophorectomy, hysterectomy, or tubal ligation) d. Maintenance if a\n             monogamous relationship with a male partner who has been surgically sterilized by\n             vasectomy\n\n          4. Females of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test at the\n             Randomization Visit (first study treatment visit) prior to dosing.\n\n          5. Patient has no clinically significant findings on a physical examination, 12-lead\n             electrocardiogram (ECG) and clinical laboratory tests (clinical chemistry panel,\n             complete blood count [CBC], urinalysis [UA]) after signing the ICF but before\n             receiving the first dose of study drug. (Note: The Investigator will determine if a\n             particular finding is clinically significant. In making this determination, the\n             investigator will consider whether the particular finding could prevent the patient\n             from performing any of the protocol-specified assessments, could represent a\n             condition that would exclude the patient from the trial, could represent a safety\n             concern if the patient participates in the trial, or could confound the\n             trial-specified assessments of safety or efficacy.)\n\n          6. Patient is fluent in English.\n\n          7. Are considered eligible according to the following TB screening criteria:\n\n             \u2022 Have no history of latent or active TB prior to screening. An exception is made for\n             patients with a history of latent TB and documentation of having completed\n             appropriate treatment for latent TB within 3 years prior to the first administration\n             of study agent. Appropriate documentation to verify that there had been treatment\n             with a antituberculous treatment must be established prior to study participation.\n\n             \u2022 Have no signs or symptoms suggestive of active TB upon medical history and/or\n             physical examination.\n\n             \u2022 Have no recent close contact with a person with active TB.\n\n             \u2022 Subject has a negative purified protein derivative test within 30 days prior to the\n             first dose. Tuberculin skin tests should be considered positive when they have\n             greater than or equal to 5 mm of induration at 48 to 72 hours after test is placed.\n             Subjects with a positive tuberculin skin test (if less than or equal to 14 mm of\n             induration) are allowed if they have a history of Bacillus Calmette-Guerin\n             vaccination with a negative Quantiferon test in the past year, no symptoms per\n             tuberculosis workup, and a negative chest X-ray.\n\n          8. Be able to adhere to the required study visit schedule and comply with noted protocol\n             requirements.\n\n          9. Subject has established ileal, ileo-colonic, or colonic Crohn's disease for a minimum\n             of 3 months.\n\n         10. Subject has moderately to severely active Crohn's disease, as defined by a Crohn's\n             Disease Activity Index (CDAI) score from 225 to 450 at screening and baseline and\n             must also have an SES score that falls under the auspice of moderate to moderately\n             severe disease (10-15).\n\n         11. Subject has evidence of active inflammation, as demonstrated by any of the following:\n\n               -  Elevated C reactive protein (CRP)  at screening (>2.87 mg/L, or upper limit of\n                  normal (ULN) as set by local laboratory)\n\n               -  Endoscopic evidence of inflammation during the screening period or within 8\n                  weeks prior to the screening period\n\n         12. Subjects are allowed to continue on concurrent treatment with the following agents:\n\n               -  5-aminosalicylates, if stable dosage for at least 2 weeks prior to screening\n                  (same dosage to be maintained throughout the trial)\n\n               -  Probiotics, provided that the dose has been stable for the 2 weeks prior to\n                  enrollment\n\n               -  Antidiarrheals (eg, loperamide, Imodium) for control of chronic diarrhea; as per\n                  standard CDAI protocols, the use of antidiarrheals will be assessed at each\n                  visit.\n\n        Additional eligibility information\n\n        SES-CD The subject has a diagnosis of active moderate to severe CD at screening with these\n        specific findings: the presence of large ulcerations (0.5cm is the minimal diameter in\n        size to be categorized as large - this also constitutes between 2-3 points on the SES-CD\n        score), the extent of ulcerated surface (the minimal percentage has got to be at least 10%\n        - this also constitutes between 2-3 points on the SES-CD score), the extent of the\n        affected surface (50% is the minimal percentage to fall in the moderate category - would\n        constitute between 2-3 points on the SES-CD score) and finally the presence and type of\n        narrowing found (number of strictures found and if the colonoscope can be passed or cannot\n        be passed - this also constitutes between 2-3 points on the SES-CD score). The minimal\n        score will be between 10 and 15.  The local endoscopist (investigator) will determine\n        whether subjects meet the entrance criteria from the SES scoring perspective. An appendix\n        will be attached to define in a table the simple endoscopic scoring for Crohn's Disease\n        (Appendix 1).\n\n        CDAI Crohn's Disease Activity Index scoring: this consists of eight variables including\n        five subject reported outcomes. Variables 1,2,3,4 and 5 will be obtained from the\n        patient's diary (see table 2a, subject diary, under Appendix 2, Crohn's Disease Activity\n        Index Variables) completed by the patient during the 7 days prior to each CDAI evaluation.\n        The Standard Height and Weight Table (Table 2b) must be used to calculate variable 8. The\n        score from each variable is weighted by applying the multiplier shown. The total CDAI\n        score is then determined by calculating the sum of the individual, weighted scores. A\n        minimum score of 225 points is required and cannot exceed 450.  These are the two primary\n        criteria for entry that have to do with the study outcomes proposed.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          1. The patient has any condition, including clinically significant abnormalities on\n             Screening laboratory test and/or medical history found during Screening assessments,\n             or any acute or chronic condition, that, in the opinion of the investigator,\n             constitutes a risk for the patient or a contraindication for participation in and\n             completion of the study, or could interfere with study objectives, conduct, or\n             evaluations (such as unstable diabetes mellitus, thyroid disease, vascular disease,\n             end-stage coronary disease, pulmonary disease, liver disease, renal disease and any\n             metabolic disorders that are also uncontrolled).\n\n          2. The patient has major surgery scheduled during the study period.\n\n          3. The patient has a history of cancer, except for adequately treated basal cell\n             carcinoma of the skin, cervical dysplasia, or carcinoma in situ of the skin or the\n             cervix.\n\n          4.
