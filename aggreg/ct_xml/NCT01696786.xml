        Inclusion Criteria:

        Any consenting female who wishes to freeze unfertilized oocytes and are:

          1. at risk for ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (enlarged ovaries with abdominal fluid
             accumulation) and postponement of pregnancy has been recommended.

          2. a cancer patient anticipating treatment and have been cleared by the oncologists for
             ovarian stimulation.

          3. a female who seeks to preserve her future fertility and does not wish to use donor or
             partner sperm to fertilize her eggs.

          4. a donor egg recipient who elects to have some of the eggs obtained fertilized with
             husband/partner  sperm and the rest cryopreserved for future use.

          5. a patient for whom the partner's sperm retrieval or production has failed and donor
             sperm is not an option.

          6. a patient who, for religious or ethical reasons, wants to limit the number of fresh
             oocytes exposed to sperm (fertilization) and do not want to either discard or donate
             the excess oocytes.

        AND

          1. has been clinically and psychologically approved for ovarian stimulation

          2. age between 12 and 42 years, inclusive, at time of informed consent.

          3. willing and able to comply with the protocol.

          4. willing to provide follow-up information from her OB/GYN of any CVS/amniocentesis
             results, as well as information on obstetrical outcome.

          5. agree to undergo intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) when oocytes are thawed.

        For cancer patients:

          1. No significant ovarian pathology as judged by physical exam and radiological studies;

          2. Patient's general condition and prognosis deemed favorable for surgery and
             chemo/radio therapy;

          3. No other major medical illness,

          4. Oncologist approval for the ovarian stimulation and egg retrieval.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Age &gt; 42 Subjects who do not meet the inclusion criteria will be ineligible for
        participation in this study.
