SUI is characterized by\n      loss of urine from increased abdominal pressures caused by coughing, laughing, sneezing,\n      running, lifting or walking. SUI cause women to avoid routine physical activities, thus\n      detracting significantly from their quality of life.\n\n      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the performance of new designs of the TIPI device,\n      a conservative, disposable, treatment for temporary management of SUI."
