            "textblock": "Background. The prevalence of chronic venous disease is high in the general population,\n      mainly in young women, and in milder cases the usual complaint is aesthetic. Various\n      techniques are used for treatment of mild varicose disease, including surgical treatment,\n      laser ablation and sclerotherapy. Reticular veins are those with less than 3mm diameter,\n      bluish and important contribution to the aesthetic damage, and sometimes they are related to\n      local pain and recurrence after treatment of telangiectasias. There is no consensus in the\n      literature about the effectiveness of treatment with sclerotherapy, despite of being an\n      usual procedure with different chemicals.\n\n      Methods and design. One hundred lower limbs of healthy women between 18 and 69 years will be\n      triple blind randomized to receive treatment with polidocanol 0.2% diluted in 70% hypertonic\n      glucose versus 75% hypertonic glucose for sclerotherapy treatment of reticular veins. The\n      patients will be examined and clinically classified. It will be included patients with\n      reticular veins sited at out's thigh/leg, measuring at least 10cm long, and only one\n      extremity will be included per patient. The patients with varicose disease CEAP 2 or more\n      will not be included. The treatment will be carried out in only one session and the\n      medication volume not exceeding 5 ml. Clinical follow-up protocols will be filled on regular\n      visits on days 0 - 7 - 60 concomitantly with photograph documentation. Supplementary\n      examination for venous mapping with ultrasound pretreatment is performed for all patients.\n\n      Discussion. This prospective controlled double-blind randomized trial aims to verify and\n      compare the efficacy and safety for sclerotherapy treatment of reticular veins of the lower\n      limbs. The results may help physicians to choose the best sclerotherapy treatment for\n      reticular veins."
