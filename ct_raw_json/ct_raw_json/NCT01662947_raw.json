R. China.\n\n      Investigator: Dr. Cao Yuedong, Leader; Li Qidong, Nurse A; Chen Wenqian, Nurse B.\n\n      Contact Dr. Cao Yuedong Tel: +86 760 88823818\n\n      Used Equipments DUT (Device Under Test): Transtek Wrist Blood Pressure Monitor, TMB-1117\n      Reference Device: Yuyue Medical Blood Pressure Meter, YYBP-212, accuracy: \u00b11 mmHg and range:\n      0-300 mmHg.\n\n      Test Protocol\n\n        1. Test Purpose:\n\n           The aim of clinical test is to determine, for the purpose of design qualification, the\n           overall performance of the system meeting the following requirement: For systolic and\n           diastolic pressures, treated separately, the mean difference of the paired measurement\n           of the test system and the comparison system shall be \u00b1 5 mmHg or less, with standard\n           deviation of 8 mmHg or less.\n\n        2. Target Subject:\n\n      1) The subject database shall contain at least 85 subjects. 2) The distribution of blood\n      pressure of the subjects required to be: At least 10 percent below 100 mmHg systolic; at\n      least 10 percent above 160 mmHg systolic; at least 10 percent below 60 mmHg diastolic; at\n      least 10 percent above 100 mmHg diastolic; with the remainder distributed between these\n      outer limits.\n\n      3. Identification and precision of equipment used According to ANSI/AAMI SP10, the maximum\n      measurement error of the non-automatic sphygmomanometers used in the comparing test shall\n      not exceed 1.0mmHg at the temperature of the test. The manometer was used to verify its\n      accuracy before test.\n\n      The clinical study was conducted according to the protocol described in the ANSI/AAMI SP10\n      with 85 subjects.\n\n      4. Test procedures (auscultatory method, same-limb sequential measurement was chosen)\n\n        1. Record the age, gender, and circumference of the left wrist of the subject.\n\n        2. Let subject seated or supine calmly for five minutes before test.\n\n        3. Measure heart rate in one minute by palpation on radial artery, record it.\n\n        4. Two observers shall make simultaneous, blinded, blood pressure determination on the\n           subject's left arm. Each nurse will write down the reading on a small piece of paper,\n           make a tick if there is an auscultatory gap and then submit to the recorder.\n\n        5. The two readings separately from two observers will be recorded, and if two observers\n           agree that they find an auscultatory gap this time, it will also be recorded. The wrist\n           cuff will be take off, after 90 seconds rest, TMB-1117 cuff will be taken on and\n           tested, and the readings (systolic, diastolic, mean BP and Heart rate) be recorded.\n\n        6. For each subject, repeat 3) and 5) to get 3 measurements.\n\n        7. Repeat step 1) to 6) for every subject.\n\n      5. Note:\n\n        1. No motion and speaking are allowed during the measurement.\n\n        2. The reference device's cuff release at the rate about 3 mmHg/s so to ensure an accurate\n           reading of observer.\n\n        3. The arm, wrist and the haear of subject to keep on the same height when measurement.\n\n        4. Test environment: Temperature: 20\u00b11 \u2103; Relative humidity: 40~50%."
