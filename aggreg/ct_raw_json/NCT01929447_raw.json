The severity of the disorder is expressed  by the\n      Apnea Hypopnea Index (AHI) which is the number of Apnea/Hypopnea episodes per hours of\n      actual sleep and the Respiratory Disturbances Index (RDI)  which is an extended index\n      incorporating in addition to the previous episodes also respiratory effort related arousal\n      episodes. The high cost of in-lab full night PSG, together with long waiting lists for sleep\n      studies, have led to the development of a variety of ambulatory sleep study systems.\n\n      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the newly developed WP200 with the unified\n      probe (WP200U) compared to the currently used configuration of WP200 that uses an\n      incorporated Nonin oximetry module in the sleep lab or in the home sleep environment."
