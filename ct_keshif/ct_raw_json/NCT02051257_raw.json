A T cell is a type of immune cell that can recognize and kill abnormal cells of\n      the body. Central memory enriched T cells will be made from a patient's own T cells that are\n      genetically modified in a laboratory. This means that the T cells are changed by inserting\n      additional pieces of deoxyribonucleic acid (genetic material) into the cell to make it\n      recognize and kill lymphoma cells. Central memory enriched T cells may kill the cells that\n      are not killed by stem cell transplant and may lower the chances of the cancer recurring."
