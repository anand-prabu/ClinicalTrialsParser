Radiosurgery is an alternative treatment with potential for\n      fewer cognitive side effects.  The impact of radiosurgery alone on the cognitive function of\n      patients with multiple brain metastases is not well studied.  We propose a pilot study at\n      the Winnipeg Centre for Gamma Knife Surgery to examine this issue."
