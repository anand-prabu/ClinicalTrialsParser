Understanding\n      lifestyle behaviors, their causes, and relations to cancer are critical.   Where people\n      spend their time during the day may be related to their risk of getting cancer. This project\n      will assess behaviors in different locations across the day and relate exposure to different\n      environments to biological outcomes."
