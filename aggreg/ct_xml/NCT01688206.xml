  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multi-center, open-label study will evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics,
      pharmacodynamics and preliminary efficacy of RO5520985 in patients with locally advanced or
      metastatic solid tumors. Cohorts of patients will receive escalating doses of RO5520985
      intravenously every 2 weeks. Anticipated time on study treatment is until disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs.

             therapy or for whom no standard therapy exists

          -  Measurable disease as determined by RECIST 1.1

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-1

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with squamous non-small cell lung cancer histology

          -  Prior treatment with anti-angiogenic agents targeting VEGF/Ang-1/Ang-2/PIGF and its

          -  Prior systemic anti-cancer therapy within the following timeframes: a) cyclical
             chemotherapy within a period of time that is shorter than the cycle length for the
             treatment used prior to study drug administration; b) biologic therapy or continuous
             or intermittent treatment with small molecule therapeutics (targeted therapies)
             within 4 weeks or &lt; or = 5 half-lives of the drug concerned (whichever is shorter)
             prior to study drug administration

          -  Treatment with any other investigational agents within less than the cycle length
             used for that treatment or within 4 weeks (whichever is shorter) prior to study drug
             administration

          -  Major surgery within 4 weeks prior to study drug administration
