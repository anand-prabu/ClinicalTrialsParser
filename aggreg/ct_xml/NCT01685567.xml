      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the MICHI™
      Neuroprotection System with Filter (MICHI™ NPS+f) in providing cerebral embolic protection
      during carotid artery stenting.   It will be used in conjunction with a FDA approved carotid
      artery stent for the treatment of carotid artery disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral embolization during carotid artery stenting (CAS) can often precipitate severe
      adverse neurological effects. Most major clinical studies of CAS have used distal filters
      for cerebral protection and have compared the neurologic complication rates with those of
      carotid endarterectomy (CEA). Many currently available embolic protection devices, however,
      have limited efficacy in capturing microembolic debris that is liberated during stenting,
      pre-dilatation and post-dilatation. Distal protection systems are furthermore limited by the
      need to cross the lesion prior to deployment. Some studies have shown a relatively high
      incidence of cerebral infarction even when distal protection devices are employed.

      Cerebral protection with carotid flow reversal is a method that was developed as an
      alternative to the use of distal protection devices. While novel in its approach, this
      method too has its limitations.  Another technique developed employs carotid flow reversal
      prior to traversing the stenosis and can be accomplished by directly accessing the carotid
      anatomy without the use of the transfemoral approach. Major benefits to this method include
      a simpler route to the target lesion and the ability to perform the procedure on patients
      with severe carotid tortuosity and difficult aortic arch anatomy.

    <description>The MICHI™ NPS+f is a flow reversal circuit consisting of two proprietary sheaths connected by standard surgical tubing. The sheaths each have a standard hemostasis valve and sidearm.  An in-line flow regulator allows the clinician to modify to the flow through the circuit (either high flow or low flow) in addition to permitting temporary cessation of flow.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient must meet one of the following criteria regarding neurological symptom status
             and degree of stenosis:

               -  Symptomatic:  Stenosis must be greater than or equal to 50% as determined by
                  angiogram and the patient has a history of stroke (minor or non-disabling), TIA
                  and/or amaurosis fugax within 180 days of the procedure.

               -  Asymptomatic:  Stenosis must be greater than or equal to 70% as determined by
                  angiogram without any neurological symptoms within the prior 180 days.

          2. Target vessel must meet diameter requirements for stent (refer to selected stent IFU
             for diameter requirements).
