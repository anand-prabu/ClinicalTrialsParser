  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although lysosomal storage disorders, such as Fabry disease, Gaucher disease, and Pompe
      disease, represent serious challenges in the healthcare system, no study has yet
      investigated the prevalence of these diseases in the US. Frequently, patients show
      progressive worsening of symptoms for several years before they get diagnosed. Since many of
      these diseases can be managed therapeutically, it is important to identify and treat
      patients in order to avoid organ damage.  The investigators aim to undertake a screening
      study that identifies undiagnosed patients with lysosomal storage disorders and determine
      the prevalence of these diseases with special focus on underrepresented minority groups.
