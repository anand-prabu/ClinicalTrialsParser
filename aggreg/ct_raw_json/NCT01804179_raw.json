Investigators will compare the new educational material to\n      another widely available educational brochure.

We recognize that\n             interventions are needed for non-English speaking populations, therefore, once we\n             find promise in the English language CARES intervention materials, we will move\n             forward with conducting other studies that involve translation of measures and\n             cultural adaptation of the CARES intervention materials into Spanish or Haitian\n             Creole.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  Individuals who have participated in a CRCS research study in the past 1 year will\n             not be eligible for this study.\n\n          -  Recent screening criteria relates to not having had I-FOBT within the previous year,\n             flex sig within the previous 5 years, a double-contrast barium enema (DCBE) x-ray\n             with the previous 5 years, or a colonoscopy within the previous 10 years.\n\n          -  Within the recruitment and intervention frame, high risk individuals (due to strong\n             family history, ulcerative colitis, polyposis syndromes) are excluded because they\n             may be eligible for CRC screening before age 50, and the preferred screening option\n             is certainly colonoscopy which is beyond the primary focus of the current study."
