            "textblock": "Traditional risk factors are estimated to account for only part of cardiovascular disease\n      (CVD)risk. Non-traditional risk factors such as increased homocysteine concentrations are\n      believed to be causally related to CVD. The interactive effect between hypertension and\n      hyperhomocysteinemia on the risk of CVD has received great attention.\n      Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR)was the main regulatory enzymes for homocysteine\n      metabolism. MTHFR converts 5,10-methylene-THF into 5-methyl-THF. Polymorphism of MTHFR C677T\n      leads to a reduction in enzyme activity, which may lead to an increased concentration of\n      plasma homocysteine and lower levels of serum folate, particularly in those with low folate\n      intake. Enalapril Maleate-Folate Tablets, known to reduce both blood pressure and serum\n      homocysteine and thereby preventing stroke, was found to have adverse events, such as cough,\n      called ACEI-intolerance in some patients.\n\n      In the present study, we sought to assess:(1)the efficacy and safety of Amlodipine-Folic\n      Acid Tablets in lowing blood pressure and homocysteine in patients with mild to moderate\n      hypertension, hyperhomocysteinemia (hcy\u226510\u03bcmol/L)and ACEI intolerance;(2)whether the blood\n      pressure and homocysteine-lowing efficacy of Amlodipine-Folic Acid Tablets can be modified\n      by individual MTHFR C677T polymorphisms.\n\n      In all, about 540 patients with mild to moderate hypertension, hyperhomocysteinemia and ACEI\n      intolerance will be enrolled in this trial. Eligible subjects are randomly and\n      double-blindly assigned to one of the three treatment groups:1)amlodipine tablet(5mg,control\n      group);2)amlodipine-folic acid tablet(5mg amlodipine combined with 0.4mg of folic acid,low\n      FA group);or 3)amlodipine-folic acid tablet (5mg amlodipine combined with 0.8mg of folic\n      acid,high FA group),once daily for 8 weeks.\n\n      The allocation of participants was programmed by an independent statistical coordinating\n      center,encrypted,and sent to each study center.Tablet containers were labeled only with the\n      name of the trial and the allocated concealment number.The participants,care partners,and\n      all staff directly involved in the trial were blinded to interventions during the period of\n      the trial.\n\n      Demographic and clinical information were obtained at baseline. Blood pressure was examined\n      at baseline and every two weeks for a total period of 8 weeks. Blood homocysteine and folate\n      concentrations were examined at baseline and at 4th\u30018th weeks of the trial. MTHFR C677T\n      genotypes were determined for each study subject.\n\n      All analyses will be performed according to the principle of intention to treat."
