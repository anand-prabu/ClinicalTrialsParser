The overall\n      purpose is to develop disease modifying treatment for sickle cell disease that is less\n      cytotoxic than the current standard of care, and which can directly and more efficiently\n      reactivate fetal hemoglobin levels. The hypothesis is that patients treated with oral\n      tetrahydrouridine and decitabine will have the same chance of severe non-hematologic\n      toxicities as the placebo group. The primary end-point is \u2265 grade 3 non-hematologic\n      toxicity. The investigators' hypothesis is that patients in the treatment groups receiving\n      oral THU-decitabine 2X/week over 8 weeks (n=15) will be equivalent to placebo group (n=10)\n      with regards to the chance of \u2265 grade 3 non-hematologic toxicity."
