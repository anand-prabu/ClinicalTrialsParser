Currently, there is no treatment option for relapsed or refractory\n      extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma. Romidepsin is a histone deacetylase inhibitor which was\n      approved for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. A recent phase II study of romidepsin for\n      relapsed/refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma reported an overall response rate of 38% (95%\n      confidence interval 24%-53%). The median duration of overall response was 8.9 months.\n      Considering the median number of previous treatments in these patients was three (range\n      1-11), romidepsin has single agent activity against relapsed/refractory T-cell lymphoma.\n      Thus, if the single agent activity of romidepsin is demonstrated, it could be a therapeutic\n      agent for combination with salvage treatment."
