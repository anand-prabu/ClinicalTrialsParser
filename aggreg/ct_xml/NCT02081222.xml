  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Viscoelastic hemostatic assay has been reported to be superior to predict perioperative
      bleeding in cardiac surgical patients compared with conventional blood coagulation test.
      However, the role of rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) in predicting perioperative
      bleeding and transfusion requirements in pediatric patients who undergoing surgery for
      congenital heart disease. Therefore, the investigators attempt to evaluate the
      predictability of intraoperative rotational thromboelastometry for perioperative bleeding
      and transfusion requirements in pediatric cardiac surgical patients by comparing with
      conventional coagulation test. The investigators also attempt to evaluate the correlation
      between ROTEM parameters, platelet count, and results of conventional coagulation test
      results.
