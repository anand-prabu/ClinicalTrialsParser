    <measure>Tensile strength of explanted mesh</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Each specimen will be tested for tensile strength to determine force versus displacement.</description>

    <measure>Collagen protein levels of explanted mesh.</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The total amount of collagen and non-collagenous proteins in cultured cell layers and tissue sections by differential staining with two dyes, sirius red and fast green. Sirius Red binds to all types of collagen, whereas fast green stains non-collagenous proteins.</description>
