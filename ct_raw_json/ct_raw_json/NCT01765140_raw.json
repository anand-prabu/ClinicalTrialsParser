This study\n      will enroll minors and adults.\n\n      CMS patients under age 18 years will be included if their parent or guardian gives written\n      permission.  Minors who turn 18 while in the program will be re-consented as adults.\n\n      The dose of DAP will be determined individually for each patient.  Adults will start with a\n      dose of 10 mg 3-4 times daily, increasing over several weeks to the dose that produces the\n      maximum symptomatic response, not to exceed 100 mg daily.  Pyridostigmine bromide (PB) may\n      be added at low doses, increasing to the dose that produces the best response, not to exceed\n      360 mg daily.  In children, equivalent doses of these medications will be given calculated\n      on a surface area basis.  The doses of DAP and PB will be periodically adjusted to assure\n      that the smallest effective doses are used.\n\n      Patients who achieve significant clinical benefit from DAP, as judged by the study PI and\n      the patient, may continue taking DAP as long as the drug is available from the sponsor, and\n      as long as they return for regular follow-up evaluations at the Duke MG Clinic.  Patients\n      who are unable to return for regular follow-up will be required to have their local\n      physician obtain DAP for them from the sponsor."
