VR1010\n      is designed to release glycerol. The study will assess the duration of lubrication/\n      moisturization of the vagina with the VR101 intravaginal ring in place (up to 7 days) and\n      participant satisfaction of the device.\n\n      Study participants will insert the intravaginal ring and leave it in place for an initial 7\n      days and then repeat this process a 2nd time.  Participants will respond to questionnaires,\n      complete a daily diary and come in for 4 separate study visits.  Each study visit will\n      involve a brief vaginal exam.\n\n      Upon removal of the initially inserted device (7 days after first study visit), participants\n      will insert a second device for an additional 7 days and undergo the same evaluation."

Vaginal dryness can dramatically affect women's lifestyle, in particular\n      their sexual activity and relationship with their partner. Since we believe that living with\n      uncomfortable vaginal dryness does not have to be part of aging, we intend to conduct this\n      study to evaluate a lubricating vaginal ring developed to ease symptoms caused by vaginal\n      dryness.\n\n      The objectives of this study are to obtain preliminary data on the ability of the VR101\n      intravaginal ring to relieve the symptoms of vaginal dryness in peri- and post-menopausal\n      women.  Effectiveness will be measured in two ways:\n\n        1. Vaginal health index scoring assessed by a member of the research team\n\n        2. Participant answers to questionnaires\n\n      Study objectives will assess the following:\n\n        1. Successful placement of VR101 intravaginal ring into the vagina\n\n        2. Ease of insertion and removal\n\n        3. Comfort and fit\n\n        4. Lubrication/ moisturization of the vagina"
