Patients who have given\n      their consent to be evaluated at least two years after their stroke and their operation in a\n      single visit by clinical examination and procurement of standardized scales. Will be\n      measured the quality of life through scale SIS3.0, residual disability by the Rankin scale.\n      The quality of life of the carer will be assessed through scales and Zarit carer version of\n      SIS3.0. The existence of predictive parameters of long-term evolution will be searched in\n      determining the existence of a correlation between demographic data and baseline\n      characteristics of the stroke on and the evolution of the quality of life."
