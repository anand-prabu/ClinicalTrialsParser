    <textblock>
      Background:

      - Glioblastoma is an aggressive type of brain cancer that often resists treatment. TRC105 is
      an experimental drug that blocks the growth of new blood vessels. It is being studied for
      possible use in treating different kinds of cancer. Researchers want to see if TRC105 can be
      used to treat glioblastoma that has not responded to standard treatments.

      Objectives:

      - To test the safety and effectiveness of TRC105 in adults who have glioblastoma that has
      not responded to standard treatments.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have glioblastoma that has not responded to
      standard treatments.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood and urine
           samples will be collected. Imaging studies and other tests will be used to study the
           tumor before the start of treatment.

        -  Participants will have 28-day (4-week) cycles of treatment.

        -  Participants will have TRC105 intravenously once a week. The first infusion will take
           about 4 hours. The length of time needed for the infusion may be slowly reduced if it
           is well tolerated.

        -  At the end of the first cycle (the first 4 weeks), the imaging studies will be repeated
           before continuing TRC105.

        -  Participants will take TRC105 for as long as the tumor does not grow and the side
           effects are not too severe. They will have imaging studies at the end of every cycle to
           evaluate the tumor.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background:

        -  TRC105 is an anti-angiogenic monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds to CD105 (Endoglin),
           a transmembrane glycoprotein that is essential for angiogenesis, and expressed
           abundantly on activated vascular endothelial cells (ECs). CD105 is a member of the
           transforming growth factor-Beta (TGF-Beta) receptor superfamily, and modulates TGF-Beta
           signaling leading to EC proliferation and migration.

        -  Immunohistochemistry studies reveal that CD105 is preferentially expressed in blood
           vessels of tumor tissues as compared with normal mucosa.  For patients with
           glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), increased expression of CD105 may correspond to worse
           survival times.  Furthermore, expression of CD105 is essential for neovascularization,
           and is upregulated in the setting of (vascular endothelial growth factor ) VEGF
           inhibition.

        -  TRC105 binding to CD105 leads to inhibition of EC proliferation, neovascularization,
           and induces cell death via apoptosis. TRC105 may also mediate antibody-dependent
           cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC).

      Objectives:

      Primary

        -  To determine the radiographic response rate for patients with recurrent GBM treated
           with TRC105.

        -  To establish data regarding the anti-tumor activity of TRC105 in patients with GBM, as
           determined by progression free survival.

      Secondary

        -  To obtain information regarding the safety of TRC105 in patients with recurrent GBM.

        -  To evaluate the health-related quality of life (HRQL) in patients while on treatment
           with TRC105.

        -  To examine the effect of TRC105 on vascular permeability as measured by percent change
           from baseline in the forward contrast transfer rate (Ktrans) of dynamic
           contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI).

        -  To examine the effect of TRC105 on vascular perfusion as measured by percent change
           from baseline in cerebral blood volume (CBV), cerebral blood flow (CBF), and mean
           transit time (MTT) of dynamic susceptibility contrast magnetic resonance imaging
           (DSC-MRI).

        -  To examine the effect of TRC105 on water diffusion as measured by percent change from
           baseline in apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and fractional anisotropy (FA) of
           diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

        -  To examine the effect of TRC105 on tumor metabolism as measured by percent change from
           baseline in fludeoxyglucose F18 injection (FDG) uptake of positron emission tomography
           (PET) scan.

        -  To obtain preliminary data regarding how changes in serial FDG-PET scans and
           physiological MRI correlate with radiographic response rates and with progression free
           survival in patients treated with TRC105.

      Eligibility:

      -This is a phase II trial in patients with recurrent GBM who are VEGF therapy naive.

      Design:

      -Prior to treatment start, patients will undergo a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
      including MRI perfusion and diffusion scans, as well as an FDG-PET scan. Patients will then
      receive TRC105 as a single agent (weekly dose of 10 mg/kg IV). A cycle will consist of 4
      weeks of therapy. At the end of the first cycle, the magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and
      FDG-PET scans will be repeated before continuing treatment. Patients who are clinically and
      neurologically stable, and who have radiographic stable or responding disease at the end of
      each cycle will continue treatment with TRC105. MRI perfusion and diffusion will be repeated
      after the completion of each cycle of therapy.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA

          -  Patients must have histologically confirmed glioblastoma or gliosarcoma.

          -  Patients must have evidence for tumor progression by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
             or computed tomography (CT) scan. This scan should be performed within 14 days prior
             to registration and on a fixed dose of steroids for at least 5 days. If the steroid
             dose is increased between the date of imaging and registration a new baseline MR/CT
             is required. The same type of scan, ie, MRI or CT must be used throughout the period
             of protocol treatment for tumor measurement.

          -  Patients must have progressed after radiation therapy and must have an interval of
             greater

          -  Patients must have recovered from the toxic effects of prior therapy: 4 weeks from
             any investigational agent, 4 weeks from prior cytotoxic therapy, two weeks from
             vincristine, 6 weeks from nitrosoureas, 3 weeks from procarbazine administration, and
             1 week for non-cytotoxic agents, e.g., interferon, tamoxifen, thalidomide,
             cis-retinoic acid, etc. Any questions related to the definition of non-cytotoxic
             agents should be directed to the Study Chair. All toxicities from prior therapies
             should be resolved to National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for
             Adverse Events (CTCAE) less than or equal to grade 1 (except for toxicities such as
             alopecia or vitiligo).

          -  Patients must be &gt; 18 years old. Because no dosing or adverse event data are
             currently available on the use of TRC105 in patients &lt; 18 years of age, children are
             excluded from this study, but will be eligible for future pediatric trials.

          -  Karnofsky performance status &gt;  60%

          -  Life expectancy of greater than 12 weeks.

          -  Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:

               -  leukocytes &gt; 3,000/microliter

               -  absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1,500/microliter

                  (SGPT) &lt; 2.5 times institutional upper limit of normal

               -  Prothrombin time (PT)/Partial thromboplastin time (PTT) &lt; 1.5 times
                  institutional upper limit of normal

          -  creatinine &lt;  1.5 times ULN within normal institutional limits

        OR

        --creatinine clearance &gt; 60 glomerular filtration rate for patients with creatinine

        levels above institutional normal.

          -  hemoglobin of &gt;  9grams/deciliter without transfusion support in the past 28 days

               -  Patients must not have any significant medical illnesses that, in the
                  investigators opinion, cannot be adequately controlled with appropriate therapy
                  or would compromise the patients ability to tolerate this therapy

               -  Patients having undergone recent resection of recurrent or progressive tumor
                  will be eligible as long as all of the following conditions apply:

          -  They have recovered from the effects of surgery.

          -  They should have residual disease following resection of recurrent tumor.

        To best assess the extent of residual disease post-operatively, a computed tomography
        (CT)/ magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) should be done:

        no later than 96 hours in the immediate post-operative period and

          -  at least 4 weeks post-operatively, and

          -  within 14 days of registration, and

          -  on a steroid dosage that has been stable for at least 5 days.

        If the steroid dose is increased between the date of imaging and registration, a new
        baseline MRI/CT is required on a stable steroid dosage for at least 5 days.

          -  The effects of TRC105 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason and
             because antiangiogenic agents are known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing
             potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier
             method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of
             study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while
             she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating
             physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to
             use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study
             participation, and 4 months after completion of TRC105 administration.

          -  Patients must have the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written
             informed consent document.

          -  A baseline 12 lead electrocardiogram (ECG) to be performed within 2 weeks of trial

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA

             (VEGF) receptor inhibitors.

          -  Patients with a history of peptic ulcer disease or erosive gastritis within the past
             6 months, unless treated for the condition and complete resolution has been
             documented by esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD).

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to TRC105.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

               -  Exclude patients who have had angina, MI, symptomatic congestive heart failure
                  (CHF), cerebral vascular accident (CVA), transient ischemic attack (TIA),
                  arterial embolism, pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), percutaneous
                  transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) or coronary artery bypass graft (CABG)

                  are below the lower limit of normal for the institution

          -  Patients known to have a malignancy (other than their glioblastoma) that has required
             treatment in the last 12 months and/or is expected to require treatment in the next
             12 months (except non-melanoma skin cancer or carcinoma in-situ in the cervix)

          -  Patients are not allowed to receive concurrent anti-coagulation, and may not have

             unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to
             treatment of the mother with TRC105, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the
             mother is treated with TRC105.

        <description>Response and progression will be evaluated by the Updated Response Assessment Criteria for High-Grade Gliomas developed by the Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology Working Group (RANO). Complete response is complete disappearance of all enhancing measurable and non-measurable disease sustained for at least 4 weeks. Partial response is &gt;/=50% decrease compared with baseline in the sum of products of perpendicular diameters of all measurable enhancing lesions sustained for at least 4 weeks. Stable disease does not qualify for complete response, partial response, or progression. Progression is a &gt;/=25% increase in sum of the products of perpendicular diameters of enhancing lesions compared with the smallest tumor measurement obtained at baseline (if no decrease) or best response, on stable or increasing doses of corticosteroids,</description>
