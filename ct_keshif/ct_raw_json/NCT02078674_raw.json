Willing and able to give informed consent prior to study enrollment,\n\n          3. Able to comply with study requirements, and\n\n          4. Women of child-bearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test prior to\n             each vaccination, and will be advised through the Informed Consent process to avoid\n             becoming pregnant over the duration of the study, and must assert that they will\n             employ an effective form of birth control for the duration of the study. Acceptable\n             forms of birth control are: credible history of continuous abstinence from\n             heterosexual activity or prior surgical sterilization, hormonal contraceptives (oral,\n             injectable, implant, patch, ring), barrier contraceptives (condom or diaphragm), and\n             intrauterine device (IUD). Women with an adequately documented history of surgical\n             sterility, or \u226550 years of age and without menses for \u22651 year are exempt from urine\n             pregnancy testing.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n        Subjects will be excluded if they meet any of the following criteria:\n\n          1. Any ongoing, symptomatic acute or chronic illness requiring medical or surgical care.\n\n               -  Asymptomatic conditions or findings (e.g., mild hypertension, dyslipidemia) that\n                  are not associated with evidence of end-organ damage are not exclusionary\n                  provided that they are being appropriately managed and are clinically stable\n                  (i.e., unlikely to result in symptomatic illness within the time-course of this\n                  study) in the opinion of the Investigator.\n\n               -  Acute or chronic illnesses or conditions which may be reasonably predicted to\n                  become symptomatic if treatment were withdrawn or interrupted are exclusionary,\n                  even if stable.\n\n               -  Note that illnesses or conditions may be exclusionary, even if otherwise stable\n                  and clinically minor, due to therapies used to treat them (see exclusion\n                  criteria 3, 5, 8, 9).\n\n          2. Any grade 1 or higher (as based on the Toxicity Grading Scale [TGS]) abnormality in\n             ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, blood urea nitrogen, or creatinine\n             levels.\n\n          3. Any grade 2 or higher (as based on the TGS) vital sign or clinical laboratory\n             abnormality not specified in criterion 2 above. Note that any abnormal vital sign may\n             be repeated at the Investigator's discretion.\n\n          4. Participation in research involving investigational product (drug / biologic /\n             device) within 45 days before planned date of first vaccination.\n\n          5. History of a serious reaction to prior influenza vaccination.\n\n          6. History of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome (GBS) within 6 weeks following a previous\n             influenza vaccine.\n\n          7. Received any vaccine in the 4 weeks preceding the study vaccination; or any A(H7N9)\n             avian influenza vaccine at any time.\n\n          8. Any known or suspected immunosuppressive condition, acquired or congenital, as\n             determined by history and/or physical examination.\n\n          9. Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 continuous days) of\n             immunosuppressants or other immune-modifying drugs within 6 months prior to the\n             administration of the study vaccine. An immunosuppressant dose of glucocorticoid will\n             be defined as a systemic dose \u226510mg of prednisone per day or equivalent. The use of\n             topical, inhaled, and nasal glucocorticoids will be permitted.\n\n         10. Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the 3 months\n             preceding the administration of the study vaccine or during the study.\n\n         11. Acute disease at the time of enrollment (defined as the presence of a moderate or\n             severe illness with or without fever, or an oral temperature >38.0\u00b0C on the planned\n             day of vaccine administration).\n\n         12. Known disturbance of coagulation.\n\n         13. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding, or plan to become pregnant during the study.\n\n         14. Suspicion or recent history (within one year of planned vaccination) of alcohol or\n             other substance abuse."
