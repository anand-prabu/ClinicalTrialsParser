    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well eribulin mesylate works in treating patients with
      previously treated metastatic breast cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as eribulin
      mesylate, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the
      cells or by stopping them from dividing.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Progression free survival (PFS).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Frequency of alopecia with absence or decrease to &lt; 50%.

      II. Incidence of grade 3 and 4 neutropenia of &lt; 30%.

      III. Incidence of sensory neuropathy (all grades) to &lt; 25%.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the role of circulating endothelial cell precursors (CEPs) and apoptotic
      circulating endothelial cells (CECs), in predicting early response to treatment.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive eribulin mesylate intravenously (IV) over 2-5 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15.
      Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and for 1 year.
