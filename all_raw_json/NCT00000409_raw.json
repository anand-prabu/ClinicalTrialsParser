            "textblock": "Low back pain is considered one of the most widely experienced health problems in the U.S.\n      and the world. It is the second most frequent condition, after the common cold, for which\n      patients see a physician or lose days from work. Estimated costs to those who are severely\n      disabled from low back pain range from $30-70 billion annually. Rates of spinal surgery in\n      the U.S. have increased sharply over time, and researchers have documented 15-fold\n      geographic variation in rates of these surgeries. In many cases, where one lives and who one\n      sees for the condition appear to determine the rates of surgery. Despite these trends, there\n      is little evidence proving the effectiveness of these therapies over nonsurgical management.\n\n      This study will use the National Spine Network to conduct a multicenter, randomized,\n      controlled trial for the three most common diagnostic groups for which spine surgery is\n      performed: lumbar intervertebral disc herniation (IDH), spinal stenosis (SpS), and spinal\n      stenosis secondary to degenerative spondylolisthesis (DS). This arm of the trial will deal\n      with patients from the third diagnostic group. The study will compare the most commonly used\n      standard surgical treatments to the most commonly used standard nonsurgical treatments. We\n      will conduct the study at 12 sites throughout the United States.\n\n      The primary endpoint of the study will be changes in health-related quality of life as\n      measured by the SF-36 health status questionnaire. Secondary endpoints will include patient\n      satisfaction with treatment, utility for current health in order to estimate\n      quality-adjusted life years (QALYS) as the measure for cost-effectiveness, resource use, and\n      cost.\n\n      We will follow patients at 6 weeks and 3, 6, 12, and 24 months to determine their health\n      status, function, satisfaction, and health care use. We anticipate that we will enroll and\n      randomly allocate a total of 300 study participants in this arm of the trial. We will track\n      an additional observational cohort to assess health and resource outcomes. Enrollment in the\n      Observational cohort has been completed as of February 2003.\n\n      We will integrate data from the trial and observational cohorts to formally estimate the\n      cost-effectiveness of surgical versus nonsurgical interventions for IDH, SpS, and DS. The\n      results of this trial will provide, for the first time, scientific evidence as to the\n      relative effectiveness of surgical versus nonsurgical treatment for these three most\n      commonly diagnosed lumbar spine conditions."
