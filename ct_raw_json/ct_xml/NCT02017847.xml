      Aim of this study is to identify intensity cut off points for physical activity in a
      population over the age of 70.

      Activity monitors measure activity in counts. The higher the counts, the higher the
      intensity of the measured activity. In this study the count cut off points for low, moderate
      and high intensity activity will be investigated in a population of elderly people over the
      age of 70. This information will subsequently (in future studies) be used to investigate the
      physical activity patterns in a population of elderly over the age of 70 who have worn an
      activity monitor for a duration of 7 days.
