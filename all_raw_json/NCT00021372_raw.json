Determine the toxicity of this regimen in this patient population.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral estramustine 2-3 times daily on days 1-3 and paclitaxel IV\n      over 1 hour on day 2 on weeks 1-6. Treatment repeats every 8 weeks for at least 1 course in\n      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving a complete\n      or partial response continue therapy for at least 3 courses or for 1 course after achieving\n      maximum response. Patients are followed every 3 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-35 patients will be accrued for this study."
