            "textblock": "Noninvasive fractional flow reserve (FFR) computed from CT (FFRCT) is a novel method for\n      determining the physiologic significance of coronary artery disease (CAD), and several\n      clinical trials have revealed that the FFRCT has a good correlation with invasive FFR, also\n      use of noninvasive FFRCT plus Computed Tomography (CT ) among stable patients with suspected\n      or known CAD was associated with improved diagnostic accuracy and discrimination vs CT alone\n      for the diagnosis of hemodynamically significant CAD.\n\n      The cornerstone of FFR is the linear relationship between pressure and flow under conditions\n      of constant (and minimized) intracoronary resistance, so is FFRCT. Under such conditions,\n      pressure and flow are assumed to be directly proportional, and a decrease in pressure across\n      a stenosis reflects a decrease in blood flow to the dependent myocardium. However, even\n      after administration of potent pharmacologic agents such as adenosine, intracoronary\n      resistance is not static, but instead fluctuates in a phasic pattern throughout the cardiac\n      cycle. In addition,  for patients who are allergic to pharmacologic agents or with sever\n      lesions which response little to pharmacologic agents, the measurement of FFR is challenging\n      and the lesion are always underestimated. The ADVISE trial revealed that intracoronary\n      resistance is naturally constant and minimized during the wave-free period. The\n      instantaneous wave-free ratio calculated over this period produces a drug-free index of\n      stenosis severity comparable to FFR. But whether iFR calculated from Computed\n      Tomography(iFRCT) is comparable to FFRCT or FFR, and its diagnostic performance remains\n      unknown. Thus the investigators conduct this trial to assess the diagnostic performance of\n      Instantaneous Wave-Free Ratio for diagnosis of hemodynamically significant coronary\n      stenosis.\n\n      Instantaneous Wave-Free Ratio calculated from reconstructed heart model.Wave-intensity\n      analysis identified a wave-free period in which intracoronary resistance at rest is similar\n      in variability and magnitude.The investigators define the resting distal-to-proximal\n      pressure ratio during this period as the instantaneous wave-free ratio (iFR)."
