  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ureteric stents are used often following ureteroscopy for prevention of obstruction from
      edema and or stone fragments.  They are often associated with pain, voiding often, the need
      to urinate quickly and finding blood in the urine called &quot;lower urinary tract symptoms&quot; or
      LUTS for short.  There is randomized studies showing the efficacy of α-blockers such as
      tamsulosin in relieving &quot;stent symptoms&quot; (pain and LUTS).   There is emerging but limited
      evidence to show that antimuscarinic medications, used to treat overactive bladder (OAB)
      have some efficacy in decreasing stent symptoms.  Mirabegron is a beta-agonist used to
      decrease OAB symptoms.

      Mirabegron functions to mediate relaxation of the detrusor muscle and has been useful in
      treating OAB symptoms. Conventional antimuscarinic medications often have bothersome side
      effects like dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision and cognitive impairment.  This may
      limit their use in some populations.  Mirabegron is well-tolerated with a good safety
      profile and therefore may be useful in treating stent symptoms without the bothersome side
      effects commonly seen with antimuscarinic medications.  .

      The investigators hypothesize that mirabegron is effective in decreasing ureteral stent
      related LUTS and pain.

    <description>The primary objective of this study is to determine if mirabegron is effective in decreasing ureteral stent related lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) following ureteroscopy for urolithiasis when compared to tamsulosin alone and in combination. Utilizing the Ureteral Stent Symptom Questionnaire, a self-administered questionnaire participants will report their urinary symptoms for comparison, enabling the comparison through out the different treatment arms.</description>

    <measure>Quality of life impact of mirabegron for stent symptoms as measured with the Ureteral Stent Symptoms Questionnaire.</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured twice, once at the time of surgery when stent is inserted and secondly at the time the stent is removed occuring 5 to 10 days later.</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The secondary objectives are to determine if mirabegron is effective in decreasing ureteral stent related pain compared to tamsulosin alone and in combination following ureteroscopy for urolithiasis, determining if there are any improvements in health related quality of life (HRQoL).  Subjects will maintain a diary recording the frequency of pain medication through out the period the stent remains insitu, 5 to 10 days.</description>
