  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims at evaluating the relation between quality of the interface between the
      stump and the prosthesis, and the quality of gait in above-knee amputees.

      The hypothesis is that an adapted prosthesis allowing an efficient gait in above-knee
      amputees corresponds to an homogeneous pressure distribution pattern onto the stump.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Forty amputee patients will be evaluated for satisfaction with the prosthesis, pressure
      repartition pattern and functional capabilities.

      Pressure at the stump-socket interface will be recorded using a set of 14 single cells
      sensors placed in predefined positions onto the stump. Pattern of pressure will be measured
      in four tasks: sitting posture, standing posture, gait initiation, and gait at preferred
      velocity.

      Reproducibility of the pressure repartition pattern will be analyzed by repeating gait and
      standing posture task in the first 15 patients included.

      In patients whom prosthesis has been modified on the basis on the first pressure measurement
      (pressure peak and bad functional capacities), a new pressure measurement will be repeated
      2-8 weeks apart.

      Postural and gait abilities will be also assessed in 40 age/gender matched non-amputated
      subjects to serve as control data.

    <description>Calculated on the basis of 10 walking trials of 10 meters. The maximal pressure will be measured at each step for each sensor. The mean maximal pressure is calculated for each of the 14 sensors. The variation coefficient is calculated between these 14 values (variation coefficient = standard deviation/mean)
A low variation coefficient of pressure is supposed to represent an homogeneous repartition of the pressure in the prosthesis.</description>

    <description>If a modification of the prosthesis is required and performed on the basis of the first assessment (at inclusion), a new assessment with the modified prosthesis is performed 5 weeks later (from 2 to 8 weeks).
Change in walking capabilities is assessed by calculating the difference between results of the two minute walk test at inclusion and at 5 weeks.</description>

    <description>First, the assessment will be performed to evaluate the relationship between pressure repartition pattern, clinical evaluation and motor capabilities. All the patients and volunteers will be concerned by this first part.
A second part will be conducted in 15 amputees within the 40 patients. Assessments of pressure pattern during gait and standing will be repeated two times: by the same investigator and by a different investigator, in order to test intra- and inter-evaluator reproducibility.
After the first assessment, the prosthesis may be modified in order to solve clinical problems. In that case, a new assessment will be proposed 2 to 8 weeks after in order to test the effect of the prosthesis modification on pressure pattern, gait, posture and clinical parameters.</description>

    <description>Clinical examination will include stump pain, wound, scar and unusual shape.
Questionnaire will include satisfaction scale (SatPro), comfort scale (SCE), and functional scale (PPA-LCI)
After installing the sensors on the stump, the patient will put his prosthesis on and will perform the following tasks: gait, sitting and standing posture and gait initiation.
Pressure repartition at the stump-socket interface will be assessed with the 14 flat sensors.
Gait parameters will be assessed with the OptoGait device. Standing posture and gait initiation parameters will be assessed with a force-plate.</description>
