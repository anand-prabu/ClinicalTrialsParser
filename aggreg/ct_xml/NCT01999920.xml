    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether Vilazodone (Viibryd), an SSRI and 5HT1a
      receptor agonist, is effective in treating Adult Separation Anxiety Disorder over a 12-week
      treatment course.

    <textblock>
      In this randomized clinical trial, 40 adults with a principal diagnosis of Adult Separation
      Anxiety Disorder (ASAD) and no major depression or substance abuse disorders will be
      randomized to 12 weeks of treatment with vilazodone (flexibly dosed) or matched pill
      placebo. Outcome will be assessed in respect to symptomatic improvement, quality of life,
      adverse events and safety.
