However, hysteroscopic procedure can cause morbidity and even mortality\n      related to infusion distension medium. We had used a manual syringe infusion method to\n      infuse fluid for distending the uterine cavity in our institute without significant\n      morbidity, and it seems that this method need less amount of distension medium, and possible\n      result in less possibility of hyponatremia. Therefore, the aim of this study is to perform a\n      randomized controlled trial of comparing the manual syringe infusion method with the\n      conventional infusion pump method to clarify if the manual syringe infusion method really\n      needs less amount of distension medium during hysteroscopy."
