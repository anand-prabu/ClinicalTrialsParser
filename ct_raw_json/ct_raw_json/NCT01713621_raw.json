Characterisation of PK-PD\n      (Pharmacokinetic-Pharmacodynamic) relationships is essential for rational evidence based\n      dosing. The adaptive investigation of a range of doses will provide the best chance of\n      accurate PK-PD characterisation, allowing the observation of Plasmodium falciparum growth\n      dynamics and the subsequent identification of MIC and MPC (minimum parasiticidal\n      concentration). Additionally the tolerability and pharmacokinetics of OZ439 will be\n      confirmed. The PK/PD relationship between OZ439 exposure and subsequent effects on\n      parasitaemia will be investigated."
