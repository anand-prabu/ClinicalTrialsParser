Advance care\n      planning is a process in which teams of experts assist in with treatment plans, managing\n      pain and other symptoms, emotional issues, and end of life issues. With advances in\n      technology, it is now possible to get the patient's feedback directly and more often. It is\n      thought that repeated questionnaires completed by the patient will provide a better and more\n      accurate measure of the patient's needs and experiences but this has not been tested. This\n      study is designed to learn if using a computerized assessment repeatedly is better than\n      standard planning techniques."
