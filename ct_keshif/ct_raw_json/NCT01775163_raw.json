In E-Mechanic changes in body weight, body composition, energy intake and\n      energy expenditure are measured before and after 3 different exercise programs of 24 weeks\n      in duration. The 3 exercise programs being compared are self-directed exercise, low dose\n      exercise and high dose exercise. The goal of this ancillary study is to undertake\n      comprehensive assessments of energy metabolism in a metabolic chamber in a group of 60 obese\n      individuals enrolled in the main study. We will compare differences in the changes in 24h\n      energy expenditure and spontaneous physical activity between the 3 exercise programs. We\n      will also test if changes in energy metabolism might explain why people don't lose the\n      expected amount of weight after 24 weeks of exercise."
