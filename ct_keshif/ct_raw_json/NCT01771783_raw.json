Output of the classic RAS system will be assessed using aldosterone\n      concentrations. Fluid and sodium intake will be monitored using sodium concentration and\n      total volume in 24h urine."

In a first step this finding\n      needs to be verified in a larger number of healthy subjects. Since it is unknown, whether\n      the changes that were observed within hours after a single inhibitor dose are stable over\n      time, the profiles also need to be investigated under steady-state conditions of the\n      different inhibitors. Comparison of RAS peptide profiles after single dose and under\n      steady-state conditions will also allow to detect whether the peptide profiles are altered\n      by compensatory mechanisms."
