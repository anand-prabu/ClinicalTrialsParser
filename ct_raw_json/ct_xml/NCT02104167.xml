    <textblock>
      The purpose of this combined retrospective and prospective clinical study is to examine
      safety and efficacy of the ROI-C® anterior cervical interbody fusion device with
      VerteBRIDGE® plating to treat single level degenerative disc disease between C2 and T1 in
      the short term, with a focus on fusion rates.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject must have degenerative disc disease (DDD) of the cervical spine with
             accompanying radicular symptoms at one level between C2 and T1.

          -  The subject can have the ROI-C device at only one level.

          -  Autograft must have been used with the ROI-C device.

          -  Subject should have had a minimum of 6 (six) weeks of non-operative treatment prior
             to surgery.

          -  Subject must be at least 21 years of age at the time of surgery

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  No BMP was used in the interbody cage

          -  Subject was a prisoner at the time of surgery

          -  Subject was pregnant at the time of surgery

          -  Subject had an active infection or sepsis at the time of surgery
