  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Repetitive negative thinking (RNT) plays an important role in different psychiatric
      disorders, such as depressive and anxiety disorders, complicated grief, anorexia nervosa.
      RNT is seen as a vulnerability factor in the onset, duration, severity and relapse of those
      disorders.  Although there is a lot of theoretical research, it is un- known if a training
      program addressing RNT has a surplus effect on Treatment as Usual (TAU). Our hypothesis is
      that a training intervention will show a significant effect on declined RNT activity,
      reduced identification with worrying/rumination, and reduced scores on metacognitions
      questionnaires, when compared to TAU (medication, psychotherapy or a combination of both
      treatments). Further we expect that this effect on RNT will not be temporary and the
      beneficial effects will remain present over a longer time (6 months). Our third hypothesis
      claims that reduced RNT will have an effect on Quality of Life, self-esteem and depressive
      and anxiety scores ( as measured by BDI-II and STAI). Fourth hypothesis concerns the effect
      of the training in the functioning on a neurobiological level. Here we expect that in
      ruminative patients beneficial effects of RNT will increase top-down prefrontal
      (dorsolateral) cortical control over an overactive bottom-up limbic system. To examine these
      neurobiological effects, we apply a multimodal approach where we combine resting state fMRI,
      structural MRI such as diffuse tensor imaging (DTI), anterior spin labelling (ASL). Further,
      in our department we developed an audio critique task where participants hear different
      kinds of critique amongst some of negative valence which will be especially problematic for
      ruminative patients reflecting difficulties and differences these top-down/bottom-up
      processes when compared to a healthy control group at baseline. Further, we hypothesize that
      only when RNT is successful these neuronal processes will normalize. We do not expect
      changes in the waiting list group.

      To examine these clinical and neuronal effects, people suffering from GAD and/or minor or
      moderate depression will be allocated by randomisation to an active treatment condition
      (ATC) and a waiting list control group WLC). All the participants will be patients treated
      by general practitioner, psychologist or psychiatrist. Training exists of 8 sessions in
      group (max 12 participants) on a weekly basis, except for the last session, which takes
      place after one month). During the training people will get information on RNT, they will be
      trained in focusing their attention, will receive some basic ideas about becoming aware of
      dysfunctional thinking and learn coping strategies such as stimulus control and engaging in
      activity.

      Measurement will take place before and after treatment for the ATC. The WLC will be measured
      at the start of the ATC and after 12 weeks. Measurement takes place by means of
      questionnaires and fMRI. During the fMRI people will undergo a resting state paradigm and
      some tasks triggering RNT. After three and 6 months, at the time interval of 3 and 6 months,
      participants will be evaluated again on RNT by means of questionnaires.

      At the end of the training, after 8th session, two participants per run will be asked to
      cooperate in a qualitative in-depth interview. We are interested in linking results with the
      training with some factors such as quantity of sessions, degree of active participation in
      between sessions. We are also interested in defining which interventions are perceived as
      most useful and if there is a link between disorder and the usefulness of some
      interventions.
