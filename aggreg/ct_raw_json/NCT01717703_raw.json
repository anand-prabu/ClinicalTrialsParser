It is hypothesized that 1% chocolate milk\n      will increase meal time satiation to a greater extent than other sugars-sweetened\n      commercially available beverages. Food intake will be measured 60 minutes after the\n      consumption of 350 ml of water, fruit drink, cola or 1% chocolate milk."
