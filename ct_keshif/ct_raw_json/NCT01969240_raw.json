To compare the use of risk\n      stratification tools with usual clinical approaches to treatment selection or\n      administration, we propose the following:\n\n        1. Test if Chest Pain Choice safely improves validated patient-centered outcome measures\n           in a pragmatic parallel patient randomized trial.\n\n           Hypothesis: The intervention will significantly increase patient knowledge, engagement,\n           and satisfaction with no increase in adverse events.\n\n        2. Test if the decision aid has an effect on healthcare utilization within 30 days after\n           enrollment.\n\n      Hypothesis: The intervention will significantly reduce the rate of hospital admission, rate\n      of cardiac testing, and total healthcare utilization."
