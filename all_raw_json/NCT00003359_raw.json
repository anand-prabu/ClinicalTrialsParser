            "textblock": "OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of T138067 sodium that can be given to\n      patients with advanced refractory cancer on a 28-day schedule and establish a dose for\n      further study. II. Evaluate the safety and dose limiting toxicity of T138067 sodium in these\n      patients. III. Determine the pharmacokinetic parameters after a single intravenous dose of\n      this agent in these patients. IV. Obtain safety data and preliminary efficacy information\n      after repetition of single doses of T138067 sodium in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is an open label, dose escalation study. Patients receive T138067 sodium by IV\n      over 3 hours. Patients may be retreated every 4 weeks for up to 6 courses (6 months total)\n      in the absence of disease progression or dose limiting toxicity (DLT). At least 3 patients\n      are treated at each dose level in the absence of DLT. The maximum tolerated dose is defined\n      as the dose level where 2 of 3-6 patients experience DLT.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 3-24 patients will be accrued into this study."
