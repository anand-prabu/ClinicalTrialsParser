Subjects were randomised\n      in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to receive placebo, ESL 400 mg once daily (QD), ESL 800 mg QD or ESL 1200\n      mg QD. The study was carried out as follows:\n\n      Screening Visit (Visit [V] 1): After completing screening procedures at V1, eligible\n      subjects began the 2 week Baseline Period.\n\n      Baseline Period (2 weeks): Subjects discontinued taking prohibited medications on V1\n      (beginning of washout period). Subjects were tapered off of discontinued medications.\n      Washout was completed by Day -7 (7 days before V2). Subjects refrained from taking any pain\n      medications and other prohibited medications (except rescue medication) throughout the\n      study. During the Baseline Period, subjects used the subject diary to complete the diary\n      pain assessment on a 0-10 numeric pain rating scale (NPRS) and to record information on\n      rescue medication daily on awakening.\n\n      Titration Period (1 week): Upon completing the Baseline Period, subjects returned to the\n      study centre for V2 (Randomisation Visit, Day 1). At V2, subjects, who had completed at\n      least 4 subject diary pain assessments satisfactorily within the past 7 days, had an average\n      pain score that was \u22654 and \u22649 and continued to meet all study entry criteria, were randomly\n      assigned to 1 of the 4 treatment groups. During the 1-week Titration Period, subjects\n      randomised to the ESL 400 mg QD and the ESL 800 mg QD treatment groups received ESL 400 mg\n      QD; and subjects randomised to the ESL 1200 mg QD treatment group received ESL 600 mg QD;\n      subjects assigned to placebo treatment received placebo QD.\n\n      Maintenance Period (12 weeks): Starting at V3, subjects assigned to treatment with ESL\n      received their full dosage regimens QD; subjects assigned to placebo treatment received\n      placebo QD. During the Maintenance Period, subjects had visits every 4 weeks.\n\n      Follow-up Period (2 weeks): Approximately 2 weeks after taking the last dose of study\n      medication, subjects returned to the study centre for the Follow-up Visit and underwent the\n      end-of-study evaluations."

The subject was instructed to complete the assessment daily on awakening.Primary analyses were conducted on the full analysis set (FAS) which consisted of all randomised subjects who received at least 1 dose of study medication and with at least 1 post-randomisation rating of 24-h-average pain. The primary efficacy variable was the absolute change from baseline to endpoint in mean pain recorded in a subject's diary upon awakening each morning. An ANCOVA on the FAS revealed no statistically significant differences between the 3 ESL groups and the placebo group after 13 weeks of treatment.",
