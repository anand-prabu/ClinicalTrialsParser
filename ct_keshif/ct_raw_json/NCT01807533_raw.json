The intervention group performs better in child, parent and transactions outcomes than\n           the control group throughout the follow-up period.\n\n        2. The intervention group shows greater changes in early neurophysiological brain\n           functions and transactions within the family that lead to better neurodevelopmental\n           outcomes than the control group.\n\n        3. Certain polymorphisms of the dopamine-related genes are associated with the\n           neurodevelopmental outcomes in VLBW preterm infants.\n\n        4. Very low birth weight preterm infants carrying more genetic plasticity in the\n           dopamine-related genes may benefit more from the interventions than those carrying less\n           genetic plasticity."

The neurophysiological and\n      transactions data will be examined for whether they mediate intervention effects on child\n      development. In addition, these infants and 153 VLBW preterm infants in our prior\n      intervention study will be collected buccal cells for assessment of the polymorphisms of\n      dopamine-related genes, which are involved in the neurotransmission of cognitive,\n      sensori-motor and behavioral-emotional systems and postulated to be associated with several\n      developmental and psychiatric illnesses.
