Trametinib may\n      stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.\n      Radiation therapy uses high energy x rays to kill tumor cells. Drugs, such as trametinib,\n      may make tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy. Giving trametinib with whole brain\n      radiation therapy may be an effective treatment for brain metastases."
