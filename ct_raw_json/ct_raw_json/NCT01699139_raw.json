Positional therapy, designed to minimize supine sleep, was reported to be\n      beneficial in the general sleep apnea population. As supine sleep is very common in stroke\n      patients, positional therapy might also have therapeutic effects. Given differences between\n      stroke patients with sleep apnea and the general sleep apnea patient, such as rolling\n      ability, body mass index and daytime sleepiness, positional therapy results in the general\n      population may not be applicable to the stroke patient.\n\n      The effects of positional therapy in ischemic stroke patients with OSA have not been\n      well-investigated. We therefore performed a pilot randomized, controlled, cross-over study\n      to test the following hypotheses: (1) positional therapy reduces the amount of nocturnal\n      supine positioning in patients with subacute ischemic stroke, and (2) severity of sleep\n      apnea improves, as reflected by apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), during positional therapy. The\n      tolerability of positional therapy over a 3-month period in patients with ischemic stroke\n      was also evaluated."
