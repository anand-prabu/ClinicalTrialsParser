Secondary objectives of the study include comparison of\n      2D- with real-time 3D-echocardiography in CHF patients and comparison of Speckle tracking\n      with tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) in CHF patients, and relating these echocardiographic\n      measurements to clinical outcome.\n\n      Bio-SHiFT is a prospective, observational, multi-center, cohort study in men and women, aged\n      18 years or older, visiting the outpatient clinic. Blood samples are taken at the day of\n      inclusion and at follow-up visits, which are performed every 3 months until the end of the\n      scheduled follow-up. Clinical data are collected at baseline and at each 3-month follow-up\n      visit. Echocardiography including TDI, Speckle tracking and 3D-echocardiography is performed\n      in a subset of patients, at baseline and during follow-up at 6-month intervals. The primary\n      endpoint is the composite of cardiovascular death, cardiac transplantation, left ventricular\n      assist device implantation, and re-hospitalization for the management of acute or worsened\n      heart failure."
