Drugs\n      used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin and docetaxel, work in different ways to stop the\n      growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.\n      Sorafenib tosylate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed\n      for cell growth. Sorafenib tosylate may also help cisplatin and docetaxel work better by\n      making tumor cells more sensitive to the drugs. Giving sorafenib tosylate, cisplatin, and\n      docetaxel may be an effective treatment for squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck."
