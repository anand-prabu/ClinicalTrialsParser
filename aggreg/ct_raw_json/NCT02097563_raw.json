            "textblock": "Despite impressive results in laboratory settings, there has been a significant lag in the\n      community adoption and sustainability of family interventions for early-onset mood and\n      psychotic disorders. Our objective is to determine the optimal methods of training and\n      monitoring the delivery of an evidence-based family-focused treatment (FFT) in community\n      providers who treat young patients (ages 13-25) with bipolar disorder (BD), psychosis, or\n      \"high-risk\" conditions. FFT is administered in 12 sessions of psychoeducation, communication\n      training, and problem-solving skills training. There are six randomized controlled trials\n      indicating that, among adults or adolescents with BD, bipolar spectrum, or psychosis-risk\n      disorders, FFT and pharmacotherapy are associated with more rapid stabilization of symptoms,\n      delayed recurrences, enhanced functioning, better medication adherence, and improvements in\n      family interaction relative to comparison treatments over 1-2 years. Using a community\n      partnered participatory approach, we will engage diverse stakeholders (clinicians,\n      administrators, caregivers) at three community sites (Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, San\n      Fernando Mental Health Center, Didi Hirsch Mental Health Center) that treat early-onset,\n      lower socioeconomic status, urban, and racially and ethnically diverse bipolar and psychosis\n      patients. We will partner with these 3 community sites to randomly assign 30 clinicians to\n      low intensity (web-based training plus low intensity supervision) or high intensity training\n      (live workshop and higher intensity supervision, i.e., weekly individual supervision with\n      fidelity feedback). Clinicians will administer FFT to up to 120 patients (ages 13-25) with\n      recent-onset mania, psychosis or high-risk conditions. We expect that 20 clinicians will\n      complete the treatment with 80 patients. Dependent variables will be empirically-derived\n      fidelity component scores over time as measured by supervisors and clinicians. We\n      hypothesize that after training, clinicians in both the high and low intensity groups will\n      attain minimum levels of fidelity required for certification in the four components.\n      However, clinicians in high intensity training will sustain higher levels of fidelity across\n      subsequent treatment cases, and will be more satisfied and more likely to adopt the FFT\n      model. This study will facilitate the translation of an evidence-based intervention and\n      identify effective treatment components to inform larger-scale dissemination of FFT in\n      community settings."
