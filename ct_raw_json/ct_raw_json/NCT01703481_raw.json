            "textblock": "This is a Phase 1 first-in-human, non-randomized (individuals will not be assigned by chance\n      to study treatments), open-label (individuals will know the identity of study treatments),\n      multicenter, 3-part, dose-escalation study. Each cycle will consist of 21 days of daily\n      continuous dosing or 28 days of intermittent dosing schedule. Part 1 is the dose-escalation\n      phase, which will be guided by pharmacokinetics and safety. Three to 6 new participants will\n      be enrolled in sequential cohorts (first cohort will receive the starting dose and\n      subsequent cohorts will receive increased doses of JNJ-42756493). Enrollment in each cohort\n      will be staggered; the second and third participant in every cohort will not be dosed until\n      the first participant in that cohort is beyond Day 7 of Cycle 1. If no dose-limiting\n      toxicities (DLTs) have been observed during the first week of Cycle 1 in the first\n      participant, the second and third participant in the cohort will initiate treatment. After\n      the last participants in each cohort completes Cycle 1 (DLT observation period of 21 days of\n      treatment), the Safety Evaluation Team (SET) will evaluate the safety for DLT determination\n      and the pharmacokinetic data and make the decision whether to escalate the dose in a new\n      cohort of 3 to 6 new participants. Dose escalation will halt when the maximum tolerated dose\n      (MTD) or when the plasma concentrations exceed the predefined cardiovascular threshold. The\n      total number of participants to be enrolled in Part 1 will depend on the dose level at which\n      the DLT will be achieved. Part 2 is the Dose Confirmation Phase, which consists of 1 biopsy\n      cohort. The study drug will be administered once daily on a continuous 21 day cycle at the\n      RP2D. Approximately 10 to 20 participants will be enrolled for treatment at the RP2D. In the\n      Part 2 biopsy cohort, tumor biopsies will be mandatory at pretreatment and during treatment\n      (Day 1 of Cycle 2) until pretreatment/post-treatment biopsy pairs are collected for at least\n      10 participants. Part 3 is the Dose Expansion Phase, which consists of 4 expansion cohorts\n      (Cohorts A, B, C, and D). In this cohort, study drug will be administered once daily on a\n      continuous 21-day cycle. Up to 15 subjects for each cohort will be enrolled before the\n      interim analysis and up to 30 additional subjects may be enrolled for treatment at the RP2D\n      to evaluate clinical responses. The study will take approximately 36 months to complete."
