It is not yet\n      known if giving radiation therapy after stem cell transplantation is more effective than\n      stem cell transplantation alone in treating relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to determine the effectiveness of radiation therapy in\n      treating patients who have relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and have undergone\n      autologous stem cell transplantation."

Patients are stratified according to\n      response to pre-salvage chemotherapy (primary refractory disease vs relapse), response to\n      post-salvage chemotherapy (complete/unconfirmed complete vs partial), and participating\n      center. Within 6-8 weeks after completion of autologous hematopoietic stem cell\n      transplantation, patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients undergo involved-field radiotherapy (IFRT) 5 days a week for 3-5 weeks\n           in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients undergo observation only. Quality of life in arm I is assessed at\n           baseline, on day 1 of IFRT, at weeks 2 and 4 during IFRT, at 1 month, 4 months, every 3\n           months for 2 years, every 6 months for 1 year, and then annually for 2 years. Quality\n           of life in arm II is assessed at baseline, 1 month, 2 months, every 3 months for 2\n           years, every 6 months for 1 year, and then annually for 2 years.\n\n      Patients are followed at 1 month, every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 1 year, and\n      then annually for 2 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 230 patients (115 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this\n      study within 4.2 years."
