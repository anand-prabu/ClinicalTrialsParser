  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aim of the study is to investigate the effects of
      Â±3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA; ecstasy) on social and emotional processing in
      healthy humans. Ecstasy is a widely used recreational drug, with over 2 million Americans
      reporting use of the drug in 2006. With this number of users, and evidence that high doses
      of MDMA are neurotoxic in laboratory animals, the public health implications of ecstasy use
      may be substantial. Certain subjective effects of this drug distinguish it from other
      stimulants, and may contribute to its widespread use: That is, users report that ecstasy
      produces profound feelings of empathy and closeness to others. These so-called
      'empathogenic' effects, which may reflect the distinctive neurochemical profile of action of
      the drug, have yet to be characterized in controlled laboratory studies. The investigators
      propose to characterize the effects of MDMA on measures of social and emotional processing
      that may contribute to this 'empathogenic' profile, including measures of emotion
      recognition, emotional responsiveness and sociability. The investigators will assess effects
      of MDMA (0, 0.75 and 1.5 mg/kg up to 125 mg) one active control drug (oxytocin: 20 or 40 IU)
      in 100 volunteers who report some prior ecstasy use. Oxytocin will be used because it
      appears to produce pro-social behavioral effects resembling those attributed to MDMA.
