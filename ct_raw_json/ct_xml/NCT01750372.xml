  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Standardized outcome measures can be used to document patient health outcomes and improve
      treatment of those requiring prosthetic and orthotic (O&amp;P) services. Though numerous
      instruments have been developed, existing measures of O&amp;P outcomes have serious shortcomings
      including limited evidence that the scores are responsive to clinical changes.

      The investigators are developing the Prosthetic Limb Users Survey-Mobility (PLUS-M) using
      modern measurement methods to be a brief, precise and flexible measure of mobility for
      persons with lower limb amputation. The investigators propose the following objectives to
      achieve this goal.

      Key objective 1: develop a measure (item bank) for measuring mobility in persons with lower
      limb loss

      Key objective 2: study health profiles of lower limb prosthetic users

      Key objective 3: validate the measure in a longitudinal study of people receiving
      replacement prosthetic limbs

      Key objective 4: study longitudinal health patterns of persons with lower limb amputation

PROMIS-29 is a 29-item survey designed to evaluate patients in seven health domains: physical function, anxiety, depression, fatigue, sleep disturbance, social role-participation, and pain interference.</description>
