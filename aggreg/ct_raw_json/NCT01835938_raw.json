Current combination therapy of pegylated\n      interferon-alfa, ribavirin and protease inhibitors is limited by resistance and substantial\n      side effects.\n\n      The investigators identified epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) as host factor for HCV\n      infection. Inhibition of kinase function of EGFR by approved inhibitor Erlotinib (TarcevaTM)\n      broadly inhibits HCV infection of all major genotypes including viral escape variants\n      resistant to host immune responses.\n\n      Completed preclinical proof-of-concept studies in HCV cell culture and animal model systems\n      demonstrate that inhibition of EGFR function by Erlotinib constitutes a novel antiviral\n      approach for prevention and treatment of HCV infection (European patent application EP 08\n      305 604.4, Filing date: September 26, 2008; Inserm, Paris, France and Lupberger et al.\n      Nature Medicine 2011).\n\n      Since Erlotinib (TarcevaTM) is an established approved drug for cancer treatment and has a\n      well characterized safety profile in humans, the aim of the study is to investigate the\n      safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of Erlotinib, a first-in-class entry inhibitor, for\n      treatment of HCV infection in a randomized placebo-controlled double blind clinical trial in\n      patients chronically infected with HCV. Following completion, this trial will set the stage\n      for a further investigation of entry inhibitors as antivirals in combination with standard\n      of care or direct antivirals such as HCV protease inhibitors. Thus, this randomized clinical\n      trial will be an important step in the development of novel urgently needed antiviral\n      therapies overcoming resistance."
