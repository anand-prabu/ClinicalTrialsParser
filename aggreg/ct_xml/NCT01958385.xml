    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, evaluator and subject blinded, parallel-group, controlled
      study intended to evaluate the safety and efficacy of treating obese patients with the
      placement of g-Cath EZ suture anchors followed by a structured diet and exercise plan as
      compared to a sham procedure followed by the same diet and exercise plan. Subjects will be
      randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to the treatment procedure followed by diet and exercise or
      the sham procedure followed by diet and exercise.  After un-blinding at 12 months
      post-treatment, sham patients can choose to have the treatment procedure as well.
