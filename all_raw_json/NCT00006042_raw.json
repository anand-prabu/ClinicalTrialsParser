Patients also receive tacrolimus IV or orally twice a day on days\n      4-50; oral mycophenolate mofetil on days 4-35; and filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously or IV\n      starting on day 4 and continuing until blood counts recover.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of cyclophosphamide until the minimum\n      effective dose necessary to induce chimerism without unacceptable toxicity in these patients\n      is determined.\n\n      Patients are followed at 2 and 6 months, at one year, and then annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: At least 23 patients will be accrued for this study."
