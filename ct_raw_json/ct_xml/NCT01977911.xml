      This study aims to test a new groundbreaking treatment for narrowing of the voicebox and
      upper windpipe, which can be due to injury, inflammatory disease or cancer treatment.
      Narrowing of the voicebox or upper windpipe can leave patients dependant on a tracheostomy
      tube to breath through (a tube or hole in the neck), which can require a high level of care
      with regular hospital visits and can lead to recurrent chest infections. Regular surgical
      procedures may be necessary to widen the airway. Speaking may be very difficult or not even
      possible, breathing is usually a struggle and swallowing can also be affected. Patients feel
      very tired all the time.

      The new treatment tested by this study is an implant that will partially replace the
      voicebox or upper windpipe in order to cure the narrowing. The implant is based on a human
      donor voicebox or windpipe that has been processed with detergents and enzymes in order to
      remove all the cells from the donor, leaving a 'scaffold' of connective tissue. The
      patient's own stem cells are removed from the bone marrow, then are grown on the scaffold in
      the laboratory. These cells will form the cartilage in the wall of the scaffold. Cells from
      the lining of the windpipe are also removed from the patient and grown on the inside of the
      scaffold. The implant can be considered 'living' due to the cells grown on it, and this type
      of treatment is referred to as 'tissue engineering' or 'regenerative medicine'.

      Once these cells have attached and started to grow on the scaffold, it is ready to be
      implanted into the patient, and an operation is performed which occurs in two separate
      stages. The final stage of the operation involves removing the narrow section of voicebox or
      upper windpipe and implanting the scaffold to reconstruct it. Patients will be followed up
      for two years after this operation, with investigations such as CT scans, examination of the
      voicebox and windpipe with a flexible camera (bronchoscopy) and blood tests performed at
      specific times.

      It is intended that this treatment will significantly improve patients' symptoms resulting
      in better breathing, swallowing and voice function, reducing the need for repeated hospital
      visits and procedures and enhancing patients' quality of life.

      The RegenVOX trial is a phase I/IIa safety and potential efficacy clinical trial of
      tissue-engineered laryngotracheal replacement using autologous-derived cells and
      decellularised human donor scaffolds in 10 patients with severe acquired laryngotracheal
      stenosis.

      Current solutions for the treatment of advanced structural disorders of the larynx such as
      trauma, inflammatory disorders or following cancer treatment are suboptimal and patients
      with such problems require frequent hospitalisation. A regenerative solution that restores
      the anatomy of the larynx would provide a definitive treatment for these patients, improve
      the outcome of resection for malignant disease, avoid some laryngectomies and would reduce
      the threshold for performing surgery over administering chemotherapy thereby reducing
      morbidity. Giving patients a once-only therapy of a life-time functional living replacement
      would allow patients to lead tracheostomy-free lives with improved breathing, swallowing and
      speech and a lower requirement for hospital follow-up.

      This project is a clinical trial of tissue engineered partial laryngeal replacements in 10
      patients with end-stage laryngeal stenosis. The intervention is based on a human donor graft
      scaffold which is decellularised and then seeded with autologous mesenchymal stem
      cell-derived chondrocytes externally and autologous epithelial cell sheets internally.
      Following expansion of these cells ex-vivo, the graft is implanted. This is the first
      clinical trial to our knowledge of a stem-call based organ replacement.

      Inclusion criteria are patients 18-70 years of age with Myer-Cotton Grade 3 or 4
      laryngotracheal stenosis or malacia due to traumatic, inflammatory, iatrogenic, or
      idiopathic causes who have exhausted conventional therapies.

      Exclusion criteria include pregnancy, those unable to provide informed consent, co-morbid
      chronic pulmonary disease patients with active/uncontrolled chronic inflammatory or
      infectious conditions such as Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis and sarcoidosis, and any
      current or previous cancer within 10 years (except basal cell skin cancer, adequately
      treated carcinoma-in-situ of the uterine cervix and locally treated carcinoma of the larynx
      without spread).

      The primary outcome measure is safety as defined by morbidity and mortality as measured by
      occurrence of adverse events. Secondary outcome is efficacy as defined by absence of
      tracheostomy tube, absence of stent, improvement in mean airway diameter, improvement in
      FEV1, improvement in Global Quality of life (SF-12 Health Survey), improvement in maximum
      phonation time (MPT) and improvement in self-assessment of voice handicap (VHI-10).

      Patients will be followed up for 2 years within this study. Key milestones will be assessed
      at 6 and 12 months. The follow-up regimen includes bronchoscopy and airway brushings taken
      at 1 week post implantation and full physical assessment including CT imaging, pulmonary
      function tests, blood tests and bronchoscopy at 1, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months. Telephone
      follow-up will take place in between these assessments.

      This trial will provide a level of insight into the real clinical potential for stem
      cell/tissue engineering combined technologies. The results will have wide implications for
      the development of hollow organ- replacements such as those for oesophagus, bowel and
      vascular disorders. We will also develop new pathways for maximising discovery science and
      health economic benefit from complex regenerative medicine therapies (a reverse
      translational route map), with important generic benefits for scientists and clinicians.

        equivalent due to traumatic, inflammatory, iatrogenic, or idiopathic causes who have
        exhausted conventional therapies.

        *The Myer-Cotton grading system for mature, firm, circumferential stenosis, confined to
        the subglottis describes the stenosis based on the per cent relative reduction in
        cross-sectional area of the subglottis. Four grades of stenosis:

          -  grade 1 lesions have less than 50% obstruction

          -  grade 2 lesions have 51% to 70% obstruction

          -  grade 3 lesions have 71% to 99% obstruction

          -  grade 4 lesions have no detectable lumen or complete stenosis

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnancy

          -  Those unable to provide informed consent

          -  Co-morbid moderate or severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (according to NICE
             clinical guideline CG101[3]

          -  Patients with active / uncontrolled chronic inflammatory conditions such as
             granulomatosis with polyangitis (formerly known as Wegener's granulomatosis) and

          -  Life expectancy less than 5 years unless such limitation is largely due to the airway
             stenosis to be treated herein (as assessed by consultant trial clinician or referring
             clinician)
