This study will be the\n      first clinical trial evaluating fosaprepitant in patients receiving multi-day cisplatin.\n      This will be a single arm, phase II study. The investigators propose to utilize intravenous\n      (IV) fosaprepitant on days 3 and 5 of the 5-day cisplatin chemotherapy regimen. It is\n      anticipated that fosaprepitant can suppress delayed chemo-induced nausea and vomiting for\n      2-5 days after therapy. This study will test the value of fosaprepitant in this patient\n      population."
