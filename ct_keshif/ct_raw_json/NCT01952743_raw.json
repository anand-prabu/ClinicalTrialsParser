Pulmonary vein isolation along with additional substrate medication\n      is commonly performed during ablation procedures is associated with 60-80% success rate for\n      maintenance of sinus rhythm. After AF ablation hypertension (HTN) is a strong predictor for\n      recurrence of atrial fibrillation. Drug resistant hypertension can be effectively treated\n      with catheter based renal denervation therapy. Our primary hypothesis is concomitant renal\n      denervation therapy along with AF ablation is associated with improvement in success rates\n      of AF ablation along with adequate control of blood pressure. The specific objectives of\n      this study are to prospectively compare success rates, time to AF recurrence, AF burden and\n      blood pressure controls in patients randomized to concomitant renal denervation arm when\n      compared to patients with AF ablation alone."
