  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The world's population is aging and the resulting prevalence of chronic illnesses is a
      challenge that our society must address. The vision is to address this challenge by
      designing smart environment technologies that keep older adults functioning independently in
      their own homes as long as possible. Smart environments have been used as the basis of
      monitoring activities for residents with health conditions.  However, there is currently a
      lack of large scale, longitudinal research to identify early markers of dementia and other
      health status changes and to predict functional decline. The objective of this project is to
      perform a 5-year longitudinal study of older adults performing daily activities in their own
      smart homes.

    <textblock>
      By tracking residents' daily behavior over a long period of time our intelligent software
      can perform automated functional assessment and identify trends that are indicators of acute
      health changes and slower progressive decline (e.g., dementia). By implementing prompt-based
      interventions that support functional independence and promote healthy lifestyle behaviors
      (e.g., social contact, exercise, regular sleep), the investigators can improve overall
      health and well-being. The investigators hypothesize that smart home technologies can be
      used to detect and predict functional change, to slow functional change and extend
      functional independence, and to improve quality of life in elderly individuals who are at
      risk of transitioning to mild cognitive impairment and to dementia. This hypothesis has been
      formulated on the basis of preliminary data produced by the applicants which supports the
      efficacy of using smart home technologies for both functional status assessment and for
      prompting the initiation and completion of activities in individuals with mild cognitive
      impairment and dementia. The rationale of the proposed work is that understanding the
      natural history of functional change between aging and dementia will lead to early
      prevention and proactive interventions that will slow functional change, thereby delaying
      nursing home placement and cost of care to society. The investigators plan to pursue the
      following specific aims: (1) Characterize the daily lifestyle of smart environment residents
      through minimal-supervision activity recognition and activity discovery, (2) Design software
      algorithms that detect trends in behavioral data, and (3) Evaluate the efficacy of
      activity-aware automated prompting technology for extending functional independence and
      improving quality of life. The proposed work is innovative because it will track a large
      number of individuals longitudinal in their own homes and determine whether this technology
      can be used to promote healthy lifestyle behaviors and detect health care changes that may
      lead to early interventions, improved quality of life, and decreased health care
      utilization. The project is significant because it will introduce new technologies for
      activity discovery and tracking that require minimal-supervision, contribute algorithms that
      predict cognitive decline and signal more acute health status change, and demonstrate for
      the first time that activity-aware automated prompting technologies can be used to support
      and/or slow functional change and to increase quality of life in elderly individuals.
