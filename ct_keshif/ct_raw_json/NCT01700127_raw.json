The subjects will be randomized into one of the two study arms. In one of the group\n      caregivers will be advised to breastfeed immediately prior to and after each dose of the\n      vaccine while in the other group caregivers will be advised to withhold breastfeeding for 30\n      minutes before and after each dose of the vaccine. The other childhood vaccines i.e. OPV and\n      Pentavalent will be administered at least 30 minutes after administration of Rotarix\u00ae, The\n      enrolled subjects will be followed up for 4 weeks after the 2nd dose of Rotarix\u00ae."
