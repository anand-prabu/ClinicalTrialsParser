Certain drugs may help improve ovarian activity in such women as\n      metformin. Oral administration of metformin is accompanied by undesirable side effects. The\n      vagina proved to be a good alternative to the oral route for other drugs. Using metformin\n      through the vagina and avoidance of such side effects, while maintaining its effectiveness,\n      would help women to better tolerate this drug."

A variety\n      of drugs have been used to help improve follicular dynamics in PCOS patients. Metformin, an\n      insulin sensitizer long known for its antidiabetic properties, has been used in PCOS\n      patients. One of the major factors affecting compliance are the gastrointestinal side\n      effects associated with oral administration of metformin. Knowing that the vagina is a good\n      absorptive surface for many drugs, it is postulated that vaginal administration of metformin\n      could be a good alternative to the oral route, if it proves effective. Both pharmacokinetic\n      and clinical evidences of efficacy are traced for the vaginal route of administration."
