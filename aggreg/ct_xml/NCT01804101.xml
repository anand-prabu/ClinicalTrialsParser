      This clinical trial studies liposomal cytarabine-daunorubicin CPX-351 in treating patients
      with untreated myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukemia. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as liposomal cytarabine-daunorubicin CPX-351, work in different ways to
      stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from
      dividing.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Estimate whether the 32 units/m^2 or the 64 units/m^2 or both dose levels of CPX-351
      (liposomal cytarabine-daunorubicin CPX-351) are likely to improve treatment-related
      mortality (TRM) rate while keeping the complete remission (CR) rate constant in patients
      with untreated high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or non-acute promyelocytic leukemia
      (APL) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) at high risk of TRM.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Describe the CR/CR with incomplete platelet count recovery (CRp) rate after up to 4
      cycles of induction/re-induction therapy.

      II. Describe the event-free survival, disease-free survival, and overall survival of
      patients who achieve CR/CRp.

      III. Estimate the frequency and severity of regimen-associated toxicities.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I:

      INDUCTION/RE-INDUCTION: Patients receive lower-dose liposomal cytarabine-daunorubicin
      CPX-351 intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes on days 1, 3, and 5. Treatment repeats every 40
      days for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients
      achieving CR or CRp continue on to consolidation.

      CONSOLIDATION: Patients receive lower-dose liposomal cytarabine-daunorubicin CPX-351 IV over
      90 minutes on days 1 and 3. Treatment repeats every 40 days for 4 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II:

      INDUCTION/RE-INDUCTION: Patients receive higher-dose liposomal cytarabine-daunorubicin
      CPX-351 IV over 90 minutes on days 1, 3, and 5. Treatment repeats every 40 days for 4
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving
      CR or CRp continue on to consolidation.

      CONSOLIDATION: Patients receive higher-dose liposomal cytarabine-daunorubicin CPX-351 IV
      over 90 minutes on days 1 and 3. Treatment repeats every 40 days for 4 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 1 month.
