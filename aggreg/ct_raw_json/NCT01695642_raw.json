There are very few studies that have been performed to evaluate\n      long-term outcomes after LASIK.\n\n      In this study, we will assess long-term outcomes 5 - 10 years after LASIK to assess\n      stability of visual outcomes and long-term effect on corneal morphology with in vivo\n      confocal microscopy. Clinical and corneal morphology outcomes will also be compared between\n      patients who had flaps created with the microkeratome and femtosecond laser."
