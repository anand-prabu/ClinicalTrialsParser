In the present study we will include 76 subjects who have participated in an\n      intervention study with vitamin D (20.000 IU per week) versus placebo for the prevention of\n      type 2 diabetes, and who have completed the study after 5 years or who have been excluded\n      because of diagnosed type 2 diabetes or for other reasons. If vitamin D is stored to any\n      extent in the body the subjects given 20.000 IU vitamin D per week for 2-5 years will have a\n      considerable amount of stored vitamin D and accordingly, a slow decline in serum 25(OH)D\n      during the following year without vitamin D substitution, which will be measured in the\n      present study. If our hypothesis is correct, that vitamin D can be stored in significant\n      amounts when the supply is abundant; current advice on vitamin D supplementation mainly\n      during winter should be changed to \"year around\" in order to build up sufficient stores for\n      the months without sufficient sun light."
