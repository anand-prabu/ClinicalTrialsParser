However,CRN was once regarded as a progressive and irreversible disease, no standard\n      therapy has been suggested for CRN. In our clinical practice, we have used nerve growth\n      factor(NGF) to treat CRN, and found that GM1 can successfully reverse CRN. A case report has\n      been published in Journal of Clinical Oncology (JCO) in 2011. So we carried out this\n      prospective study to test the efficacy of NGF for CRN."
