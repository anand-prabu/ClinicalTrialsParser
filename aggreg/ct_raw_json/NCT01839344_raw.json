Acarbose (100mg oral), a pharmaceutical alpha-glucosidase\n      inhibitor, will serve as a positive control.\n\n      Secondary Hypothesis: We hypothesize that administration of quercetin (2g oral) will reduce\n      the Area Under the Glucose Curve (AUC) for the 2 hours following a 100g MTT compared to\n      placebo. AUC is hypothesized to be comparable between quercetin and Acarbose.\n\n      Tertiary hypothesis: We hypothesize that administration of quercetin (2g oral) prior to a\n      100g MTT will result in a smaller reduction in flow mediated dilation (FMD) measured as an\n      increase in Reactive Hyperemia Index (RHI) at 90 minutes compared to placebo."

Each participant will serve as their own control and comparison for each of the\n      interventions.\n\n      Fasting and post-MTT endothelial function will be measured by peripheral tonometry (Itamar\n      EndoPAT (Peripheral Arterial Tone) 2000) and reported as reactive hyperemia index (RHI).\n      EndoPAT testing will be performed prior to the fasting blood collection and then again at 90\n      minutes following the MTT, during each clinical research visit.\n\n      Exploratory data will also be collected on post-MTT increases in gamma-glutamyltransferase\n      (GGT)."

As lack of clarity in ICD-9 coding by\n             providers is notorious in type 2 diabetes, we will specify ICD-9 diagnosis 250.XX in\n             order to capture all subtypes of type 2 diabetes (see ICD-9 book for more information\n             on subtypes).\n\n          -  Patients on a stable dose (consistent dose for one month) of all medications and\n             supplements.\n\n          -  Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) of 6.5-10.5% within the last year.
