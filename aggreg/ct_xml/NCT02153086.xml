    <description>The frequencies of all adverse events observed during the observation period will be tabulated by type and seriousness. Adverse events are defined as any unfavorable and unintended signs, symptoms or diseases temporally associated with administration of ramelteon whether or not it was considered related to treatment. Among these, events that are considered as having a causal relationship with ramelteon are defined as adverse drug reactions.</description>
