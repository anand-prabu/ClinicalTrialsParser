One explanation is that the GL of a meal may interact with a\n      person's pre-existing glucose tolerance (GT).\n\n      As older adults have a higher incidence of glucose tolerance and are more likely to\n      experience memory problems the present study considers the interaction between the GL of\n      meal in those with better or poorer GT.\n\n      The population studied will not have a history of diabetes or dementia.  A battery of\n      cognitive tests will be administered after meals sweetened with one of three sugars known to\n      vary in the rate that they release glucose into the blood stream."
