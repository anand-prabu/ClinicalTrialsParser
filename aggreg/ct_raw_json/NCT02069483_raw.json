After completing a\n      phone screener, participants will complete a baseline phone survey. Within two weeks of the\n      baseline survey, participants will come to an in-person session.  At that time they will be\n      randomized with equal probability to one of two conditions: 1) Motivational Interviewing\n      (MI), or 2) tailored feedback on reasons for quitting. After undergoing MI or receiving\n      tailored feedback, participants will be asked to generate message that they feel would\n      motivate them to quit. These messages will be both text and audio. After generating and\n      reviewing these messages, participants will then evaluate these messages before ending the\n      laboratory session. Starting two days after their laboratory session, between 8:00am and\n      9:00am, staff will send participants one of the self-generated text messages with a link to\n      also hear the message; this process will last for two weeks. Within a week of stopping\n      sending messages, participants will be asked to complete a final phone survey to elicit\n      smoking behaviors and provided feedback on the messaging."
