            "textblock": "OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the radioimmunodetection performance of the imaging agent\n      technetium Tc 99m LL2 monoclonal antibody (LymphoScan) in patients with low, intermediate,\n      and high grade B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. II. Define the safety of an initial\n      administration of technetium Tc 99m LL2 monoclonal antibody in these patients. III.\n      Demonstrate that diagnostic imaging with this agent can correctly stage patients who have\n      been diagnosed with this disease similarly to noninvasive conventional diagnostic modalities\n      (CDMs), primarily CT scan and bone scan. IV. Demonstrate that imaging with technetium Tc 99m\n      LL2 monoclonal antibody is at least as sensitive for detecting disease in various body sites\n      as any other standard diagnostic imaging method. V. Compare patient management plans based\n      on CDMs alone, technetium Tc 99m LL2 monoclonal antibody alone, and both CDMs and technetium\n      Tc 99m LL2 monoclonal antibody. VI. Describe the human antimouse antibody production in\n      these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is an open label, multicenter study. After all other diagnostic studies have\n      been completed, patients receive an infusion of technetium Tc 99m LL2 monoclonal antibody by\n      IV injection or infused over 20-30 minutes as part of their staging procedures. Planar\n      images are acquired between 4-8 hours and 18-24 hours following antibody injection, and\n      single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) imaging is performed between 4-8\n      hours following antibody injection. Patients may receive a repeat injection of technetium Tc\n      99m LL2 monoclonal antibody. Patients are followed for 3 to 6 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: At least 100 patients will be accrued into this study."
