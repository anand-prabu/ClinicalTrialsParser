Follow-up was 4 to 23 months. The outcome\n      measures for this study were the operative safety and post-operative pain, adverse effects\n      and anatomical as well as functional cure.\n\n      Setting: The operations were performed under general anesthesia according with the reported\n      surgical techniques at university and private hospitals."
