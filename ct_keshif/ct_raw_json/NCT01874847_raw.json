            "textblock": "PURPOSE: The long-term goal of this line of research is to develop rational, biologically\n      based evidence for the treatment of post-concussion syndrome (PCS) in children. The\n      objective of this application is to examine the effect of melatonin on the symptoms of PCS\n      and its neurobiology using integrated neurodiagnostic techniques in children.\n\n      OVERVIEW: PCS is a constellation of clinical symptoms including physical (i.e. headaches),\n      cognitive (i.e. memory), and behavioral disturbances. PCS is associated with significant\n      morbidity in the child and his/her family), and yet there are no evidence-based medical\n      treatments available. This suggests an urgent need to develop novel treatment options to\n      improve outcomes for children suffering from PCS. Melatonin has several relevant mechanisms\n      of action, and neuroprotective effects. Recent research suggests that the explanations for\n      persistent PCS symptoms may be due to alterations in neurotransmissions and neuronal\n      circuitry, particularly involving the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Investigators\n      have two specific aims:\n\n        1. To determine if treatment with melatonin improves PCS in children following mild\n           traumatic brain injury. Hypothesis: treatment of mTBI children with PCS with 3mg or\n           10mg of oral melatonin for 28 days will result in a decrease in PCS symptoms as\n           compared with placebo. Effects will be dose-dependent and may be independent of sleep\n           effects. Methods: A randomized double blind, placebo controlled trial (RCT); Outcome\n           measure is a PCS symptom questionnaire. A subsequent RCT will then be performed using\n           the optimal melatonin dose at a second centre.\n\n        2. To understand the neurophysiological mechanisms of paediatric PCS and assess any\n           resultant effects of treatment with melatonin. Methods: A case-controlled study within\n           the RCT, using functional MRI and Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation to investigate the\n           neurophysiological properties of paediatric mTBI before and after treatment; Treatment\n           groups from the RCT will be compared with two control groups: i) normal controls and\n           ii) asymptomatic mTBI children.\n\n      SIGNIFICANCE: This study has the potential to 1) provide a safe and effective treatment for\n      PCS and 2) will provide valuable information about the neurophysiological properties of the\n      brain associated with PCS following mTBI in children and how these change with symptom\n      resolution."
