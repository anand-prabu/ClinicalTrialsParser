The primary outcome is\n      subjects' pain score with suction curettage on a 0-100 21-point scale.  Secondary outcomes\n      include pain scores with cervical dilation and 15 minutes post-procedure, subjective pain\n      ratings, incidents of side effects and adverse events, the frequency of additional doses of\n      medication, recovery room time, and physician assessment of and satisfaction with pain\n      control.  Investigators hypothesize that this algorithm will result in improved pain\n      control, decreased frequency of additional medication doses, improved patient and physician\n      satisfaction, without differences in side effects, adverse events or recovery room time."
