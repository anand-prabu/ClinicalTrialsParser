            "textblock": "During the ERAMUNE-01 and -02 studies, the HIV-DNA quantification in the PBMCs (Peripheral\n      Blood Mononuclear Cells) showed showed that some patients had a very low or undetectable\n      reservoir.\n\n      Recent studies showed that a low reservoir is associated to a spontaneous virologic control\n      in three specific categories of patients:\n\n        -  \"Elite Controllers\": these rare patients are able to spontaneously maintain an HIV-RNA\n           viral load below 50 copies/mL and elevated CD4 counts without any treatment. These\n           patients belong to the B27/B57 haplotypes associated to a reduced risk of HIV\n           contamination but these haplotypes are very rare in the global population (0,3 %)\n\n        -  \"Visconti\" patients: early-treated patients, during the primo-infection stage. After 3\n           to 5 years of treatment, these patients are able to maintain an undetectable HIV-RNA\n           viral load.\n\n        -  \"Salto\" patients: these patients are treated a bit later compared to the Visconti\n           cohort, when their CD4 count was above 350 cells/mm3 and their HIV-RNA viral load below\n           50 000 copies/mL. The follow-up of these patients showed the same capacity of control\n           of the HIV infection for at least 2 years following treatment interruption.\n\n      Taking into account these 3 categories of patients which common characteristics is a low\n      reservoir, our objective is to answer the 2 following questions:\n\n        1. Is it possible to discontinue the treatment in chronically-infected patients with a\n           \"normal\" immune system and with an undetectable HIV-DNA reservoir?\n\n        2. Is a low viral reservoir predictive of a treatment-free remission of the HIV infection\n           in chronically-infected patients?\n\n      The main objective of the proof-of-concept ERAMUNE-03 trial is to evaluate the proportion of\n      patients in success (i.e. able to maintain a virologic and an immunologic control of the\n      infection) after treatment discontinuation, failure is defined as:\n\n        -  An HIV-RNA viral load > 400 copies/mL on 2 consecutive tests starting from Week 4\n\n        -  Or  CD4 count < 400 cells/mm3 on 2 consecutive measures starting from Week 4\n\n        -  Or the onset of an AIDS-related event"
