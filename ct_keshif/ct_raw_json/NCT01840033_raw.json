            "textblock": "Home parenteral nutrition (HPN) is the reference treatment for anatomic or fonctionnal\n      chronic intestinal failure.  Nutritionnal catheter must follow two rules: low infection rate\n      and be able to preserve the permeability of the central vein.  Today, in europeen\n      guidelines, two types of central devices are recommended: tunnelled central catheter with\n      cuff and implanted ports.  However, their insertion is not without risk.  Since many years,\n      we have seen a new generation of catheter - peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC\n      line)- which have many advantage over other central catheter.  ESPEN guidelines accept the\n      use of PICC line in short and moderate-term for HPN, but no prospective study have look for\n      long-term used in HPN.\n\n      The objective of our study is to evaluate in a prospective randomised monocenter study the\n      no-inferiority of PICC line to tunnelled central catheter with cuff for serious catheter\n      related-complications such as infection and thrombophlebitis for patient on HPN over 1 month\n      of duration. The secondary objectives are to: evaluate the number of patients with at least\n      one serious complications related in 1000 days of used, the rate of minors and majors\n      complications, number of catheter inserted, the satisfaction of patients and doctors.\n\n      The study is held in CHU Nice and will be proposed to hospitalized patients who will need\n      HPN.  After consent, patients will be randomized to receive PICC Line (group A) of\n      nutritional central catheter with cuff (group B). Echography of vessels will be held at the\n      beginning, 3 months and 12 months.  Follow-up will be conduct at regular interval (month\n      0-1-3-6-9-12).  The duration of follow-up will be of 12 months and the global duration of\n      the study will be 36 months.  One major complication will conduct to withdrawal of the\n      study.  There will be 55 patients in each group."
