  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of overweight and obesity are increasing worldwide.  In the U.S.,
      approximately 85,000 new cancer cases per year are related to obesity.  Understanding
      lifestyle behaviors, their causes, and relations to cancer are critical.   Where people
      spend their time during the day may be related to their risk of getting cancer. This project
      will assess behaviors in different locations across the day and relate exposure to different
      environments to biological outcomes.
