The safety of this drug\n      combination will also be studied.\n\n      Ipilimumab is designed to increase the immune system's ability to fight cancer.\n\n      ABI-007 is designed to stop cancer cells from making new DNA (the genetic material of\n      cells).  This may stop the cancer cells from dividing into new cells."

            "textblock": "Study Drug Administration:\n\n      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will receive ABI-007 by vein\n      over about 30 minutes on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day cycle.  During the first 3 months\n      that you receive ABI-007, you will also receive ipilimumab.  You will receive ipilimumab by\n      vein over about 90 minutes.  You will receive it 4 times, each time about 3 weeks apart.\n\n      You will be given standard drugs to help decrease the risk of side effects.  You may ask the\n      study staff for information about how the drugs are given and their risks.\n\n      Study Tests:\n\n      Every week, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for routine tests.\n\n      Before each cycle of ABI-007:\n\n        -  Your performance status will be recorded.\n\n        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs.\n\n        -  Blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for routine tests.\n\n        -  Blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for tests of the immune system (first 3 cycles\n           only).\n\n        -  You will be asked about any other drugs you may be taking and about any side effects\n           you may be having.\n\n        -  If you are able to become pregnant, you will have a blood (about 1 teaspoon) or urine\n           pregnancy test.\n\n      Every 8 weeks (+/- 7 days), you will have a chest x-ray and CT scans or MRI scans performed\n      to check the status of the disease.\n\n      Length of Study:\n\n      You may receive ipilimumab for up to 3 months.  You may continue taking ABI-007 for as long\n      as the doctor thinks it is in your best interest.  You will no longer be able to take the\n      study drugs if the disease gets worse or intolerable side effects occur.\n\n      If you stop receiving the study drugs for any reason, you will have an End-of-Treatment\n      Visit.\n\n      End-of-Treatment Visit:\n\n      Within 14 days after you stop study treatment, you will come into the clinic for the\n      End-of-Treatment Visit.  At this visit, the following tests will be performed:\n\n        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs and weight.\n\n        -  You will be asked about any other drugs you may be taking and any side effects you may\n           be having.\n\n        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.\n\n        -  If the study doctor thinks it is in your best interest, you will have a CT scan or MRI\n           scan to check for side effects.\n\n      Every 2 months for 6 months, then every 3 months for up to 2 years, you will also be\n      contacted by telephone or during a routine clinic visit to see how you are doing.  If you\n      are called, each call should last about 5 minutes.\n\n      This is an investigational study.  Ipilimumab is FDA approved and commercially available for\n      the treatment of metastatic melanoma.  ABI-007 is FDA approved and commercially available\n      for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer.  It is investigational to use ABI-007, either\n      alone or in combination with ipilimumab, for the treatment of metastatic melanoma.\n\n      Up to 64 patients will take part in this study.  All will be enrolled at MD Anderson."
