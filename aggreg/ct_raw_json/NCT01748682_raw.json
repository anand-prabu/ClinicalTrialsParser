As there is no description of\n      comparative studies on diet of normal consistency, using solids and liquids, there are\n      doubts as to the real need for consistency liquid diet in preoperative bariatric surgery.\n      The lack of robust evidence has made nutrition professionals adopt different procedures.\n      There is still a belief that these patients are unable to lose weight in the preoperative\n      period, the ongoing history of previous attempts without success."
