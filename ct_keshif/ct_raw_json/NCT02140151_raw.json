In addition, baseline\n      characteristics of high-risk eyes (fundus features, optical coherence tomography (OCT)\n      parameters and genetic profile) will be evaluated to determine their predictive value in\n      conversion to exudative AMD.  The effect of ranibizumab on the atrophic component of AMD\n      will also be monitored."
