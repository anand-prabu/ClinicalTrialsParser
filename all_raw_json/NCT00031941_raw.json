Within 4-10 days, patients begin second course and\n      receive oral CC-5013 once daily on days 1-21. Subsequent courses repeat every 28 days in the\n      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of CC-5013 until the maximum tolerated dose\n      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 3\n      or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed at 2 weeks.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-51 patients will be accrued for this study."
