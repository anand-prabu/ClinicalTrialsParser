  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The  availability  of  HIV  care  and  treatment  programs  is  increasing  in  sub-Saharan
      Africa.  However more than half the patients who need HIV treatment are still not receiving
      antiretroviral therapy (ART).  This can lead to early death from AIDS. Additionally, many
      patients start ART late after the HIV disease is very advanced. This results in high death
      rates soon after starting ART. The factors that contribute to late ART initiation are still
      unclear. This study will identify factors that help patients to enroll or prevent them from
      enrolling into HIV care and starting ART on time. We will examine the characteristics of all
      patients initiating ART at study sites.  We will also look at potential risk factors among
      patients who initiate ART late (cases) compared to patients who initiate earlier (controls)
      at 6 HIV care and treatment clinics in Ethiopia. Data will be collected using 2 methods:

        1. Face-to-face interviews with participants using questionnaires

        2. Obtaining clinical data from the electronic patient-level database

      Identifying factors that help patients to start or prevent them from starting ART on time
      will help to direct interventions, programs and policies to reduce early death.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Although HIV care and treatment programs are being scaled up in sub-Saharan
      Africa, more than 50% of the patients in need of ART are  not receiving it and there is
      still significant mortality from AIDS. One of the major challenges is high rates of late ART
      initiation (i.e., in the advanced stages of HIV disease) which results in high rates of
      mortality soon after initiation of ART. The individual-level factors that contribute to late
      ART initiation are still unclear. Objective:  As the 3rd part of  a  3-phase  NIH-sponsored
      project,  this  study  aims  to  identify individual-level enablers and barriers to timely
      enrollment into HIV care and ART initiation.

      Methods: We will be recruiting all patients newly initiating ART at the study sites for
      descriptive analysis (approximately 1,200).  As a sub-analysis, we will be utilizing a
      case-control approach to examine potential individual risk factors (e.g. knowledge and
      behaviors around HIV care and treatment,  experience  of  stigma,  and  other  perceived
      barriers  and  enablers  to  earlier  HIV diagnosis, enrollment into care, and ART
      initiation) among 360 patients who initiated ART late (CD4 count &lt;150 cells/µL compared to
      360 patients who initiated earlier (CD4≥200) at 6 HIV care and treatment clinics in
      Ethiopia. For both the descriptive study and case-control study, data will be collected
      using 2 methods:

        1. Face-to-face interviews with participants using structured questionnaires

        2. Abstraction of clinical data from the electronic patient-level database to capture
           patient information at baseline, 6 and 12 months after enrollment in the study

      Expected  use  of  results: Identifying  individual-level  enablers  and  barriers  of
      timely  ART initiation will facilitate implementation of interventions, programs and
      policies to mitigate the problem of late ART initiation.

Individuals initiating ART with CD4 counts of 150-199 cells per µL and at WHO Stage I-III will be excluded from the case-control analysis in order to ensure meaningful distinction between the two groups. We will enroll 720 patients for the case control study nested in the prospective cohort, which will include 360 cases and 360 controls, who will be frequency matched by sex, month of ART initiation, and clinic.</description>
