  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pseudomonas is a common and virulent respiratory bacteria in patients with Cystic Fibrosis
      (CF). With time, the infection with Pseudomonas becomes chronic and very difficult to
      eradicate. The standard treatment of chronic Pseudomonas infection is inhaled Tobramycin
      which is given every other month.. Inhalation of Tobramycin was proven as an effective
      treatment that improves the respiratory function and reduces the concentration of bacteria
      in the sputum. However,  inhaled treatment lasts between 15 to 30 minutes twice a day and
      therefore adherence is a major problem. The effect of switching from inhalation treatment to
      inhaler treatment on patient's adherence and quality of life has not been studied.
