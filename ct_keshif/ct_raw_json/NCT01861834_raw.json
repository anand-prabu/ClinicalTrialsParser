The subject may continue Omegaven under this protocol at the discretion of\n        the Principle Investigator.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n        Patients with a history of the following will be excluded from enrollment in this\n        protocol:\n\n          -  Allergy to fish or egg protein.\n\n          -  Liver disease proven or suspected to be caused by a process other than TPN-dependent\n             short bowel syndrome, including but not limited to hepatitis C, hepatitis B, cystic\n             fibrosis, biliary atresia, Alagille syndrome, familial intrahepatic cholestasis, and\n             alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency.11\n\n          -  Refusal of third party providers to reimburse hospital for the cost of Omegaven\u00ae."
