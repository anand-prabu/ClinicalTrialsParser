  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sorafenib and pazopanib are both effective and promising treatments for advanced RCC. Both
      drugs are registered for this indication. No prospective comparative data in advanced RCC
      (or other indications) have been published. A search in the clinicaltrials.gov database did
      not reveal any planned or ongoing studies. As sequential therapy is now the standard of
      treatment for advanced RCC it is important to evaluate in clinical trials what the value of
      different sequential strategies is. This needs to be done every time new agents are
      introduced into the treatment armamentarium. As there are no data yet on the sequential use
      of sorafenib followed by pazopanib or vice versa, this sequence, however, will most
      certainly be used in daily practice, it is required to examine efficacy and safety of this
      sequential approach in a clinical trial in a randomized setting.

      Therefore, the investigators have designed an open randomized study in patients not
      previously treated for advanced RCC. Suitable patients will be randomized (1:1) in 2 groups.
