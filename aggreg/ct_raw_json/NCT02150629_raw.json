We will record patients with various aetiologies, grades\n        of impairment and types of spinal cord lesions. Patients need to have minimal voluntary\n        motor capacities: the motor scores of the key muscles according to the ASIA classification\n        (www.asia-spinalinjury.org) should be at least 3 for extensor muscles and 2 for flexor\n        muscles. Written informed consent is required. Control subjects: Healthy subjects, written\n        informed consent.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n        Patients: Comorbidities which influence or inhibit gait or upper-limb motion (e.g.\n        peripheral nerve lesions). Orthostatic problems that greatly impair upright body position.\n        Mental illness, cognitive impairments. Control subjects: neurologic disease, walking\n        disabilities, mental illness, cognitive impairments"
