In order to develop a dynamic clinical analysis that is\n      updated with every new subject, and to extract patterns from this large data base, The\n      research team designed computer programming using Data Mining tools, which combine methods\n      from statistics and artificial intelligence with database management.\n\n      Blood test will be perform from each subject.
