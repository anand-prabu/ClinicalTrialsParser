            "textblock": "Brugada syndrome is characterized by a ST shift on the surface ECG, and a specific\n      morphology of the Twave. This ECG abnormality is called a type 1-ECG, and is variable in\n      time. Patients presenting a Brugada syndrome are exposed to sudden cardiac death, although\n      it's difficult to predict patients at high risk. It is suspected that the type 1-ECG burden\n      might be correlated to the ventricular fibrillation risk of these patients, but there is no\n      mean to record the ECG over a long period of time.\n\n      The objective of the study is to evaluate the correlation between ST elevation on the\n      electrocardiogram (ECG) and ST shift on the intracardiac electrograms (EGM) recorded with\n      the AnalyST ICD, to assess the ability of the device to detect the type 1-ECG. Patients\n      enrolled in the study are patients already implanted with a defibrillator for their Brugada\n      syndrome. During an Ajmalin test, which unmasks the type 1-ECG, both intracardiac EGM and\n      surface ECG will be compared to assess the detection of the typical ST-shift by the ICD."
