            "textblock": "Glidescope\u00ae Videolaryngoscope  is an angulated rigid optical device introduced in clinical\n      practice in 2004 to facilitate endotracheal intubation.\n\n      Since its introduction potential benefits of this instrument might lie with use in patients\n      with clinical features indicating difficult laryngoscopy or it being used as a rescue method\n      following failed direct laryngoscopy.  In a few centers was proposed and used  routinely.\n\n      The performance of Glidescope\u00ae was studied in easy and difficult scenarios, in vivo and on\n      manikins and compared with the reference standard McIntosh direct laryngoscopy. In patients\n      with predicted or simulated difficult intubation, despite glottis visualization was improved\n      with Glidescope\u00ae,  the introduction of the tube in trachea was difficult  the same as with\n      McIntosh laryngoscopy. Training of operators before to entertain the trials varied from 20\n      to 50 Glidescope successful intubations. In an observational study  Aziz et al. demonstrated\n      in the two Institutions  involved that the GlideScope\u00ae was used more frequently at the\n      Institution were the failure rate was significantly  lower. At this , 51 providers performed\n      mean 21.7  GlideScope\u00ae intubations  while at the other 91 providers  performed 9.9\n      intubations.\n\n      These data highlight  the important issue of how many Glidescope\u00ae intubations a provider\n      should complete to reach a definitive clinical competence in this practice. Until now there\n      is only one study performed on mankin comparing Glidescope\u00ae with AirTraq\u00ae and McIntosh\n      laryngoscopes in novices . The authors concluded that despite a steep learning curve after 5\n      intubation difficulties in instrumentation and longer times to intubate persisted with\n      Glidescope\u00ae in comparison with the other two devices. Outcome measures were: duration of\n      intubation attempt, modified Cormack  grades, dental trauma and difficulty of use.\n\n      In vivo both timely insertion of laryngoscope blade and introduction of the tube, no need of\n      help or of external laryngeal displacement should be included to ascertain expertise with\n      this new technology  in patients with different grades of difficulty predicted."
