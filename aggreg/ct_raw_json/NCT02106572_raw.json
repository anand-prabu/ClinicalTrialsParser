Secondary objective is to evaluate the safety of\n      abnobaVISCUM\u00ae 900, in particular, to compare the toxicity of the two treatments. Another\n      secondary objective is the treatment efficacy as measured by calculated prognosis for\n      recurrence and progression after 1 year, the tumor grading in case of a recurrence and by\n      measurement of Quality of Life."
