Investigators have called the\n      technique the \"corkscrew\" technique and believe it will allow obtaining a larger biopsy\n      sample during the endoscopic ultrasound examination. The corkscrew technique uses a\n      clockwise rotational movement to drive the needle into the pancreatic mass (like a wine\n      bottle opener twists and buries itself into a cork). It is believed that this will lead to a\n      better biopsy sample than the usual way and therefore result in a higher chance of a\n      diagnosis."
