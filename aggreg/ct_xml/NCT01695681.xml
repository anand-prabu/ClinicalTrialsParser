      The purpose of this study is  to determine the prevalence of  previously undiagnosed coeliac
      disease based on a health survey from Tromsø, Norway.  Moreover, the health impact of
      undiagnosed coeliac disease will be examined.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Few population-based studies have examined the prevalence of coeliac disease and the impact
      of undiagnosed coeliac disease on health. Moreover, the number of people with undiagnosed
      coeliac disease is much higher than the number who know their diagnosis.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the prevalence of coeliac disease and the impact
      of undiagnosed coeliac disease on health.

      In a health survey of the population of Tromsø Norway, serological markers of coeliac
      disease (transglutaminase 2, TG2 and deamidated gliadin antibody test) have been analyzed.
      Individuals with increased level of one of these markers, will be invited for upper
      endoscopy with small bowel biopsy examination to confirm the diagnosis of coeliac disease.
      All persons with screen detected coeliac disease, will be advised to start a gluten free
      diet.

      Health status and Quality of Life will be examined by means of the Gastrointestinal Symptoms
      Rating Scale (GSRS) and  the Psychological General Well-Being Index (PGWBI) respectively.

        1. At baseline GSRS and PGWBI will be analyzed in persons with screen detected and biopsy
           verified coeliac disease and compared with a group of healthy control persons from the
           health-survey cohort.

        2. In a prospective study of the persons with screen detected coeliac disease, health
           status (GSRS) and Quality of Life will be compared before and after one year on a
           gluten free diet.
