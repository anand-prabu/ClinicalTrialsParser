            "textblock": "Background:  Type 2 diabetes is a worldwide health problem. As the reduction in blood\n      pressure has been coupled to improvements in overall cardiovascular outcomes, the control of\n      hypertension has become an important modifiable risk factor in the overall care of the\n      patient with Type 2 Diabetes, in addition to glycemic control.  Recently, several\n      large-scale clinical trials evaluating the glucose-lowering effects of the\n      anti-hyperglycemic agent, liraglutide (a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist), have\n      demonstrated a modest yet persistent anti-hypertensive effect in patients with Type 2\n      diabetes.\n\n      Study Objectives: Accordingly, the goal of this small study is to understand whether the\n      blood pressure lowering effect of liraglutide is coupled to the release of vasoactive\n      mediators which may stimulate natriuresis and/or diuresis and lower systolic blood pressure.\n\n      Study Design: Randomized, double-masked, cross-over study with treatment of liraglutide or\n      placebo for 3 weeks, with an intervening washout period for 3 weeks, and cross-over to\n      identical treatment with placebo or liraglutide for 3 weeks.\n\n      Study Patients: 20 patients with Type 2 Diabetes and Systolic Hypertension\n\n      Endpoints: Change in vasoactive hormones, 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure, urinary sodium\n      excretion patterns."
