Subjects who have provided written informed consent\n      will undergo the protocol-specific assessments to determine their eligibility for the study.\n      Subjects considered eligible will be assigned to an appropriate age stratum, and will be\n      given a single dose of the study vaccine. For each age stratum, the first 142 subjects\n      enrolled will be evaluated for both immunogenicity and safety, and the remaining subjects\n      subsequently enrolled will be evaluated only for the safety of the study vaccine.\n\n        1. Group A: healthy adults 18 to < 65 years of age\n\n        2. Group B: healthy adults \u2265 65 years of age\n\n      The investigator will evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of the study vaccine throughout\n      the study. The immunogenicity assessment will be performed at Visit 1 (pre-vaccination) and\n      at the End-of-Study Visit. For safety measurements, subjects will be instructed to record\n      any adverse events occurring after vaccination in the Patient Diary card.\n\n      Subjects who are assigned for the both immunogenicity and safety assessment will have their\n      blood sample drawn for antibody titer (immunogenicity) testing, and afterward, receive 0.5\n      mL of the study vaccine by intramuscular injection at deltoid muscle. Subjects will return\n      to the clinic for follow-up visit 4 to 5 weeks after the vaccination, and undergo another\n      blood sampling for antibody titer test. The long-term safety for up to 6 months after\n      vaccination will be also evaluated. Subjects who are assigned for only safety assessments\n      will not undergo blood sampling, but have the same visit schedule as those assigned for the\n      both immunogenicity and safety assessments."
