For\n      solving this problem, to place the patient on rigid surface, use a backboard that might\n      decrease the mattress compression, receive a feedback that reflects the mattress compression\n      depth (MCD) using dual accelerometer or magnetic sensor have been proposed. As the other\n      solution, we hypothesized that training of 6-7cm CCD for healthcare providers improve\n      accurate CCD during cardiopulmonary resuscitation when manikin is placed on mattress in\n      hospital."
