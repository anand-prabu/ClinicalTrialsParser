        Main Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant is male with hemophilia A or B with inhibitors, with a high titer (≥5
             Bethesda unit (BU)) or a historical high anamnestic response.

          -  Participant is 12 to 65 years old at the time of screening.

          -  Participant is currently using or has used bypassing agents for treatment of bleeding
             episodes.

          -  Participant has an annualized bleed rate of 5 or more bleeding episodes per year on
             average over the 2 years prior to the Screening visit.

          -  Participant has a Karnofsky Performance Score ≥60.

          -  Participant is hepatitis C virus negative (HCV-) either by antibody testing or
             polymerase chain reaction (PCR); or hepatitis C virus positive (HCV+) with stable
             hepatic disease.

          -  Participant is human immunodeficiency virus negative (HIV-) or HIV+ with stable
             disease, CD4+ count ≥200 cells/mm^3 at screening.

          -  Participant is willing and able to comply with the requirements of the protocol.

        Main Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant is not willing to go on an on-demand treatment scheme.

          -  The use of α-interferon with or without ribavirin is planned for an HCV-infected
             participant or the use of a protease inhibitor is planned for an HIV-infected
             participant.

               -  Participants currently taking any of these medications for ≥30 days are
                  eligible.

             Tween 80.

          -  Participant has a known history of being non-responsive to rFVIIa treatment of
             bleeding episodes.

          -  Participant has a prior history of thromboembolic event or diagnosis of other
             diseases that may increase the participant's risk of thromboembolic complications.

          -  Participant has participated in another clinical study involving an investigational
             product (IP) or investigational device within 30 days prior to enrollment or is
             scheduled to participate in another clinical study involving an IP or investigational
             device during the course of this study.

          -  Participant is a family member or employee of the investigator.
