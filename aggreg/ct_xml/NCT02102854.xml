  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rabbit antithymocyte globulin (rATG) is approved for the treatment of acute rejection
      following kidney transplantation and is routinely administered as a series of 5-7
      consecutive daily doses via central intravenous catheter. This prolonged course is not
      consistent with the Medicare diagnosis-related group (DRG) for acute rejection which limits
      rejection admission to 3 days. The prolonged hospitalization results in increased medical
      costs and uniform financial loss to the hospital for patients admitted under this DRG.  In
      addition there is a patient related toll of the prolonged hospitalization and a potential
      for additional hospital acquired complications. Single large-doses of rATG have been shown
      to have equivalent safety and efficacy profile compared to the standard daily protocol when
      used as an induction agent but there are no reported experiences of its use for rejection
      treatment.  The investigators hypothesize that single-dose rATG infusion will be as safe and
      efficacious as standard rATG administration when used for rejection treatment and would
      result in significant reduction in the length of hospital stay (LOS) and hospital costs for
      rejection treatment.
