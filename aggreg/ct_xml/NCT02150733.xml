        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects must have histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced solid tumor.
             However, Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) subjects are allowed without histological
             confirmation as long as there is radiological diagnosis as per standard criteria

             classification score

          7. Subjects with biliary obstruction for whom a biliary drain or stent has been placed
             are eligible, provided that the drain or stent has been in place for at least 10 days
             prior to the first dose of Tivantinib, and the subject's liver function has
             stabilized as defined by 2 measurements at least 5 days apart that put the subject in

             gonadotropin-releasing hormone modulators for prostate cancer, and the use of
             somatostatin and analogs for neuroendocrine tumors are permitted

         11. Any other investigational drug/medical device within 3 weeks prior to the first dose

         12. Substance abuse or medical, psychological, or social conditions that, in the opinion
             of the Investigator, may interfere with the subject's participation in the clinical
             study or evaluation of the clinical study results
