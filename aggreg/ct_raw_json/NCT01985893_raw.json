This study will also assess the relationship between the anticipated anti-tumour\n      activity of the treatment regimens and biological characteristics of subjects' tumour at\n      baseline.\n\n      The purpose of this study is to estimate the clinical benefit of lapatinib plus trastuzumab\n      compared to lapatinib plus capecitabine as measured by investigator-assessed\n      progression-free survival, tumour response and overall survival.\n\n      The purpose of this study ist further\n\n        -  to characterize the safety and tolerability of lapatinib plus trastuzumab in this\n           population.\n\n        -  to identify predictors of sensitivity to lapatinib and trastuzumab therapy. and\n\n        -  to compare the differences in health-related quality of life (HRQL) and pain symptoms\n           for patients by treatment assignment."
