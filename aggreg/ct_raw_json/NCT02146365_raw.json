This study will look at nasal swabs from toddlers who received a\n      killed whole cell pneumococcal vaccine (PATH-wSP) in VAC-010 and compare them to nasal swabs\n      from toddlers of the same age who did not receive the PATH-wSP vaccine. This information\n      will be used to help further develop the PATH-wSP vaccine. The research will be done in\n      Kenya at one site in Kisumu (KEMRI). The study will enroll healthy Kenyan toddlers (12-15\n      months of age) who are participating in the VAC-010 study (N=250) and whose parents provide\n      consent for this study. In addition 50 healthy Kenyan toddlers of similar age who did not\n      participate in the VAC-010 study will also be enrolled.\n\n      The toddlers will be followed for 6 months and will have 5 study visits. During those study\n      visits each toddler will have their nose and back of their throat swabbed. The material from\n      the swab will be analyzed for the presence and type of pneumococcal and other germs. At the\n      last visit, one blood sample (5 ml or approximately 1 tsp) will be obtained.\n\n      There will be no direct benefit to the participants other than direct and immediate medical\n      care as needed.\n\n      Parents of all participants will provide written informed consent."
