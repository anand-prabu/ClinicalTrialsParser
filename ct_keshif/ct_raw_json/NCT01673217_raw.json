Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as decitabine and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin\n      hydrochloride, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing\n      the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Vaccines made from a peptide or antigen may\n      help the body build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells. Giving combination\n      chemotherapy together with vaccine therapy may kill more tumor cells"

To evaluate NY-ESO-l specific cellular and humoral immunity by determination of NY-ESO-I\n      specific antibody, CD8+ and CD4+ T-cells following immunization with NY-ESO-l protein mixed\n      with montanide and GM-CSF in combination with 5-aza-2' -deoxycytidine (decitabine) in\n      patients receiving liposomal doxorubicin for recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or\n      primary peritoneal carcinoma.\n\n      II. To determine the impact of 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine on NY-ESO-I specific expression,\n      NY-ESO-l promoter methylation, and global DNA methylation.\n\n      III.
