    <textblock>
      Hope is important to palliative home care patients. Our research team has developed a Living
      with Hope Program that has been found to increase hope and quality of life in older persons
      with advanced cancer.

      The investigators want to know if this program increases hope and quality of life for all
      palliative home care patients (all ages, all diagnosis).  Thirty palliative home care
      patients and their care partners will participate in this pilot study to evaluate the study
      procedures and the living with hope program.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Hope is important for palliative home care patients (Duggleby, 2000; Duggleby,
      et al., 2012; Duggleby &amp; Wright, 2004, 2005). Our research team has developed a program
      (Living with Hope) that has been found to increase hope and quality of life of palliative
      home care patients (Duggleby et al., 2007).  The Living with Hope Program (LWHP) involves
      seeing a 15 minute film on hope and choosing a hope activity to begin over a one week time
      frame.  Participants choose to begin: a) a hope collection, b) a story about themselves, and
      c) to write a letter to someone.

      Aims: The purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate the feasibility of study procedures and
      collect preliminary data on the effectiveness and processes of the Living with Hope Program
      for persons receiving palliative home care in Alberta and Saskatchewan.

      Sample:  Palliative home care teams in Alberta and Saskatchewan will identify potential
      participants based on the inclusion criteria. They will make contact and ask if the
      potential participants are willing to talk with a research nurse about the study. If they
      agree the research nurse will contact potential participants.  Inclusion criterion for the
      patients are: a) 18 years of age and older, b) English speaking, c) receiving palliative
      home care services and d) able to complete the study as determined by their palliative care
      coordinator/manager. Inclusion criterion for the care partner participants are: a)
      identified by a palliative home care patient as being their primary source of physical
      and/or emotional support, b) 18 years of age and c) English speaking.

      The research nurse will contact potential participants and ask them when it will be a
      convenient time to meet with and obtain written informed consent.

      Design: Using a mixed-methods randomized control trial (Quant +qual) design, 30 dyads
      (palliative care patient and their care partner) will be randomly assigned to one of three
      groups: 1) treatment (Watching a film on hope and beginning a hope activity), 2) low dose
      group (Film only) or 3) usual care group.  In all groups, demographic information, and
      baseline, day 7 and 14 measures of hope, quality of life and anxiety will be collected by
      trained research nurses. On day 14 all participants will be interviewed using open ended
      audiotaped questions  to help evaluate the study procedures and those in group 1 and 2 the
      LWHP program. Participants in group 1 (treatment group) will also be asked to describe what
      they were thinking about when doing the hope activities. Care partners' levels of hope and
      their evaluation of the study procedures (using open ended qualitative interview questions)
      will also be collected.

    <description>McGill Quality of Life Questionnaire: The MQOL is a 16 numerical rating scale designed to measure subjective well-being in palliative care patients. It is comprised of five sub measures: physical symptoms, physical well-being, psychological well-being, existential well-being and support. The scores reflect subjective well-being in each domain as well as a total quality of life score that is a mean score of the 5 sub-measures. The total scores range from 0-10 where the higher the scores indicate a higher the quality of life. The MQOL takes approximately 10 minutes to complete. There are no ceiling or basement effects. The MQOL has been found to be a reliable (r=.9) and valid measure of quality of life in palliative care patients.</description>

    <measure>Herth Hope Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline in hope at day 7</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The Herth Hope Index is a 12 item (1-4 point) Likert scale that delineates three sub-scales of hope: a) temporality and future, b) positive readiness and expectancy, and c) interconnectedness. The HHI has been found to take approximately 5 minutes to complete. Summative scores range from 12-48, with a higher score denoting greater hope. The HHI has been found to be reliable (test-retest r=. 91, p&lt;.0 05) and valid (concurrent validity, r=. 84, p&lt;0. 05; criterion, r=. 92, p&lt; 0.05; divergent, r=-0.73, p&lt;0. 05). The HHI has been used in studies with terminally ill patients and family caregivers[54-55] with no reported difficulties in completion.</description>

    <measure>Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline in HADS on day 7</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The 14-item HADS measures anxiety and depression. Respondents can score 0 to 21 points on each of the subscales on anxiety and depression. According to Zigmond and Snaith 0 to 7 points on a subscale represent a noncase, 8 to10 points represent a doubtful or possible case, and 11 to 21 points represent a definite case of anxiety or depression. In a recent meta-analysis  the HADS  was found to be an effective screening tool for anxiety and depression in palliative care.</description>
