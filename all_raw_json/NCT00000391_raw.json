            "textblock": "To study the safety and toxicity of intranasal peptide T (D-Ala-1-peptide-T-amide) in\n      humans, and to find out how quickly and how much of a given dose enters the bloodstream and\n      how quickly it leaves the bloodstream. To obtain information on the ability of intranasal\n      peptide T to prevent, halt, and/or reverse the effects of AIDS on the central nervous\n      system.\n\n      Studies have shown that AIDS is caused by a retrovirus. This virus works by inactivating or\n      destroying human CD4 cells (which are part of the human immune system). This in turn leads\n      to the observed immunologic defects and related illnesses, including HIV encephalopathy\n      (disease of the brain). One method of preventing AIDS is to prevent HIV from entering the\n      cell. HIV binds to the receptor CD4 site. Peptide T also binds to this site, and thus by\n      competing for that site, can block the binding of the virus to its receptor. Preliminary\n      animal and human studies indicate that peptide T is safe at the doses selected for this\n      trial.\n\n      Thirty patients with AIDS or AIDS related complex (ARC) are entered into the study to\n      receive an increasing schedule of three dosage levels of intranasal peptide T for 12 - 16\n      weeks followed by a 1-month off-drug follow-up period and a subsequent 1-month return to the\n      drug. All patients receive an initial intravenous test dose of peptide T. The test dose is\n      administered over 1 hour, followed by an observation period of 8 hours in the outpatient\n      clinic."
