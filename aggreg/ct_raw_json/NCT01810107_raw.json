A Universal Modular Glottiscope will\n      be utilized for adequate laryngeal exposure.  An operating microscope will be used for\n      magnification.  This setup will allow for the Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) imaging\n      probe to be introduced using a laryngoscope to provide stability.  The optical imaging probe\n      will then be directed, or gently applied towards, the glottal surface, and an image field of\n      500 microns x 500 microns x 350 microns will be obtained.  As the probe is moved along the\n      medial and superior mucosal surfaces of the vocal folds, \"real-time\" images will be obtained\n      and digitally stored for review. The digitally stored images will be assessed and analyzed\n      for their optical characteristics. The optical imaging probe will then be withdrawn from the\n      patient and the original operative procedure will then be performed.  Images can be attained\n      in both \"non-contact\" mode (where the probe tip remains in the space between each vocal\n      fold) and \"contact\" mode (where the probe tip is gently placed against the glottal tissue to\n      compress it).  The contact mode allows for deeper imaging (much like an ultrasound), which\n      would be useful in situations involving larger (thicker) vocal folds. The study will end\n      when images are acquired from a range of developmental ages to be able to refine the optical\n      characteristics of the optical imaging system."

The major analysis will be to validate the age dependent laminar structure using a cohort of 720 subjects between age 0-18 as well as estimate the probability of future events of developing two- or three laminar structure given a subject's age. We will perform one-sided two-sample binomial tests to examine as well as model the patterns of the rates of bi- and tri-laminar structure patterns by using logistic model or discrete or continuous time Cox's proportional hazards model of which the predictor variables are determined based on the discriminant model described above. In addition, as a parallel approach we will analyze the Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) data of each of the trilaminar system by using linear or curve-linear regression models which will provide a prediction model of the mean OCT at various critical ages.",
