Black MSM bear a disproportionate\n      burden, with prevalence of 28%, in contrast to 19% in MSM overall. Black MSM undergo HIV\n      testing less frequently than other MSM\u037e are less likely to be aware that they are HIV\n      infected\u037e are more likely to experience delays in entry into HIV care\u037e and are less likely\n      to be prescribed antiretroviral therapy (ART) when eligible. These disparities are\n      pronounced in substance-using MSM, as substance users are at elevated risk of late diagnosis\n      and delayed engagement in HIV care. The combination of pervasive stigma associated with MSM\n      behavior and high rates of substance use hinders effective prevention efforts in this\n      population, even as the prevalence of infection in Black MSM in some US cities approaches\n      50%. Reducing HIV-related disparities in MSM and among Black Americans are National HIV/AIDS\n      Strategy priorities and are essential to the effort to control and prevent HIV/AIDS in the\n      US."
