  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim of this study is to investigate a novel &quot;dual instance&quot; planning method to
      make use of the respiratory motion to improve pancreatic radiation therapy (RT) treatment
      planning.

      Specific Aim 1:  Acquire patient abdominal MRI and CT at both deep inspiration (INSP) and
      expiration (EXP) positions and characterize the changes in geometric relationships between
      the INSP and EXP instances for tumor and normal tissues including stomach, duodenum and
      bowel.  We hypothesize that INSP and EXP MRI and CT characterization will allow
      identification of patients who may benefit from the dual instance planning method.

      Specific Aim 2:  Develop, investigate and evaluate plans based on free breathing, single
      instance breath hold, and the novel dual instance anatomical information.  We hypothesize
      that use of the dual instance method will lead to improved plans, demonstrated by the
      ability to increase dose to the target, while maintaining the clinically-accepted normal
      tissue dose constraints.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Any patient with a biopsy proven diagnosis of malignancy involving the pancreas to be
             treated with radiation therapy

          -  Age &gt;18 years

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document

          -  Creatinine or creatinine clearance of &lt;1.5 times the upper limit of normal or &gt;45
             mL/min/1.73m2 for patients with creatinine levels above normal. Modification of Diet
             in Renal Disease (MDRD) formula was used to calculate the creatinine level

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who are currently receiving any investigational agents

          -  Unable to undergo MRIs

          -  Patients with late stage kidney disease or who have had a liver transplant

          -  Individuals who are allergic to animal dander or have asthma that may be enflamed by
             proximity to animals will be excluded as the scans will take place in a facility
             where animal research is also performed.
