            "textblock": "The main hypothesis of the present study is that carefully designed spice mixtures can\n      override any taste aversion to brassica vegetables, increase acceptance (liking and\n      intention to consume), and measured consumption of mixed vegetable dishes which include\n      brassica vegetables using a modified Universal Eating Monitor and hedonic testing. In order\n      to examine this hypothesis we will achieve the following specific aims:\n\n        1. To measure the liking of vegetables; intentions to consume vegetables; differences in\n           responses by baseline eating restraint; the perceived tastes (sweet, salt, sour,\n           bitter, umami) and overall flavor intensity of Brassica vegetables and five individual\n           vegetables include the following brassica vegetables: broccoli florets,  cauliflower,\n           spinach, squash and tomato . Therefore, hedonics of brassica vegetables will be\n           measured in the same individuals.\n\n        2. To measure attitudes towards foods for health, pleasure and reward using a validated\n           set of questionnaires (Health and Taste Attitudes Scale).\n\n        3. To measure level of restrained eating using the Three Factor Eating Questionnaire since\n           this will affect eating behaviors measured objectively.\n\n        4. Measure simultaneously meal hedonics and the actual intake of cooked dishes of\n           vegetables using a modified Universal Eating Monitor when dishes are eaten plain or\n           with added spices in random order.\n\n      These will be the first studies to our knowledge of the ability of spices to aid in\n      increasing vegetable consumption to meet USDA dietary recommendations. If successful, this\n      study will provide important guidelines for research on prevention through nutrition as well\n      as public health recommendations for diet and chronic disease prevention."
