While\n      inpatient rehabilitation care is the preferred form for many patients post-stroke, due to\n      access and financial barriers, many patients do not have this option.   Community,\n      outpatient rehabilitation programs will allow the patients with moderately disabling strokes\n      the opportunity to maintain or augment gains achieved during inpatient stroke rehabilitation\n      , while allowing some patients with mild disability to avoid inpatient rehabilitation\n      completely.\n\n      Objective:  Phase 1 randomized control trial to test the efficiency and effectiveness of\n      treating adults who have suffered a single stroke using the following essential treatment\n      components; a)  community setting,    b) group activity program, c) flexible, task-specific,\n      computer-based exercise regime This program is designed to allow an extension of the\n      in-patient rehabilitation experience to a community-based setting, in a cost-effective\n      manner using paraprofessional staff and rehabilitation specialists, to provide a\n      challenging, functional program to promote recovery and independence from physical\n      impairments affecting balance and walking.\n\n      The specific objectives are to:\n\n        1. assess the benefits and feasibility of the multi-functional group exercise intervention\n           for balance and mobility in a community setting.  Secondary objectives\n\n        2. identify effective combinations of exercises & activities that translate to increased\n           abilities and participation levels.\n\n      Hypothesis: Intense training targeting standing balance, and walking will significantly\n      improve stroke clients' functional mobility. Training in a group setting and incorporating\n      interactive and engaging computer gaming further provides the benefits of motivation and\n      peer support while providing treatment in a cost effective manner."
