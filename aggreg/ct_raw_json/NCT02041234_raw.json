            "textblock": "20 subjects with DM2 will be recruited, randomised into two arms. The surgical arm will be\n      subjected to RYGB. The medical arm will be treated maximally utilising the best means\n      available and following internationally available protocol/guidelines. The study population\n      will be subjected to a set of tests which is over and above the standard tests for similar\n      groups of patients undergoing standard care (details below). Some test samples will be\n      bio-banked. Treatment end points and follow up protocol will be the same for each treatment\n      arm. The International Diabetic Federation (IDF) in 2011 recommended that bariatric surgery\n      should be considered an alternative treatment option for those Asian DM2 subjects with BMI\n      of 27 or above. Data for the effectiveness of Bariatric Surgery for those DM subjects with\n      lower BMI is not as well established as those with higher BMI. There is scant good quality\n      data, especially from Asian subjects. As their treatment is totally funded by the research\n      project, subjects on the non surgical treatment arm will benefit from the more intense\n      management of their disease with no restriction due to cost. The surgical arm will also be\n      fully funded by the research project. They will be exposed to the standard risks associated\n      with this type of surgery. Subjects in both arms will have to provide more blood and other\n      samples than usual and has to follow visits protocol as close as possible. RYGB is a major\n      surgical procedure, with significant potential complications; during the process of surgery\n      and afterwards, both short and long term. Procedure related mortality is about 0.3%. Major\n      complications that may require surgical intervention includes: anastomotic leakage about\n      3-4%, bleeding 3%, infection 3%, venous thrombo-embolism 1%. Some of these complications\n      will require prolong hospitalisation. After surgery, loose stool, dumping syndrome,\n      anastomotic ulcers can occur in less than 3%.Life long dietary supplement will be required.\n      Longer term post surgical complications include intestinal obstruction due to adhesions or\n      internal hernia, about 2%, further surgery may be needed. This risk is lifelong. Nutritional\n      deficiencies, especially if not compliant with regular supplement intake, may occur. Drug\n      allergies can occur; from simple rash to life threatening anaphylactic reaction. Blood\n      taking can cause bruising, pain at the puncture site and sometimes fainting."
