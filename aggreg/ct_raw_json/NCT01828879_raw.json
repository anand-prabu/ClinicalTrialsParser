The ointment should\n      be applied at least 2 hours before or at least 30 minutes after bathing, showering, shaving,\n      use of sauna, or heavy exercise (i.e. causes sweating). On study visit days, the ointment\n      should be applied at least 2 hours before the visit. Efficacy evaluation will be done at all\n      subsequent study visits in participants receiving study drug for at least 3 consecutive days\n      (minimum of 5 applications) while the participants who will receive at least 1 application\n      of the study drug, will be evaluated for safety. Primary efficacy evaluation will be based\n      on the Physician's Global Evaluation of Clinical Response (PhGECR). Participants' safety\n      will be monitored throughout the study."
