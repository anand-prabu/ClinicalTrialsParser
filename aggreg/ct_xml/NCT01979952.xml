    <textblock>
      This is an 12 month multi-centre, prospective, randomized, placebo controlled, double blind
      clinical trial designed to assess the effect of nintedanib 150mg BID on the progression of
      IPF measured by using  HRCT, lung function, 6MWT, biomarkers, and PROs with  continued
      treatment and assessments for up to 18 months.

             Society (ALAT) IPF guidelines for diagnosis Usual Interstitial Pneumonia (UIP)
             management, within 5 years of Visit 0. All HRCT found to be possible UIP must have
             confirmatory pathology

          4. Carbon Monoxide Diffusing Capacity (DLCO) (corrected for Hb): 30%-79% predicted of
             normal

          5. Full Vital Capacity (FVC) predicted of normal

        Exclusion criteria:

          1. Aspartate Amino Transferase (AST), Alanine Amino Transferase (ALT) &gt; 1.5 fold Upper

                  vitamin K antagonists, dabigatran, heparin, hirudin), or high dose antiplatelet
                  therapy. Exceptions: prophylactic low dose heparin or heparin flush as needed
                  for maintenance of an indwelling intravenous device (e.g. enoxaparin 4000 IU
                  s.c. per day) and prophylactic use of antiplatelet therapy (e.g. acetyl
                  salicylic acid up to 325 mg/d, or clopidogrel at 75 mg/d, or equivalent doses of
                  other antiplatelet therapy)

          6. Current or planned usage of any investigational drug during the course of this trial

          7. Previous treatment with nintedanib within a clinical trial in the previous 3 months
             and discontinuation of nintedanib study treatment due to an adverse event

          8. Known hypersensitivity to the trial drug or its component

          9. A disease or condition which in the opinion of investigator may put the patient at
             risk because of participation in this trial or limit the patientÂ¿s ability to

         11. Pregnant women or women who are breast feeding or of child bearing potential not
             using two effective methods of birth control (one barrier and one highly effective
             non-barrier) for at least 1 month prior to trial and/or not committing to using it
             until 3 months after end of treatment

         12. Women will be considered to be of childbearing potential unless surgically sterilised
             by hysterectomy or bilateral tubal ligation, or postmenopausal for at least two
             years;  Highly effective methods of birth control include established use of oral,
             injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception, placement of an intrauterine
             device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS). A barrier method of contraception includes
             condom or occlusive cap with spermicidal (foam, gel, film, cream, suppository) or
             male sterilization (with appropriate post vasectomy documentation of the absence of
             sperm in the ejaculate)

         13. Sexually active males not committing to using condoms during the course of the study
             (except if their partner is not of childbearing potential) and 3 months after end of
