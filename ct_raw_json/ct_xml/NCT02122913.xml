  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, Phase 1a/1b study of orally administered LOXO-101 in
      adult subjects with advanced solid tumors that have progressed or are non responsive to
      available therapies and for which no standard or available curative therapy exists.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial will be conducted in 2 parts: an initial dose escalation phase of LOXO-101 in
      subjects with advanced solid tumors. This will be followed by an expansion phase in solid
      tumor subjects with a neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor (NTRK) alteration. During the
      escalation phase, LOXO-101 will be taken once daily (QD) or twice daily (BID). During the
      expansion phase, the LOXO-101 dose selected from Phase 1a will be explored in 23 to 33
      additional subjects per tumor type with an NTRK alteration.

      The objectives of the dose escalation phase are to determine the safety, tolerability,
      pharmacokinetic profile, and recommended phase 1b dose of orally administered LOXO-101. The
      objectives of the expansion phase are to describe the preliminary anti-tumor activity of
      LOXO-101 in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and other solid tumor types
      with NTRK alterations.
