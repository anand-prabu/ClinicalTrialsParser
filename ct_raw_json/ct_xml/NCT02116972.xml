  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a double-blind, randomized, parallel group, dose-ranging, single dose design.
      The study will be conducted in male and female patients ≥ 40 years of age with
      osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee.

      Approximately 300 patients with OA of the knee will be randomized to one of three treatment
      groups (1:1:1) and treated with a single intra-articular (IA) injection of:

        -  20 mg FX006,

        -  40 mg FX006, or

        -  normal saline.

      Each patient will be evaluated for a total of 20 weeks following a single IA injection.
      Following screening, safety and efficacy will be evaluated at 6 out-patient visits (Days 1
      [Baseline], Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16 and 20).
