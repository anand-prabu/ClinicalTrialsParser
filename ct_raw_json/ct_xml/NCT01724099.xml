    <textblock>
      This study has two arms, HP001 and placebo group. Inclusion of 80 patient each arm. They
      will be screened at first visit. At the baseline, that is the second visit, they will be
      evaluated each outcomes including weight, waist circumference, lipid profile (total
      cholesterol, triglyceride), CRP (C-reactive protein), visceral fat area and subcutaneous fat
      area using abdominal computed tomography (CT), questionnaires of QoL (Quality of Life) and
      eating attitudes, etc. The HP001 will provide to the patients from the baseline, it contains
      4 weeks of serving. After 4 weeks, the visit 3, the evaluation procedure will be repeated
      except lipid profile, CRP, abdominal CT. Another HP001 of 4 weeks will be given to the
      patient. The visit 4, 4 weeks after the visit 3, the same procedure will be repeated. The
      visit 5, 12 weeks after from the baseline, the patient will be evaluated including weight,
      waist circumference, lipid profile, CRP, visceral fat area and subcutaneous fat area using
      abdominal computed tomography, questionnaires of QoL and eating attitudes, etc.
