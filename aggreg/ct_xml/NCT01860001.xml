      The aim of this study is to define the incidence and nature of acidosis after major surgery
      using Figge's equations to directly measure acidosis. This study will also aim to compare
      the ability of indirect measures (base deficit, anion gap,corrected anion gap and lactate)
      to identify the presence of tissue acids in this population. The incidence of postoperative
      ketoacidosis as a contributor to tissue acidosis will be assessed through the use of point
      of care urinalysis.

    <textblock>
      Metabolic acidosis is a frequent occurrence following major surgery. Monitoring acid base
      disturbances and in particular diagnosing the aetiology of the acidosis are important parts
      of assessing a patient's cardiovascular status following surgery. The presence of a
      metabolic acidosis is frequently attributed to anaerobic metabolism leading to the
      generation of lactic acid due to hypovolaemia and poor tissue perfusion. This commonly
      results in clinicians treating postoperative patients with a metabolic acidosis by
      administering intravenous fluids containing 0.9% saline or Hartmann's solution (compound
      sodium lactate). If the cause of the metabolic acidosis is not hypovolaemia, treatment with
      intravenous fluids may actually exacerbate the acidosis by causing hyperchloraemia. An often
      overlooked cause of metabolic acidosis after surgery is starvation leading to ketoacidosis.
      All patients are starved for a minimum of six hours prior to general anaesthesia due to the
      potential risk of aspiration of gastric contents into the bronchial tree. Many patients are
      in fact fasted for much longer periods than this. There is, however, little data describing
      the incidence of ketoacidosis following surgery. In addition, there may be other causes of
      acidosis after surgery which often overlooked but can be determined using equations and
      mathematical models. The aim of this study is to define the incidence and nature of acidosis
      after major cancer surgery using using equations to directly determine acids. This study
      will also aim to compare the ability of commonly used indirect measures (base deficit, anion
      gap, corrected anion gap and lactate) to identify the presence of tissue acids in this
      population. The incidence of postoperative ketoacidosis as a contributor to tissue acidosis
      will be assessed through the use of point of care urinalysis.
