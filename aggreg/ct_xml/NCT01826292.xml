  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are conducting a retrospective, cross-sectional chart review of patients
      who underwent an anesthetic administered by an anesthesiologist in the University of
      California Davis main operating rooms and were transferred to the main post anesthesia care
      unit between January 1, 2012 and March 31, 2012. The investigators are excluding patients
      less than 18 years of age, patients transferred to the intensive care unit, and patients for
      whom data is not reported. Our aim is to report the incidences patient characteristics, as
      well as anesthetic and surgical techniques, and the associations these factors may have with
      the outcome of patient length of stay in the PACU.

    <textblock>
      We are conducting a retrospective, cross-sectional chart review of patients who underwent an
      anesthetic administered by an anesthesiologist in the University of California Davis main
      operating rooms and were transferred to the main (Pavilion) post anesthesia care unit
      between January 1, 2012 and March 31, 2012. We are excluding patients less than 18-years of
      age, patients transferred to the intensive care unit, and patients for whom data is not
      reported. Charts will be reviewed and data will be collected by the primary and
      co-investigator(s). Analysis will consist of cross-tabulation counts across independent
      variables, univariate analysis (outcome variable PACU length of stay), and regression
      analysis (outcome variable PACU length of stay). We aim to measure patient length of stay in
      the post anesthesia care unit (PACU) as the outcome variable. The following patient,
      operative, and post operative factors will be recorded as covariates: age, gender, height,
      weight, American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification, pre-operative
      use of pain medication, pre-operative pain score, whether the patient is non-English
      speaking, history of smoking, surgical service, anesthetic time, surgical time, urgency of
      surgery, use of general anesthetic or monitored anesthesia care, use of regional anesthetic,
      regional anesthetic type, use of inhalational or total intravenous anesthetic maintenance,
      intraoperative use of dexmedetomidine, intraoperative use of dexamethasone, intraoperative
      use of ondansetron, intraoperative use of remifentanyl, intraoperative use of ketamine,
      total volume of crystalloid or colloid administered, intraoperative use of endotracheal
      tube, natural airway, or laryngeal mask airway, time of PACU arrival,  initial pain score in
      the PACU, episode of post operative nausea or vomiting, administration of antiemetic in the
      PACU, post operative temperature, time of anesthesiologist sign out in the PACU, time of
      patient transfer from the PACU, location of transfer from PACU, preoperative placement of
      scopolamine patch, history of postoperative nausea and vomiting, type of surgery (including
      categories of major abdominal-open, orthopedic, ear nose and throat, thoracic, vascular,
      ophthalmology, abdominal-laparoscopic, urology, minor, neurology, and plastics), intra
      operative estimated blood loss, intra operative administration of the following medications:
      dexamethasone, antiemetics including dexamethasone, acetaminophen, ketorolac, muscle
      relaxant (i.e. paralytics), muscle relaxant reversal agents, and morphine equivalent dosage
      of opioids; intra operative volume of colloid administered, intra operative volume of blood
      products administered, morphine equivalent dosage of opioids administered in the post
      anesthesia care unit, times of admission and discharge from the post anesthesia care unit.
      The data will be labeled with a code that the research team can link to personal identifying
      information when acquired. The code sheet will be secured and kept separate from the
      dataset. The primary and co-investigator(s) will be the only individuals who have access to
      the password protected database stored on a secure server at the University of California
      Davis Medical Center.
