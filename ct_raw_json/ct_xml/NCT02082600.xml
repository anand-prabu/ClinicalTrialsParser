      The aims of this study are examine the effects of sleep deprivation in muscle recovery after
      a maximum eccentric resistance exercise session performed on an isokinetic dynamometer (24
      series of 10 repetitions). The sample will consist of 10 men, sedentary, clinically healthy,
      aged between 20 and 31 years old. Two experimental groups will be developed: EXE-SLEEP, in
      which subjects will perform the exercise protocol (~18:00-19:00) and will be subject to
      normal period of sleep for 3 nights; EXE-TOTAL, in which subjects will perform the same
      exercise protocol and will be sleep deprived for 60 hours, followed by one night of sleep
      rebound.

      The blood parameters analyzed will be:

        -  Creatine kinase and myoglobin: before, immediately after, 2, 4, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60
           hours after exercise protocol.

        -  Total and free testosterone, IGF-1, and cortisol: before, immediately after, 2, 4, 12,
           24, 36, 48, and 60 hours after exercise protocol. Moreover, from 19:00 of the second
           day to 19:00 of the third day it will be collected blood samples every 2 hours.

        -  GH: during the second night, GH will be evaluated every 1 hour, from 23:00 to 07:00.

        -  TNF-alfa, IL-6, IL-1 beta, IL-10, and IL-1ra: before, immediately after, and 2 hour
           after exercise, as well every 4 hours from 19:00 of the second day to 19:00 of the
           third day.

      It will be evaluated isometric strength every 12 hours, as well visual analog scale of pain.

    <description>This group will perform 24 sets of 10 maximum repetitions of eccentric contractions for quadriceps and than will keep awake for 60 hours (2 nights), followed by 1 night of sleep, all inside the lab. During whole protocol, it will be collected several blood samples for evaluation of hormones, cytokines and muscle damage parameters. It will be also evaluated isometric strength and pain.</description>
