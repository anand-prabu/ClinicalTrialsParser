Laboratory and other studies\n      suggest that the study drug, KPT-330, may prevent leukemia cells from growing and may lead\n      to the destruction of leukemia cells.  It is thought that KPT-330 activates cellular\n      processes that increase the death of leukemia cells.  The main goal of this study is to\n      evaluate the side effects of KPT-330 when it is administered to children and adolescents\n      with relapsed or refractory leukemia."
