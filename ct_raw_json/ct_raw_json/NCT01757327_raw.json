Patients with ER negative, PR positive, and HER2 negative breast\n             cancer are eligible.\n\n          -  All surgery for breast cancer (as defined by surgical excision of the cancer with a\n             negative margin or mastectomy) must be complete.\n\n          -  Undergone axillary lymph node surgery (either sentinel lymph node biopsy or axillary\n             lymph node dissection) per institutional standard.\n\n          -  Completed all (neo) adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy as recommended by the\n             treating physicians.\n\n          -  Completed the most recent cancer therapy (surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy) no\n             less than 3 and no more than 24 weeks prior to registration. Note: patients who\n             received experimental neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy or surgical therapy (with the\n             exception of Hh inhibitors) through participation in clinical trial are NOT excluded\n             from this study as long as the other trial does not exclude patients from enrolling\n             into an additional adjuvant clinical trial and enrolling into this trial will not\n             compromise the endpoints (primary and secondary) of the primary clinical trial. In\n             addition, patients must have completed the experimental therapy no less than 4 weeks\n             or 5 half lives (whichever is longer) and no more than 24 weeks prior to\n             registration.  For those patients who have enrolled into a\n             neoadjuvant/adjuvant/surgical trial, all endpoints of these trials will be reviewed\n             prior to consenting the patient for the LDE225 trial.\n\n          -  Presence of bone marrow DTCs after the completion of all intended breast cancer\n             therapy including surgery, (neo) adjuvant chemotherapy therapy, and radiation as\n             indicated.

If it is essential that the\n             patient stays on a statin to control hyperlipidemia, only pravastatin may be used\n             with extra caution.\n\n          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic\n             composition to LDE225 or other agents used in the study.\n\n          -  Planning to embark on a new strenuous exercise regimen after initiation of study\n             treatment.  Muscular activities, such as strenuous exercise, that can result in\n             significant increases in plasma CK levels should be avoided while on LDE225\n             treatment.\n\n          -  Diagnosis of a medical condition that would lead to lack of physical integrity of the\n             upper gastrointestinal tract or known malabsorption syndrome.\n\n          -  Taking warfarin and Coumadin derivatives because of potential interactions with\n             LDE225.\n\n          -  Receiving treatment with medications known to be moderate or strong inhibitors or\n             inducers of CYP3A4/5 or drugs metabolized by CYP2B6 or CYP2C9 that have narrow\n             therapeutic indices and that cannot be discontinued before starting treatment with\n             LDE225.  Medications that are strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors should be discontinued at\n             least 7 days and strong CYP3A4/5 inducers at least 2 weeks prior to starting\n             treatment with LDE225.\n\n          -  Concurrent uncontrolled medical conditions that may interfere with participation in\n             the study or potentially affect the interpretation of the study data.\n\n          -  Impaired cardiac function or clinically significant heart disease, including any one\n             of the following:\n\n               -  Angina pectoris within 3 months\n\n               -  Acute myocardial infarction within 3 months\n\n               -  QTcF > 450 msec for males and > 470 msec for females on the screening ECG\n\n               -  A past medication history of clinically significant ECG abnormalities or a\n                  family history of prolonged QT-interval syndrome\n\n               -  Other clinically significant heart disease (e.g., congestive heart failure,\n                  uncontrolled hypertension, history of labile hypertension, or history of poor\n                  compliance with an antihypertensive regimen)\n\n          -  Pregnant and/or breastfeeding.  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because\n             LDE225 is an Hh inhibitor with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient\n             effects.  Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in\n             nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with LDE225, breastfeeding\n             should be discontinued if the mother is treated with LDE225.\n\n          -  Known to be HIV-positive on combination antiretroviral therapy because of the\n             potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with LDE225.  In addition, these patients\n             are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive\n             therapy.  Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients receiving combination\n             antiretroviral therapy when indicated."
