Outcome domains include: 1) clinical outcomes (symptom\n      severity, social functioning); 2) process outcomes (perception of treatment, satisfaction,\n      group therapy alliance, treatment compliance, and attrition and treatment credibility); and\n      (3) Technical feasibility of the RELAX application. Study clinicians will be 1) trained to\n      conduct baseline and follow-up assessments 2) trained to conduct the standardized Anger\n      Management Therapy (AMT) protocol at acceptable levels of adherence and competence and 3)\n      trained how to use the technology and how to respond to technical difficulties.  Study\n      clinicians will test the feasibility of the RELAX application and show that it can be\n      integrated with CBT anger management therapies and support therapist communication through\n      the technology."
