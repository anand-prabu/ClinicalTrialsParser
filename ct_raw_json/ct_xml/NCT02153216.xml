      This study is the Formative Phase of a larger study; once this phase is completed,
      enrollment into the randomized controlled trial (RCT Phase) will begin. The primary
      objective of the Formative Phase is to gain a better understanding of the context in which
      drinking alcohol among ART client in Vietnam occurs, in order to culturally tailor the
      intervention to be tested in the RCT Phase. Formative Phase activities will consist of up to
      40 in-depth interviews with hazardous drinkers who are either: a) ART clients in one of the
      ART clinics in Thai Nguyen, or b) who are people who inject drugs (PWID) that are not
      recruited from the ART clinics (whom we will refer to as general population PWID).
