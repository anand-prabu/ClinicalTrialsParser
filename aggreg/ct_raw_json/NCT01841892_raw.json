            "textblock": "Methadone is effective for heroin addiction, but many methadone patients continue to use\n      cocaine. High magnitude and long-duration voucher-based abstinence reinforcement, in which\n      participants receive vouchers exchangeable for goods and services contingent on providing\n      drug-free biological samples, is one of the most effective treatments for drug addiction and\n      can maintain cocaine abstinence over extended periods of time. Our research on a model\n      Therapeutic Workplace has shown that employment-based abstinence reinforcement, in which\n      participants must provide drug-free urine samples to access the workplace and maintain\n      maximum pay, can maintain cocaine abstinence and reduce drug-related HIV risk behaviors over\n      extended time periods. Our next challenge is to disseminate employment-based reinforcement\n      for the treatment of drug addiction. The investigators propose to develop, manualize, and\n      pilot test a community-friendly Therapeutic Workplace intervention that can be implemented\n      widely throughout the US and elsewhere. Methadone patients who use injection or crack\n      cocaine during methadone treatment will be invited to participate (N = 58) and randomly\n      assigned to one of two groups: Usual Care (control) group or Community Therapeutic Workplace\n      group. As in our prior implementations of the Therapeutic Workplace intervention, Community\n      Therapeutic Workplace participants will enroll in Phase 1 to initiate drug abstinence and\n      acquire job skills. Participants who initiate abstinence and acquire job skills in Phase 1\n      will be hired into community workplaces with collaborating employers in Phase 2. During\n      Phase 2, employment-based abstinence reinforcement contingencies will be implemented using\n      procedures for workplace drug and alcohol testing overseen by the US Department of\n      Transportation. Using this system, a national provider of Drug-Free Workplace Services will\n      arrange random drug testing and employment-based abstinence reinforcement contingencies in\n      which employees will be required to remain drug-free to maintain employment. The\n      investigators hypothesize that participants in the Community Therapeutic Workplace group\n      will provide more drug-free samples, and engage in fewer HIV-risk behaviors than\n      participants in the Usual Care group. The study will provide vital information on the\n      acceptability of the intervention to participants and employers, and provide preliminary\n      data on the effectiveness of the investigators procedures to maintain abstinence and promote\n      employment."
