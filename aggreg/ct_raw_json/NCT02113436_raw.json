The\n      subjects under 2 years of age at Visit 1 will receive only 1 inhalation bid during the\n      run-in period. The subjects who meet the eligibility criteria for randomization will be\n      stratified according to their age (<2 or >=2 year-old) at Visit 1 and randomized to one of\n      the two treatment groups.\n\n      The total duration of participation in the study will be 10 weeks for a comparison period\n      completion and 27 weeks for a completion."
