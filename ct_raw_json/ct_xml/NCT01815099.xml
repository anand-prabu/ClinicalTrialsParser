  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We are investigating the feasibility and efficacy of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)
      for patients with GAD who were placebo nonresponders in DIEF003523.1.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately five patients with GAD who failed to respond to a sham (placebo) TMS
      intervention will be enrolled. TMS sessions will occur twice a week for five weeks.
      Assessments will occur at pretreatment, weekly during treatment, and at posttreatment.
      Approximately five nonanxious control volunteers will also be recruited to complete
      pretreatment assessments for baseline comparison purposes.

    <description>The Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS) is one of the most commonly used and extensively validated outcome measures for anxiety symptoms.  The SIGH-A allows for a standardized administration of the HARS.  Participants will be categorized for some analyses based upon treatment remission status defined as SIGH-A score.</description>
