Secondary aims\n      are to determine whether tDCS combined with CT causes larger transferable improvements on\n      non-trained tasks (i.e., generalisation effects) and whether these generalisation effects\n      are maintained over time (i.e., maintenance effects).\n\n      Specific hypotheses are:\n\n        1. CT combined with active tDCS will produce greater training gains on CT tasks compared\n           to a similar control group receiving CT with sham tDCS.\n\n        2. CT combined with active tDCS will produce greater generalisation effects on non-trained\n           cognitive tasks compared to CT with sham tDCS.\n\n        3. The cognitive improvements gained by patients from both interventions will be\n           maintained over 1 month follow-up."

Concurrent anticonvulsant or long acting benzodiazepine medication, as these\n             medications may interfere with the effects of tDCS.\n\n          3. Subject requires a rapid clinical response due to inanition, psychosis or high\n             suicide risk.\n\n          4.
