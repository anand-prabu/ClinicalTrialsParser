The potential\n      patient participants must have received a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment following a\n      comprehensive clinical assessment.  They must also be English speakers, live in the\n      community, have no evidence of significant visual or auditory impairment, and have no\n      history of diagnosed alcohol or drug abuse or major psychological disorder.  Potential\n      family / friend participants are expected to be spouses or adult children.\n\n      Brief Description:\n\n      Patients and their carers will be assigned to either a 'brief intervention group' or a 'no\n      intervention group'.  Over 5 1 1/2 -hour weekly sessions, the brief intervention group will\n      be taught a memory skills program which emphasises practical strategies for dealing with\n      everyday memory problems.  Interactive group discussion and 'take home' exercises are also\n      included.  The no intervention group will serve as a control group, and will receive only\n      their usual care from the the memory clinic.  At the completion of the study, the brief\n      intervention will be offered to those in the no intervention group.\n\n      All participants will complete questionnaires about knowledge of memory techniques, common\n      memory and behaviour problems and emotional health at pre-intervention, post-intervention\n      and after a 3-month follow-up.\n\n      Methods of Data Analysis:\n\n      Outcome evaluation will be monitored by neuropsychological assessments of memory\n      performance, and subjective self-reports.  A 2 x 3 multivariate analysis of variance\n      (MANOVA) will be used to assess differences on the experimental measures between groups\n      (brief intervention, no intervention) across repeated assessment phases (pre-intervention,\n      post-intervention, 3-month follow-up)."
