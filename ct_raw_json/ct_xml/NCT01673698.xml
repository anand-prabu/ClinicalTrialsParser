      The REDUCE Pivotal Trial is a pivotal clinical study designed to develop valid scientific
      evidence regarding the safety and effectiveness of the ReShape Duo® as an adjunct to diet
      and exercise in the treatment of obese subjects with one or more obesity-related comorbid
      conditions.
