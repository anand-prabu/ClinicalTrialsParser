      The characteristics and outcomes of a mixed group of critically ill patients who received
      mechanical ventilation are not known in China.

      A 1 month Cross-section survey will be performed with the aim of describing the
      characteristics and outcomes of conventional mechanical ventilation and treatment of acute
      respiratory distress syndrome in intensive care units in China.
