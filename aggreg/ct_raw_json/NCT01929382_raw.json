Earlier studies have demonstrated that these symptoms are common in healthy\n      volunteers as well as in patients.\n\n      This study is designed to determine whether a titration of dosing reduces the frequency and\n      severity of the FLS. A reported study with another interferon (interferon beta),\n      demonstrated a reduction in the frequency and severity of the FLS when a titration of dosing\n      was used.  This study will compare the effects of the standard dose regimen with a titration\n      regimen in healthy volunteers."
