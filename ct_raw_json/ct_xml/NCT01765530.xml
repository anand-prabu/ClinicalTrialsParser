  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the in-vivo efficacy of a novel device (endOclear)
      for cleaning the endotracheal tube (ETT) lumen from secretions. The investigators
      hypothesize that a protocol of routine ETT cleaning with endOclear may increase the ETT
      luminal volume measured at extubation compared to the current standard of care. The device
      may therefore be clinically useful by better maintaining the ETT original function.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After a few days of mechanical ventilation (MV), the lumen of the endotracheal tube (ETT) is
      coated with a thick bacterial biofilm, which is a potential source for bacterial
      colonization of the lower respiratory tract and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
      Accumulation of mucus/secretions on the interior of the ETT also effectively lowers the
      cross section of the ETT and increases significantly the work of breathing in intubated
      patients, who then require increased MV support, with prolonged intubation and ICU stay.

      A primary goal for all ICUs is to shorten the time of MV, to decrease the incidence of ETT
      microbial colonization and ultimately VAP incidence. To meet this goal several airways
      technologies to maintain the ETT free from debris/bacteria have been developed in order to
      improve the current ventilator-liberation standards in intubated critically ill patients.

      Based on preliminary laboratory, animal and clinical data, The investigators now wish to
      test the hypothesis that a novel commercially available ETT cleaning device can be effective
      in targeting two specific issues:

        -  Specific aim 1: To evaluate the mean difference in ETT luminal volume of ETTs cleaned
           with the novel cleaning device (EndOclear) vs. ETT cleaned in the standard manner.

        -  Specific aim 2: To determine whether ETTs cleaned with the novel device show a lower
           degree of microbial colonization for the entire period of mechanical ventilation.

      Data about in-vivo respiratory mechanics measurements, microbial diversity and antibiotic
      resistance analysis, users' feedbacks and safety of the device will also be collected.

      The investigators will conduct a clinical trial on 74 intubated patients randomized to
      receive standard ETT cleaning or cleaning with the EndOclear.

    <description>Implementing an original technique by Thomas, et al. (Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy. 2006, San Francisco,CA. ICAAC06-A-2966-ASM), the investigators will measure the size of the inner lumen of each ETT using a high definition Computed Tomography (CT) imaging of the extubated ETTs with subsequent reconstruction and analysis by use of dedicated software. The whole ETT will be analyzed through hig-definition CT slices, with detection of the plastic-mucus-air interfaces resulting in multiple measurement of the ETT cross-sectional area (CSA). The investigators will calculate the luminal residual air volume, the total volume of mucus and all the associated measurements, such as lowest CSA. Comparing the volume of the used ETT to a blank clean same-size one, the investigators will also measure the relative loss of volume (%) due to mucus accumulation.</description>

    <description>To evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of the endOclear, the investigators will administer an anonymous questionnaire to the RTs who will use the device during the study. RTs will be asked to evaluate the device on three clinical issues: efficacy in cleaning the ETT of the endOclear, safety of the new maneuver, and feasibility for future intensive care unit implementation. Nurses assisting the procedure will be asked for their anonymous opinion too. Outside of this final survey, users will be instructed to timely report to the investigators any concern regarding safety of the device or adverse events.</description>

    <intervention_name>ETT cleaning maneuver</intervention_name>
    <description>The ETT cleaning maneuver will be performed through the endOclear device. This is a commercially available device. It consists of an endotracheal tube cleaning apparatus with a flexible central tube and a cleaning device at its distal end. The cleaning device has a mechanically expandable mesh structure which can be adapted to selectively move between a radially-collapsed position and a radially-expanded one. In operation, the collapsed cleaning apparatus is inserted into the ETT through a Y-shaped connector. The device is then expanded by a safety toggle protected trigger mechanism that, when fired, presses the device's smooth silicone disc against the inside surface of the endotracheal tube. The cleaning apparatus is then pulled out of the endotracheal tube removing mucus deposits and secretions.
We plan to add the use of endOclear to the standard ICU practice, scheduling the systematic use of the device every 8 hours for the whole intubation period.</description>
