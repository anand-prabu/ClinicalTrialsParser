    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to characterize the pharmacokinetics of MK-1602 in the
      treatment of acute migraine, including the influence of demographic and other variables on
      MK-1602 pharmacokinetics, and to evaluate the relationship between MK-1602 concentrations
      and efficacy of the drug.
