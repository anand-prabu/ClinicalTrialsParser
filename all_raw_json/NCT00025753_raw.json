We propose to test the efficacy and safety of 2 treatments for these\n      complications in people living with HIV/AIDS: aerobic, weight lifting exercise training, and\n      a new insulin-sensitizing agent called rosiglitazone (Avandia).  Exercise and rosiglitazone\n      have been effective and moderately safe when used in HIV-seronegative people with diabetes,\n      but a specific trial is needed to test efficacy and safety in people living with HIV/AIDS."

We hypothesize\n      that rosiglitazone will lower blood sugar, insulin, blood fats, muscle and liver lipid\n      content and composition in HIV-infected people.  Exercise training will induce the same\n      benefits, but will also reduce abdominal fat mass.  We hypothesize that combining exercise\n      training with rosiglitazone therapy will be most effective at reducing blood sugar, insulin,\n      lipids, muscle and liver lipid contents, and restoring body fat distribution than either\n      intervention alone.  At baseline and after 12 wk of treatment we will measure: the ability\n      of insulin to promote the clearance of sugar from the blood, the clearance rate of blood\n      sugar, the rate of glucose production by the liver, blood fat and cholesterol\n      concentrations, body fat content and fat distribution in the arms, legs, trunk regions,\n      muscle and liver lipid content and composition."
