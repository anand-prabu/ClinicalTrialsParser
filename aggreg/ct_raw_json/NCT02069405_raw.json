However, in some patients\n      beta-blockers have little effect. This is thought to be due to a different mechanism of\n      action which continues to maintain the heart rate despite administration of beta-blockers.\n      This study aims to look at the effect of music or relaxation tracks to reduce patient heart\n      rate as anxiety is thought to play a role in maintaining high heart rates. This study will\n      randomise patients into a normal standard of care group compared to a normal standard of\n      care group with music/ relaxation track and compare heart rate, radiation dose, image\n      quality, amount of beta-blocker used and patient experience via a State-Trait Anxiety\n      Inventory (STAI) questionnaire."
