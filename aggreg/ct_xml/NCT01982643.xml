    <textblock>
      The aim of this 2-stage, 3-site study is to investigate the effectiveness and safety of a
      combination of extended-release depot naltrexone plus extended-release bupropion as a
      potential pharmacotherapy for methamphetamine (MA) use disorder.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stage 1 will include 20 individuals with severe stimulant use disorder (methamphetamine
      type) enrolled across three study sites. Following a maximum 30-day screening period to
      establish eligibility, participants will receive a monthly injection of extended-release
      depot naltrexone (XR-NTX; as Vivitrol®) plus once-daily bupropion extended-release tablets
      (BRP; as Wellbutrin XL®) for 8 weeks. Take-home oral study medication (BRP) will be
      dispensed weekly for dosing on non-clinic days. Participants will be asked to attend clinic
      twice weekly for observed BRP dosing, collection of urine samples, assessments, and medical
      management. Following the 8-week active medication phase, participants will complete a
      follow-up phase, including a medication taper and post-medication phase follow-up visit
      during Week 9. If Stage 1 data document success (see criteria below) in at least 3
      &quot;responder&quot; study participants, Stage 2 will follow utilizing the same protocol as in Stage
      1, to enroll an additional group of 29 participants. Using the same criteria of &quot;responder&quot;
      success, if the combined stages document success in at least 9 of 49 study participants, the
      combination medication will be considered to have shown sufficient potential to advance to a
      large-scale placebo-controlled trial.
