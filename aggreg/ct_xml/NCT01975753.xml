    <textblock>
      Acute pain relief in emergency setting is still a public health priority. Pain is the
      primary reason for emergency room use, but the situation of &quot;oligo-analgesia&quot; persists in
      all countries. Intravenous morphine titration has become the standard method for severe
      acute pain management in the emergency department, but it is still insufficiently
      implemented. Deviations from the recommended protocol are common: initial additional loading
      doses, unusually extended intervals between bolus, premature discontinuation. Several
      factors contribute to these difficulties: heaviness of its setting up, especially in
      overcrowding case, procedure rigidity, high consumption of nursing time. This method
      requires a systematic intravenously route, which has several inconvenients: algogenic
      procedures, coupled initial diagnostic venous sampling (delay for analgesia), excessive
      &quot;medicalization&quot; of ambulatory patients (risk of infection and less mobility in the
      emergency department). An alternative to reduce the analgesic latency in emergency
      department, without losing the benefits of tolerance and safety should be welcome. The
      inhaled route looks promising, but has yet not been enough evaluated in adults, and even
      less in the emergency room. Aerosol techniques change from one study to another (molecules,
      materials, doses, painful intensities included, judgment criteria and assessment times). A
      morphine titration by aerosol therapy could be an interesting alternative to the standard
      method disadvantages, using faster, painless and easier procedures, leading to
      &quot;demedicalization&quot;.

      To the need for stronger fundamentals, an additional study was designed in healthy
      volunteers. The objective is to compare the titration of intravenous morphine titration
      aerosol in moderate acute pain caused by electrostimulation.

      To purchase this aim, we first need to determine accurately the smallest dose of effective
      and well tolerated inhaled morphine, to provide the &quot;bolus&quot; dose we have to repeat by
      titration, which is still currently unknown. This dose is called ED50, it's the effective
      dose for at least 50% of healthy volunteers relieved. ED50 for intravenous morphine is also
      needed to be established, unknown in this indication. The determination of these two
      parallel ED50 would allow a reliable conversion factor between the two routes of
      administration for morphine &quot;bolus&quot;, which can then be tested in comparative titrations. To
      validate our induced pain model in healthy volunteers, we also have chosen to fix in these
      conditions the ED50 of fentanyl that the effective dose by nebulization is better known.
      This study would also describe the pharmacokinetics of inhaled morphine and its derivatives
      after a single spray.
