  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adjuvant therapy has been proved effective in treating earlier stage or less advanced
      non-small-cell lung cancer. This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy of icotinib as
      adjuvant therapy in treating stage IIA-IIIA adenocarcinoma patients with EGFR mutation. The
      primary endpoint is disease-free survival.
