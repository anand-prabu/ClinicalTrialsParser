  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Simulation-based training is essential in learning or maintaining skills in high risk
      industry such as aviation and railway and in the medical field like anaesthesia. Debriefing
      following simulation is fundamental in order to reduce the emotional impact of the session
      and to asses the technical and non-technical skills (behavior). Even if the ideal debriefing
      method is still to be found, individual debriefing is considered as the gold standard but
      time consuming. The DEBRIEF-SIM study is a prospective, single blinded, multicentric and
      randomized study that will compare the individual (defined by learning couple resident and
      nurse) approach to a grouped (several couples) debriefing. The primary end point is to
      define the noninferiority of this approach compared to the individual one on the educational
      impact.

      The learners will be debriefed according to their randomization after the first session, but
      will all undergo individual debriefing following the second session.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Individual debriefing consists in a individual meeting between each subject of the study and
      the investigator to analyze the management of the anaesthesia crisis simulated.

      Grouped debriefing consists in the analysis by the investigator of the management of the
      anaesthesia crisis simulated in the presence of all the subjects included in the Grouped
      Debriefing group.
