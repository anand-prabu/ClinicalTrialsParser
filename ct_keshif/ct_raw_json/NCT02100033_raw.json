However, all previous\n      physicians and medical scientists have different interpretation to De-qi, and no objective\n      principles for clinical practice, teaching and studies.\n\n      Qi propagated combined with acupuncture practice always be seen as De-qi , therefore, the\n      study control \"transmission or not\" and \"direction of sensation propagated\" to compare\n      what's different in human body. If the change happened as prediction based on acupuncture\n      theories, it could define De-qi for operation.\n\n      The study will collect 60 subjects, from age 20 to 40, the same numbers of male and female.\n      They will accept different manipulation in left hand HeGu(LI4), and assessed the variations\n      in microcirculation, temperature of left forearm, and waxing/waning of yin-yang , Qi and\n      blood in related meridian. We hope to understand if sensation propagated is primary factor\n      of De-Qi and acupuncture effect ."
