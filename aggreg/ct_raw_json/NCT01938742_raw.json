The study is designed to assess the safety, reactogenicity, and\n      immunogenicity of a monovalent influenza A/H7N9 virus vaccine manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur\n      administered to healthy adults at different dosages (3.75, 7.5, or 15 mcg of HA/0.5 mL dose)\n      given with MF59 adjuvant manufactured by Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics and without\n      adjuvant (15 mcg of HA/0.5 mL dose and 45 mcg of HA/0.75 mL dose).  The A/H7N9 vaccine was\n      made with HA antigen derived from the influenza A/Shanghai/2/2013 virus. Subjects will be\n      randomly assigned to 1 of 7 groups (up to 100 subjects per group) to receive two doses of\n      the A/H7N9 vaccine with and without MF59 adjuvant delivered intramuscularly approximately 21\n      days apart.  The same dosage of A/H7N9 vaccine will be given to subjects at both their first\n      and second study vaccinations. The primary objectives are to: 1) assess the safety and\n      reactogenicity of a monovalent influenza A/H7N9 virus vaccine following receipt of two doses\n      administered with and without MF59 adjuvant; and 2) assess new-onset chronic medical\n      conditions following receipt of two doses of a monovalent influenza A/H7N9 virus vaccine\n      administered with and without MF59 adjuvant. The duration of the study for each subject will\n      be approximately 13 months."
