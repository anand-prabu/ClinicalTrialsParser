            "textblock": "This is a study of drug effectiveness for 2 treatments of vivax malaria, which is one of the\n      two main types of malaria in Viet Nam.  There are two important drugs used in Viet Nam for\n      treating vivax malaria, Chloroquine and Artemisinin.  Sometimes, when medicines are used for\n      many years they become less effective at treating a disease, especially when they are not\n      used at adequate doses according to national guidelines or when counterfeit drugs are\n      available in the market.  The purpose of this study is to check that Chloroquine and\n      Artemisinin, are still effective for patients in Viet Nam.\n\n      Participants in this study will be treated with either Dihydroartemisinin-Piperaquine\n      (DHA-PPQ) or Chloroquine (CQ) for 3 days. Both drugs are recommended by the national\n      guidelines to treat vivax malaria. The investigators would like to know if both of these\n      treatments are equally effective so half of the patients in the study will be treated with\n      DHA-PPQ and the other half will be treated with CQ.  This way the investigators can compare\n      the drugs to find out if one is better than the other.\n\n      Participants will be followed for 3 days in hospital, then regularly by follow-up visits\n      until the 63rd day.  Tests will be done to determine the amount of drug and malaria\n      parasites in the participant's body and how the blood cells react to the malaria.  The\n      parasite will be tested to determine what type it is and how it reacts to the treatment.\n\n      The results of the study will be used to inform malaria treatment guidelines in Viet Nam."
