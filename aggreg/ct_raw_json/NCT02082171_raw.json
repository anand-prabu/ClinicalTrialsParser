            "textblock": "Prevention of physical disability represents a major priority for the public health system.\n      Physical disability is the final result of a complex cascade of negative events occurring at\n      different levels (i.e., environmental, social, biological, and clinical). The heterogeneity\n      of the underlying mechanisms responsible for the onset of physical disability may require\n      the adoption of preventive interventions affecting multiple domains. Although several\n      studies suggest that single or different combinations of preventive interventions (in\n      particular, physical activity, cognitive training, and healthy diet) might provide\n      beneficial effects in preventing functional loss (and its related features, such as pain or\n      reduced quality of life), very limited evidence coming from clinical trials is currently\n      available on the topic. Intervention trials are usually designed to test the effect of a\n      specific monodimensional intervention on a very selected population, so to reduce the risk\n      of biased results. This approach, although legitimate and methodologically correct, may 1)\n      be insufficient to target the multiple and heterogeneous physiopathological mechanisms\n      underlying the onset of physical disability, and 2) cause a population selection bias\n      leading to difficulties in implementing the study results to the overall older population\n      (thus, determining the \"evidence-based medicine\" issue in the elderly). To our knowledge,\n      there are no available data from clinical trials evaluating the effects of a multidomain\n      intervention based on lifestyle modifications (e.g., physical activity, cognitive training,\n      nutritional modification) for preventing mobility disability (a very early phase of the\n      disabling process) in community-dwelling older persons. In the present project (Multidomain\n      Intervention to preveNt Disability in ElDers, MINDED), we propose to conduct a pilot study\n      aimed at estimating the effects of a multidomain person-tailored preventive intervention\n      (based on physical activity, cognitive training, and nutritional modifications) on frailty\n      status, physical performance, cognitive function, nutritional status, health-related quality\n      of life, and use of health care services. In addition, we will perform cost-effectiveness\n      analyses of the proposed intervention. The project will yield the necessary preliminary data\n      to design a definitive full-scale Phase 3 randomized clinical trial. By providing a\n      conclusive answer about the effectiveness of a multidimensional preventive program in the\n      primary prevention of major health-related outcomes, the results of the full-scale trial\n      will have relevant clinical and public health implications, and will promote the practicing\n      of a truly evidence-based geriatric medicine."
