      Broadly, the purpose of the proposed study is to test the efficacy of a parent-coordinated,
      parent-teen-teacher collaborative intervention for middle school students with ADHD and
      academic impairment (STAND; Supporting Teens' Academic Needs Daily). [This model was chosen
      because of its potential ability to promote treatment maintenance and generalizability
      across school years, because parents will be taught to implement, monitor, and adjust
      intervention components as needed. Key innovative components in the STAND intervention
      address previously reported treatment barriers: 1) a parent-delivered academic intervention
      to promote maintenance and generalization across school years, and to relieve some of the
      burden of intervention delivery from teachers, 2) motivational interviewing to address
      parent disengagement from and adolescent resistance to the treatment process, 3) multiple
      tailored options for home-school communication, including a web-based support system, to
      facilitate home-school communication, and 4) empowering parents by coaching them to
      effectively and tactfully involve teachers in the treatment planning and monitoring process
      in order to increase teachers' willingness to support the child's academic needs. To study
      the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of the STAND treatment model,] two cohorts of 42
      middle school students with ADHD will be recruited (total N=84) and randomly assigned to
      participate in STAND or a treatment-as-usual monitoring group. All participants will
      complete intake, mid-treatment, post-treatment, [and follow-up] assessments designed to
      monitor academic functioning, [intervention feasibility, compliance, and satisfaction].

      Aim 1: The proposed study will evaluate the efficacy, [maintenance, and cross-school year
      generalization] of a parent-teen-teacher collaborative intervention (Supporting Teens'
      Academic Needs Daily; STAND) vs. treatment as usual to increase the academic functioning of
      middle school students with ADHD. Intervention effects on ADHD symptomatology and
      impairment, grade-point-average (GPA), [organization, daily planner use], homework
      completion, teacher ratings of academic functioning and classroom behavior, and the
      parent-teen relationship will be examined.

      Aim 2: The proposed study will examine the acceptability and feasibility of the STAND
      program. Parents and teens will report on [satisfaction, barriers to treatment
      participation, therapeutic alliance, and treatment credibility] throughout the intervention
      and follow-up period. [Therapists will also complete ratings of parent and adolescent
      engagement and compliance with treatment procedures] will be collected from participants in
      the program. Parent, teen, and teacher compliance with intervention procedures will also be
      measured in order to assess feasibility. Treatment fidelity measures will also be collected
      in order to measure clinician adherence to the manualized STAND procedures.

      Aim 3: The proposed study will also explore ways to improve home-school communication during
      the middle school years. To this end, families will be given options regarding the modality
      of communication with teachers, and parent, teen, and teacher preferences for medium of
      intervention delivery will be examined (i.e., web-based, email, paper/pencil).
