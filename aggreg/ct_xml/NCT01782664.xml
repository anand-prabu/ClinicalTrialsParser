  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A multi-centre, randomised, dose ranging study to evaluate the safety and clinical efficacy
      of GSK2586184 in patients with chronic plaque psoriasis.

      There will be 2 study cohorts (Cohorts A and B). Cohort A is the main study cohort, and this
      part of the study will be randomised, double-blind and placebo-controlled. Fifty-six
      subjects will be randomised in Cohort A: 14 subjects in each treatment group:  100 mg, 200
      mg or 400 mg GSK2586184, or placebo. Cohort B is an exploratory, open-label investigation of
      the effect of 400 mg GSK2586184 on inflammatory gene expression in the skin and whole blood,
      and GSK2586184 concentrations in the skin. A maximum of 8 subjects will be included, and all
      subjects will take 400 mg GSK2586184.

      In both Cohorts A and B, study medication will be administered orally (as tablets), twice
      daily, for up to 12 weeks.

      Each subject will have 7 out-patient visits: Screening; Baseline &amp; Start of treatment; Week
      2; Week 4; Week 8; Week 12; and Follow-up (Week 16)
