A total of 20\n      patients will be randomized to intra-detrusor injection of 300 U Onabotulinumtoxin A in 30\n      ml NaCl 0.9 % or placebo with 30 ml NaCl 0.9 %. Bladder biopsies will be obtained in the\n      same procedure. The treatment will be repeated after three months. All included patients\n      will be evaluated with urodynamic examinations. Follow-up is 12 months after the first\n      treatment. The primary endpoint of the study is development of NDO."
