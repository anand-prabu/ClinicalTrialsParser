  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In most of situation, left colon (especially SD junction) is considered the most difficult
      part of colonoscopy, where endoscopist may encounter difficulty for scope insertion and
      patients may feel pain or uncomfortable. It is suggested more than half of the whole time
      for scope insertion should be used in left colon. Many methods, such as water immersion,
      abdominal palpation, have been used to facilitate insertion in left colon.

      Colonoscopy with whole-colon water exchange method has been shown to be useful for reducing
      medication used, pain experienced during colonoscopy, increasing the success rate of cecum
      intubation and adenoma detection rate in sedated and unsedated patients undergoing screening
      colonoscopy. Exchange of water during scope insertion minimizes loop formation and prevents
      lengthening and distension of the colon during colonoscopy. This will facilitate the
      colonoscopy in average or difficult colonoscopy. However, it is not known whether the
      benefits of water exchange method of colonoscopy was mainly due to its effect on the left
      colon.

      We hypothesized that left-colon water exchange colonoscopy (LWE) may have the similar effect
      regarding the maximal pain score and mean pain score in unsedated patients compared with
      whole-colon water exchange colonoscopy (WWE). At the mean time, LWE may reduce the insertion
      time compared with WWE. Here we performed a prospective, randomized controlled study to
      investigate the efficacies of whole-colon water exchange, left-colon water exchange and air
      methods of colonoscopy on pain score and insertion time in unsedated outpatients.
