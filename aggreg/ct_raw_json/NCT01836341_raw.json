This\n      study will then test the safety of afatinib at different dose levels when combined with the\n      chemotherapy drugs cisplatin or carboplatin, and pemetrexed. These treatments will be given\n      during radiation treatment and the drug afatinib will be continued after chemotherapy and\n      radiation."
