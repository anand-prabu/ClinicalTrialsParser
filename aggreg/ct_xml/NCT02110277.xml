    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop technology to image the ovaries in order to better
      evaluate ovarian disease and to study how these experimental imaging techniques might work
      together or separately to improve our ability to detect ovarian cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Epithelial ovarian cancer causes the highest mortality of any of the gynecologic cancers
      although it is the second most common gynecologic malignancy.  Ovarian cancer is not usually
      detected earlier than Stage III or IV because it is usually asymptomatic; yet survival is
      high with early stage disease. In addition, women with a pelvic mass noted on ultrasound
      that undergo oophorectomy have only a 1-3% risk of malignancy and thus 97-99% will be
      overtreated because of our inability to reliably differentiate benign from malignant masses
      with ultrasound. BRCA1 testing and family history will identify certain high-risk
      individuals who have a higher risk of malignancy and need a modality that will be more
      reliable in detecting early cancers to provide more accurate surveillance.We are developing
      a new transvaginal imaging device optimized for ovarian cancer detection, diagnosis and
      validated from ex vivo and in vivo clinical studies. This automated system  may provide an
      early diagnostic tool for ovarian cancer in the future.
