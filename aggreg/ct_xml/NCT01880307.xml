      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a top-down treatment approach, prescribing
      infliximab and azathioprine at diagnose, yields better outcome in comparison to the usual
      step-up treatment approach, starting with prednison and azathioprine, in moderate-to-severe
      pediatric Crohn's disease (CD) patients.

      1. Objective: The purpose of this study is to determine whether a top-down treatment
           approach, prescribing infliximab and azathioprine at diagnose, yields better outcome in
           comparison to the usual step-up treatment approach, starting with prednison and
           azathioprine, in moderate-to-severe pediatric Crohn's disease (CD) patients.

        2. Sample size: We will include 90 (2 x 45) patients, so at least 80 patients will be
           available for evaluation at 52 weeks. With these numbers a difference of 50% and 82% (=
           32) can be shown at a power of 80% (2-sided Î± 0.05; nQuery Advisor). This difference is
           feasible as in a retrospective study on infliximab step-up vs top-down in pediatric
           Crohn's disease steroid free remission in the step-up arm in 5 out of 11 (45%) patients
           was observed vs in 15 out of 18 (83%) in the top-down arm(1).

        3. Study design: an international open-label randomised controlled trial

        4. Study population: Children (age 1-17 yrs) with new-onset, untreated, CD with
           moderate-to-severe disease activity Intervention: Patients will be randomized to either
           top-down IFX treatment or conventional step-up treatment.

        5. Main study parameters/endpoints: The primary endpoint at 52 weeks is steroid free
           clinical remission. The secondary endpoints, amongst others, will be mucosal healing at
           10 weeks assessed by endoscopy and prevention of complications (fistulas, strictures,
           need for surgery). Endoscopy at 52 weeks will be performed to assess mucosal healing in
           case of persisting complaints.

        6. Nature and extent of the burden: In total, approximately 8 study visits will take
           place. During each visit physical examination will take place. Patients are requested
           to collect a stool sample twice. Blood draws will be performed when patients undergo
           venous puncture for routine procedure anyway, in total 6 times. Patients will undergo
           ileocolonoscopy under general anaesthesia at week 10. During ileocolonoscopy mucosal
           biopsies of ileum and colon will be taken.

        7. Potential risks and benefit associated with participation: Ileocolonoscopy is a safe
           procedure. The short-term risks of IFX treatment are the risk of infections and
           immunogenicity. The long-term risks of IFX treatment are currently unknown. It is
           likely that patients in treatment arm 2 eventually also will be treated with IFX, but
           in a later stage of the disease. The benefit with participation is the higher
           likelihood of early achievement of mucosal healing in treatment arm 1: top-down IFX
           treatment which may well prevent complications such as growth failure and fistulas or
           strictures that require surgery. Pediatric CD has a more severe disease course than
           adult CD, as illustrated by a higher upper gastrointestinal involvement and more
           extensive disease. Active CD during childhood often leads to growth failure and/or
           delay of pubertal development. Moreover, short disease history and a younger age at
           diagnosis are possibly related to a better efficacy of IFX. Therefore, top-down IFX
           might be even more beneficial in pediatric than in adult patients.
