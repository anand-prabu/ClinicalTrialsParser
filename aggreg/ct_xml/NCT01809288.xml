      Background:

      - Rates of diabetes and heart disease in women are increasing. Early recognition of risk
      could help women live longer and healthier lives. Race and ethnicity may affect the best
      kinds of tests to use to screen for these conditions. Researchers want to compare risk
      factors for diabetes and heart disease in African, African-American, and white women. Doing
      so may help identify the most effective screening test for each group. This study will look
      at healthy African, African-American, and white women who are federal employees and
      contractors.

      Objectives:

      - To study risk factors for diabetes and heart disease in African, African-American, and
      white women.

      Eligibility:

        -  Healthy African, African-American, and white women between 30 and 65 years of age who
           are federal employees or contractors.

        -  For this study, African women must be born in Africa and have immigrated to the United
           States, and report that both parents are Africans. African-American women must
           self-identify as African-Americans, born in the United States, and have parents who
           both self-identify as African-American born in the United States. White women must
           self-identify as white and have parents who also self-identify as white.

      Design:

        -  Participants will have four visits to study their risk factors for diabetes and heart
           disease.

        -  The first visit is a screening visit. Participants will be screened with a physical
           exam and medical history. Blood and urine samples will be collected. They will also
           have an EKG test. Participants will also be shown how to fill out a 3-Day Food Record
           and wear an activity monitor called an accelerometer. The food record will keep track
           of how much participants eat for 3 consecutive days, including 1 non-working day. The
           accelerometer device will be worn for 3 days to monitor movement.

        -  At the second visit, participants will have blood tests, an oral glucose tolerance
           test, and body fat measurements. They will also fill out questionnaires, review the
           food record, and have two imaging studies.

        -  At the third visit, participants will have a longer glucose tolerance test. During the
           test, participants will receive both glucose and insulin and blood samples will be
           collected over several hours. Participants will receive lunch at the clinical center
           after the test.

        -  At the fourth visit, participants will have a meal test. They will fast for 12 hours
           before the test. Participants will eat a specific meal and have blood samples taken
           during and after they eat.

        -  Participants will discuss the results of these tests with the study doctors.

    <textblock>
      African-American women experience disproportionately high rates of conditions related to
      insulin resistance, specifically type 2 diabetes (T2D) and cardiovascular disease (CVD). In
      Africa, T2D and CVD have also become leading causes of death for women. Early recognition of
      risk and the implementation of preventive measures could improve both quality of life and
      longevity as well as decrease health care expenditures. However, screening tests for the
      early detection of T2D and CVD were developed several decades ago in large studies with
      mostly white participants. Emerging evidence suggests that there are racial differences in
      the ability and importance of various risk factors to predict the development of diabetes
      and CVD. Consequently tests used to screen for T2D and CVD are often not effective in women
      of African descent. Thus, women of African descent lose the opportunity and benefit of early
      intervention. Designing tests to determine risk for T2D and CVD in women of African descent
      requires an appreciation of why current tests do not work. Screening tests to detect risk
      for T2D and CVD usually rely on the observation that insulin resistance is associated with
      increased hepatic fat and high triglyceride (TG) levels. However, while insulin resistant
      white women usually have both high liver fat and TG levels, insulin-resistant
      African-American women usually have normal TG levels and low hepatic fat. Therefore, these
      tests routinely fail to detect risk in African-American women.

      The relationship between TG levels to insulin resistance and liver fat has never been
      studied in African women. To improve diagnosis, we propose a study of race differences in TG
      levels and hepatic fat comparing 3 groups of women who are federal employees or contractors:
      African-American African (born in subSaharan Africa and immigrated to the United States) and
      white. This design ensures all enrollees will have health insurance, a similar work
      environment and a comparable distribution of position (i.e. scientific, administrative,
      support). Analyses to detect differences in diet, physical activity and other psychosocial
      factors will be undertaken. There will be 4 outpatient visits for 360 non-diabetic women
      (120 African-American, 120 African and 120 white, aged 30 to 65 years, BMI 20 to 45 kg/m(2)
      enrolled. At Visit 1, a medical history, physical exam and screening labs will be done.
      Then, for 3 days prior to Visit 2, participants will record food intake and monitor physical
      activity. At Visit 2 an oral glucose tolerance test will be performed. Studies to examine
      body fat content and distribution will also be done. At Visit 3, insulin resistance will be
      measured with an intravenous glucose tolerance test. At Visit 4, breakfast will be eaten
      with blood samples taken before and after the meal.

      This study will be the first time (a) TG levels in African immigrants are compared to
      African-American and white women (b) the relationship of TG to insulin resistance, liver
      fat, body fat distribution, diet, physical activity and psychosocial factors are examined in
      these 3 groups of women under similar metabolic and economic conditions. While failure of
      screening tests means a lost opportunity for early intervention, effective screening tests
      can change outcomes, improve lives and minimize health care expenditures. This protocol is
      building a foundation on which effective screening tests for diabetes and heart disease can
      be built.
