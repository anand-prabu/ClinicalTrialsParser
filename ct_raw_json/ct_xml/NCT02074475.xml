      Primary endpoint: Defining The optimal target range for Surgical Pleth index. Surgical Pleth
      Index (SPI, formerly used SSI = Surgical Stress Index) is a novel multivariate index, which
      is based on the sum of the normalized pulse beat interval (PBI) and the
      photoplethysmography. SPI indicates the balance between intensity of surgical stimulation
      and the level of anti-nociception (opioid analgesia and neural blockade). This study is a
      Spin off from a larger Adequacy of Anaesthesia study and aims on finding the most
      appropriate target range for SPI in order to avoid signs of inadequate anaesthesia. Patients
      are treated without monitoring adequacy of anaesthesia thus the values are collected blinded
      and analyzed afterwards in accordance of signs for inadequate anaesthesia. The study
      population will be 150 patients.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Ability to provide written informed consent

               -  Age 18-80 years of age

               -  Surgery that is expected to last at least 2 hours under general anesthesia with
                  endotracheal tube

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any subject that meets the definition of vulnerable subject as defined in ISO
             14155:2011o Per ISO 14155:2011, a vulnerable subject is defined as an individual
             whose willingness to volunteer in a clinical investigation could be unduly influenced
             by the expectation, whether justified or not, of benefits associated with
             participation or of retaliatory response from senior members of a hierarchy in case
             of refusal to participate

               -  Any subject with a cardiac pacemaker

               -  Any subject with atrial fibrillation at the time of obtaining the baseline
                  values

               -  Any subject with more than 5 ventricular extra systoles/minute at the time of
                  obtaining the baseline values

               -  Any subject who needs invasive blood pressure measurement

               -  Any subject who show hemodynamics that would have qualified for being considered
                  as a sign of inadequate anesthesia already at baseline:

                  o Mean blood pressure below 60 mmHg or above 100 mmHg o HR below 45 /min or
                  above 100/min

               -  Any subject with epidural anesthesia or analgesia during the surgery. Epidural
                  catheter may be placed pre-operatively, and used in the PACU, but not during the
                  surgery

               -  Any subject having surgery that requires prone position

          -  Any subject with very high body mass index (&gt;35) because of incompatibility with the
             target controlled anesthesia models used

               -  Any subject with known allergies to the specific anesthetic agents/ analgesic
                  drugs intended for use in their surgeries

               -  Any subject with laryngeal mask airway

               -  Any subject who requires neuromuscular blocking agent infusion

               -  Any subject who is going to have major surgery with a high risk of extensive
                  blood loss

               -  Any subject with known chronic use of opioids
