Determine the antitumor activity of DX-8951f in patients with recurrent,\n      metastatic, or unresectable ovarian, tubal, or peritoneal carcinoma that is refractory to\n      platinum, taxane, and topotecan. II. Evaluate the quantitative and qualitative toxic effects\n      of this regimen in these patients. III. Evaluate the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in\n      these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified by prior chemotherapy (minimally pretreated vs heavily\n      pretreated). Patients receive intravenous DX-8951f over 30 minutes daily for 5 days. Courses\n      repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n      Patients are followed every 3 months until death.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 37 patients will be accrued for this study."
