  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of eating various levels of
      mycoprotein (Quorn) on feelings of appetite, energy intake and levels of gut hormones in
      overweight volunteers.

    <description>Energy intake will be assessed during an ad-libitum meal at 180 minutes at the end of each study visit. Participants will be offered a meal in excess and asked to eat until they feel comfortably full. The meal will be weighed before and after consumption and energy intake will be calculated from the manufacturer's reported nutritional composition.</description>
