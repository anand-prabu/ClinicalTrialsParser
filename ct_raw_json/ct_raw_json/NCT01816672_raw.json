Type I or II diabetes requiring medical treatment as determined by the physician\n\n          4. The largest non-healing wound, if multiple wounds are present, or the single wound to\n             be treated   (index ulcer) is a Wagner 1 or 2 Diabetic Foot Ulcer (DFU; see Appendix\n             9 for Wagner Classification) that is located on the plantar, medial, or lateral\n             aspect of the foot (including all toe surfaces but not on the heel). Subjects who\n             have heel ulcers may be included if another, eligible wound is the index ulcer\n\n          5. For subjects with potentially multiple eligible DFUs, the largest ulcer will be\n             selected. There must be at least 4 cm between the index ulcer and other ulcers; if\n             all ulcers are closer than 4 cm, the subject should not be enrolled (screen failure)\n\n          6. Debrided ulcer size between 0.5 cm2 and 20 cm2\n\n          7. Demonstrated adequate offloading regimen\n\n          8. Duration \u2265 1 month at first visit (screening period)\n\n          9. Subject must be willing to comply with the Protocol, which will be assessed by\n             enrolling clinician.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          1. Subjects known to be sensitive to AutoloGel components (calcium chloride, thrombin,\n             ascorbic acid) and/or materials of bovine origin\n\n          2. Wagner 3, 4, or 5 DFU (see Appendix 9 for Wagner Classification) Page 15 of 58\n\n          3. Any clinically infected index ulcer that is apparent on Day 0. The presence of\n             infection is defined by \u2265 2 classic findings of inflammation (erythema, warmth,\n             tenderness, pain, or induration) or purulent secretions (Lipsky, 2012, or see\n             Appendix 4)\n\n          4. Presence of another wound that is concurrently treated and might interfere with index\n             wound\n\n          5. Ulcer not of DFU pathophysiology (e.g., venous, vasculitic, radiation, rheumatoid,\n             collagen vascular disease, pressure, or arterial etiology)\n\n          6. Presence of underlying osteomyelitis, or if osteomyelitis is suspected\n\n          7. Received systemic corticosteroids or immunosuppressive agents, hyperbaric oxygen\n             therapy (HBOT), electrostimulation, growth factors, or any cell or tissue-derived\n             products for wounds during the 30 days preceding the screening visit; received\n             radiation therapy or chemotherapy within previous 6 months\n\n          8. Any malignancy other than non-melanoma skin cancer\n\n          9. Ischemic ulcer defined as an ankle brachial index (ABI; handheld or Arterial Doppler)\n             < 0.8 (note: if ABI is \u2265 1, then an skin perfusion pressure (SPP) or transcutaneous\n             oximetry (TCOM) must be performed or the subject cannot be enrolled), TCOM < 30 mm\n             Hg, or SPP < 30 mm Hg; toe pressure < 45 mm Hg. These measurements may be concurrent\n             with the initial evaluation of the index ulcer or obtained within 90 days of study\n             enrollment if done prior to that concurrence.\n\n         10. Subject has radiographic evidence consistent with diagnosis of active Charcot foot\n\n         11. Untreated Charcot foot or DFUs associated with a treated Charcot deformity in which\n             reconstruction or offloading has not taken place\n\n         12. Ulcer expected to be treated with any advanced therapeutics (e.g., HBOT)\n\n         13. Ulcer area decreases by \u2265 30% during 2-week screening/run-in period\n\n         14. Subjects who are cognitively impaired and do not have a healthcare proxy\n\n         15. Serum albumin of less than 2.5 g/dL\n\n         16. Plasma Platelet count of less than 100 x 109/L\n\n         17. Hemoglobin of less than 10.5 g/dL\n\n         18. Subject has inadequate venous access for repeated blood draw required for AutoloGel\n             Administration\n\n         19. Subject requires or is anticipated to require interventions directed at improvement\n             of arterial perfusion to affected area."
