      While few students may consider a career in research at baseline, receiving information from
      peers via online social networks represents a potential way of reaching underserved minority
      students.

      This study addresses a critical problem in the process to diversify the pipeline of clinical
      researchers - how to cultivate baseline interest in research among high achieving youth
      before they participate in pipeline programs. We will seek to challenge existing paradigms
      of studying effectiveness of interventions to promote entry of minority youth into clinical
      research careers through testing a novel social media campaign that aims to increase
      interest in research careers among schoolmates of students in a pipeline program.  We are
      testing the use of of peer-created and inspired videos about career choice as a novel way to
      develop messages that have potential to influence teens.

      Should this research program be successful, it will yield valuable insights for researchers
      and educators who are attempting to train minority students about the importance of
      involving youth in creating materials to recruit and retain minorities into pipeline
      programs and educational programs targeted towards clinical research.

        enrolled. The subjects for this study include two populations of students age 15-17: (1)
        Collegiate Scholars members to participate in focus groups and (2) feedback group
        recruited by students involved in TEACH research to view the social media campaign.

             Scholars Program which is a pipeline program for Chicago Public School students.

          -  The feedback group will be recruited by friends involved in the Teach Research study.
              They must be named by one of their friends participating in Teach Research.

        Exclusion Criteria:
