The two\n      tools are the Royal Marsden Abridged Adult Nutrition Screening Tool (AANST) and the\n      Malnutrition Screening Tool (MST)[10]  The tools will be compared with the currently\n      accepted gold standard, Patient Generated Subjective Global Assessment (PG-SGA). Both\n      screening tools are in the form of scored questionnaires and are suitable for electronic\n      input.\n\n      The ultimate objective is to select an adult inpatient nutrition screening tool with the\n      highest sensitivity for future use in the oncology inpatient setting in order to allow\n      prompt commencement of an appropriate nutrition care plan."
