      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the 123 women emergency phone line of
      Medellin (Colombia) leads to a reduction in the violence suffered by women, as well as in
      their psychological wellbeing and attitudes towards violence.

      There is excess demand for the 123 women emergency phone line of Medellin. While on average
      10 cases are reported (excluding referrals at night by the police, between 7pm and 7:00
      a.m.), the average daily capacity of operation is 6 cases. So, is not possible for the 123
      women team to track all women who call in 24 hours. Women who cannot receive the services of
      the 123 women team only get the emergency support of the police and do not receive
      additional aid (while it is verified that the rights of women are respected and they are
      guided to relevant services). The excess of demand over the capacity of the team of the 123
      women line represents a natural experiment.

      Women will be recruited from those who are attended by the 123 emergency women phone line
      immediately as well as from those who were only attended by emergency support of the police
      and may have received later the support of the 123 women line (control group). In a first
      instance, women will be called to verify their address. A face to face survey will be
      conducted by mid-2015.

    <intervention_name>123 women emergency phone line in Medellin, Colombia</intervention_name>
    <description>123 is the emergency number in Colombia. The 123- woman line consists of supplementary emergency services to meet the demands of urgency in relation to cases of VAW. This service is implemented by the mayor of Medellin, in collaboration with the national police who is the institution in charge of managing the 123 line.
When the police attends an emergency on VCM, the call is derived to the 123- woman line. There, a team consisting of a psychologist and a lawyer serves women in crisis, as emergency services provided by the police are developed in parallel. The team verifies that the rights of women are respected and that women are oriented to the relevant services. The 123- woman line operates from 7:00 am to 7:00 pm, Monday through Friday.</description>
