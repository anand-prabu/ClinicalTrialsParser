  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hospitalization of youth with established diabetes is both costly and frequently
      preventable. Poor glycemic control is a risk factor for hospitalization and is also
      associated with adolescent age and lower socioeconomic status. This is a randomized,
      controlled trial for high-risk adolescent youth with T1DM and suboptimal glycemic control
      with an intervention arm and usual care control arm matched for frequency of contacts. There
      will be 110 subjects with T1DM and HbA1c&gt;8%, aged 13 to 17 years, recruited from the
      Diabetes Program at Boston Children's Hospital and followed for 6 months. The intervention
      will be implemented by a diabetes nurse educator and social worker, who will each have
      monthly contact with the adolescent and a parent/guardian through a telehealth
      (videoconference) visit. Care will be guided by a diabetes action plan. Telehealth
      interventions have been utilized successfully in both adults and youth with diabetes. They
      facilitate frequent contact with the care team allowing barriers to adherence to be
      addressed, education to be reinforced, care plans to be updated, and diabetes-specific
      family support to be provided.
