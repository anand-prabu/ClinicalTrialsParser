As the disease progresses the cartilage become frustrated,\n      surrounding bone react to become thicker and inflammation occurs in subchondral bone seen in\n      T2-weighted MRI as increase in signal density. Patients are treated initially by pain\n      management. In patients who don't response to first line treatment invasive treatment like\n      total knee replacement is done. The investigators designed this clinical study with the aim\n      of evaluating therapeutic effects of intra-articular injection of bone marrow mesenchymal\n      stem cells (BM-MSCs) in 60 patients with  knee osteoarthritis."
