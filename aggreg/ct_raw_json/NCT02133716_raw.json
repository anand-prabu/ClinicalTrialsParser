Each pointer may take four values \u200b\u200bon a scale from 0 to 3, which is subsequently added to an overall score. The score range from 0 (no pain or the presence of minimal pain) to 21 (maximum pain) in preterm.\nPIPP score was evaluated at 30 seconds after venopuncture Both the validity and reliability of this scale have been studied and proven in various studies.\nThe PIPP scale will it be monitored by skilled and experienced nurses in neonatal care.",
