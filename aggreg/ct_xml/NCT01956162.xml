  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multi-center trial, randomized in 2 parallel groups, open label, with a blinded adjudication
      committee (PROBE methodology), comparing &quot;Orthèse Diabète&quot; with &quot;conventional&quot; removable
      devices in terms of healing of ulcers.

      - Primary objective: Evaluate the efficiency of &quot;Orthèse Diabète&quot; compared to &quot;conventional&quot;
      removable devices, in terms of the proportion of diabetic patients whose principal ulcer
      will heal completely at 3 months.

      1. Secondary objectives

             1. Proportion of patients whose principal ulcer will heal completely at 1, 2 and 6
                months

             2. Proportion of patients in whom all initial plantar ulcers will heal
                completely at 1, 2, 3 and 6  months

             3. Percentage of area decrease of  the plantar ulcers at 1, 2, 3 and 6  months

             4. Time to healing of the principal ulcer

             5. Appearance of new ulcers

             6. Requirement for amputation

             7. Incidence of the infectious complications

             8. Adherence of wearing

             9. Patient's satisfaction with the prescribed device

        2. Population

             1. 10 centers/110 patients monitored for a period of 6 months maximum

             2. Experimental  Group: &quot;Orthèse Diabète&quot; a plantar off-loading custom-made removable
                device

             3. Control group: &quot;Conventional&quot; removable off-loading systems among the devices
                available in France.
