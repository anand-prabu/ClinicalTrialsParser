      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of Askina® Calgitrol® Paste in reducing
      local infection in subjects treated for mildly infected Diabetic Foot Ulcers (DFU) with
      Askina® Calgitrol® Paste.

  <study_design>Endpoint Classification: Safety/Efficacy Study, Intervention Model: Single Group Assignment, Masking: Open Label, Primary Purpose: Treatment</study_design>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical signs of local infection (Presence of erythema, pain, tenderness, warmth or induration)</measure>
    <time_frame>At day 0, day 2 and weekly in a period of a maximum of 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>During each of the day 2 and weekly control visits, the investigator will observe the wound visually and assess it for signs of Clinical infection, using the Guidelines for Diabetic Foot Ulcer infection of the Infectious Diseases Society of America. The investigator will score the degree of infection of the wound according to a table adapted from the 8 items wound score for diabetic foot infections.
In general, treatment with Askina Calgitrol Paste will be discontinued when local infection has resolved or when it was worsened since the last control visit. However, treatment of Askina Calgitrol Paste will continued after 4 weeks of treatment only if there are signs of improvement.
The treatment period of Askina Calgitrol Paste will last a maximum of 6 weeks.</description>

    <time_frame>Daily or at every change of dressing, in a period of a maximum of 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Ease of application and removal of dressing will be assessed by the subject/subject's relatives and the investigator using a rating scale of 1 (very easy) to 5 (very difficult). Dressing change at home will be evaluated in a patient diary by the patient or the carer and dressing changes in the clinic by the investigator.</description>
