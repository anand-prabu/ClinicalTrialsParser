It will be a double-blind, randomized crossover with a rest period (wash-out) of\n      4 weeks. The study population will be 32 healthy male volunteers to whom will be\n      administered a single dose of 180 microgram of each product, subcutaneously. The study will\n      have a total duration of 14 days in each treatment step. The serum concentration of\n      PEG-interferon for both products,  measured  by enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and by antiviral\n      activity of PEG-interferon,  is the main variable.For this purpose 15 samples of each\n      volunteers will be needed. Clinical and laboratory variables, useful as pharmacodynamics\n      parameters Beta-2 microglobulin (\u03b22M) - 2'5'oligoadenylate synthetase - oligoadenylate\n      synthetase (OAS)- and neopterin) and safety evaluation, will be measured."
