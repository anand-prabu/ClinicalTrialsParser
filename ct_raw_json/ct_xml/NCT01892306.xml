  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The specific goal of this research study is to investigate the feasibility, acceptability,
      and preliminary efficacy of a transdiagnostic, cognitive-behavioral therapy developed
      specifically to target common core processes across mood and anxiety disorders [Unified
      Protocol for Transdiagnostic Treatment of Emotional Disorders (UP)], for the treatment of
      patients with bipolar I disorder (BD-I) and comorbid anxiety. The study will compare
      treatment-as-usual with pharmacotherapy (TAU) plus 18 one-hour sessions of treatment with
      the UP to TAU alone. Patients in both treatment conditions will be followed over a 12-month
      period and will be assessed monthly to track changes in mood, anxiety and emotion-related
      symptoms; functional impairment; and relapse rates. Data on the acceptability of the
      treatment will be gathered concurrently through monthly patient self-reported ratings of
      treatment satisfaction, and by tracking rates of acceptance for randomization into the
      study, number of completed sessions, and dropout rates. The study will examine: 1) whether
      combined cognitive behavioral treatment (UP) for BD-I and comorbid anxiety disorders is an
      acceptable and feasible approach to treatment; 2) whether treatment with the UP for BD-I and
      comorbid anxiety disorders as an adjunct to pharmacotherapy treatment-as-usual (TAU) leads
      to greater symptom reduction and reduced functional impairment than pharmacotherapy alone,
      3) whether treatment for BD-I and comorbid anxiety disorders with the UP improves relapse
      rates over a 6-month follow-up relative to TAU; and 4) whether reduction in symptoms,
      relapse rates, and functional impairment are mediated by changes in emotion regulation
      skills.  The broader aim of this study is to address the need for improved treatments for
      bipolar disorder.

             disorders:

        generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, or social phobia.

          -  HAM-D-17 score &lt;16 (i.e. depressive symptoms)

          -  Current, stabilized (&gt; 3 months) pharmacotherapy treatment under the care of a
