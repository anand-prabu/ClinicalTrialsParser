      Innerview can support the integration of mental health and primary care by accurately and
      reliably collecting, organizing and automating mental health evidence and activities.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To deliver integrated quality care, innovative strategies are needed to efficiently collect,
      understand, monitor and manage mental health evidence and its contribution to the primary
      care office visit.  Computer applications can provide solutions to providers by helping
      their processes to be feasible, manageable, and sustainable.  We hypothesize that by both
      providing patients the opportunity to reflect on their physical, emotional and behavioral
      symptoms and functioning, and giving providers accurate, reliable, current, symptom-based
      mental health evidence in an accessible organized format prior to the face-to-face visit,
      Innerview will enhance diagnostic and treatment processes from both a patient- and
      population-based perspective, as well as enhance communication between patient and provider.
