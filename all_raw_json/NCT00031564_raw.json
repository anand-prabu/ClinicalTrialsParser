Interleukin-2 may stimulate\n      a person's white blood cells to kill cancer cells. Combining vaccine therapy with\n      interleukin-2 may kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining vaccine therapy with\n      interleukin-2 in treating patients who have stage IV kidney cancer."

Patients with stable or responding disease after day 106 may receive\n      additional vaccinations in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed at 3 weeks after the last dose of IL-2.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 30 patients will be accrued for this study."
