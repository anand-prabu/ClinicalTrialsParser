      This study is composed of a main study and an ancillary one. The objective of the main study
      is to define, on the psychopathological, neurological and pharmacokinetic plan, the
      predictive factors for developing a behavioural addiction (BA) secondarily to the
      dopaminergic treatment, associated or not to a dopamine dysregulation syndrome (DDS), in
      patients with Parkinson's disease.

      3 particular profiles of patients will be established:

        -  BA- : no secondary behavioural addiction

        -  BA+/DDS-: secondary behavioural addiction, without dopamine dysregulation syndrome

        -  BA+/DDS+: secondary behavioural addiction, with dopamine dysregulation syndrome

      We wish in particular:

        -  To differentiate, among the BA+ subjects, those for who is a DDS from those for who we
           can evoke a side effect of the dopaminergic treatment

        -  To demonstrate that the BA+/DDS- subjects present pharmacokinetic particularities
           causing the occurrence of the BA.

        -  To clarify the possible relationship between the dosage and the pharmacodynamics of the
           treatment (especially that of pramipexole) in one hand, and the developing of BA in the
           other hand.

      This study has several levels of evaluation, we chose describe the methodology of the study
      in 3 axis : Psychopathology axis, Neurological axis and pharmacokinetic axis.

      The pharmacokinetic aspects will be studied only on a part of the sample, in an ancillary
      study centered on the pharmacokinetic of the pramipexole (in its immediate release form).

    <textblock>
      This is a monocentric study with a recruitment period comprised between October 2012 and
      October 2015. The recruitment occurs during the consultations in the service of neurology.
      If the subjects are eligible, the study is proposed to them, and an evaluation is fixed in
      the next days. This evaluation consists in an individual face-to-face interview based on
      standardized and semi-structured questionnaires, during approximately one and a half hour.
      It's focused on the different characteristics of Parkinson's disease, and on psychiatric and
      addictive co morbidities. The evaluation is completed by a set of self-administered
      questionnaires focused on impulsivity and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).

      For the 80 patients participated to the ancillary study only, a blood sample will be
      realized when the patient will arrived, just before the intake of his treatment (to obtain
      the residual plasmatic concentration). A second sample will be realized at a different time
      for each patient, to cover the entirety of the kinetic between 2 intakes of pramipexole
      (immediate release form) via the entire sample. The second blood sample will be realized
      four hours after the first one at the most. After this second sample, the patient will have
      completed his participation to the study.

      An extraction of DNA and a conservation of the sample during ten years are planned, for the
      possible realisation of a pharmacogenetic analysis, if the results of the pharmacokinetic
      analysis imply an interest of such a study.
