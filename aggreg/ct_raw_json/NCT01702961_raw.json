For patients who did not have a complete response after traditional\n      chemotherapy, the chance is high that the tumor will return even after high-dose\n      chemotherapy. To improve the response and decrease the chance of relapse, doctors have used\n      rituximab, an antibody that kills lymphoma cells, both before and after transplantation.\n      These doctors have reported that more patients had control of the tumor for an extended\n      period of time using rituximab with high dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell\n      transplantation. How widely this is applicable is not known.\n\n      The purpose of this clinical research trial is to confirm that there is a good control of\n      tumor in patients with lymphoma or Hodgkin's disease treated with rituximab and conventional\n      stem cell transplantation."

            "textblock": "Subjects will receive the chemotherapy through a plastic tube (catheter) placed into a vein\n      under the collarbone. The antibody rituximab is given on the day of admission. The subject\n      will also start a six-day course of chemotherapy at that time. The chemotherapy will consist\n      of the following drugs: BCNU, etoposide also called VP-16, Ara-C also called cytosine\n      arabinoside, and melphalan. BCNU is given on the first day, Ara-C and VP-16 on the second,\n      third, fourth and fifth days, and melphalan on the sixth day. The infusion of blood stem\n      cells is given through the catheter the day after the last dose of chemotherapy. This is\n      called Day 0. A week later the subject will receive shots under the skin of Neupogen to help\n      the stem cells grow quickly. Three additional doses of rituximab are given weekly starting 2\n      weeks later. If the subject recovers and is discharged from the hospital before getting all\n      the doses of rituximab, they can receive the remainder in clinic.\n\n      Patient's will remain in the hospital for approximately 3-4 weeks and in the Houston area\n      for about 30 days from the infusion of the donor cells. The patient will have blood, urine,\n      bone marrow, and X-ray examinations performed as necessary to monitor the results of\n      treatment. They will have blood tests daily while hospitalized.\n\n      As an outpatient the patient will be monitored to make sure their immune system (system in\n      the body that helps protect the body and fights bacterial, viral and fungal infections) is\n      recovering, and the patient may require additional infusions of immunoglobulins\n      (infection-fighting blood proteins) until the blood protein levels are safe. The patient\n      will also be taking antibiotic pills for about 6 months to prevent infections. They will\n      have X-rays and other diagnostic tests (PET scans) every 6-12 months during the next 5 years\n      to make sure the tumor stays under control."
