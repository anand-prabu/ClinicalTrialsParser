  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain control after knee replacement requires analgesia to both the top (anterior) and botton
      (posterior) portion of the the knee.  Presently we use a nerve block for the anterior
      portion.  The investigators want to to examine if giving exparel into the posterior portion
      will give better pain relief.

      Hypothesis: There is no difference in, the use of analgesics or the length and quality of
      analgesia and no decrease in the time to be able to accomplish simple to complex knee
      movements using Exparel infiltration when compared to controls.

      Objectives:

        1. Is to assess the efficacy of pain control of Exparel vs. controls when injected into
           the posterior capsular space after total knee arthroplasty

        2. Asses the opioid use after Exparel vs. controls

        3. Asses the time to simple and complex knee movement and ambulation.

        4. The safety of Exparel will be assessed by the occurrence of all postsurgical adverse
           events and serious adverse events through Day 30.

      Methods:

      After IRB approval, 20 subjects will be consented to participate in the study. The study
      includes subjects undergoing total knee arthroplasty either under general or spinal
      anesthesia. This study will include men and women (18 - 75 years) who have American Society
      of Anesthesiologist physical classification status 1 - 3 and underwent total knee
      arthroplasty.

      Subjects will be divided into two groups, Group A (control) to receive 20ml of saline while
      Group B (study) to receive 20ml of liposome bupivacaine into the posterior capsular space
      during total knee arthroplasty. Patients from both groups will receive a femoral nerve block
      with catheter placement for continuous infusion of local anesthetic. All subjects will have
      access to rescue analgesics after surgery. Multimodal analgesia will supplement pain as per
      standard care by the anesthesia team. Tylenol Orally 1g TID (not to exceed 4g in 24hrs),
      oxycontin 10mg orally, twice/day, Celebrex 200 mg orally once a day and Percocet 5/325 prn
      will serve as this multimodal approach. The time, day and number of requests for break
      through (additional) analgesia will be noted by both anesthesia team and primary care team.
      Pain scores will be assessed using a 0 - 10 numeric scale. Pain will be assessed for the
      following intervals: hospital arrival, PACU arrival, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48, 72, hours later
      and after hospital discharge 10 +/- 5 days after the block. Pain inquiries will assess both
      posterior and anterior aspects of the knee. Pain at rest and for simple leg movements (knee
      extension, straight leg raise) to fully ambulatory will be noted. These assessments will be
      made in conjunction with rehab and physical therapy specialists.
