Determine the feasibility, safety, and tolerability of 12-week moderate intensity\n           exercise\n\n        2. Explore potential therapeutic benefits of 12-week moderate intensity exercise. Outcome\n           data will include posttraumatic and depressive symptoms.\n\n        3. Explore potential therapeutic effects of a 12-week moderate intensity exercise on\n           comorbid pain syndrome and quality of life."
