The pressure pain\n      threshold, evaluated through algometry, and the electrical activity of the masticatory\n      muscles were evaluated, by means of surface electromyography, before and immediately after\n      the therapeutic procedures. The volunteers underwent three different interventions:\n      ultrasound, ultrasound associated with stretching and ultrasound placebo, with a 1-week of\n      minimum interval between them."
