Validate the selection of MRI technique factors by comparing visibility of soft\n      tissue structures in MRIs, cone beam (CB)CTs and fan beam (FB)CTs of the same patient.\n      (Group II) IV. Assess the feasibility of using deformable image registration to map contours\n      from FBCT to MRI, CBCT to MRI, MRI to MRI and vice versa. (Group II) V. Compare morphologic\n      and functional changes in target and normal structures, visualized on MRI, CBCT and FBCT\n      images, in response to radiation therapy and identify opportunities for treatment\n      adaptation.
