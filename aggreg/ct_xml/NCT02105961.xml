  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-centered, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel group,
      trial evaluating 2 doses of mepolizumab against placebo given every 4 weeks through
      subcutaneous (SC) injection. In severe COPD subjects, sputum eosinophils levels are elevated
      to similar levels as those seen in severe asthmatics. It is hypothesized that the reduction
      of eosinophils with mepolizumab in COPD subjects would translate into a reduction of COPD
      exacerbations. The study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of mepolizumab, in subjects
      who are at or above the baseline blood eosinophil count of at least 150 cells/microliters
      who exacerbate despite regular use of maximal tolerated therapy, appropriate for severe COPD
      subjects, in the 12 months prior to study start. In total, 660 subjects will be randomized
      in 1:1:1 ratio to receive mepolizumab 300 mg, mepolizumab 100mg, or placebo administered SC.
      The total duration of subject participation will be approximately 62 weeks, consisting of a
      1 to 2 week screening period, 52-week treatment period and 8-week follow-up period.

             Society/European Respiratory Society

          -  Severity of COPD: Subjects must present with the following: a measured pre and
             post-salbutamol Forced expiratory volume in one second/ Forced vital capacity
             (FEV1/FVC) ratio of &lt;0.70 at Visit 1 to confirm the diagnosis of COPD; a measured
             post-salbutamol FEV1&gt; 20 percent and &lt;=80 percent of predicted normal values
             calculated using National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) III
             reference equations at Visit 1

          -  History of exacerbations: A well documented history (e.g., medical record
             verification) in the 12 months prior to Visit 1 of ; at least two moderate COPD
             exacerbations. Moderate is defined as the use of systemic corticosteroids
             (intramuscular (IM), intravenous, or oral) and/or treatment with antibiotics or; at
             least one severe COPD exacerbation. Severe is defined as having required
             hospitalization. Note: At least one exacerbation must have occurred while the subject
             was taking Inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) plus long acting beta2-agonist (LABA) plus
             long acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA). Prior use of antibiotics alone does not
             qualify as a moderate exacerbation unless the use was specifically for the treatment
             of worsening symptoms of COPD.

          -  Concomitant COPD therapy: A well documented requirement for optimized standard of
             care background therapy that includes Inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) plus 2 additional
             COPD medications (i.e., triple therapy) for the 12 months prior to Visit 1 and meets
             the following criteria: Immediately prior to Visit 1, minimum of 3 months of use of
             an; Inhaled corticosteroid at a dose &gt;= 500 micrograms (mcg)/day fluticasone
             propionate dose equivalent plus; LABA and LAMA.

        For subjects who are not continually maintained on ICS plus LABA plus LAMA for the entire
        12 months prior to Visit 1 use of following is allowed (but not in the 3 months
        immediately prior to Visit 1); inhaled corticosteroid at a dose &gt;=500 mcg/day fluticasone
        propionate dose equivalent plus; a LABA or a LAMA and; use of at least one other class of
        COPD medication (i.e., phosphodiesterase-4-inhibitors, methylxanthines, or a combination
        of short acting beta2-agonist and short acting muscarinic antagonist).

          -  Informed Consent: Able to give written informed consent prior to participation in the
             study, which will include the ability to comply with the requirements and
             restrictions listed in the consent form. Subjects must be able to read, comprehend,
             and write at a level sufficient to complete study related materials.

          -  Gender: Male or Eligible Female; To be eligible for entry into the study females of
             child bearing potential must commit to consistent and correct use of an acceptable

             of their smoking status and smoking history, i.e. current smokers, never smokers or
             ex-smokers can be enrolled into the study. Current smokers are defined as those with
             a history of cigarette smoking of &gt;=10 pack-years [number of pack years = (number of
             cigarettes per day / 20) x number of years smoked (e.g., 20 cigarettes per day for 10
             years, or 10 cigarettes per day for 20 years)]. Former smokers are defined as those
             who meet the definition of a current smoker but have stopped smoking for at least 6
             months prior to Visit 1. Never smokers are those that do not meet the definition of a
             current or former smoker.

             Also, excluded are subjects with active tuberculosis, lung cancer, bronchiectasis,

             by the Investigator. 12-lead ECGs will be over-read by a centralized independent
             cardiologist to assist in consistent evaluation of subject eligibility. Results from
             the 12-lead ECG over-read must be received prior to assessing eligibility at Visit 2.

          -  Unstable or life threatening cardiac disease: Subjects with any of the following
             would be excluded: Myocardial infarction or unstable angina in the last 6 months ;

             abnormalities that are uncontrolled. Significant is defined as any disease that, in
             the opinion of the investigator, would put the safety of the subject at risk through
             participation, or which would affect the efficacy or safety analysis if the
             disease/condition exacerbated during the study.

          -  Eosinophilic disease: Subjects with other conditions that could lead to elevated

        Randomization Criteria

        In order to be randomized to study drug the subject must meet the following randomization
        criteria at Visit 2:

          -  Blood eosinophils: Documented elevated peripheral blood eosinophil count of &gt;=300
             cells/microliter within the past 12 months prior to Visit 1; OR A peripheral baseline
             blood eosinophil count of &gt;=150 cells/microliter from haematology conducted at Visit
             1

          -  Electronic Diary Compliance: Compliance with completion of the eDiary defined as
             completion of all questions on 5 or more days out of the 7 days immediately preceding
             Visit 2.

          -  12-lead ECG: No evidence of an abnormal and significant ECG finding from the 12-lead
             ECG conducted at Visit 1 as indicated on the over-read provided by the centralized
             independent cardiologist. Subjects with a QT interval corrected with Fridericia's
             formulas (QTcF)&gt;=450 msec are not eligible. For subjects with a QRS interval
             &gt;=120msec, those with QTcF&gt;=480 msec are not eligible. Specific ECG findings that
             preclude subject eligibility are listed in the protocol.

          -  Abnormal chest X-ray (or Computerized Tomography [CT] scan): No chest X-ray (or CT
             scan) that reveals evidence of clinically significant abnormalities not believed to
             be due to the presence of COPD. If a chest X-ray or CT scan is not available within 6
             months prior to Visit 1, then a chest X-ray must be taken at Visit 1 and the results
             reviewed prior to randomization. For sites in Germany: If a chest X-ray (or CT scan)
             within 6 months prior to Screening (Visit 1) is not available, the subject will not
             be eligible for the study.

          -  Laboratory abnormality: No evidence of clinically significant abnormality in the
             haematological, biochemical, or urinalysis screen at Visit 1, as judged by the
             investigator.

             Alkaline Phosphatase (Alk Phos) &lt;=2x ULN; Bilirubin &lt;=1.5x ULN (isolated
             bilirubin&gt;1.5x ULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin
             &lt;35 percent)

          -  Pregnancy: No subjects who are pregnant or breastfeeding. Subjects should not be
             enrolled if they plan to become pregnant during the time of study participation.
