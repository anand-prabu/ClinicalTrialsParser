      Subjects who completed the Double-blind Randomized Maintenance Phase (DBRMP) Study Day 29
      visit in ZS-004 and have an i-STAT potassium value that is 3.5 to 6.2 mmol/l inclusive or
      who discontinued during ZS-004 due to hypo- or hyperkalemia in the DBRMP and have a mean
      i-STAT potassium value from two consecutive measurements at 0 and 60 minutes on Acute Phase
      Day 1/Maintenance Phase Day 1 that is 3.5 to 6.2 mmol/l inclusive may have the option to
      participate in ZS-004E. Subjects who discontinued from study ZS-004 due to any other reasons
      (e.g. adverse events, poor compliance, investigator decision) will not be entered into study
      ZS-004E. All subjects who continue into the extension study must begin dosing within two (2)
      days after the last dose of investigational product in ZS-004.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All subjects with i-STAT potassium values between 3.5-5.5 mmol/l, inclusive at the ZS-004
      DBRMP Study Day 29 visit, who continue directly into the open-label extension study ZS-004E,
      will enter the Maintenance Phase (MP) and start on open-label ZS at a dose of 10g qd. All
      subjects with i-STAT potassium values &gt; 5.5 mmol/l at the ZS-004 DBRMP Study Day 29 visit
      will undergo an acute treatment phase (AP) where they will receive ZS 10g three times a day
      (tid) for 24 (3 doses) or 48 hours (6 doses). If the subject's i-STAT potassium is between
      3.5-5.0 mmol/l, inclusive after 24 (AP Study Day 2) or 48 hours (AP Study Day 3), the
      subject will enter the MP at a starting dose of 10g qd.

      For subjects who discontinued during ZS-004 DBRMP due to hypo- or hyperkalemia baseline
      potassium values will be determined within 1 day of administration of the first dose in the
      ZS-004E extension study by taking two (2) consecutive i-STAT potassium measurements at 0 and
      60 minutes (Â± 10 minutes). If the mean i-STAT value is between 3.5 - 5.5 mmol/l, inclusive,
      the subject will enter directly into the MP and receive 10g ZS qd; if the mean i-STAT
      potassium value is &gt; 5.5 mmol/l, the subject will enter the AP. If i-STAT potassium values
      are still &gt;5.0 mmol/l on the morning of AP Study Day 3, subjects will not enter the MP but
      will be referred to their normal health care provider for standard of care.

      If the i-STAT potassium value increases above 5.5 mmol/l during the MP with treatment at 10g
      qd, the dose can be increased to15g qd. Conversely, if S-K decreases to between 3.0-3.4
      mmol/l, inclusive, the dose of ZS can be decreased in 5g qd, decrements. If a subject is on
      a 5g qd dose and still develops blood potassium i-STAT values between 3.0 - 3.4mmol,
      inclusive the dose can be reduced to 5g every other day.

      Subjects will receive up to 2 months of treatment with open-label ZS.
