            "textblock": "Several studies show an association between chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and\n      coronary artery disease (CAD). Besides risk factors such as smoking, both are associated\n      with physical inactivity, advanced age and systemic inflammation The use of coronary\n      computed tomography (CCT) with multiple detectors is a diagnostic method for coronary\n      disease, describing the anatomy and severity of arterial obstruction. One way of estimating\n      the cardiovascular risk is coronary calcium score (CCS). Due to the association between COPD\n      and CAD, it is likely that many patients with IHD diagnosed by CT have reduced lung\n      function.\n\n      The aim of this observational study is to establish the correlation between the CCS and lung\n      function. It will also correlate the presence of irreversible airway obstruction with\n      significant coronary lesions.\n\n      Patients over 40 years referred to CCT who agree to participate in the study will perform a\n      spirometry with bronchodilator and collect a blood sample to measure serum markers of\n      inflammation and cardiovascular risk (glycemia, lipid profile, C reactive protein (CRP),\n      tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-Alpha) and fibrinogen).  The data will be compared in the\n      general population and in subgroups: smokers, former smokers and nonsmokers.\n\n      One year after the CCT patients will be contacted by the investigators and accessed for\n      emergency room visits, hospital admissions and fatal or nonfatal coronary or respiratory\n      events.\n\n      The investigators hypothesis is that reduced lung function is independently associated with\n      elevated CCS and is, also a risk factor for increased hospital admission and coronary\n      events.\n\n      The concomitant assessment of lung function and CCS can contribute knowledge about the\n      epidemiological association between pulmonary disease and CAD. This can also add to evidence\n      for the use of spirometry as a marker of cardiovascular risk."
