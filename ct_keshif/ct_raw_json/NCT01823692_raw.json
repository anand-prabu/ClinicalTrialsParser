Nowadays, simple radiography is used as a control standard for evaluating\n      reduction of distal radius fractures. The disadvantages include time wasting, frequent x-ray\n      exposures and use of more sedation in determining adequate reduction, made scientists to\n      evaluate alternative method such as  ultrasonography  which fast, easy and less dangerous\n      were considered as advantages. The investigators goal was to identify whether\n      ultrasonography guidance compare with the simple radiography aids in determining the\n      adequacy of distal radius fracture reduction."
