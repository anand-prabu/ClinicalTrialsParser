  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to characterize structural abnormalities in the brain and the
      integrity  of the blood brain barrier in patients with mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIB (MPS
      IIIB).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      MPS IIIB is caused by a genetic defect resulting in a lack of the enzyme called NAGLU (or
      N-acetylglucosaminidase).  Synageva BioPharma Corp is developing SBC-103, a recombinant form
      of the human NAGLU enzyme, as an enzyme replacement approach for MPS IIIB.  Recent
      scientific studies have indicated a  possible defect in the barrier between the blood and
      the brain (the so called 'blood-brain barrier') in mice with MPS IIIB and in patients with
      MPS IIIA and IIIC.  In order to understand the effects of SBC-103 in patients, using new
      imaging methods, it will be important to understand if the blood brain barrier is abnormal
      in MPS IIIB patients. In addition to supporting the development of new therapies, this
      information may provide new insights that could impact how MPSIIIB patients are treated.

      The results of this study will help Synageva BioPharma Corp design and start further studies
      with the purpose of developing an effective enzyme therapy to treat MPS IIIB.

        Up to six subjects with MPS IIIB.  An attempt will be made to enroll equal numbers (three)
        of MPS IIIB subjects with a classic (severe) disease presentation, and MPS IIIB subjects
        with an attenuated phenotype.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject and/or subject's parent or legal guardian provides informed consent

          -  Subject is â‰¥5 years of age.

          -  Subject has a definitive diagnosis of MPS IIIB, as determined by either a documented
             deficiency in alpha-N-acetylglucosaminidase (NAGLU) enzyme activity or documented
             functionally-relevant mutations in both alleles of the NAGLU gene.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject has any internal or non-removable external metal items that may present a
             safety risk (for MRI), or any other medical condition or circumstance in which an MRI
             is contraindicated.

          -  The subject has a known or suspected hypersensitivity to anaesthesia, a bleeding
             disorder, or any other medical condition or circumstance in which a lumbar puncture
             (for collection of CSF) is contraindicated.

          -  Previous allergic reaction to gadolinium-based MRI contrast media.
