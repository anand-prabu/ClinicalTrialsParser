      The purpose of this study is to collect and assess long-term safety of everolimus in
      patients who are currently receiving everolimus treatment in a Novartis-sponsored, Oncology
      CD&amp;MA study that has reached its study objectives, are not progressing on the current study
      treatment as defined by the parent protocol and are unable to access everolimus treatment
      outside of a clinical study. Parent studies eligible to participate in the roll-over study
      will be decided by Novartis. Investigator initiated trials (IITs) will not be included. The
      primary objective of the parent study must have been reached and the parent study must be in
      the process of being completed and reported.
