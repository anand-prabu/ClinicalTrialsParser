Sorafenib tosylate and everolimus may stop the\n      growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. The addition\n      of everolimus to sorafenib tosylate may cause more shrinkage of thyroid cancer and may\n      prevent it from growing but it could also cause more side effects than sorafenib tosylate\n      alone.
