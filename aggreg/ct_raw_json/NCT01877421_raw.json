Changes from\n      baseline, such as soft tissue erythema, ulceration and sloughing, will be noted and\n      assessments will be made by the principal investigator as to whether they might be\n      attributable to the antiplaque chewing gum.\n\n      In the Phase 2a portion of the study, the efficacy of the antiplaque chewing gum in reducing\n      existing supragingival plaque and gingivitis will also be assessed. Plaque will be assessed\n      using the Turesky Modification of the Quigley-Hein Plaque Index (PI, Turesky et al-1970) and\n      gingivitis will be assessed using both the Modified Gingival Index (MGI, Lobene et al-1986)\n      and the percent of bleeding sites on gentle probing (BOP) using the methods described in\n      Ainamo and Bay-1975."
