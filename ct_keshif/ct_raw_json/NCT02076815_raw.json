The rationale for developing this new\n      formulation is based on the assumption of having a better tolerability while maintaining an\n      efficacy comparable to that of the immediate release formulation.\n\n      The effects of Anagrelide Retard and Thromboreductin\u00ae will be compared in terms of mean\n      platelet count measured by a central laboratory/centralized method at 3 time points during\n      the maintenance phase."

Treatment allocation will be\n      balanced within stratum (treated/naive) and age classes by central randomization. Naive\n      patients will start with dose level 2 of the IMPs (i.e., 1 mg Thromboreductin\u00ae or 2 mg\n      Anagrelide Retard). Anagrelide-treated patients will be switched to the dose level which is\n      closest to the pre-study anagrelide dose at study start. Dose modifications in the titration\n      phase will be done on a weekly basis (up to a maximum of 12 weeks) until \"stable platelet\n      counts\" on two consecutive visits is achieved.\n\n      The periods of the study participation per patient are as follows:\n\n        -  Screening (up to 7 days prior to randomization), ending with randomization/first IMP\n           dose (Baseline Visit)\n\n        -  Titration period (weekly visits for up to 12 weeks): to achieve \"stable platelet\n           counts\" on two consecutive measurements (i.e. weekly visits)\n\n        -  Maintenance period (weekly visits for 4 weeks): primary endpoint relevant period. The\n           maintenance period for a patient starts at the visit with the second successive\n           platelet count \u2264400 G/L (or <600 G/L, if the dose cannot be increased any more due to\n           intolerance or because the maximal dose allowed has already been reached) if the second\n           platelet value measured lies in the range within \u00b1 30% of the value measured at the\n           previous visit.\n\n        -  End of study (EoS) safety follow-up visit (28 days after the last maintenance visit/EoT\n           for early termination)."
