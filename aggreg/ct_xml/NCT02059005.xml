      This study will assess Specialized Community Disease Management (SCDM), an intervention
      which employs various evidence-based strategies to engage substance using co-morbid patients
      while in the hospital and follow them into the community via an empirically validated
      telephone approach as well as contact with a trained community health worker peer
      specialist.  The investigators will first adapt and refine the core SCDM intervention with
      patient, provider, and stakeholder input through an active community advisory board.  The
      investigators will then conduct a three-year, randomized controlled trial of 222 patients
      enrolled prior to hospital discharge who are diagnosed with congestive heart failure,
      pneumonia, or acute myocardial infarction, and a substance use disorder (SUD).  Patients
      will be randomized to either the SCDM intervention or Treatment as Usual (TAU), in which a
      team of nurse navigators and community health workers follow patients (primarily by
      telephone) for 30 days post-discharge, but do not address the specific needs of SUDs.  The
      investigators will test the following four hypotheses: (1) patients randomized to SCDM will
      demonstrate larger reductions in substance use measured by urine-confirmed self-reported
      days using over the 6-month follow-up compared to patients randomized to TAU, (2) patients
      randomized to SCDM will attend more specialty substance abuse intervention and treatment
      sessions over the 6 month follow-up than patients randomized to TAU, (3) patients randomized
      to SCDM will demonstrate reduced HIV transmission risk behaviors and greater rates of HIV
      testing over the 6 month follow-up than patients randomized to TAU, and (4) patients
      randomized to SCDM will experience fewer days of rehospitalization and use of acute
      emergency services than patients randomized to TAU.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hospitalized patients with substance use disorders (SUDs) face significant complications in
      their medical care. They are more likely to be discharged against medical advice,
      rehospitalized after discharge, and experience personal chaos and reduced family support.
      Hospital systems are moving to implement hospital-based and community disease management
      strategies to help patients transition post-discharge, however, few provide specialized
      follow-up for patients with SUDs. This proposal will test whether an extended, specialized
      community disease management program can improve outcomes over an existing nurse navigator
      disease management strategy for patients with co-morbid medical conditions and SUDs.  The
      investigators will enroll 222 inpatients with co-occurring medical conditions and SUDs and
      will randomly assign them to either 1) Treatment as Usual - a 30-day, post-discharge program
      that consists of medical monitoring by workers who have no special training in working with
      SUD patients, or 2) the Specialized Community Disease Management program - a 90-day program
      that will employ specialized teams including a trained clinical social worker and a
      peer-specialist community health worker who will provide evidence-based telephone continuing
      care, home visits, and increased focus on patients' substance use.  All participants will be
      followed at 3- and 6-months post-discharge.  The investigators hypothesize that (1) patients
      randomized to SCDM will demonstrate larger reductions in substance use measured by
      urine-confirmed self-reported days using over the 6-month follow-up compared to patients
      randomized to TAU, (2) patients randomized to SCDM will attend more specialty substance
      abuse intervention and treatment sessions over the 6 month follow-up than patients
      randomized to TAU, (3) patients randomized to SCDM will demonstrate reduced HIV transmission
      risk behaviors and greater rates of HIV testing over the 6 month follow-up than patients
      randomized to TAU, and (4) patients randomized to SCDM will experience fewer days of
      rehospitalization and use of acute emergency services than patients randomized to TAU.
