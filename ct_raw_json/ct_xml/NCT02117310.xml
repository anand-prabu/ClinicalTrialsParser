  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a feasibility study in which indocyanine green (ICG) will be administered during
      routine expanded endonasal approach (EEA) for cranial base pathologies in which a nasoseptal
      flap harvest will be necessary. The research entails administering ICG, which is already
      widely used during open neurosurgical procedures, to identify the blood supply at two
      distinct stages of endonasal cranial base surgery: during nasoseptal flap harvest and after
      final positioning of the nasoseptal flap to ensure its viability before ending the case.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to determine if it is feasible to use angiography during endo-nasal
      surgery. During the angiography indocyanine green (ICG) will be injected into the patients
      IV tubing to help see the arteries. ICG is routinely used in vascular surgeries on the brain
      but not for endo-nasal surgery.  The purpose of this study is to see how well intraoperative
      angiography using ICG can be done during endonasal surgery.

This study will determine feasibility of other larger clinical trials using this method.</description>
