The treatments to\n      be conducted in this study are non-invasive, i.e. without opening the skull, and will create\n      microthalamotomies in specific target areas such as thalamus, subthalamus and pallidum. The\n      data obtained in this study will be used to evaluate the basic safety aspects of this new\n      treatment technology and will serve as a basis for the clinical introduction of MR-guided\n      ultrasoundneurosurgery."
