In patients with end stage renal disease, this complex\n      remains in the circulation for days. Previous studies have shown that sugammadex adequately\n      reverses the blockade induced by rocuronium in such patients, and no evidence of recurrence\n      was observed after a dosis of 2 mg/Kg administered to reverse a moderate level of blockade.\n      To our knowledge, nothing has been published so far on the reversal of profound blockade by\n      sugammadex in patients with renal failure.\n\n      The aim of our study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sugammadex in the reversal\n      of profound neuromuscular block (NMB) induced by rocuronium in patients with end-stage renal\n      failure and compare it to patients with normal renal function."
