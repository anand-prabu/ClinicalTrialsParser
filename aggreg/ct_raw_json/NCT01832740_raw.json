Especially, periods rich in slow-wave sleep (SWS) have shown a\n      memory enhancing effect on hippocampus-dependent declarative memory. Slow oscillatory\n      activity typically occuring during SWS has been implicated in the consolidation effect. In\n      this study we investigate if the consolidation effect can be amplified by the application of\n      a weak transcranial oscillatory electric current within the frequency range of SWS in humans\n      (0,7-0,8 Hz) during nocturnal SWS."
