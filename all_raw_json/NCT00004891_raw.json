A CT scan of the chest\n      is obtained if the prestudy chest x-ray is abnormal.\n\n      Patients receive preoperative radiotherapy/chemotherapy. Within 4-6 weeks of completion of\n      radiotherapy/chemotherapy, patients undergo repeat FDG-PET imaging and CT scan. Patients\n      undergo surgical resection 1-2 weeks later.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 125 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years."
