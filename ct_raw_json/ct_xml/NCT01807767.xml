  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to determine the efficacy and safety of Everolimus conversion
      in liver transplantation. Most large US liver centers transplant patients with high Model
      for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) scores. However, many of the sponsored liver transplant
      trials in the US do not include patients with high MELD scores making it difficult to
      extrapolate these trial data to the patients cared for at larger liver transplant centers.
      The greatest potential benefit of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors is the
      avoidance of the side-effects of calcineurin-inhibitors, namely, renal insufficiency,
      diabetes and hypertension. Therefore, this protocol is designed to study the efficacy and
      safety of everolimus and Myfortic in liver transplant patients with high MELD scores at two
      large centers with a vast experience in the administration of mTOR inhibitors.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients must give written informed consent before any assessment is performed. MELD ≥ 25.
        Recipients who are 18-70 years of age of a primary or secondary liver transplant from a
        deceased donor.

        Allograft is functioning at an acceptable level by the time of randomization as defined by
        the Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST), Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT), Total Bilirubin
        levels ≤3 times Upper Limit of Normal (ULN), and Alkaline Phosphatase (AlkP) levels ≤ 5
        times ULN. Ability and willingness to provide written informed consent and adhere to study
        regimen.

        Patients who are able to take oral medication at time of randomization. Glomerular
