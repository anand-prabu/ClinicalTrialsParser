For this, the investigators relied on observational components: FSHD2 patients\n      appear more often present with psychiatric comorbidities and seem to have lower cognitive\n      performance compared to FSHD1 patients. This was confirmed by a preliminary study on a small\n      sample population of patients. It seems to exist mainly executive dysfunction associated\n      with attention disorders in patients FSHD2. Moreover, their performance in IQ tests would be\n      low in relation to their socio-educational and compared with patients FSHD1 level."
