However, how exactly this drug\n      works to relieve abdominal pain and discomfort in humans is not clearly known. Studies in\n      animal models suggest that patients with IBS-C have hypersensitivity in the gut.\n\n      Consequently, in IBS-C patients, there is rapid and excessive conduction of signals both\n      from the brain and central nervous system region towards the pelvic-floor (anorectal axis)\n      and the reverse direction. The investigators hypothesize that treatment with Linaclotide may\n      improve/normalize these signals and thereby improve bowel symptoms.\n\n      Investigators will test this theory using a new, noninvasive (and established) method of\n      studying this communication pathway between the brain and gut."

Patients over 50 will not be eligible to enroll unless they have had a\n             colonoscopy, sigmoidoscopy or barium enema within ten years prior to screening.\n             Individuals under the age of 50 would only be required to undergo one of such\n             diagnostic procedures if they present with alarm symptoms such as rectal bleeding,\n             unexplained weight loss or anemia). There is no plan undergo such procedures as part\n             of this research protocol. Therefore, individuals requiring such a procedure will be\n             referred back to their treating physician (due to reaching age 50 and requiring a\n             general screening of colon check or any age, due to alarm symptoms) and will not be\n             enrolled in the study.\n\n          -  No evidence of metabolic problems (to be excluded by laboratory testing; a\n             comprehensive blood count and metabolic panel are required to be within six months of\n             screening visit. If none are available on the patient's electronic records or records\n             provided by an external provider, we will have them complete blood testing to exclude\n             clinically significant metabolic abnormalities).
