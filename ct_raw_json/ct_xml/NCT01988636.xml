      Background:

      - Malaria is caused by small germs carried by mosquitoes. People can get malaria if an
      infected mosquito bites them. Malaria destroys red blood cells and reduces oxygen in the
      blood. Most malaria is mild, but severe malaria kills at least 660,000 people each year.
      About 75% of these are children in Sub-Saharan Africa, most under age 5. Researchers want to
      find a safe vaccine that helps prevent malaria.

      Objectives:

      - To see if a new malaria vaccine is well tolerated and effective.

      Eligibility:

      - Healthy adults 18   35 years old who are not pregnant and live in Mali.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with medical history, physical exam, and blood test. They
           will also have an ECG. Soft electrodes will be stuck to the skin. A machine will record
           the heart   s electrical signals.

        -  Study participation will last about 1 year.

        -  Participants will be randomly placed in 5 groups. Some will get 2 doses of the PfSPZ
           vaccine weeks apart; some will get 3 or 5 doses of vaccine; some will get 3 or 5 doses
           of placebo.

        -  Doses will be given through a needle in the arm directly into the bloodstream. Then
           participants must stay at the clinic for 2 hours.

        -  After each dose, participants will return to the clinic several times for blood tests
           and physical exam.

        -  A week before the first dose and 2 weeks after the last, participants will take a full
           course of anti-malaria drugs.

        -  If a participant gets malaria during the study, they will take another course of
           anti-malaria drugs.

    <textblock>
      For decades it is known that humans can be protected against malaria by repeated
      immunization with radiation-attenuated sporozoites. Traditionally, those sporozoites are
      administered by exposing the vaccinee to at least 1000 bites of sporozoite-infected
      irradiated mosquitoes, an approach that is unsuitable for mass vaccination campaigns.
      Recently, Sanaria Inc. 1 has developed a process for manufacturing, in compliance with
      current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMPs) aseptic, purified, radiation attenuated
      cryopreserved sporozoites from a wellcharacterized isolate of P. falciparum. This product,
      which is called PfSPZ Vaccine, can be administered by needle and syringe. Previous studies
      conducted by the Vaccine Research Center, National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Navy
      have established that IV administration of PfSPZ Vaccine can induce sterile protection
      against controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) with a homologous strain of P. falciparum
      in up to 100% of malaria na(SqrRoot) ve individuals.

      The next logical step is to test the safety and immunogenicity of PfSPZ Vaccine in malaria
      experienced individuals. As an exploratory objective, this study will collect initial data
      to find out if the vaccine can protect against naturally occurring infection. Here, we
      propose a randomized double blind controlled trial to assess the safety and immunogenicity
      of IV administration of PfSPZ Vaccine in African adults.

      Subjects will be recruited from a rural village in Mali. The study will be conducted as
      collaboration among the Malaria Research and Training Center (MRTC, Mali), the Laboratory of
      Malaria Immunology and Vaccinology (LMIV) National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
      Diseases (NIAID), and Sanaria, Inc. Group 1 (n=12), will receive 135,000 PfSPZ Vaccine,
      followed by 270,000 PfSPZ Vaccine 2 weeks later for safety purposes. An independent Data
      Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will determine whether it is safe to proceed with 270,000
      PfSPZ Vaccine.

      At Study Week 4, Group 2 (n=50) will receive their first of 3 injections of 270,000 PfSPZ
      Vaccine administered at 4, 12 and 24 weeks, alongside Group 3 (n=25), receiving a similar
      volume of normal saline as placebo. Also at Study Week 4, Group 4 will receive their first
      of 5 doses of 270,000 PfSPZ Vaccine given at 4, 8, 12, 16, and 24 weeks, alongside Group 5
      (n=25) receiving a similar volume placebo. Safety data will be collected at defined time
      points after each immunization. Two weeks after the last vaccination (Week 26) all subjects
      will receive a full course of antimalarial treatment. From Week 28 until Week 48 all
      subjects will be monitored for parasitemia detected by slide microscopy in bi-weekly
      intervals, and by passive case detection.
