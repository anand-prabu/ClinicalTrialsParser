In this study, ADI will\n      be combined with the well known chemotherapy Doxorubicin and the safety and potential\n      efficacy of this combination will be explored in patients with HER2 Negative Metastatic\n      Breast Cancer."

Biopsy proven HER2 negative metastatic breast cancer (dose escalation portion and MTD\n             expansion portion) or advanced solid tumor (dose escalation portion).\n\n          2. ASS deficiency (defined as <25% ASS expression) demonstrated on tissue specimen by\n             Immunohistochemistry (IHC).  Cytology and fine need aspirate specimens are not\n             acceptable for ASS testing.\n\n          3. Unresectable disease or subject refused surgery.\n\n          4. Measurable disease as assessed by RECIST 1.1 criteria (Appendix A).\n\n          5. No more than 4 prior lines of chemotherapy for metastatic disease.\n\n          6. Time to treatment failure from doxorubicin containing regimen \u2265 12 months if\n             previously treated with doxorubicin.\n\n          7. Age \u2265 18 years.\n\n          8. ECOG performance status of 0 - 2.\n\n          9. No prior systemic therapy, immunotherapy, investigational agent, or radiation therapy\n             within the last 3 weeks.\n\n         10. Fully recovered from any prior surgery and no major surgery within 4 weeks of\n             initiating treatment. Surgery for placement of vascular access devices is acceptable.\n\n             -\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          1. Serious infection requiring treatment with systemically administered antibiotics at\n             the time of study entrance, or an infection requiring systemic antibiotic therapy\n             within 7 days prior to the first dose of study treatment.\n\n          2. Prior epirubicin exposure of \u2265 500 mg/m2.\n\n          3. Pregnancy or lactation.\n\n          4. Expected non-compliance.\n\n          5. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active\n             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association Class III\n             or IV), cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness, social situations that would\n             limit compliance with study requirements.\n\n          6. Subjects who have had any anticancer treatment prior to entering the study and have\n             not recovered to baseline (except alopecia) or \u2264 Grade 1 AEs, or deemed irreversible\n             from the effects of prior cancer therapy. AEs > Grade 1 that are not considered a\n             safety risk by the Sponsor and Investigator may be allowed upon agreement with both.\n\n          7. Subjects with history of another primary cancer, including co-existent second\n             malignancy, with the exception of: a) curatively resected non-melanoma skin cancer;\n             b) curatively treated cervical carcinoma in situ; or c) other primary solid tumor\n             with no known active disease present in the opinion of the Investigator will not\n             affect subject outcome in the setting of breast cancer diagnosis.\n\n          8. Subjects who had been treated with ADI-PEG 20 previously.\n\n          9. History of seizure disorder not related to underlying cancer.\n\n         10. ECOG performance status > 2."
