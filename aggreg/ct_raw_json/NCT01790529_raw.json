            "textblock": "Surgical site infections (SSI) are the most frequent hospital acquired infections in\n      patients who underwent surgery. With regards to the increasing financial restraint in\n      patient care, the socio-economic burden of SSI in the public health sector and its\n      prevention gains in importance.\n\n      The prophylactic application of antibiotics (surgical antimicrobial prophylaxis, SAP) prior\n      to the skin incision significantly reduces the risk of SSI, but the correct time point of\n      drug administration remains unclear. Most studies recommend application of SAP directly\n      prior to skin incision. Other studies, however, suggest that this is too late and more time\n      between administration of the SAP and skin incision is necessary for optimal SSI prevention.\n      A large cohort study in Switzerland concluded that SAP should be applied between 74 and 30\n      minutes prior to skin incision.\n\n      Due to the obvious importance of this controversy, we want to answer this question with a\n      clinical study (randomized controlled trial, RCT) at the University Hospital of Basel and\n      the Cantonal Hospital of Aarau. We plan to investigate two administration strategies\n      according to the timing of the SAP. Strategy A will consist of SAP application in the\n      anesthetic room located in front of the actual operating theatre, where the patient gets\n      anesthesia. Therefore, the application of SAP will take place early, approximately between\n      75 and 30 minutes prior to skin incision. In strategy B we will apply SAP in the operating\n      theatre, which on average occurs later (approximately within the last 30 minutes before skin\n      incision).\n\n      We test the hypothesis that strategy A is more effective in preventing SSI than strategy B.\n      We will include a total of 5000 patients in abdominal, vascular and trauma surgery (2500 at\n      each study site and 2500 per study group). All patients will be followed in the hospital for\n      SSI occurrence. Additionally, all patients will be interviewed by telephone after hospital\n      discharge at a defined follow-up period of 30 days (1 year if an implant is in place, such\n      as hip endoprosthesis or meshes). We expect this study to be completed within approximately\n      3 years."

The decision to change this important parameter was taken in order to make\n           results of this trial more comparable to those of other published studies.\n\n        -  In the original study protocol it was planned to provide each randomized patient with a\n           patient's diary to record signs of SSI. This was abandoned for limited benefit and in\n           order to minimize patients' time and effort.\n\n        -  Patients who undergo combined surgery (by one of the participating surgical specialties\n           plus by a non participating specialty) shall not be included in this trial as outcomes\n           (SSI) could be difficult to correlate to one or another part of surgery. This had not\n           been specified as an exclusion criterion in the original study protocol.\n\n        -  Patients' information sheets and informed consents in one of the languages other than\n           German were only approved by the local ethics committees by May 15th, 2013.\n\n        -  As per ethics committees regulations, patients can only be included in more than one\n           clinical trials under specific circumstances. Therefore only a limited percentage of\n           patients that are already included in other studies can still be included for this\n           trial. However, overall, this only excludes a very limited number of potentially\n           includable patients."
