In addition we will collect patient\n      reported mean total minutes per week of mild, moderate, and vigorous-intensity physical\n      exercise over the course of radiation therapy.Baseline characteristics including demographic\n      data (age, education, employment) as well as BMI, waist to hip ratio, and health\n      comorbidities (including smoking status, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes) will also be\n      collected. BMI and health comorbidities will be extracted from the chart. Patient-Reported\n      Outcomes will include QOL, fatigue, depression, pain and sleep. QOL will be assessed using\n      the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT) scale developed for the assessment of\n      patient symptoms and QOL in cancer patients. Fatigue will be assessed using the 13-item\n      FACT-fatigue scale for the assessment of fatigue in cancer patients.Skin toxicity will be\n      defined as radiation dermatitis, pruritus, and pain.\n\n      Lymphedema will be assessed by measuring limb girth. Measurements will be taken by first\n      marking both limbs while patient is lying supine, starting at the ulnar styloid at 5cm\n      intervals on the length of the arms. The diameter of the limb will then be measured at these\n      markings. Based on these measurements, the affected limb will be compared to the unaffected\n      limb. Range of motion will be defined as reduced abduction compared to the contralateral\n      shoulder . All measurements will be taken with a goniometer."
