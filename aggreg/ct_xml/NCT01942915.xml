  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Decompensated liver cirrhosis (LC), a life-threatening complication of chronic liver
      disease, is one of the major indications for liver transplantation. Recently, umbilical cord
      blood mononuclear cells transfusion has been shown to lead to the regression of liver
      fibrosis in animal model. The investigators thus investigated the safety of the therapy with
      life signs like temperature, pulse, blood pressure, the incidence of hepatocellular
      carcinoma and mortality and so on. And the efficacy was evaluated with the measurement of
      alanine aminotransferase (ALT), glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (AST), total bilirubin
      (TBIL), direct bilirubin (DBIL), albumin (ALB), cholinesterase (CHE), prothrombin time (PT)
      and child-pugh score.
