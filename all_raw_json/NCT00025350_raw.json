Patients are stratified according to ECOG\n      performance status (0-1 vs 2), baseline serum CEA (less than 5 mg/L vs at least 5 mg/L), and\n      number of metastatic sites (1 vs 2 or more). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment\n      arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral gefitinib once daily (twice daily on day 1 of course 1).\n           Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable\n           toxicity.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive a higher dose of oral gefitinib as in arm I. Patients are\n           followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually\n           thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 100 patients (50 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this\n      study."
