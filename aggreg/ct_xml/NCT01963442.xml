    <textblock>
      To investigate the non inferiority of a short lasting antibiotic treatment (3 days) when
      compared to a long lasting antibiotic treatment (8 days), at Day 15 after the beginning of
      treatment in terms of clinical efficacy, in adults admitted to emergency services for a non
      severe Community Acquired Pneumonia (PAC), who responded well to 3 days of beta-lactamin
      treatment (3GC or A/AC).
