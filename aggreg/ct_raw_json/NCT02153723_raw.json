            "textblock": "Background/rationale for the study:\n\n      In Rett syndrome brain cells aren't actually lost, instead poor maturation of connections\n      between brain cells (synapses) prevents effective neurological functioning, and is the main\n      morphological feature of the disease. The MeCP2 gene plays a major role in transcriptional\n      regulation of other genes, one of which is the gene encoding brain-derived neurotrophic\n      factor (BDNF).\n\n      The disease progression and severity of symptoms is directly affected by the level of BDNF\n      expression. An increase of BDNF levels (by genetic manipulations or pharmacological agents)\n      leads to delayed onset of Rett syndrome-like symptoms in experimental models; rescued\n      gait/mobility, improved quality of life and increased survival rates.\n\n      Copaxone treatment by subcutaneous injection caused elevation of BDNF levels.  Quantitative\n      immunofluorescence assays showed about a twofold increase in neuronal expression of BDNF\n      following Copaxone treatment.\n\n      We expect that an increase in BDNF levels with Copaxone administration will stimulate\n      communication between brain cells (synaptic maturation), which will lead to amelioration of\n      symptoms (motor functions/gait, cognitive functions, breathing, encephalopathy and improve\n      quality of life) for girls with Rett syndrome."
