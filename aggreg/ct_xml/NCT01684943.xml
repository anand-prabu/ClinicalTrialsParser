  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are doing this research study to compare the pharmacokinetics (rate of
      absorption) of insulin lispro (Humalog), insulin aspart (Novolog), and insulin glulisine
      (Apidra) within individual subjects.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Aggregate mean difference in tmax between the analog with greatest and the analog with the least value of tmax for individual subjects.</measure>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Correlation between HbA1c at study entry and use of insulin analog with most favorable PK as an outpatient for subjects with a difference in tmax between analogs.</measure>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Subjects with a difference in tmax between analogs will be catagorized as follows: using insulin with best PK for them, using insulin with worst PK for them, or using insulin with intermediate PK for them. Whether there is a difference between the median A1c between these three groups will be tested with the Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance test. In addition whether there is a difference in the fraction of subjects in these groups meeting their A1c goal of less than or equal to 7% (i.e. whether the analog choice and meeting the A1c target are independent) will be determined with the chi-square test.</description>

    <measure>Fraction of subjects with difference in tmax between the analog with greatest and the analog with the least value of tmax that is &gt; 25%</measure>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Correlation between HbA1c at study entry and use of insulin analog with tmax &lt; 60 minutes as an outpatient vs. use of an insulin analog with tmax &gt; 60 minutes as an outpatient.</measure>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Subjects with a difference in tmax between analogs will be catagorized as follows: using insulin with tmax less than or equal to 60 minutes or using insulin with tmax &gt; 60 minutes. Whether there is a difference between the median A1c between these two groups will be tested with the heteroskedastic Student's t test.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Correlation between number of monthly self-reported or meter recorded incidents of hypoglycemia at study entry and use of insulin analog with best PK kinetics.</measure>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Subjects with a difference in tmax between analogs will be catagorized as follows: using insulin with best PK for them, using insulin with worst PK for them, or using insulin with intermediate PK for them. Whether there is a difference between the number of hypoglycemic episodes per month between these three groups will be tested with the Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance test. In addition whether there is a difference in the fraction of subjects in these groups with less than or equal to two episodes of hypoglycemia a week (i.e. whether the analog choice and the frequency of hypoglycemia are independent) will be determined with the chi-square test.</description>
