  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to examine the effects of soy fiber on body weight, body
      composition and blood lipids in overweight and obese participants.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thirty nine overweight and obese college adults (19-39 y of age) were randomly assigned to
      consume control biscuits or biscuits supplemented with soy fiber for 12 wk (approximately
      100g/d). Information on body weight, body mass index, waist/hip circumference, blood
      pressure as well as measures of lipoprotein, glucose concentrations, and HbA1c was obtained
      at baseline, 8 and 12 wk after intervention. Body composition was also assessed at baseline
      and wk 12, respectively.
