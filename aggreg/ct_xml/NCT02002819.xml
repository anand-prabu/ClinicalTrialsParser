  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) have seizures in addition to losing their memory and
      other mental functions (referred to as cognitive functions). The seizures, and other
      examples of overactive electrical activity in the brain that is not noticeable, contribute
      to the loss of cognitive function. Studies in animal models suggest that a drug that
      prevents seizures called levetiracetam may reduce neuronal over-excitation and improve
      cognition in individuals with AD. We propose to determine if levetiracetam can also be used
      to treat patients with AD-associated seizures and loss of mental functions. We developed
      novel instruments for this population that will also be used in future large-scale clinical
      trials.

      The current study will last for 12 weeks and will involve people with early-onset AD and
      epileptic brain activity. Participants will be initially examined and then assigned to
      groups in a randomized manner. One group will receive levetiracetam for 4 weeks, then no
      drug for 4 weeks, and then placebo for 4 weeks. For another group, the order of treatments
      will be reversed. The cognitive abilities of participants will be retested every 4 weeks and
      compared to those at the beginning. The cognitive tests include a virtual-reality navigation
      test of memory and computerized tests of mental flexibility and problem solving. The
      participants will be monitored with a magnetoencephalogram (MEG) with simultaneous EEG
      (M/EEG) at their initial visit and after each treatment phase (levetiracetam and placebo).
      M/EEG is a highly effective non-invasive method for identifying brain regions of epileptic
      activity. We will need to recruit 36 randomized participants to test our hypotheses. This
      study will take place at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) Memory and Aging
      Center, which is a large referral site for early-onset dementias, and the Department of
      Radiology. Our overall goal is to demonstrate that levetiracetam engages the intended brain
      target by suppressing epileptic activity and provides cognitive benefit in a select group of
      patients who would be predicted to respond favorably to this treatment.

    <description>Epileptiform activity will be measured using a 1-hr resting magnetoencephalogram/electroencephalogram (M/EEG). M/EEG can detect abnormal epileptiform findings called &quot;spikes&quot;. The M/EEG will be read by an epileptologist with specialized training to assess whether there are any spikes. If spikes are observed during the M/EEG they will be counted to determine their frequency (i.e. 5 spikes per 1 hour recording).
The frequency of spikes will then be compared to baseline values from before beginning the study treatment, using statistical tests to determine if the frequency changed with treatment.</description>

    <description>A 20-minute computer-based virtual navigation test will be used to assess how well a subject can navigate a virtual community to reach a goal destination. The subjects will then be measured on their ability to accurately navigate the virtual community after a period of a few hours. The subject's performance after the study treatment will be compared with results from a baseline assessment done before the study treatment, using statistical tests to assess whether there was any significant change.</description>

    <description>Cognitive function will be assessed using a 1-hour evaluation incorporating standardized clinical measures of attention, executive functioning, working memory, episodic memory, speech and language, visuospatial skills, and emotional processing. This evaluation involves a series of oral and pencil and paper tasks to assess these domains. The subject's performance after the study treatment will be compared with results from a baseline assessment done before the study treatment, using statistical tests to assess whether there was any significant change.</description>
