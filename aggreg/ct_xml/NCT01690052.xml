  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objectives were: 1) To determine the efficacy of both cevimeline and pilocarpine in
      the secretion of saliva in patients with xerostomia, and 2) To compare the side-effects
      between the treatment for xerostomia with cevimeline and with pilocarpine.

    <description>The primary outcome measure is the increase of stimulated and non-stimulated saliva in ml from the baseline record. At each appointment, participants will provide 2 saliva samples to measure their current salivary output. The first measurement will be obtained by having the patient spit as much as he or she could into a cup for five minutes. The amount of saliva in ml will be recorded. The second measurement will be obtained in a similar manner with the addition of having the patient chew on a block of unflavored wax. Patients will complete weekly questionnaires to help determine which side-effects they experience as they take the medications.</description>
