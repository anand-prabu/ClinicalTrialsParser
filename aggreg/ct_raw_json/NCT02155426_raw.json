CTC\n      identification and monitoring these cells after treatment could help the clinicians to\n      detect relapse or be a prognostic factor.\n\n      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE : To study the relationship between CTC count and clinical outcome of\n      treatment (Overall response rate and Progression-free survival).\n\n      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES :To study the relationship between CTC and overall survival.\n\n      STUDY DESIGN : This is a prospective, observational study.\n\n      Duration of the inclusions: 12months.\n\n      SAMPLE SIZE : 1200 patients"
