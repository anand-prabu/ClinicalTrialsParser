      This is a double-blind , randomized, controlled, two-arm study aiming to evaluate the safety
      and efficacy of Polyheal-2 vs PolyHeal, in once daily application as compared to historical
      control. The study will enroll adult subjects with post traumatic/post surgical hard to heal
      wounds who meet the entrance criteria which will be followed for 12 weeks.

    <textblock>
      Subjects will undergo screenibg period of up to two weeks. Following to eligibilidy
      confirmation subjects will be randomized into one of the two treatment groups and treated
      with study device once daily for 4 weeks.

      Continuation of study device for additional period is based on wound healing progression and
      under investigator's discretion.

      Subjects will be followed up weekly following to 4 weeks of active treatment for additional
