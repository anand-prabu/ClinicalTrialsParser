The drugs used in mFOLFOX6 include Fluorouracil (5-FU), Leucovorin and Oxaliplatin.\n\n      In patients with esophagogastric cancer, mFOLFOX6 has been used in both clinical trials and\n      standard of care. \"Investigational\" means that the FDA has not yet approved this combination\n      for the treatment of esophagogastric cancer.\n\n      Every person has molecules in their bloodstream called vascular endothelial growth factors\n      (VEGFs). These molecules help grow and sustain new blood vessels needed by the human body.\n      Cancer tumors hijack this mechanism because they need new blood vessels and oxygen to grow.\n      Ziv-aflibercept is an antibody, a \"targeted therapy\" called a \"VEGF Trap\", that \"traps\"\n      (binds) these VEGFs and prevents the cancer from using them to grow. Ziv-aflibercept has\n      recently been approved by the FDA for patients with treatment-resistant colorectal cancer.\n      Patients who received standard 5-fluoruracil based chemotherapy pus ziv-aflibercept lived\n      significantly longer than those patients who received standard 5-fluoruracil alone.\n\n      In this research study, investigators will see if adding ziv-aflibercept to standard\n      chemotherapy (mFOLFOX6) works better than mFOLFOX6 chemotherapy alone in patients with\n      metastatic or unresectable esophagogastric cancer."

            "textblock": "If patients agree to participate in this research study, they will be asked to undergo some\n      screening tests or procedures to find out if they are eligible. Many of these tests and\n      procedures are likely to be part of regular cancer care and may be done even if it turns out\n      that patients do not take part in this research study. If patients have had some of these\n      tests or procedures recently, they may or may not have to be repeated. These tests and\n      procedures include: a medical history, physical examination, EKG, CT, Blood tests, pregnancy\n      test, urine test, additional blood tests for research and a collection of archival tumor\n      tissue. The screening tests will be reviewed by the doctor and the study team and if the\n      patient meets the eligibility criteria for this study, they will begin treatment. If the\n      patient does not meet the eligibility criteria, they will not be able to participate in this\n      research study.\n\n      After the screening procedures confirm that a participant is eligible to participate in the\n      research study, they will be \"randomized\" into one of two groups. A participant will receive\n      either:\n\n      mFOLFOX6 with Ziv-aflibercept -or- mFOLFOX6 with Placebo (A Placebo contains no medicine)\n\n      Randomization means that a participant is put into a group by chance (like flipping a coin).\n      Neither the participant nor the research doctor will choose what group the participant will\n      be in. Randomization will be 2:1 (twice as many of the participants in this study will\n      receive mFOLFOX6+Ziv-aflibercept). This study is \"blinded\", which means neither the patient\n      nor the doctor will know if the patient is getting the investigational drug or the placebo\n      with the mFOLFOX6.\n\n      Before a participant begins mFOLFOX6 chemotherapy, they will have a central venous line\n      inserted for the intravenous (in a vein) chemotherapy administration. This is called a\n      \"port\" or vascular access device. Insertion of the port is a minor outpatient surgical\n      procedure that is performed by a surgeon or interventional radiologist depending on where it\n      is done. The doctor will arrange for the participant to have this procedure done before the\n      participant begins.\n\n      mFOLFOX6 is a combination of chemotherapy including oxaliplatin, leucovorin, and 5-FU. The\n      oxaliplatin and leucovorin are given intravenously over 2 hours. The 5-FU is also given\n      intravenously. The participant will get a shot of 5-FU by the infusion nurse and then will\n      be hooked up to a portable pump which will infuse the rest of the 5-FU slowly over the next\n      46-48 hours. The participant can either disconnect the pump at home, or return to the\n      infusion unit to have it disconnected. The participant, the caregivers and the nurse will\n      discuss the best option for disconnecting the pump and the patient will receive instructions\n      on how to do this at home, if applicable.\n\n      Ziv-aflibercept/Placebo will be given over 1 hour intravenously."
