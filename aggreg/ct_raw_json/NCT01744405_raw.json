Estimation of nifurtimox transfer into\n      breastmilk will allow the evaluation of potential degree of exposure of infants breastfed by\n      these women to nifurtimox. This study will help clarify safety of continuing breastfeeding\n      while receiving treatment with nifurtimox for Chagas disease."
