The secondary objectives of the study were\n      to compare the following between the control and study groups: a) dietary macro- and\n      micro-nutrient intakes; b) quantitative ultrasound bone measurements of radius and tibia;\n      and c) incidence of common illnesses (diarrhea, upper and lower respiratory tract).  The\n      safety objective of the study was to compare the frequency of adverse events (AE) among the\n      control group and study group subjects."
