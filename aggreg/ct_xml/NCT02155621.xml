    <textblock>
      The genomic heterogeneity of cancers implies that to effectively use targeted therapies the
      investigators will need to assess each individual cancer and match it to a biologically
      relevant targeted therapy. The investigators will use full genome sequencing to try to
      identify cancer &quot;drivers&quot; and corresponding drugs that may inhibit these pathways.

    <textblock>
      Carcinogenesis is an immensely complex process such that even within a histologic cancer
      subtype - for example adenocarcinoma of the lung or breast - there is significant
      variability in cancer behaviour and response to therapy. Analyses of individual patients
      demonstrate unique molecular signatures for every cancer examined. Frequently, multiple
      different pathways are involved in disease growth and progression and the dominant process
      varies from person to person and perhaps even within different sites of disease within one
      person. As well these variations evolve in response to treatment.

      Recognizing genetic aberrations that promote disease facilitates targeted treatment; this
      has been demonstrated in several small subgroups of cancers in which specific genetic
      mutations or translocations have been successfully treated with targeted chemotherapy
      agents. With many recognized mutations and aberrations, personalized evaluation of the
      genetic signature encoded in DNA and RNA may provide important diagnostic information and
      potentially enable directed therapy to the appropriate oncologic pathway thereby providing
      information to help guide chemotherapy choices

      Our initial pilot project demonstrated the feasibility of this approach at our institution
      (with 100 patients). We now know it is possible to identify and consent patients, sequence
      the genome and transcriptome, analyze and report abnormalities, and identify potential
      actionable targets in a clinically relevant time frame.

      The overarching theme of this POG Program is to create a comprehensive cataloguing of
      somatic cancer mutations and cellular pathway abnormalities that could generate profound
      insights into genetic patterns that underlie particular cancer phenotypes, and provide
      valuable prognostic and predictive information.

      Eligible subjects will have several samples analyzed: a fresh tumour biopsy (typically 5
      cores are required), a blood sample for normal comparison and archival tumours when
      available. Comprehensive DNA and RNA sequencing is performed followed by an in-depth
      bioinformatic analysis to identify somatic mutations, gene expression changes or other
      abnormalities that might be cancer &quot;drivers&quot; or provide actionable (diagnostic) or druggable
      targets. The POG team meets every week to discuss the detailed genomic reports for patients,
      consider additional validation tests when necessary, and debate research questions. The
      clinicians (typically 5 - 10) come to a consensus on what systemic therapies might be
      appropriate based on these results. Whenever possible subjects are matched to clinical
      trials.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  1. Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of cancer;
             if this is not available but metastatic cancer is virtually certain because of the
             clinical and radiographic presentation then a POG program biopsy could be done
             concurrently with a diagnostic biopsy to minimize invasive testing for patients. If
             the biopsy turned out not to be cancer then the POG analysis may be cancelled.

             2. This cancer must be incurable, as defined by their treating oncologist (generally
             due to advanced stage).

             3. Patients must agree to provide archival tissue and agree to undergo at least one
             study specific biopsy at baseline and a blood test for genomic analysis. All subjects
             will also have a biopsy and blood samples at progression if it could be done safely.

             4. ECOG PS 0 or 1.

             5. Patients may have previously received one line of palliative systemic therapy
             and/or palliative radiation therapy as needed. In addition, hormone therapy or one
             line of biologically targeted therapy (such as EGFR inhibitors, BRAF inhibitors, VEGF
             inhibitors) is permitted and would not count as a line of therapy. Such that a
             patient could have one line of systemic therapy and one line of hormone or targeted
             therapy and still be potentially eligible. If the targeted therapy is given
             concurrently with the systemic chemotherapy that would count as one line of
             treatment.

             6. Age &gt; 18 years of age.

             7. Patient consent must be obtained according to the BCCA requirements.

             8. Patients must be accessible for follow-up and must be registered at the BCCA. The
             intention of this program is to serve the population of B.C. such that strong
             priority will be given to these patients. The ability to track subsequent treatments
             and outcomes is essential.

             9. Estimated life expectancy of &gt; 6 months.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  1. Unable or unwilling to undergo tumour biopsy(s) and/or blood/skin samples for
             normal DNA.

             2. Significant medical condition that in the opinion of the treating or consenting
             oncologist renders the subject not suitable for participation.

             3. Unwilling or unable to provide treatment and outcome follow up information to the
             BCCA investigators.
