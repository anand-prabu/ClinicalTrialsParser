Within one year sixty patients (age 18-65) with\n      documented single vessel CAD (type A or B1 lesion) accepted for PCI based on clinical\n      grounds and according to current international guidelines, will be asked to participate in\n      this trial. Patients will be randomized to implantation of a drug-eluted stent (Xience\n      Prime) or BRS (Absorb). The patients will be blinded to the nature of the implanted device.\n      H2 15O PET will be performed one month (reference scan), one year, and three years after the\n      PCI procedure (resolution of BRS is generally complete within a three year period). The PET\n      protocol will consist of three MBF measurements: resting MBF, during endothelial dependent\n      vasodilation provoked by coldpressor-testing (CPT), and during (endothelial dependent and\n      independent) maximal vasodilation by infusion of adenosine intravenously. After three years\n      a control invasive coronary angiogram will document any potential obstructive coronary\n      lesions that may affect the MBF measurements.\n\n      Primary study parameters/outcome of the study MBF measurements: resting MBF, during\n      endothelial dependent vasodilation provoked by cold-pressor-testing (CPT), and during\n      (endothelial dependent and independent) maximal vasodilation by infusion of adenosine\n      intravenously\n\n      Secondary study parameters/outcome of the study Obstructive coronary lesions on control\n      invasive coronary angiogram that may affect the MBF measurements."
