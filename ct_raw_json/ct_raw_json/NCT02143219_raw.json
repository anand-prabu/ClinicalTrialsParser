            "textblock": "Metastatic pancreatic carcinomas represent the 5th cause of cancer death in France (#8000\n      per year). The median age at diagnosis is 69 and 74 in male and female respectively. When\n      the 5-Fluorouracile has been used as a single agent with a limited efficacy during more than\n      20 years, the onset of gemcitabine in 1995 has led to a moderate increase of median survival\n      (from 4.41 to 5.65 months) and overall survival at 1 year (2 versus 18%). Recently, in a\n      phase II followed by a phase-III study, a French collaborative group has demonstrated the\n      benefit of \"FOLFIRINOX \" regimen versus gemcitabine alone, in terms of median survival (11.1\n      versus 6.8 months), progression-free survival (6.4 versus 3.3 months) and response rate\n      (31.6 versus 9.4%).\n\n      Although more hematologic (neutropenia) and GI toxicities were observed, FOLFIRINOX was\n      acceptable as a new standard regimen for the majority of patients under the age of 70 with a\n      good Performans Status. To reduce the toxicity of FOLFIRINOX in elderly patients (> 70 yo),\n      pharmacogenetic monitoring of 5-FU and Irinotecan key metabolism enzymes (DPD and UGTA1) may\n      be easily performed. The methodology of the study is to use the Bryant & Day statistical\n      method, allowing to consider simultaneously as principal objective, the response rate\n      (efficacy) and the tolerance (preservation of autonomy daily living, Katz index): this\n      design is particularly fitting in a study for elderly patients who represent half of the\n      pancreatic carcinoma population."
