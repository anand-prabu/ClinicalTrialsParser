  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to select the optimal formulation of the norovirus vaccine from
      different concentrations of virus-like particles (VLP) and MPL adjuvant
      (3-O-desacyl-4'-monophosphoryl lipid A) for further development.

    <textblock>
      The vaccine being tested in this study is called norovirus GI.1/GII.4 bivalent virus-like
      particle (VLP) vaccine adjuvanted with or without monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) and aluminum
      hydroxide. The norovirus vaccine is being tested to assess different formulations of the
      vaccine that will then be further developed.

      This study will look at the number of antibodies to norovirus formed in people who take
      different formulations of the norovirus vaccine. The study will enroll approximately 420
      patients. Participants will be randomly assigned (by chance) to one of fourteen treatment
      groups—which will remain undisclosed to the patient and study doctor during the study
      (unless there is an urgent medical need).

      All participants will be administered vaccine on Day 1 and Day 28 of the study. Some
      treatment arms will receive one dose of the norovirus vaccine and some arms will receives
      two. In order to keep the treatment arms undisclosed to the patient and the doctor, those
      randomized to the one dose groups will receive a dose of Hepatitis A vaccine on Day 1
      followed by the norovirus vaccine 28 days later. Participants will be asked to record any
      symptoms that may be related to the vaccine or the injection site in a diary card for 7 days
      after each vaccination.

      This multi-centre trial will be conducted globally. The overall time to participate in this
      study is up to 393 days. Participants will make 6 visits to the clinic, and will be
      contacted by telephone twice for follow-up assessments.
