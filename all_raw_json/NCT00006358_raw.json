II.\n      Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive oral temozolomide once daily on days\n      1-5 and oral thalidomide daily on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for a maximum\n      of 24 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are\n      followed at 1 month and then for survival.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study within 4-5 months."
