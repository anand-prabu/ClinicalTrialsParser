The loss of family support for individuals with mental illness is a\n      major contributing factor to housing instability, homelessness, and other problems. Despite\n      progress toward integrating mental health and substance abuse services, interventions that\n      improve the course of mental illness while helping the families of the mentally ill are not\n      currently available.  Enhancing skills for coping with mental illness may be an effective\n      strategy for treating SUD, decreasing caregiver burden, and improving the long-term outcomes\n      for people with mental illness.\n\n      Patients and their families are randomly assigned to either the Family Intervention for Dual\n      Diagnosis (FIDD) program or family psychoeducation. The FIDD program lasts for up to 3 years\n      and includes both single and multiple-family group formats. The family psychoeducation\n      program consists of 6 weekly sessions.  Routine assessments are conducted on all patients,\n      and relatives are evaluated on a wide range of outcomes, including substance abuse,\n      hospitalizations, psychiatric symptoms, legal problems, aggression, housing and\n      homelessness, family burden, social support, and quality of life. To determine the\n      effectiveness of the FIDD program, knowledge of mental illness and problem-solving skills\n      are assessed in the families following treatment."
