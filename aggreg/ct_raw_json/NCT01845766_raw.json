We will randomize those subjects into the intervention group\n      which will take a standardized rehabilitation with routine clinical care for sepsis and the\n      control group which will take routine clinical care for sepsis. And, we plan to assess their\n      functional activity using ADL, IADL and SF-36, and cognitive function using MMSE at the time\n      of enrollment, 28 days, and 6 months later."
