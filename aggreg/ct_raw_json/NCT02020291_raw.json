The present project focuses on the critical\n      role of the Wnt-5a protein in the pathobiological processes that lead to metastatic cancer\n      disease.\n\n      WntResearch has identified a formylated 6 amino acid peptide fragment, named Foxy-5, which\n      mimick the effects of Wnt-5a to impair migration of epithelial cancer cells and thereby\n      acting anti-metastatic. The aim of the present clinical phase 1 trial is to establish the\n      recommended dose for a clinical phase 2 study and thereby further develop Foxy-5 as a first\n      in class anti-metastatic cancer drug. Foxy-5 is designed to inhibit the development of\n      metastasis by reducing the motility of cancer cells and should thereby increase the survival\n      rates of patients with solid malignant tumours."
