            "textblock": "The goal of this research is to understand the functioning of 'regulatory circuits' in the\n      brain. These are brain circuits which allow a person to regulate their attention, regulate\n      their behavioral responses, and regulate their decision-making. We are also interested in\n      how the stimulant medications methylphenidate and naltrexone affect these regulatory\n      circuits. Methylphenidate is a widely-used, FDA approved medication used to treat Attention\n      Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and is also known as Ritalin. Naltrexone is an FDA\n      approved medication used to help treat alcohol and substance abuse.\n\n      This research study will use a scanning technique known as functional magnetic resonance\n      imaging (fMRI)which takes a special kind of picture of the brain that enables us to \"see the\n      brain at work\". Adult participants will be given a one-time dose of either methlyphenidate,\n      naltrexone,or placebo before each fMRI scan session. There are three total fMRI scan\n      sessions. Therefore, each participant will receive each possible medication/placebo only\n      once.\n\n      Thus, using the fMRI technique, our main purpose for this research is to better understand\n      the functioning of regulatory circuits in conditions such as ADHD and alcohol dependence.\n      This research may one day help us develop better treatments for these disorders."

For more detailed\n      information regarding drug administration please see section.\n\n      Once at the scanner facility, subjects will fill out an MRI Safety form before every scan to\n      ensure that they are able to enter the magnet safely. After this form has been completed and\n      signed, then the subject will undergo a practice session of the fMRI tasks in the private\n      practice room designated for such activity at the scanner facility. Once tasks have been\n      practiced the MRI technician will prep the subject making sure there is no metal on their\n      person before entering the scanner.\n\n      All subjects will be in the scanner for approximately 65 minutes performing the tasks which\n      are listed in more detail in section.\n\n      Post scan, the study coordinator or other trained study personnel will escort the subject\n      back to the Rachel Upjohn Building at the University of Michigan via taxi for a study\n      debriefing."
