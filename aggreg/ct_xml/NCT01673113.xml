  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cryolipolysis with Zeltiq CoolSculpting device is a novel method of non-invasive fat
      removal.  The technique works by application of cold plates to the skin surface for a single
      cooling cycle lasting 60 minutes, after which a cold-induced inflammatory panniculitis leads
      to selective loss of fat.  There is no histologic evidence of necrotic or inflammatory
      damage to skin or nerves, however a single small human study has reported prolonged
      temporary altered sensation (hypoesthesia) in the area of cryolipolysis procedure.  This
      hypoesthesia seen in about 2/3 of patients, is completely reversible, lasts up to 8 weeks
      after treatment, and suggests that cooling under these conditions can temporarily alter
      sensory nerve function.

      The purpose of this study is to further characterize the reversible cutaneous sensory
      function alteration after cryolipolysis with Zeltiq CoolSculpting device.  Using multiple
      modalities of sensory nerve function we hope to elucidate the details of cryolipolysis
      induced sensory nerve alteration.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects ages 18-65 years old, male or female with visible adiposity on the flanks
             (love handles) and no weight changes exceeding 10lb during the preceding month.

          -  Willingness to participate in the study

          -  Informed consent agreement signed by the subject

          -  Willingness to have skin biopsy done

          -  No history of allergy to lidocaine or any other anesthetics.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has a history of nerve problems, neuropathy

          -  Subject who has recently undergone liposuction or another weight loss procedure, had
             a history of subcutaneous injections into the area of intended treatment within the
             preceding 6 months.

          -  Subjects with a BMI of 30 or greater

          -  Subject has an infection, surgical scars or other dermatologic condition in the area
             to be treated

          -  Subject has known cold sensitivity disorders including Raynaud's phenomena, cold
             urticaria, cryoglobulinemia, or cold induced hemoglobinuria

          -  Women who are pregnant or intending to become pregnant in the following 9 months;

             investigational drug or device.

          -  Any other condition or laboratory value that would, in the professional opinion of
             the investigator, potentially affect the subject's response or the integrity of the
             data or would pose an unacceptable risk to the subject.

          -  Subject taking anticoagulants
