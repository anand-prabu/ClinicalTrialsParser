  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is compare the efficacy of haplo-cord transplant (investigational
      arm) with that of  a more commonly used procedure in which only the cells contained in one
      or two umbilical cords are infused (standard arm).

      We hypothesize that reduced intensity conditioning and haplo-cord transplant results in fast
      engraftment of neutrophils and platelets, low incidences of acute and chronic graft versus
      host disease, low frequency of delayed opportunistic infections, reduced transfusion
      requirements, shortened length of hospital stay and promising long term outcomes. We also
      hypothesize that umbilical cord blood selection can prioritize matching and better matched
      donors can be identified rapidly for most subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a clinical trial for subjects with hematologic malignancies ( acute myelogenous
      leukemia, acute lymphocytic leukemia, Hodgkin's or Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, or
      myelodysplastic syndrome) who are in need of a donor stem cell transplant, and for whom an
      umbilical cord blood transplant is thought to be the best option. For allogeneic transplant
      donors, we  typically try to use related family members, such as brothers or sisters, or
      volunteer donors  who are 'HLA matched', i.e. share similar proteins on their cells. This
      study is for subjects for whom such a matched sibling donor or a matched unrelated donor is
      not available.

      This study tests a new method of bone marrow transplantation called combined haplo-identical
      cord (haplo-cord) transplantation. In this procedure, cells from a related donor who shares
      half of the HLA proteins ( haplo-identical)are collected from the blood, as well as cells
      from an umbilical cord, and then both are transplanted. It is hoped that by using cells from
      a haplo-identical relative, subjects will have a faster recovery and require fewer
      transfusions. Over time the haplo-identical cells from the relative are replaced by the
      cells from the cord blood. The combined transplantation of haplo-identical stem cells and
      cord blood has previously been used in approximately 60 subjects with very encouraging
      results.

      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of haplo-cord transplant (
      &quot;investigational&quot; arm) with the more commonly used procedure in which only the cells
      contained in one or two umbilical cords are infused (&quot;standard&quot; arm). Subjects will be
      randomly assigned into either the haplo-cord group or the umbilical cord group.

      If randomized to the haplo-cord group, a family member will undergo a stem cell collection.
      In both arms, subjects will receive a &quot;conditioning regimen&quot; prior to transplantation. The
      conditioning regimen consists of chemotherapy, which is meant to destroy the cancer cells
      and suppress the immune system to allow the transplanted cells to grow. Subjects will remain
      in the hospital until the stem cells are fully recovered, which is usually 4 to 6 weeks
      after the transplant. Subjects will have bone marrow aspiration and biopsy at 3 weeks, 4
      weeks, 2 months, 6 months and 1 year after the transplant and then yearly thereafter.
      Participation in the study will continue for up to 5 years after transplantation.

This may include 0-2 antigen mismatches at each A or B (at the antigen level) or DRB1 (at the allele level) loci. All typing will be done using molecular typing. Though molecular level typing will be available, a match is defined at intermediate resolution for HLA-A and -B and at high resolution for -DRB1</description>

    <description>If a subject is randomized to the haplo-cord transplant group, their family member will undergo a stem cell collection. The stem cells from the haplo-identical donor will be purified by a procedure called CD34 selection before they are given to the subject. A special device called the CliniMACS® CD34 Reagent System, which is not FDA approved, will be used for this purpose. The manufacturer of the device, Miltenyi Biotec, is providing the researchers access to the device for use in this research study.  Because the stem cells from the haplo-identical donor are treated using the CliniMACS CD34 selection device, they cells are considered investigational.</description>
