The eligible patients were\n      treated with the standard procedure of EGDT. The hemodynamic data were recorded. Oxygen\n      metabolism and hepatic function were monitored. Indocyanine clearance test was applied to\n      detect the hepatic perfusion. Hemodynamics, hepatic perfusion, oxygen metabolism and hepatic\n      function were compared before treatment, after EGDT and 24 hours after EGDT."
