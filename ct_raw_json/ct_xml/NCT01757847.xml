  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study proposes to compare a brief Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) group
      intervention to an active control group in a sample of 154 overweight or obese binge eating
      veterans who have completed the VA's national behavioral weight management program (MOVE!).
      This study anticipates that the ACT intervention will reduce binge eating and distress while
      improving functioning and maintenance of weight loss.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately two-thirds of all adults and close to 75% of Veterans are overweight or obese,
      making obesity a national epidemic with significant impairments in physical and
      psychological functioning, increasing healthcare costs, and high mortality rates. A
      significant proportion of overweight and obese individuals binge eat in response to stress
      or negative emotions, further contributing to obesity. Obesity and binge eating are
      independently related to a number of physical and mental health co-morbidities such as
      diabetes, coronary heart disease, osteoarthritis, respiratory symptoms, depression, and
      anxiety. Although behavioral weight loss interventions have been partially effective, few
      show long-term maintenance of weight loss, especially for patients with binge eating
      behavior. Thus, a stepped-care approach that provides more intensive treatment to
      specifically address the emotional and behavioral factors associated with problematic eating
      and obesity may be necessary. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), an
      empirically-supported intervention that is being rolled out nationally by the VA, has been
      effective in reducing distress, increasing quality of life, and improving other indices of
      health in a wide range of conditions from depression to diabetes. The investigator's
      preliminary findings suggest that a brief ACT-based group intervention for patients with
      overweight or obesity can substantially reduce binge eating and distress, and improve
      functioning. This study proposes to test the efficacy of an ACT intervention for binge
      eating in conjunction with a standard behavioral weight loss intervention, Managing
      Overweight and/or Obesity for Veterans Everywhere (MOVE!), at the VA San Diego Healthcare
      System (VASDHS). Patients (N = 154) who are overweight or obese (body mass index &gt; 25 kg/m2)
      and meet the clinical criteria for binge eating will be randomized to receive either four
      2-hour weekly ACT intervention groups or brief MOVE-II active control groups after their
      participation in MOVE!. This study hypothesizes that: 1) patients in the ACT intervention
      will experience significantly greater reductions in binge eating severity than patients in
      the brief MOVE-II active control group (primary outcome); 2) patients in the ACT
      intervention will experience significantly greater improvements in physical and mental
      health functioning, obesity-related quality of life, physical activity levels, caloric and
      nutrient intake, emotional distress symptoms, binge frequency, and other forms of emotional
      eating than patients in the brief MOVE-II active control group; 3) gains associated with the
      ACT intervention will be maintained longer than gains associated with the brief MOVE-II
      active control group; 4) at 3-month and 6-month follow-ups, patients in the ACT intervention
      will have greater decreases in body mass index compared to patients in the brief MOVE-II
      active control group; and 5) measures of acceptance and action will mediate treatment
      response in the ACT intervention on outcomes of interest. Given the significant physical and
      psychological sequelae of binge eating and obesity, a brief intervention that can reduce
      disordered eating, enhance the maintenance of weight loss, and improve functioning among
      patients who suffer from binge eating, could be critical in the comprehensive approach to
      patient care at the VA.

    <description>The MOVE-II protocol and was designed to reinforce the weight-loss principles that patients learn in MOVE! and to provide support in continued weight loss. The brief MOVE-II active control group protocol will be delivered in four 2-hour weekly group sessions. This protocol include a psycho-educational component that reinforces the key information from the medical, nutrition, and weight loss strategies modules of the MOVE! program. After review of the psycho-educational components, patients have the opportunity to share their challenges with binge eating and weight loss. Patients will then be able to receive support and feedback from other group members and the therapist. In addition to reinforcing the strategies taught during MOVE! and to provide support in implementing those strategies, the active control group focuses on increasing self-esteem and self-efficacy by exploring patient strengths and maintaining therapeutic alliance and optimism.</description>
