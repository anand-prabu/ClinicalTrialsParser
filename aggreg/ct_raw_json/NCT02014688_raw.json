This study is\n      conducted in normal volunteers of various non-Caucasian ethnic group, and data will be\n      combined with Caucasian subjects to be representative of the US population: (1) Hispanic\n      Descent, (2) Black or African American Descent, (3) Asian Descent, (4) American Indian or\n      Alaskan Native Descent. This study will complement the previous study S-2012-1 NORM-cc, in\n      which normal data from Caucasian individuals were collected.\n\n      The main goal of the study is to provide the range of these structural parameters in normal\n      eyes. The study will include at least 87 (enrollment target: 135) normal volunteers; each\n      study site will recruit at least 29 (target: 45) subjects with an age range of 18 to 90\n      years and an approximately equal number of females and males. All subjects will undergo\n      Spectralis OCT imaging, biometric and ophthalmoscopic examination, disc photography and\n      visual field testing in one single visit. All examinations performed on the subjects are\n      non-significant risk procedures because the medical devices are cleared for marketing in\n      Europe and in the U.S. Total study duration including IRB approval is anticipated to not\n      exceed 4 months."
