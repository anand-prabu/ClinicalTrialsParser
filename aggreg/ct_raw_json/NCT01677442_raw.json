            "textblock": "The thoracoscopic surgery always requires not only an appropriate depth of anaesthesia, but\n      also a quiet and wide operative field. That's why anaesthesia plays a critical role in\n      thoracoscopic surgery.\n\n      General double-lumen endotracheal intubated anesthesia with one-lung ventilation, has been\n      accepted mandatory for Video-Assisted Thoracic Surgery (VATS) although several adverse\n      effects can derive from this type of anesthesia like intubation-related throat injury,\n      ventilator-induced lung injury, arrhythmia and so on. The investigators hypothesize that\n      VATS could be performed under the no-intubated thoracic epidural anesthesia (NTEA) to avoid\n      general anesthesia related risks.\n\n      Some cases have been reported to prove the safety and feasibility of NTEA in uncomplicated\n      VATS. However, the comparison of NTEA and general anesthesia has been rarely investigated in\n      such a larger magnitude number and such operation varieties. The investigators hypothesize\n      NTEA could result in less inflammations, lower incidence of complications, less dosage of\n      antibiotic, faster recovery eventually leading to a shorter hospital stay. For this reason,\n      the investigators will undertaken a randomized trial comparing results of general VATS\n      operations under NTEA versus those of a control group operated under general anesthesia with\n      double-lumen endotracheal intubation.\n\n      A total of 500 patients will be included. The study will be performed in the first\n      affiliated hospital of Guangzhou Medical College."
