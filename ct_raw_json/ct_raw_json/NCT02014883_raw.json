Should an organic acid abnormality such as an excessive urinary excretion of propionate metabolites such as 3-hydroxypropionic, 2-methylcitric, propionylglycine, tiglylglycine and/or methylmalonic acid occur, the dose of triheptanoin will be reduced until normalization of the organic acid and acylcarnitine profile. If still abnormal, patient will be excluded from the study. For GI distress, the research dietitian will instruct the patient regarding taking the dose over a longer period of time (30 minutes). If GI distress persists, triheptanoin dose will be reduced by 50% and re-increased progressively as the problems resolve with the patients working closely with research dietitian until tolerance of the full dose is achieved.",
