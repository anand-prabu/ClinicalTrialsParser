Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of\n      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of hu14.18-IL2 fusion protein until the\n      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at\n      which at least 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed every 2 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 3 years, and then\n      annually for 5 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-24 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year."
