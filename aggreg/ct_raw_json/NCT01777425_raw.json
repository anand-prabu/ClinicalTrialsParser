The SNOT-22 total score can range from 0 to 110, with higher scores representing worse quality of life.\nPerceived health status can be evaluated by the 36-item short-form (SF-36). It consists of 36 items covering eight domains. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight.
