The exact pathophysiology of EDS in PD, DLB\n      and MSA has not been fully elucidated so far, although pharmacological factors (dopaminergic\n      medications) and pathological factors (neurodegeneration of sleep-wakefulness regulatory\n      areas) have been identified. Arterial hypotension is frequently observed in patients with\n      PD, DLB and MSA and considered as a marker of autonomic failure. Sleepiness is known to\n      occur preferentially when patients are having arterial hypotension whatever the cause (i.e.\n      postprandial period, administration of hypotensive medication such as dopamine agonists).
