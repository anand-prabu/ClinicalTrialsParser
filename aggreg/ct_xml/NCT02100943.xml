      This study will evaluate the presence or absence of Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) in the
      third trimester of pregnancy and again postpartum.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective cohort study to evaluate the presence or absence of OSA in the third
      trimester of pregnancy and again postpartum. The investigators will use the Watch-PAT200®
      device as their accepted standard for diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea.

      When enrolled, women will be taught how to use the Watch-PAT200® via a company produced
      video that will be shown in the clinic and will be available via YouTube for review later if
      needed. They will also complete the Berlin Questionnaire. The patient will then use the
      Watch-PAT200® device overnight to evaluate for obstructive sleep apnea. This will be
      performed between 32-36 weeks gestation. Apnea-hypopnea indices (AHI) will be calculated and
      an AHI&gt;5 will be considered diagnostic for OSA.

      The next morning when the patient returns the Watch-PAT200® device they will exhale into the
      NIOX MINO® to assess their exhaled nitric oxide levels. This will be performed between
      800-1000 am by one of the study personnel.

      The patient will also wear the Watch-PAT200® device the first postpartum night. The entire
      process will be repeated between 6-8 weeks postpartum.
