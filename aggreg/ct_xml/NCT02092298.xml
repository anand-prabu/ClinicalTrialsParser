    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if hyperthermic intraperitoneal
      chemotherapy (HIPEC) will help to control the disease in patients with Stage 4 stomach or
      gastroesophageal cancer. The safety of this treatment will also be studied.

      HIPEC Treatment:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, on Day 1 of Week 1,  you will
      receive heated mitomycin-C and cisplatin as a liquid that is injected through 3 to 4 small
      incisions in your abdomen for about 1 hour. This will be done as a surgical procedure, and
      you will be under general anesthesia. The chemotherapy will then be flushed out of your
      abdomen and collected, and the treatment area inside your abdomen will be washed. The fluid
      that is flushed through your abdomen will be collected and checked for cancer cells.  As is
      standard of care, any lesions that are found during treatment may also be biopsied at this
      time.

      You will also receive sodium thiosulfate by vein over about 20 minutes to protect the
      kidneys.

      You will remain in the hospital for 3-7 days after treatment.

      Study Visits:

      On Day 1 of Week 1:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2-3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

      Every day while you are in the hospital after treatment:

      -Blood (about 2-3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

      One (1) time between Weeks 2-6:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  You will have a CT scan of your chest, abdomen, and pelvis to check the status of the
           disease.

        -  Blood (about 2-3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for tumor marker testing

      Surgery:

      If your doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a standard of care surgery. You will
      receive a separate consent form which explains the surgery and its risks.

      On or before 8 weeks after your surgery:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2-3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

      Follow-Up Visits:

      You will be contacted every 12 weeks (until 24 months after the last person enters the
      study) by telephone or routine clinic visit.  You will be asked about any other cancer
      treatments you may be receiving.  If you stopped the study early, the study doctor may ask
      you to return to the office for extra CT scans during the follow-up period.

      You will have a CT scan of your chest, abdomen, and pelvis every 6 months for 5 years after
      surgery to check the status of the disease.

      Length of Study Participation:

      You will be on study for about 5 years after surgery. You will be taken off study early if
      the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow
      study directions.

      Your participation on the study will be over after the follow-up visits.

      This is an investigational study.  The chemotherapy and surgery are standard treatment for
      stomach and gastroesophageal cancer.  It is investigational to give the chemotherapy by
      HIPEC.

      Up to 30 participants will take part in this study.  All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

    <description>Primary objective of study is to assess overall survival (OS) in subjects with stage IV gastric cancer representing positive cytology or imaging occult carcinomatosis after laparoscopic hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy administration. Overall survival measured from time of laparoscopic HIPEC. Patterns of tumor recurrence and survival assessed by reviewing routine surveillance CT scans.
