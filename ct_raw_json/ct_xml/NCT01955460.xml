    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of T-cells
      injected with the genes TGFb-DNR and NGFR that can be given in combination with chemotherapy
      (cyclophosphamide and fludarabine) and aldesleukin to patients with metastatic melanoma.

      This study involves gene therapy.  T-cells are types of white blood cells that help your
      body fight infections. They may recognize and kill melanoma cells.  Researchers want to grow
      your T-cells in a laboratory, inject them with TGFb-DNR and NGFR genes which may help them
      recognize tumor cells, and then give them back to you by vein.  This may help to control
      melanoma.

      Cyclophosphamide is designed to block cancer cells from dividing, which may slow or stop
      their growth and spread throughout the body.  This may cause the cancer cells to die.

      Fludarabine is designed to interfere with the DNA (genetic material) of cancer cells, which
      may cause the cancer cells to die.

      Aldesleukin is designed to block the activity of cells that decrease the immune system's
      ability to fight cancer.

      Study Groups:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a dose
      level of TGFb-DNR and NGFR T-cells based on when you join this study.  Up to 5 dose levels
      of T-cells may be tested.  At least 2 participants will be enrolled at each dose level.  The
      first group of participants will receive the lowest dose level.  Each new group will receive
      a higher dose than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen.  This will
      continue until the highest tolerable dose of TGFb-DNR and NGFR T-cells is found.

      All participants will receive the same dose level of cyclophosphamide, fludarabine, and
      aldesleukin.

      Study Drug Administration:

      The days leading up to Day 1 of the study are considered negative days.  For example, the
      day before Day 0 is Day -1.  Day 0 is when you will receive the T-cells, as explained below.

      On Days -7 and -6, you will receive cyclophosphamide by vein over about 2 hours.  You will
      also receive furosemide by vein over about 60 minutes to try to increase the amount of urine
      your body makes.

      On Day -7, you will receive mesna by vein non-stop over about 24 hours.  Mesna is given to
      help protect the bladder from side effects of cyclophosphamide.

      You will take trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole (SMX) by mouth 2 times a day, starting on
      Day -7 and continuing for at least 3 months after chemotherapy.  SMX is given to lower your
      risk of side effects.

      On Days -5 to -1, you will receive fludarabine by vein over about 15-30 minutes.

      On Day 0, you will receive TGFb-DNR and NGFR T-cells through a central venous catheter (CVC)
      over about 15-60 minutes.  A CVC is a thin flexible tube that is inserted into the body.
      The catheter may be placed into a vein in your arm or in a large vein in your neck.  If the
      cells need to be given through a large vein in your upper chest or in your neck, the area
      will be numbed with anesthetic before the catheter is put in.  Other catheters may be needed
      in one or both of your arms to give you fluids, drugs, or extra nutrition.  You will sign a
      separate consent form for the catheter, which will describe the procedure and the risks in
      more detail.

      Starting on Day 0:

        -  You will receive levofloxacin with or without food by mouth or by vein over about 60
           minutes 1 time a day until your white blood cell count rises.  Levofloxacin is designed
           to prevent infection caused by bacteria.

        -  You will take fluconazole by mouth 1 time a day until your white blood cell count
           rises.  Fluconazole is designed to treat fungal infections.

        -  If you have a herpes infection, you will take acyclovir by mouth (or valacyclovir by
           vein over about 60 minutes if you are unable to take acyclovir by mouth) 1 time a day
           until your white blood cell count rises.  These drugs treat infections caused by the
           herpes viruses.

      On Days 1-5, you will receive aldesleukin by catheter over about 15 minutes every 8-16 hours
      for up to 15 doses.  On Days 22-26, you will receive aldesleukin by catheter over about 15
      minutes every 8-16 hours for up to 15 doses.  You will only receive aldesleukin if your
      platelet counts are high enough.

      You will be in the hospital over the course of about 7 days each time you receive
      aldesleukin.  You will be expected to stay in the Houston area for at least 14 days in order
      to take part in the chemotherapy and cell infusion parts of the study.

      If your blood count drops and if the study doctor thinks it is needed, you will receive
      filgrastim through a needle under the skin 1 time a day until your white blood cell count
      rises.  Filgrastim is designed to help raise the white blood cell count.

      You will take Tylenol (acetaminophen) by mouth before the T-cell infusion to lower the risk
      of allergic reaction.

      Anytime the study doctor thinks it is needed, you will receive ondansetron by vein over 30
      minutes to lower the risk of nausea and vomiting during chemotherapy.

      If the disease is stable or has partly responded, it is possible that you will receive a 2nd
      round of chemotherapy, aldesleukin, and T-cells.  You would repeat the study visit schedule
      as well.  Your doctor will discuss this with you.

      Study Visits:

      Every 1-2 days during Days -7 to 26, blood (about 3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine
      tests.

      On Day 0:

        -  Your vital signs will be measured before the TGFb-DNR and NGFR T-cell infusion, every
           15 minutes during the infusion, and then 1 time an hour for 4 hours after the infusion.

        -  Blood (about 4½ tablespoons each time) will be drawn before the T-cell infusion and 4
           hours after the infusion to test the frequency and activity of the cells (the number of
           cells and how they behave).

      If your blood tests show that you had Cytomegalovirus (CMV) in the past, you will have an
      additional blood (about 2 teaspoons) sample drawn after the T-cell infusion to check for the
      presence of CMV. The study staff will check your CMV levels at Day 3 (+/- 24 hours) and Day
      21 (+/- 7days) after TIL infusion as an added precaution.

      Some of the T-cells that you receive may come from donors who have tested positive for CMV
      in the past. However, these donors will be treated for CMV before their cells are collected,
      and the cells will also be tested to check for CMV before they are given to you.

      At 1 week after the T-cell infusion, blood (about 4½ tablespoons) will be drawn to test the
      frequency and activity of the cells.  This will be repeated at 4 weeks after the T-cell
      infusion if the doctor thinks it is needed.

      At about 6 and 12 weeks after the T-cell infusion:

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs and weight.

        -  Blood (about 4½ tablespoons) will be drawn to test the frequency and activity of the
           T-cells.

        -  You will have a CT or PET/CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis to check the status
           of the disease.

        -  You will have an MRI or CT scan of the brain to check the status of the disease.

        -  You will have any other tests that the study doctor thinks are needed.

      On Days 6 and 27 (+/-1 day) after the T-cell infusion, you will have tumor biopsies to check
      the status of the disease. The type of biopsy will depend on the size and location of the
      tumor.  Your doctor will discuss this with you.

      If the patient's TIL are grown

      Length of Study Drug Dosing:

      You may receive up to 2 rounds of the study drugs (up to 24 weeks total).  You will no
      longer be able to take the study drugs if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side
      effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

      Your participation on the study will be over once you have completed the follow-up visits.

      Follow-Up:

      At 6 and 12 months after the T-cell infusion (which may be a second T-cell infusion, as
      described above) and then 1 time every year for 10 years after the infusion:

        -  Blood (about 4½ tablespoons) will be drawn to test the frequency and activity of the
           T-cells.  Researchers will also use this blood to check for any long-term side effects
           of putting new genes into the cells.

        -  You will have any other tests that the study doctor thinks are needed.

      This is an investigational study.  TGFb-DNR and NGFR T-cells are not FDA approved or
      commercially available.  They are currently being used for research purposes only.

      Cyclophosphamide is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of several
      types of cancer such as leukemia, lymphoma, and breast cancer.  Fludarabine is FDA approved
      and commercially available for the treatment of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia.  It is
      investigational to give cyclophosphamide and fludarabine to patients with metastatic
      melanoma.

      Aldesleukin is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of metastatic
      melanoma and a type of kidney cancer.

      Up to 36 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.
