    <textblock>
      For some upper ureteral and renal stones,ureteroscopic lithotripsy needs to be performed
      under general anesthesia with interrupted suspension of mechanical ventilation, which could
      result in hypercapnia and hypoxia. In this study, the investigators hypothesize that 10
      cmH2O PEEP added to the respiratory circuit with 1 L/min 100% oxygen might extend the time
      of ventilation suspension but have no effect on carbon dioxide retention in blood.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For some upper ureteral and renal stones,ureteroscopic lithotripsy is often perdurbed by the
      patient's respiratory movement either under epidural anesthesia or general anesthesia with
      mechanical ventilation. So intermittent suspension of mechanical ventilation under general
      anesthesia can ensure the surgery to be performed continuously and successfully. But this
      could result in hypercapnia and hypoxia. So far, there have been few studies focused on the
       change of the internal environment in blood as result of suspending breath. In this study,
      the investigators hypothesize that 10 cmH2O PEEP added to the respiratory circuit with 1
      L/min 100% oxygen might extend the time of ventilation suspension but have no effect on
      carbon dioxide retention in blood.
