  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The placebo effect represents a potent treatment for MDD—placebo response in acute
      randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of antidepressant medications averages 30%, and
      meta-analyses have estimated the proportion of medication response attributable to placebo
      to be 50-75%. Patient expectancy is the mechanism of placebo effects in antidepressant RCTs
      and has been positively associated with medication response. Determining how expectancy
      alters the course of MDD could lead to methods of optimizing placebo effects and improving
      the treatment of MDD. In addition, investigating the neurobiology of placebo effects has the
      potential to elucidate the pathophysiology of MDD and the mechanisms of action of
      antidepressant treatments. Brain regions implicated in expectancy and placebo effects
      comprise prefrontal cortical (PFC) areas, amygdala, insular cortex, rostral anterior
      cingulate cortex (rACC), and dopaminergic reward pathways in the striatum. Pathological
      decreases in PFC and striatal function, increases in limbic activity, and disordered
      connectivity between these regions have all been observed in MDD, and the rostral and dorsal
      ACC have been repeatedly linked to antidepressant treatment response.

      Therefore, studying placebo effects offers a window into the functioning of the neural
      circuits that are disturbed in MDD and improve with effective treatment. The goals of this
      study are to determine whether expectancy affects the outcome of antidepressant
      pharmacotherapy and to investigate the neural mechanisms of expectancy effects. These will
      be accomplished by conducting a clinical trial randomizing adult outpatients with MDD to 8
      weeks of treatment in high vs. low expectancy conditions. The high expectancy condition will
      be open administration of citalopram, while the low expectancy condition will be
      placebo-controlled administration of citalopram. The neural mechanisms of expectancy will be
      determined using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) paradigms to investigate
      treatment activation differences in brain regions associated with placebo effects and MDD.
