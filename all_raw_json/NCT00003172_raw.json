            "textblock": "OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the objective response rates for two different regimens in patients\n      with advanced gastric cancer: the combination of fluorouracil plus hydroxyurea given as high\n      dose 24 hour infusions plus interferon alfa-2a and filgrastim; versus the combination of\n      doxorubicin and docetaxel. II. Evaluate the toxicities and reversibility of toxicities of\n      each of these combinations in patients with advanced gastric cancer.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is an open label, two arm, multicenter, randomized study. Arm I: Patients\n      receive fluorouracil (5-FU), recombinant alfa-2a interferon, hydroxyurea (HU), and\n      filgrastim (granulocyte colony-stimulating factor; G-CSF). 5-FU is administered by 24 hour\n      infusion on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, and 36 (weeks 1-6). Recombinant alfa-2a interferon is\n      administered subcutaneously immediately before beginning the 5-FU infusion, then three times\n      a week for 6 weeks. HU is administered by 24 hour infusion on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, and 36\n      (weeks 1-6). G-CSF is administered subcutaneously on days 3, 4, 5, and 6 on weeks 1-6. Weeks\n      7 and 8 are rest periods. Arm II: Patients receive doxorubicin administered by slow IV push\n      followed (30 minutes after infusion) by docetaxel as a 1 hour IV infusion. Treatment is\n      repeated every 21 days. All patients are assessed monthly during study and continue study\n      treatment as long as no disease progression or unacceptable toxic effects are observed.\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for the first 2 years, then every 6 months for years\n      2-5, and then annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A minimum of 26 patients (13 in each arm) and a maximum of 80 patients\n      (40 in each arm) will be accrued in this study in approximately 2 years."
