      The primary objectives of this clinical study include:

        -  Evaluate E1 Wear including early bedding-in process, clinical outcomes on patients who
           received Total Hip Arthroplasty with E1

        -  Compare E1 wear used with CoCr and Biolox Delta heads

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed as PROSPECTIVE, RANDOMIZED, MULTI-CENTER Study to compare two
      different materials (CoCr and Delta ceramic) articulating against E1 Highly Crosslinked
      polyethylene in Hip Replacement.

      Patient population is 160 (80 each). Follow-up period is 10 year postoperatively. E1 liners
      with thickness of 4.8mm at 45 degrees position (load bearing direction) will be used in all
      cases.

      Randomization will occur via random number generator by 4 blocks randomization.
