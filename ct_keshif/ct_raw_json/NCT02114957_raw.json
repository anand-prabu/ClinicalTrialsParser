The\n      information is critical for drug development and could not be obtained from any other\n      studies using animals. The two herbal drugs are decursin and decursinol angelate (DA) which\n      naturally exist in a traditional herb Angelica gigas Nakai (AGN). Preclinical and clinical\n      studies indicated that AGN and decursin/DA were quite safe to animals and human."
