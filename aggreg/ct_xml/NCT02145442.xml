  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      -  Obesity is an important and growing public health worldwide

        -  Obesity is highly related to the development of metabolic syndrome, diabetes,
           cardiovascular diseases and cancer

        -  An extensive body of evidence from efficacy trials has shown that weight loss is
           achievable, however, a modest weight loss is achieved in a small proportion of patients

        -  Important adverse events have been reported with the use of antiobesity drugs.

        -  The use of natural products with potential effects inducing weight loss is an
           alternative strategy for treating patients with overweight and obesity. However,
           efficacy and safety should be evaluated in RCT.

        -  Obex combines different molecules with potential effects inducing weight loss and
           control on metabolic parameters such as fasting glucose, cholesterol and triglycerides.

        -  Therefore, the administration of Obex in overweight and obese patients with impaired
           fasting glucose could be an excellent strategy to induce weight loss and ameliorate the
           metabolic disturbances related to obesity and overweight.
