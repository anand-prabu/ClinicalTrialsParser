The\n      investigators will collect genotype data on methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (MTHFR), MTR\n      and MTRR in this patient population.  Subjects will be able to receive their genotype\n      results, on request, upon completion of the study.  The investigators hypothesize that\n      depressed patients will be more likely to have a mutation in the MTHFR gene"

The following\n      scales will be conducted at this visit:\n\n      Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders-IV\n      (DSM) (SCID-I) is a clinician-administered, semi-structured diagnostic interview for mental\n      health disorders.\n\n      Hamilton Depression Rating Scale-24 (HAM-D) is a clinician-administered questionnaire\n      designed to assess the severity of depression in adults.\n\n      Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) is a clinician-administered questionnaire which\n      assesses the severity of symptoms of anxiety.\n\n      Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (YBOCS) is a clinician administered questionnaire to\n      assess the severity of symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder.\n\n      The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is a clinician administered cognitive screening\n      tool to aid in the detection of mild cognitive impairment.\n\n      The Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) is a clinician-administered rating scale\n      that quantifies the presence and severity of suicidal ideation and behavior.\n\n      Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) is a 7-point clinician rating of severity of\n      psychopathology.\n\n      Next, a physician will conduct a brief medical physical exam which includes: measuring blood\n      pressure, pulse, and body weight, a current and past medical history and blood will be\n      drawn. If you are a female of childbearing potential, a urine pregnancy test will be\n      performed.\n\n      Baseline Visit The results of the laboratory tests performed at the screening visit will be\n      reviewed. If eligibility is met, vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, and weight) will\n      be measured. Then a member of the research team will ask questions about current symptoms.\n      The following scales will be conducted at this visit and at all remaining visits in the\n      study:  HAM-D, HAM-A, YBOCS, MoCA, C-SSRS, and the CGI-S.\n\n      Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I)  is a 7-point rating of treatment response\n      anchored by 1 (\"very much improved) and 7 (\"very much worse\").\n\n      Blood will be collected including a sample for genetic testing. Then the first week of study\n      drug and instructions on how to take it will be given. Please bring any unused study drug to\n      on the next visit.\n\n      Visits 1/End of Week 1, 2/End of Week 2, 3/End of Week 4, 4/End of Week 8, 5/End of Week 12\n      Vital signs will be measured and a member of the research team will ask questions about\n      current symptoms. Rating scales will be conducted assessing the symptoms.\n\n      Any unused study drug from the last visit will be collected and counted. The study doctor\n      will ask about overall health and wellbeing. Please tell the study doctor about any problems\n      encountered during the study. The next week's study drug will be given. Please bring any\n      unused study drug to on the next visit.\n\n      Additional blood will be collected at visit 5."
