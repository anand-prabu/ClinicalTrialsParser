  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the physiological response to application of the
      Intrathoracic Pressure Regulator (ITPR) in patients with compromised cerebral circulation.
      The study will evaluate the physiological response to intrathoracic pressure regulation
      (IPR) therapy in hemodynamically stable patients with compromised cerebral circulation who
      are on ventilatory support.
