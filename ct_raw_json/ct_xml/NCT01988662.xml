  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percent reduction in blood VEGF at month 3 following intravitreal (IVT) injection of anti-VEGF agent</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 3</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>Yes</safety_issue>
    <description>Percent reduction in blood VEGF level is calculated as the difference in blood VEGF level mesured after 3 month of anti-VEGF agent IVT treatment (Ranibizumab or Aflibercept) when compared to baseline blood VEGF level.</description>

    <measure>Percent reduction in blood VEGF level overtime</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to month 3</time_frame>

    <description>Blood VEGF measurement performed at all visits and compared to baseline level</description>

    <measure>Correlation between blood detected VEGF level and measured concentration of anti-VEGF agent overtime</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline through month 3</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>Yes</safety_issue>
    <description>VEGF level and anti-VEGF concentration measured in the blood at each single visit, including pre- and post-dose measurement during the dosing visits.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean change from baseline in Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) of the study eye over time</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline through Month 3</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>BCVA score is assessed on study eye at every study visit based on the number of letters read correctly on the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS)-like visual acuity charts at a testing distance of 4 meters. An increase in score indicates an improvement in acuity</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>mean change in central retinal thickness (CRT) of the study eye over time</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline through Month 3</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Central Retinal Thickness in micrometers assessed by Optical Tomography (OCT) at each single study visit. A reduction is thickness indicates an improvement is the lesion area.</description>
