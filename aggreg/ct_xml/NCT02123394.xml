      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of the McKenzie method in patients with
      chronic non-specific low back.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One hundred and forty-eight patients will be randomly allocated to two treatment groups:
      McKenzie method or Placebo (detuned ultrasound and short wave therapy) for 5 weeks (total of
      10 sessions of 30 minutes each).

      The clinical outcomes will be obtained at the completion of treatment (5 weeks) and at 3, 6,
      and 12 months after randomization. The data will be collected by a blinded assessor. The
      statistical analysis will follow the intention-to-treat principles and  the between-group
      differences will be calculated by constructing mixed linear models.

Patients will also receive written instructions from the Treat Your Own Back book and will be asked to perform home exercises  based on the principles of McKenzie method. The description of the exercises that will be prescribed in this study are already published elsewhere. Compliance with home exercises will be monitored by means of a daily-log that the patient will fill in at home and bring to the therapist at each subsequent session. Patients will receive 10 sessions of treatment over a period of five weeks (two sessions/week).</description>

        as pain or discomfort between the costal margins and the inferior gluteal folds, with or
        without referred symptoms in the lower limbs, for at least 3 months), with a pain
        intensity of at least 3 points measured by a 0-10 points pain numerical rating scale, aged
        between 18 and 80 years and  able to read in Portuguese.

        -

        Exclusion Criteria: patients will be excluded if they have any contraindication to
        physical exercise or ultrasound or short wave therapy, evidence of nerve root compromise
        (i.e one or more of motor, reflex or sensation deficit), serious spinal pathology (such as
        fracture, tumor, inflammatory and infectious diseases), serious cardiovascular and
        metabolic diseases, previous back surgery and pregnancy.
