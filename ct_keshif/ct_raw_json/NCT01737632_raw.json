From intake to 2 months, residential treatment will show better outcomes than\n      the family based treatment. Between 2 months and 18 months, family based treatment will show\n      better outcomes than residential. Between 18 months and four years post intake, outpatient\n      family based treatment will maintain its treatment gains, while the residential treatment\n      condition will show an increase in these same symptoms and behaviors.\n\n      Aim 2: To examine the relationship between predictors (family, peer, educational/vocational\n      functioning and involvement in post-treatment services), and outcomes (drug use, co-morbid\n      symptoms, and criminal behavior) during the four-year post intake period.\n\n      Hypothesis 2a. Family functioning, educational/vocational functioning, and peer\n      relationships measured at discharge will predict drug use, co-morbid symptoms, and criminal\n      behaviors though the four year longer term follow up period.\n\n      Hypothesis 2b. Family functioning, educational/vocational functioning, peer relationships,\n      and involvement in post-treatment services during the post treatment period will predict\n      drug use, co-morbid symptoms, and criminal behavior through the longer term follow up\n      period.\n\n      Research Question 1. Is the rate of change in family functioning, educational/vocational\n      functioning, peer relationships, and involvement in post-treatment services related to the\n      rate of change in drug use, co-morbid symptoms, and criminal behavior?"
