  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study examines whether nonsmokers can be mobilized to help smokers quit.  We will test,
      via mail campaign, whether targeting nonsmokers can be equally effective in increasing
      smokers' quit rate as targeting smokers directly.  The hypothesis is that both targeted
      interventions will lead to a higher quit rate than a control group, which receives one set
      of self-help materials. Each of the targeted intervention groups receives 10 mailings.
      Smoking status of all three groups will be measured at 3 and 7 months post randomization.

      This study examines the potential of enlisting nonsmokers to help smokers quit smoking.
      Nonsmokers are the majority of the society. If an intervention can be designed to mobilize
      nonsmokers to help smokers quit, then it has strong implications for increasing smoking
      cessation at the population level.  The conventional approach in smoking cessation is to
      target smokers directly. This study aims to test whether targeting nonsmokers can be equally
      effective.  The study employs a three arm randomized design, in which a smoker-nonsmoker
      pair in the same household will be randomized into one of the three groups.  One group
      receives materials targeting the smoker in the household, one group receives materials
      targeting the nonsmoker, and the third group serve as a control group.  The intervention
      consists of mailed materials which include postcards, informational materials, CDs, DVDs,
      coupons for cessation-related incentives such as nicotine patches, and links to secured
      websites.  The mail campaign is augmented with brief phone calls to ensure receipt of
      mailings and to reinforce targeted messages.The mail campaign is augmented with brief phone
      calls to ensure receipt of mailings and to reinforce targeted messages. At 3 and 7 months
      post randomization, project staff contact all participants to assess their smoking status.
