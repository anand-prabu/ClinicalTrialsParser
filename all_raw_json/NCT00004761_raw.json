Generate a large data bank of clinical, historical, and genetic information concerning\n      these patients.\n\n      III.  Accumulate donated tissue specimens, including selected cells and DNA, from selected\n      patient subsets for the establishment of permanent tissue cell banks.\n\n      IV.

Diagnostic studies to confirm the type of epidermolysis bullosa are performed as\n      indicated.  A pedigree chart is completed on the first affected family member entered.\n\n      Selected patients are followed at least biannually. A study duration of approximately 10\n      years is anticipated."
