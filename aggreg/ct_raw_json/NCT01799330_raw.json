TCEMS can improve exercise tolerance, functional status and symptoms even among COPD\n           patients who fail to make gains in exercise tolerance by participating in conventional\n           PR due to their debilitation and/or marked cardio-respiratory impairment."

The\n      studies proposed in this research will build on the knowledge gained in our previous study\n      of TCEMS by investigating whether and how TCEMS adds to the beneficial effects of PR on\n      exercise capacity and muscle function among outpatients with stable COPD, and by assessing\n      for the first time whether TCEMS improves exercise tolerance and functional status among\n      COPD patients unable to make gains following conventional outpatient PR. Thus, this proposed\n      study may provide a novel strategy in the rehabilitation of patients with chronic lung\n      disease.\n\n      The two specific aims of the proposed study are:\n\n        1. Determine whether administration of TCEMS after conventional exercise training in PR\n           leads to added gains in muscle strength, exercise capacity, dyspnea and health status,\n           to determine if TCEMS should be considered as an additional routine method in\n           outpatient PR programs.\n\n        2. Determine whether patients who are unable to improve exercise tolerance during\n           conventional exercise training in PR can achieve gains in muscle strength, exercise\n           tolerance, dyspnea, and health status following TCEMS used as an alternate\n           rehabilitative strategy."
