      The purpose of the study is to investigate the possible association between low levels of
      MBL and the development of endometriosis

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Endometriosis is a chronic, inflammatory disease, affecting approximately 10% of the female
      population. The pathogenesis of endometriosis is still unclear, but several studies have
      indicated that the immune system is involved. It has been suggested that endometriosis
      should be considered an autoimmune disease, considering the findings of elevated levels of
      cytokines, decreased cell apoptosis, increased incidence of autoantibodies and a higher
      frequency of other autoimmune diseases in endometriosis patients. MBL participates in the
      innate immune defence by activating complement on the surfaces of microorganisms, but
      several studies have suggested that MBL is also involved in autoimmune diseases. The
      individual MBL level is highly variable due to a number of polymorphic sites in the
      structural gene and in the promoter region, and approximately 12 % of the normal population
      have very low serum MBL levels (&lt;100 ng/ml).

      The possible association between MBL and endometriosis has been investigated in two small
      studies, in which no association was found. The aim of the present study is to investigate
      the prevalence of individuals with low serum levels of MBL and with genotypes associated
      with low MBL production in a larger group of endometriosis patients.
