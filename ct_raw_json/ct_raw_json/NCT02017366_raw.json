Oral feeds are started at the same time as in the control group (reg. day 5) Jejunostomy feeds are then continued for 6 weeks together with oral intake with a continuous energy administration of 1000kCal, and then stopped. After this time, patients should be on regular full diet in both groups. If failure and step-back needed, temporary switch to Glc 20% is done to maintain fluid and calory administration."
