      The proposed natural history study will enroll male and female patients, ages 36 months and
      younger, who have a diagnosis of XLHED based on genetic testing and who have not received an
      investigational study drug. The study protocol will include collection of all relevant
      medical history and documentation of clinical outcomes using age-appropriate, minimally
      invasive technologies.  Data will be collected both retrospectively, back to pregnancy
      assessments that may be available, and prospectively through age 5 yrs.

      Important to the development and regulatory approval of therapies for XLHED will be the
      collection of data on the clinical history and prospective health of those affected by
      XLHED. The proposed natural history study will enroll male and female patients, ages 36
      months and younger, who have a diagnosis of XLHED based on genetic testing and who have not
      received an investigational study drug. The study protocol will include collection of all
      relevant medical history and documentation of clinical outcomes using age-appropriate,
      minimally invasive technologies.  Data will be collected both retrospectively, back to
      pregnancy assessments that may be available, and prospectively through age 5 yrs.
      Genotype-phenotype correlations in XLHED, based on well-documented health records and
      prospective assessments on genetically-confirmed individuals, may now provide new and
      clinically-predictive information for the benefit of patients, families, health care
      providers and clinical investigators designing trials for therapeutic interventions.
