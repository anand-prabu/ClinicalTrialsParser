While several tests are available\n      for assessing such patients, consensus has not been achieved on the optimal approach. As a\n      matter of fact, pancreatic cancer staging is discussed controversially due to conflicting\n      evidence and certainly EUS has lost grounds due to improvements in CT technology. Thus, the\n      role of EUS and EUS-guided FNA varies among treatment centers.\n\n      The present study is designed to better define the role of EUS in predicting resectability,\n      as compared to high resolution cross-sectional imaging."
