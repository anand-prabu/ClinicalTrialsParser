To determine the duration of remission in all responders after treatment with MLN9708\n      defined as the time of documented remission until relapse.\n\n      II. To determine the 1 year overall survival, which will be measured from time of study\n      entry to the earlier of death from any cause or end of follow up at 1 year.\n\n      III. To establish toxicity and tolerability of MLN9708 treatment in AML, including\n      non-hematologic toxicities grade 3 or above as specified by Common Terminology Criteria for\n      Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0.\n\n      OUTLINE:\n\n      Patients receive ixazomib orally (PO) on days 1, 4, 8, and 11.
