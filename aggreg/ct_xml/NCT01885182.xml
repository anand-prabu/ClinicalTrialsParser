      This is a randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel group study using OXN and OXY PR
      to treat moderate to severe, chronic cancer pain. Subjects with documented history of cancer
      pain that requires around the clock opioid therapy will be included. Subjects must have a
      medical history of constipation that was induced by, or worsened by their opioid therapy.

                  taking a laxative, respectively.

               2. the subject's self-assessment that their constipation was induced or worsened by
                  their current pre-study opioid medication.

          4. Documented history of moderate to severe, chronic cancer pain that requires around
             the-clock opioid therapy (starting dose of oxycodone PR between 20-80 mg/day) &amp; are
             likely to benefit from WHO step III opioid therapy for the duration of the study.
             Subjects must be willing to discontinue their current opioid analgesic routine.

          5. Opioid medication continue at a stable or nearly stable dose in the investigator's
             opinion during the treatment.

             specific laxative medication.

          7. Subjects taking daily fibre supplementation or bulking agents are eligible if they
             can be maintained on a stable dose &amp; regimen throughout the study, &amp; in the
             investigators opinion are willing &amp; able to maintain adequate hydration.

          8. Subjects willing &amp; able (e.g. mental &amp; physical condition) to participate in all
             aspects of the study, including use of medication, completion of subjective
             evaluations, attending scheduled clinic visits, completing telephone contacts, &amp;
             compliance with protocol requirements as evidenced by providing written, informed
             consent.

          9. Subjects already taking non-opioid analgesics &amp; all other concomitant medications
             (including those for the treatment of depression) are eligible to take part in the
             study. However, all concomitant medications that are considered necessary for the
             subject's welfare should be continued at a stable dose throughout the double-blind
             phase of the study &amp; under the supervision of the investigator.

         10. Expected survival time &gt; 3 months.

         11. With capability of reading, understanding &amp; signing inform consent form &amp; compliance

             disease, as determined by medical history, clinical laboratory tests, ECG results &amp;
             physical examination, that would place the subject at risk upon exposure to the study
             medication or that may confound the analysis &amp; or interpretation of the study
             results.
