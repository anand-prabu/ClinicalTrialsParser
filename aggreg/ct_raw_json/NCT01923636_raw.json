Among asymptomatic infected neonates 10 to 15% will ultimately\n      develop hearing loss. To establish the prognosis of infected neonates remains difficult and\n      the purpose of the study is to better define early prognosis factors.\n\n      The true burden of CMV congenital infection is unknown in France: the prevalence of the\n      infection as well as the description of its epidemiology (proportion of symptomatic and\n      asymptomatic cases, rate of long term sequelae, proportion of cases following primary or\n      secondary maternal infections) are unknown."
