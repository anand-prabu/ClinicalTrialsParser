  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the safety and efficacy of reformulated raltegravir (MK-0518) 1200 mg once daily
      in combination with TRUVADA™ versus raltegravir 400 mg twice daily in combination with
      TRUVADA™ in HIV-1 infected, treatment-naive participants. The primary hypothesis being
      tested is that reformulated raltegravir 1200 mg once-daily is non-inferior to raltegravir
      400 mg twice-daily, each in combination therapy with TRUVADA™, as assessed by the proportion
      of participants achieving HIV-1 ribonucleic acid (RNA) &lt;40 copies/mL at Week 48.
