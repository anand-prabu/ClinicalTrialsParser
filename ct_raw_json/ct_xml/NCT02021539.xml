  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis tested is that the physical changes associated with cervical ripening result
      in a detectable decrease in rigidity. The main objective of this study is therefore to
      determine whether the measured elastographic rigidity of cervical tissues in addition to
      cervix size can be used to predict delivery within the next 48 hours (creation of a
      prognostic score).

      The secondary objectives of this study are:

      A-To compare the prognostic qualities of elastography scores and fetal fibronectin
      measurements for predicting the risk of delivery in the next 48 hours.

      B-To evaluate the economic impact of introducing elastographic and fibronectin measures
      during consultatios for obstetric emergencies from the point of vue of the French social
      security system and the hospital.

      C-To evaluate the prognostic value of elastographic measurements in the subgroup twins.

      D-To study elastography variation according to patient outcomes.

      E-Evaluate the reproducibility of intra-and inter-rater elastographic measurements.
