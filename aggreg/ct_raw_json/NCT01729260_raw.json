We also want to find out if MBZ\n      can slow the growth of the brain tumor. The study doctors have found that MBZ is effective\n      against malignant brain tumors in the laboratory and animal models of brain tumors."

            "textblock": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and aggressive brain cancer, and despite significant\n      advances in treatment the majority of patients die within two years of diagnosis. During\n      routine animal studies we serendipitously observed that fenbendazole, a benzimidazole\n      antihelminthic used for pinworms, prevented tumor engraftment. Subsequent in vitro and in\n      vivo experiments with benzimidazoles identified mebendazole as the drug having the best\n      results in preclinical testing 1.  In GBM cell lines, mebendazole displayed cytotoxicity\n      with IC50s ranging from 0.1-0.3 \u03bcM.  Mebendazole disrupted microtubule formation in GBM\n      cells and it's in vitro activity was correlated with reduced tubulin polymerization. In two\n      orthotopic mouse glioma models, one syngeneic and one xenograft, mebendazole significantly\n      extended average survival up to 63% compared to untreated controls 1.\n\n      Mebendazole is an FDA approved antiparasitic agent with a well-established side effect and\n      safety record and was effective in our animal models in dosing schedules that are documented\n      as safe in humans. Therefore, mebendazole is a possible anti-cancer therapeutic with\n      pre-clinical safety and efficacy and provides a promising opportunity for a clinical trial\n      in patients with malignant gliomas.\n\n      In addition, a recently published case report case report from the University of Michigan\n      documented successful long term control in metastatic adrenocortical adenocarcinoma using\n      mebendazole 2. Mebendazole was well tolerated at 200 mg/day and used as the sole treatment\n      after the patient failed other chemotherapies."
