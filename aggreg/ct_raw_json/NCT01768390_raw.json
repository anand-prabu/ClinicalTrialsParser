To be eligible for\n      inclusion, the patients are scheduled for bimaxillary treatment with FOA for an expected\n      duration of at least 1 year. All are instructed to use 0.25 gram dentifrice and brush their\n      teeth during 2 minutes twice daily during the entire period of treatment. Before bonding,\n      and after polishing with a rubber cup and non-fluoride pumice paste, 3 digital photos of the\n      maxillary incisors, canines and premolars are taken. At debonding, remaining composite\n      material on the surfaces is removed with a slow rotating carbide bur followed by polishing\n      with a rubber cup and pumice paste. A new series of frontal and lateral digital photos is\n      thereafter exposed.\n\n      The primary outcome measure is the incidence and severity of WSL as registered separately by\n      two blinded experienced and calibrated clinicians according to a validated index. A random\n      sample of 50 cases is re-assessed to check intra- and inter-examiner reliability. The\n      intervention is indended run throughout the full duration of the orthodontic treatment,\n      varying between 18 and 24 months."
