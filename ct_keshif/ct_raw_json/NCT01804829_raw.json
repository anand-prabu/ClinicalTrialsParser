Subjects who reduce their viral load to\n      less than 100 IU/ml HCV RNA through up to 16 weeks of antiviral therapy prior to liver\n      transplant are enrolled in the study. There is no requirement to reach undetectable virus\n      prior to transplant as the function of Civacir\u00ae is to neutralize any remaining virus in\n      circulation.\n\n      Subjects randomized to Civacir\u00ae treatment arms receive study drug infusions starting on the\n      day of liver transplant followed by 15 doses over a 10 week period to prevent the recurrence\n      of quantifiable Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) after liver transplant. The study will evaluate\n      dosing arms ranging from 200 mg/kg to 400 mg/kg compared to a control arm. For the primary\n      endpoint, efficacy is defined as persistent viral load suppression maintaining HCV RNA\n      levels below the lower limit of quantitation as determined by central laboratory Polymerase\n      Chain Reaction (PCR) at 12 weeks post-liver transplant and then at 24 weeks post-liver\n      transplant to demonstrate durability of effect."
