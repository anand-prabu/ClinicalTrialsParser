      Objectives

        1. To determine the uptake of universal HIV testing among Thai men who have sex with men
           (MSM) and transgender women (TG)

        2. To determine the uptake of  antiretroviral treatment (ART) regardless of CD4 count
           among Thai MSM/TG who test positive for HIV

      Subject population:. Men or transgender women who have sex with men,Thai nationals, age â‰¥18
      years old, Have engaged in anal intercourse with a man without using a condom at least one
      time in the last  6 months or have had at least 3 male sex partners in the last 6 months,Not
      known to be HIV-positive (either have never been tested for HIV or have had a previous
      negative HIV test)

      Number of participants:2000 Thai MSM and TG with approximately 76%-90% in Bangkok, 5%-12% in
      Lampang and 5-12% in Ubonratchathani.

      All participants will receive HIV testing at baseline. The frequency of study visits to
      determine HIV status in HIV-negative participants will be every 6 months for a total follow
      up time of 24 months. Once HIV-positive status is confirmed, participants will be offered
      ART immediately regardless of CD4 count. Those who accept ART will be seen more frequently
      following ART initiation, at 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 2 months, 3 months and every 3 months
      thereafter until completion of 24 months of follow-up. Those who deny immediate ART will
      have clinic visits every 6 months to monitor HIV disease. HIV-negative participants will be
      asked to come for HIV re-testing every 6 months or sooner if they feel exposed to risk
