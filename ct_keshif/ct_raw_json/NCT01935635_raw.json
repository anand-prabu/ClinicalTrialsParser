The research objects will be grouped according to the principle of a multicenter,\n           randomized, open, parallel controlled clinical trial, 300 cases of cell therapy groups\n           (100 cases with PEG-IFN treatment, LdT treatment for 100 cases, ETV treatment for 100\n           cases), 150 cases of control groups (PEG-IFN therapy in 50 cases, LdT therapy for 50\n           cases, ETV treatment for 50 cases).\n\n           Part2 (12-36W):\n\n        2. Cell therapy groups: enter the HBsAg sensitized dendritic cells activated T cells\n           (HBsAg Pulse DCs-T, HPDCs-T) immune therapy combined with interferon (IFN) or\n           nucleoside analogues treatment (NAs), infusion of HPDC-T every 2 weeks for 1 time,\n           total 12 times.\n\n        3. Control groups: antiviral therapy used only (IFN or NAs).\n\n           Part3 (36-72W):\n\n        4. The observation stage: discontinuation of interferon in the treatment of 48 weeks; NAs\n           cases will continue on treatment with NAs.\n\n      HPDCs-T produced procedure:\n\n      The first step: 1-7 days Monocytes will be isolated from peripheral blood of patients. The\n      monocytes obtained  will be then incubated in fresh serum-free AIM-V medium (Gibco)\n      containing 800U/ml of GM-CSF and 400U/ml of IL-4 (Peprotech) for 5 days. After 5 days of\n      culture in vitro, The DCs induced will be cultured with a commercially available hepatitis B\n      vaccine containing 10 ug of HBsAg (GSK) for 2 days.\n\n      The second step: 8-14 days The hepatitis B vaccine sensitized DCs (HPDCs) (from the first\n      step) will be sub-cultured with patient's own PBMCs for 7 days: HBsAg can be efficiently\n      presented to PBMCs by DCs, with producing HBV specific CTLs and HTLs (HPDCs-T).\n\n      The third step: 15 days The PBMCs (the second step) containing enough HPDCs-T will be\n      transfused back into the patient."
