In particular,\n      retrospective data showed an association between oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy and\n      improvement of grade and percentage of tumor regression; moreover, the addition of\n      Bevacizumab seems to improve TRG over chemotherapy alone, conferring also a protection\n      against liver damage due to chemotherapy-induced sinusoidal obstruction syndrome.\n\n      This is the rationale that induced us to carry out an evaluation and feasibility assessment\n      of a perioperative approach with COI-B regimen in patients affected by high risk or\n      borderline resectable colorectal liver metastases, with or without previous resection of\n      primary tumor."
