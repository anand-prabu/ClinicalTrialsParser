Patients are randomized to 1 of 2\n      treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive bortezomib IV over 3-5 seconds twice weekly on weeks 1 and 2.\n           Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or\n           unacceptable toxicity. Patients then undergo core biopsy.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients undergo core biopsy. Patients then receive bortezomib IV as in arm I.\n\n      Patients undergo radiologic re-evaluation of measurable lesions. Patients with stable\n      disease or a partial or complete response continue to receive bortezomib in the absence of\n      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed for 2 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 21-41 patients will be accrued for this study within 9-14\n      months."
