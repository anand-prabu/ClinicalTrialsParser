      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects, good and/or bad, of the drug
      regorafenib with chemotherapy regime (FOLFOX). This is a a Phase II trial that will study if
      this new treatment is effective and safe in patients with esophagus and stomach cancer.

    <description>Regorafenib 160 mg daily on days 4 to 10 and days 18 to 24 as four 40 mg coprecipitate tablets + mFOLFOX on Day 1 and Day 15 of each cycle. Each cycle consists of 28 days. All patients will receive systemic chemotherapy with the mFOLFOX regimen and regorafenib. The specific version of the FOLFOX regimen used at MSKCC is mFOLFOX6. mFOLFOX6 will be given on Day 1 of each cycle. Patients will receive Oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2 IV (over 120 minutes), leucovorin 400 mg/m2 IV (over 120 minutes), 5-FU 400 mg/m2 IVP, and 5-FU 1200 mg/m2/day CIVI x 2 days, every two weeks. Treatment will be performed on the scheduled day ± 7 days. In case of discontinuation of FOLFOX due to cumulative toxicity and administration as a single agent during the study, regorafenib for patient convenience will be administered 160 mg daily for 3 weeks on/1 week off. The 3 weeks on/1 week off schedule is supported by the single agent regorafenib data in colon cancer and GIST.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

             unresectable esophageal, gastroesophageal junction or gastric adenocarcinoma.

          -  Patient must have disease that can be evaluated radiographically. This may be
             measurable disease or non-measurable disease. Minimum indicator lesion size = 10 mm
             by helical CT or = 20 mm by conventional techniques. Pathological nodes must be = 15
             mm by the short axis to be considered measurable.

          -  Subject must be able to swallow and retain oral medication

          -  Age 18 years or older.

          -  Karnofsky performance status &gt; or = to 70%

          -  Peripheral neuropathy ≤ grade 1

          -  Hematologic (minimal values) White blood cell count &gt; or = to 3000/mm3© Absolute
             neutrophil count &gt; 1500 cells/ mm3 Hemoglobin &gt; or = to  8.0 g/dl Platelet count &gt; or
             = to 90,000 / mm3 Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x the upper limits of normal (ULN)

             x ULN for subjects with liver involvement of their cancer)

          -  Alkaline phosphatase limit ≤ 2.5 x ULN (≤ 5 x ULN for subjects with liver involvement
             of their cancer). Patients with alkaline phosphatase elevation secondary to the bony
             metastases rather than liver dysfunction may proceed with treatment on protocol after
             discussion with the principal investigator.

          -  Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x the ULN

             menses for at least 1 year) and surgically sterilized women are not required to
             undergo a pregnancy test..

          -  Patients with prior deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) currently

             rivaroxaban will be permitted.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Uncontrolled hypertension (systolic pressure &gt;140 mm Hg or diastolic pressure &gt; 90 mm
             Hg on repeated measurement) despite optimal medical management.

             digoxin.

          -  Unstable angina (anginal symptoms at rest), new-onset angina within 3 months before
             randomization, or myocardial infarction within 6 months before randomization.

          -  Evidence or history of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy.

          -  Any hemorrhage or bleeding event ≥ NCI CTCAE version 4.0 Grade 3 within 4 weeks prior
