    <textblock>
      Purpose: To determine whether oral viscous budesonide (OVB) or fluticasone metered dose
      inhaler (MDI) most effectively treats EoE by improving histologic findings and symptoms,
      which medication provides a more durable treatment response, and whether biomarkers can
      predict treatment response.

      Participants: A total of 122 16-80 year old patients with a new diagnosis of eosinophilic
      esophagitis (EoE)  who are referred for upper endoscopy.

      Procedures: This will be a prospective, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, clinical
      trial comparing OVB to fluticasone MDI for treatment of EoE.  This overall study design will
      generate data for all three Aims

    <description>To determine whether viscous budesonide is more effective than fluticasone MDI for improving post-treatment maximum esophageal eosinophil counts (measured in eosinophils per high powered field (eos/hpf)) in patients with EoE.  The mean post-treatment maximum eosinophil count will be compared between the OVB and MDI groups using a two-sample t-test.  The pre- and post-treatment counts will also be compared within study groups using a paired t-test.</description>

    <description>To determine whether viscous budesonide is more effective than fluticasone MDI for improving dysphagia (measured by the Daily Symptoms Questionnaire (DSQ)) in patients with EoE.  The mean DSQ scores will be compared between the OVB and MDI groups using a two-sample t-test, and within groups using a paired t-test.</description>

    <description>To test whether OVB results in less symptomatic recurrence than fluticasone MDI, survival analysis will be performed with the interval between treatment end (week 8) and recurrent symptoms or study end (week 60) as the time of interest.  A Kaplan-Meier curve will be constructed comparing the time until symptom recurrence in both study groups using the log-rank test.</description>

    <description>To determine whether baseline immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of esophageal biopsies for major basic protein (MBP), eotaxin-3, and mast cell tryptase (MCT) is associated with histologic response in EoE patients treated with topical corticosteroid therapy.  The mean baseline cellular staining for each biomarker (MBP, eotaxin-3, and MCT) will be compared between the responder and non-responder groups using a two-sample t-test.</description>
