Centers will be randomized to receive the choir program\n      immediately (intervention group) or after a 6-month delayed intervention phase (control\n      group). The community choirs will be led by professional music directors. The investigators\n      will assess both primary and secondary outcomes at baseline, 6 and 12 months, with the main\n      intervention group comparison being at 6 months. The investigators will also evaluate the\n      start-up and ongoing program costs for senior centers, including cost/person served and\n      determine quality adjusted life years.\n\n      The hypotheses are:\n\n        1. Compared to delayed intervention controls, participation in a community choir program\n           will be associated with improvements/maintenance on the primary outcomes of physical\n           function (balance, walking speed, strength), depressive symptoms, and cognition\n           (executive function and memory) at 6 months.  The investigators also predict\n           within-group improvements on these primary outcomes at 12 months.\n\n        2. Compared to delayed intervention controls, participation in a community choir program\n           will be associated with improvements in the secondary outcomes of well-being\n           (depressive symptoms, loneliness, resilience, social participation, health-related\n           quality of life, shortness of breath, functional status, falls, and health services\n           use) at 6 months.  The investigators also predict within-group improvements on these\n           secondary outcomes at 12 months."
