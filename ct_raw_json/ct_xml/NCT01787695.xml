    <textblock>
      Vitiligo is a chronic acquired disease characterized by well defined white macules and
      patches affecting the skin. There are many treatment modalities available for vitiligo,
      however, none of them cure the disease.   Ultraviolet A1 (UVA1) phototherapy has been shown
      to be useful for a variety of skin diseases. However, there are only a few studies published
      on the efficacy of UVA1 in vitiligo.  This is a prospective single-blind randomized clinical
      trial to assess efficacy and safety of UVA1 in the treatment of vitiligo.

    <textblock>
      Vitiligo is a chronic acquired disease characterized by well defined white macules and
      patches affecting the skin and mucous membranes. Mucocutaneous lesions develop secondary to
      selective destruction of melanocytes. The etiology of vitiligo is largely unknown but more
      likely to be multifactorial. There are several theories on the pathogenesis of vitiligo
      including mainly the autoimmune, neurohormonal, and autocytotoxic theories. The autoimmune
      hypothesis has the strongest evidence with alteration mainly in the cellular immune
      response.

      There are many treatment modalities available for vitiligo, however, none of them cure the
      disease. These include different topical treatments, phototherapy, surgical therapy, and
      depigmentation therapy. Narrow-band UVB (NB-UVB) is currently the preferred treatment over
      topical psoralen and ultraviolet A radiation (PUVA), for patients with vitiligo. However,
      overall response of vitiligo to NB-UVB has been variable. Ultraviolet A1(UVA1) phototherapy
      is now useful for a variety of skin diseases, specifically scleroderma. There are only a few
      studies published on the efficacy of UVA1 in vitiligo.

      One of the main side effects of UVA1 is prominent tanning which might be due to melanocyte
      stimulation. Therefore, the investigators hypothesis is that UVA1 will induce significant
      skin pigmentation to improve vitiligo. The investigators plan on conducting a prospective
      single-blind randomized clinical trial to assess efficacy and safety of UVA1 in the
      treatment of vitiligo.

      Study Objectives

        1. To evaluate the potential for UVA1 to induce repigmentation within vitiligo patches.

        2. To assess the side effect profile of UVA1 when used in the treatment of vitiligo.

    <description>Patients with a vitiligo patch larger than 25cm2 will be recruited. The target patch will be divided into two halves. One half will be shielded by foil and served as control while the other half will be exposed to UVA1.
The dose of UVA1 will be 60 J/cm2, 5 times a week for 4 weeks. Patients that have no or less than 10% pigmentation change after 4 weeks will receive UVA1 130J/cm2, 5 times a week for another 4 weeks. The patients with more than 10% pigmentation change will receive UVA1 60 J/cm2, 5times a week for another 4weeks. This will be followed by assessments at 4, 8, and 12 weeks post treatment.</description>
