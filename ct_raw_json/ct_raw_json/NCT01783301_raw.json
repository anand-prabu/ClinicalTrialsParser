All subjects who agree to participate in the\n      trial must sign a consent form, irrespective of whether or not they ultimately agree to have\n      their   dose determined by the study protocol. Eligible subjects will be randomised in\n      blocks of 4 at each site via a computer generated random number list to either the AFC\n      guided arm (control) or the AMH guided arm (treatment). The starting doses of GONAL-f\u00ae  for\n      each arm will be based on the study algorithms, using AFC or AMH guidance.\n\n      The investigator will then enter initiate ovarian stimulation with an individualised\n      GONAL-f\u00ae dose for that specific subject. This will be maintained for the first 5 days of\n      stimulation after which the dose can be modified based on investigator decision and in\n      accordance with the site's routine clinical practice.\n\n      Trial Population\n\n      Female partners of infertile couples requiring Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART)\n      treatment.\n\n      Data Analysis and Statistics\n\n      The primary end-point proportion of patients with desired number of retrieved oocytes (8-12)\n      will be compared between the 2 arms using the chi -square test. The null hypothesis will be\n      that there is no difference between the 2 arms in primary end-point, with the p level set at\n      p=0.05.  The secondary end-points will also be compared between the 2 arms using either the\n      Student's t test or anova test."
