  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vaccines have been responsible for preventing millions of deaths and extending the average
      human lifespan. Effective vaccines stimulate the cells of the immune system to activate
      genes and associated functions that bring about protective immunity. Knowledge of those
      genes and cellular functions activated by effective vaccination can improve our
      understanding of how the immune system works and define the features necessary for a
      successful vaccine response. This study aims to define cellular functions important for the
      hepatitis B (HBV) vaccine immune response in healthy individuals. The investigators will
      identify those genes that are activated or suppressed in immune cells at various times after
      each dose of the HBV vaccine. The investigators will explore these vaccine-induced &quot;gene
      signatures&quot; to characterize the cellular functions associated with an effective immune
      response to HBV vaccination. The investigators hypothesize that many genes associated with
      innate and adaptive immune functions are important for an effective HBV vaccine response.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy volunteer without significant medical problems

          -  Willing to receive three doses of an FDA-approved Hepatitis B vaccine

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female &lt; 18 and &gt; 60 years of age

          -  Received any vaccine within a month prior to study vaccine

          -  History of Hepatitis B infection

          -  History of previous Hepatitis B vaccination(s)

          -  History of HCV infection or positive HCV antibody test

          -  Participation in another clinical study of an investigational product currently or
             within the past 90 days, or expected participation during this study

          -  Positive serum antibody against Hep B surface antigen and/or core Hep B core antigen

          -  HIV positive

          -  In the opinion of the investigator, the volunteer is unlikely to comply with the
             study protocol

          -  Any clinically significant abnormality or medical history or physical examination
             including history of immunodeficiency or autoimmune disease

          -  Is pregnant or lactating

          -  Currently taking systemic steroids or other immunomodulatory medications including
             anticancer medications and antiviral medications

          -  Any clinically significant acute or chronic medical condition requiring care by a
             primary care provider (e.g., diabetes, coronary artery disease, rheumatologic
             illness, malignancy, substance abuse) that, in the opinion of the investigator, would
             preclude participation

          -  Unable to continue participation for 30 weeks
