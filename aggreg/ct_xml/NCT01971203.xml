  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to determine whether quetiapine extended-release in
      combination with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is more effective than CBT plus placebo
      in treating depressive and anxiety symptoms in patients with both major depression and
      generalized anxiety disorder.  Approximately 64 individuals (adults 18-65) will be randomly
      assigned to treatment group for 16 weeks.  Weekly CBT sessions will be conducted lasting
      about 45 minutes and weekly visits with the study psychiatrist lasting about 20 minutes in
      which medication will be discussed.  Both clinician administered and self-report measures
      will be used to compare groups before and after 16 weeks.

      This study will evaluate the efficacy of quetiapine extended-release as adjunctive therapy
      to cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) compared to CBT plus placebo in the treatment of
      patients with comorbid major depression and generalized anxiety disorder.  We will also
      evaluate the quality of life in patients with comorbid MDD/GAD, the response and remission
      rates by treatment group, changes in sleep quality, and tolerability of adjunctive
      quetiapine to CBT.
