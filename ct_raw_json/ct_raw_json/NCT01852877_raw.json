Correctional case management is a\n      longer-term, more intense approach while transitional case management seeks to meet the\n      clients' immediate needs, link them to Ryan White case management, and then support the Ryan\n      White case manager in assisting these clients.  Correctional case management will be\n      compared to the standard of care for jail detainees, and to transitional case management for\n      persons leaving prison.  Outcomes of interest include, (a) HIV viral load and CD4 cell\n      counts over time, (b) adherence to medication, and (c) visits to medical providers.\n\n      Aim-3:  Evaluate the impact of an incentive for HIV-positive detainees released from jail to\n      visit an HIV service organization where they can be linked to medical care and case\n      management.  Outcomes of interest are essentially the same as Aim-2.\n\n      Aim-4:  Assess university-based telemedicine as means to improve care of state prison\n      inmates living with HIV.  Outcomes of interest include medication regimens, HIV viral load\n      and CD4 cell counts, and associated health conditions.\n\n      Aim-5:  Assess the uptake of partner notification and social network HIV counseling and\n      testing involving HIV-positive persons released from jail and prison as a means to extend\n      the reach of the 'seek, test, treat and retain' (STTR) model into the community.\n\n      Aim-6:  Assess the impact of this STTR model on community viral load in the six Chicago\n      community areas with the largest number of incarcerated persons.  Two outcome measures will\n      be used: mean and total HIV viral load."
