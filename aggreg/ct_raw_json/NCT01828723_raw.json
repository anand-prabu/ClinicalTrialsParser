Facial volume defects which could be treated with a total graft volume of between 1mL\n             and 50mL\n\n          4. BMI between and including 23 and 28\n\n          5. Able to understand and provide written and verbal informed consent\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          1. Currently taking or have taken NSAIDs within last two weeks or corticosteroids within\n             the last six weeks prior to screening\n\n          2. Diagnosis of any of the following medical conditions:\n\n               -  Active malignancy (diagnosed within 5 years), except for treated non-melanoma\n                  skin cancer or   other non-invasive or in-situ neoplasm\n\n               -  Active infection\n\n               -  Type I or Type II Diabetes\n\n          3. Subjects who are unlikely to comply with the protocol (e.g., uncooperative attitude,\n             inability to return for subsequent visits, dementia, and/or otherwise considered by\n             the Investigator to be unlikely to complete the study)\n\n          4. Subjects with a known drug or alcohol dependence within the past 12 months as judged\n             by the Investigator\n\n          5.

Any other disease condition or laboratory results that in the opinion of the\n             investigator may be clinically significant and render the subject inappropriate for\n             the study procedure(s), may alter the accuracy of study results, or increase risk for\n             subjects.\n\n          8. Subjects with life-expectancies less than 9 months\n\n          9. Subjects with known collagenase allergies\n\n         10. Subjects with idiopathic or drug-induced coagulopathy\n\n         11. Pregnant females\n\n         12. On radiotherapy or chemotherapy agents\n\n         13. Taking strong CYP450 inhibitors such as protease inhibitors (ritonavir, indinavir,\n             nelfinavir, saquinavir), macrolide antibiotics (clarithromycin, telithromycin),\n             chloramphenicol, azole antibiotics (ketoconazole, itraconazole) and nefazodone.\n\n         14.
