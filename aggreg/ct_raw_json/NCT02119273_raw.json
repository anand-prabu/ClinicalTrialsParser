Although strong evidence\n      supports the benefit of routine and perioperative oral corticosteroids for CRSwNP, there is\n      limited evidence to support their utility for CRSsNP. The investigators intend to perform a\n      randomized, double blind, placebo controlled clinical trial to investigate the impact of\n      steroids used within 2 weeks prior to surgery for CRSsNP. Patients with CRSsNP that present\n      to the investigators office will be included if they have failed maximal medical management\n      and have elected to undergo endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) after  July 1, 2014. The\n      investigators hypothesis is that oral corticosteroids given 2 weeks prior to surgery will\n      improve subjective and objective outcome measures."
