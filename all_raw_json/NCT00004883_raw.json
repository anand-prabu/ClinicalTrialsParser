Determine the duration of response in patients treated with this regimen. II. Determine\n      the toxicity of this treatment regimen in this patient population.\n\n      III. Assess levels of circulating HER2 and correlate with HER2 expression in this patient\n      population.\n\n      V. Correlate circulating HER2 levels with non-small cell lung cancer tissue HER2 expression.\n\n      OUTLINE:\n\n      Patients receive trastuzumab (Herceptin) IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1. Treatment continues\n      once a week in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed every 8 weeks until disease progression or death.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 84 patients (42 per stratum) will be accrued for this study\n      within 17.5 months."
