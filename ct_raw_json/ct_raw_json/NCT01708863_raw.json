            "textblock": "Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) is a severe form of congenital heart disease that\n      consists of multiple obstructions to flow through the left heart and aorta, as well as\n      hypoplasia of the left ventricle. Most patients require a three-stage surgical protocol\n      starting within days of birth. Stage I of this process is the Norwood reconstruction (within\n      the first few days of life), Stage II (usually required within 3-8 months) involves creation\n      of a direct connection between the patient's superior vena cava and the pulmonary arterial\n      confluence (bidirectional Glenn anastomosis), and the last stage is creation of a Fontan\n      circulation (typically within the first 2-4 years). This \"single ventricle\" approach\n      requires the right ventricle to perform as the only circulatory pump for the entire body.\n\n      Our long-term goal is to develop regenerative strategies to strengthen and augment the right\n      ventricular muscle of the single-ventricle heart following surgical palliation in HLHS\n      patients. To determine the safety and feasibility of a cell-based therapeutic intervention\n      at the Stage II surgery, we aim to document the natural history of post-surgical care in\n      HLHS patients having undergone standard of care with protocol specific follow-up over the\n      course of a 6-month period.\n\n      This prospective study will document the natural history in patients with HLHS after planned\n      Stage II surgical palliation with a focus on cardiovascular parameters within 6 months\n      following surgery in 10-20 patients."
