Patients then receive a subcutaneous\n      injection of interferon alfa three times a week for 3 weeks followed by one more week of\n      rest. Treatment is repeated for four courses.\n\n      Cohorts of 10 patients each receive escalating doses of interleukin-2 and interferon alfa\n      until a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which\n      no more than 3 of 10 patients experience dose limiting toxicity. Intrapatient dose\n      escalation occurs in courses 2-4, in the absence of dose limiting toxicity.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 40 patients will be accrued for this study."
