Patients with\n      responding disease may continue therapy.\n\n      Cohort of 4-6 patients receive escalating doses of monoclonal antibody anti-anb3 integrin\n      until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose\n      preceding that at which 2 of 4 or 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD\n      is determined, additional patients are treated at that dose in the phase II portion of the\n      study.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 4-24 patients will be accrued for phase I of this study and a\n      total of 40 patients will be accrued for phase II of this study."
