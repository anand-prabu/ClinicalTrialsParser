Participants will consume 6 g of beta-glucans daily (approximately 200 g of bread per day). Beta-glucans are natural polysaccharides found in grain endosperm and are mostly represented in oat and barley. Beta-glucans are linear homopolymers of D- glycopyranosyl residues with mixed linkage (1-4, 1-3)-\u03b2-D-glucans. Their molecular structure enable beta-glucans their functional action that mostly depends of their viscosity and solubility (1). Testing bread has integrated flour with high amount of barley beta-glucans (ReducholTM). Beta-glucans are concentrated in flour up to 15 % with dry milling, sieving and air classification of barley flour."

Moreover it is presupposed that two-month consumption of\n      beta-glucans will have influence on glucose metabolism and will consequently improve insulin\n      resistance within people with metabolic syndrome.

Participants will daily consume 200 g of bread\n      with high amount of beta-glucans.\n\n      Hypothesis:\n\n        1. Two-month consumption of beta-glucans alters composition of intestinal microbiota and\n           changes ratio of bacteria from phylum Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes. Furthermore\n           consumption of beta-glucans stimulates growth of beneficial intestinal bacteria from\n           genus Lactobacillus and Bifidobacteria and consequently effects production of short\n           chain fatty acids in population with metabolic syndrome.\n\n        2. Two-month consumption of beta-glucans has influence on glucose metabolism and\n           consequently improves insulin resistance within people with metabolic syndrome.\n\n        3. Two-month consumption of beta-glucans improves specific plasma lipid content in\n           population with metabolic syndrome.\n\n      Study will be designed as double blind, randomised, placebo controlled clinical trial and\n      performed regarding to CONSORT 2010 recommendations for randomised clinical trials. Patient\n      enrollment will be performed in several community health centres in Slovenia in association\n      with family medicine doctors. Appropriate patients with metabolic syndrome will be suggested\n      to participate in clinical trial. Candidates will be suggested to participate in a two month\n      study. If there will not be recruited enough participants for two month study they will be\n      suggested for participation in one month study. Candidates interested in participating in\n      study will be informed about study design and terms and conditions of study by main\n      investigator.\n\n      Study will be performed after successful recruitment of first 20 or more participants. Study\n      will be performed three times, so that 70 participants will be recruited in complete study.\n      Participants will consume bread with high beta-glucans content (around 3, 4 g beta-glucans\n      per 100 g of bread) during 8 week period. Before beginning of study participants will have\n      two week washout period without consuming any pre- and pro-biotics. They will remain their\n      usual eating habits during study period except taking any antibiotics or pre- and\n      pro-biotic. Participants will give blood and stool samples a day before intervention with\n      barley beta-glucans. Blood sampling will involve oral glucose test for insulin resistance\n      determination and sampling for specific lipid content determination. They will also have\n      option to give a blood sample for genetic investigation of genes associated with lipid\n      metabolism (apoE). Blood and stool sampling will be repeated day after intervention period.\n      The same parameters as before intervention period except genetic analysis will be\n      investigated. 72-hour dietary recall will be performed during intervention period\n      individually to evaluate daily nutrient and energetic input of each participant."
