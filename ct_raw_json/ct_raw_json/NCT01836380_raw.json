The images will be analyzed with Vascular Tools 5 image analyses software. Similarly, intima-media thickness will be measured at end diastole as previously described. The combination of ultrasound imaging of a common carotid artery with simultaneous tonometric-obtained arterial pressure waveforms from the contralateral artery permits noninvasive determination of carotid artery compliance. Arterial compliance is a function of the increase in arterial pressure and a corresponding increase in cross-sectional area.",

After cuff deflation, ultrasound-derived measurements of the brachial artery diameters and blood velocity will be taken for 3 minutes.
