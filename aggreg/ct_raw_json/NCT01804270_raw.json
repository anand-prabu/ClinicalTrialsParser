This study will be the first to use a randomized,\n      double-blinded, sham-controlled approach to the investigation of rTMS therapy for depressed\n      adolescents.  This approach will allow for the validation of rTMS treatment outcomes in the\n      depressed adolescent population in a scientifically rigorous manner.  The magnetic resonance\n      (MR) spectroscopy pattern of rTMS response will be analyzed according to previously\n      established protocols."
