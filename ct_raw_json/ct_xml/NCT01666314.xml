    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male patients 18 years or older

          -  Voluntary written consent must be given before performance of any study-related
             procedure not part of standard medical care, with the understanding that consent may
             be withdrawn by the patient at any time without prejudice to future medical care

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of prostate adenocarcinoma

          -  Prior surgical castration or concurrent use of an agent for medical castration (e.g.
             GnRH analogue)

          -  PSA ≥ 2 ng/mL at screening

          -  Progressive disease based on PSA and/or radiographic criteria

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior therapy with orteronel, ketoconazole, aminoglutethimide, or abiraterone.

          -  Known hypersensitivity to compounds related to orteronel, orteronel excipients,
             prednisone (or commercially available equivalent), or GnRH analogue.

          -  All antiandrogen therapy (including bicalutamide) is excluded within 4 weeks before
             the first dose of study drug. Any other therapies for prostate cancer, other than
             GnRH analogue therapy, such as progesterone, medroxyprogesterone, progestins
             (megesterol), or 5- alpha reductase inhibitors (eg, finasteride or dutasteride), must
             be discontinued 2 weeks before the first dose of study drug.

          -  Continuous daily use of oral prednisone (or commercially available equivalent), oral
             dexamethasone, or other systemic corticosteroids for more than 2 weeks within the 3
             months before screening (inhaled, nasal, and local steroids [eg, joint injection] are
             allowed).

          -  Prior chemotherapy for prostate cancer, with the exception of neoadjuvant/adjuvant
             therapy as part of initial primary treatment for local disease that was completed 2
             or more years before screening.

        Please note that there are additional inclusion and exclusion criteria. The study center
        will determine if you meet all of the criteria.

        Site personnel will explain the trial in detail and answer any question you may have if
        you do qualify for the study. You can then decide whether or not you wish to participate.
        If you do not qualify for the trial, site personnel will explain the reasons
