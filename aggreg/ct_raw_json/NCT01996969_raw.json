            "textblock": "Regorafenib is a multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor which has been shown to increase survival\n      in metastatic colorectal cancer patients who have progressed after prior standard\n      treatments.  Progression-free survival data suggest that there could be a distinct subgroup\n      of patients that may benefit from regorafenib. Therefore, it would be important to identify\n      predictive biomarker of efficacy of regorafenib. Considering that regorafenib is a\n      multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor, comprehensive approach is required to discover predictive\n      biomarker.\n\n      NGS-based sequencing allows generating large amount of data regarding multiple genes and\n      multiple genetic alterations within a single experiment. Also, it requires less amount of\n      DNA or tissue and cost compared to currently used individual gene testing techniques such as\n      direct sequencing or FISH. Moreover, superior sensitivity over Sanger sequencing can be\n      obtained by increasing coverage depth, especially in cases with low tumor purity. Wide range\n      of genes targeted by regorafenib and genes in the major oncogenic pathway of colorectal\n      cancer influenced by regorafenib can be efficiently assessed using NGS-based sequencing.\n\n      The aim of this study is to identify predictive biomarker of efficacy of regorafeinib in\n      metastatic, refractory colorectal cancer patients using NGS technology."

Patients who have withdrawn from standard treatment\n             due to unacceptable toxicity warranting discontinuation of treatment and precluding\n             retreatment with the same agent before progression of disease will also be allowed\n             into the study. Patients treated with oxaliplatin in an adjuvant setting who have\n             progressed during or within 6 months of completion of adjuvant therapy are regarded\n             as failure of oxaliplatin.
