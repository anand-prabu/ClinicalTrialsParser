  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to assess whether an electronic self-management tool,
      specifically an iPhone application entitled bant, can improve glycemic control in
      Adolescents who have Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) is among the most common chronic diseases affecting
      children, adolescents and adults.  While intensive patient self-management can optimize
      Blood Glucose (BG) to near-normal levels, it is a challenge for many TIDM patients to
      continuously achieve this. These difficulties are compounded in the adolescent population,
      who struggle with daily self-management and therefore may increase their risk of T1DM
      complications.

      Due to this observation an electronic self-management tool, in the form of an iPhone
      application called bant, was developed. This app guides the analysis of BG data and suggests
      changes in treatment, while also using social network and rewards to encourage and reinforce
      self-care behaviors, such as frequent self-monitoring of blood glucose levels (SMBG).  By
      primarily measuring changes in HbA1C levels, the study will assess if bant and its features
      are associated with improved glycemic control in the adolescents who use it.
