  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral neuropathy is a common complication of diabetes, and one of the strongest
      determinants of reduced health-related quality of life among people with diabetes.
      Neuropathy frequently presents with painful symptoms, activity limitation, insomnia,
      fatigue, and depressive symptoms. Anti-convulsants and tricyclic anti-depressants provide at
      least moderate pain relief for 25-50% of patients with painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN),
      but often decrease other domains of quality of life through adverse effects, such as dry
      mouth, dizziness, nausea, drowsiness, and urinary problems. Effective, non-pharmaceutical
      approaches for PDN are needed, particularly for low income and racial/ethnic minorities who
      are at highest risk of diabetes and related complications. Acupuncture is a promising
      treatment for PDN, but evidence is limited. To address the significant public health need
      related to pain management among underserved people with diabetes, this study proposes an
      innovative, group-based model of acupuncture for PDN at an urban safety net hospital.
      Forty-eight patients who have PDN will be enrolled and randomized to one of three arms: (a)
      usual care combined with 12 weeks of group acupuncture twice weekly, (b) usual care combined
      with 12 weeks of group acupuncture once weekly, or (c) usual care alone (16 in each group).
      The aims of the study are to determine the feasibility of group acupuncture for PDN among
      underserved patients with diabetes; to evaluate the preliminary treatment effects of group
      acupuncture on pain, health-related quality of life, depressive symptoms, sleep disturbance,
      nerve conduction velocity, and protective sensation; and to determine the optimal frequency
      of acupuncture treatments.

      The investigators hypothesize that compared to patients receiving usual care alone, patients
      who undergo weekly group acupuncture treatments will have:

        1. decreased pain intensity

        2. improved health-related quality of life

        3. improved sural nerve conduction velocity

    <description>Acupuncture will be delivered in a group setting, in a common space with multiple reclining chairs. The initial acupuncture treatment will include a one-on-one diagnostic interview with one of the study acupuncturists for up to 30 minutes, followed by administration of acupuncture needles retained for 20-40 minutes. For subsequent group acupuncture treatments, participants will have a 10-15 minute diagnostic intake with the acupuncturist, followed by administration of acupuncture needles retained for 20-40 minutes. Eight to twelve needles will be administered in acupuncture points selected based on a treatment manual developed for the study. All treatments will be administered using sterile, disposable, surgical stainless steel acupuncture needles.</description>
