Ivacaftor was also well tolerated, as evidenced by the rates and\n      reasons for premature discontinuation and results of safety assessments.\n\n      Ivacaftor (Trade Name Kalydeco; 150 mg tablets) was initially approved in the United States\n      for the treatment of CF in patients 6 years of age and older who have a G551D mutation in\n      the CFTR gene."
