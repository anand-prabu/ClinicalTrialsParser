  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the potential benefit of an individualized
      resistance exercise-training program during radiotherapy for patients with locally advanced
      head and neck cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer are treated with radiation therapy
      (with/without chemotherapy) to avoid large surgical procedures. However, definitive
      radiation treatments can cause side effects (like mouth sores, difficulty swallowing) that
      often cause weight loss. It has been shown that a significant percentage of the weight loss
      is due to loss of muscle mass. Resistance exercise training works to increase muscle
      strength and endurance by doing repetitive exercises with weights, weight machines, or
      resistance bands.

    <description>Lean body mass will be analyzed at baseline, 3, 5, and 7-weeks (representing the last week of cancer treatment and end of on-site RET), 11-weeks (first clinic follow-up) and 14-weeks (second clinic follow-up and end of home-based RET program) for patients on both arms of the study.</description>

    <description>Upper and lower body strength will be analyzed at baseline, 3, 5, and 7-weeks (representing the last week of cancer treatment and end of on-site RET), 11-weeks (first clinic follow-up) and 14-weeks (second clinic follow-up and end of home-based RET program) for patients on both arms of the study.</description>

    <time_frame>14 weeks</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The distance walked in six minutes at baseline will be compared to the distance walked at 14 weeks for both groups. These finding will then be compared between the groups.</description>

    <description>If you are randomized to the resistance exercise training (RET) program, you will undergo up to three 1-hour training sessions per week for 7 weeks during radiation therapy.
There will be up to 3 sessions per week lasting up to one hour, and will generally include a 10- minute warm-up, rest periods and 10 minute cool-down. The goal is to perform the exercises as tolerated in week 1 and increase intensity as the weeks progress. Weights will be added each week depending on your tolerance to them. Rest periods will be incorporated into the exercises as needed. The intensity and weights used will be customized to the individual. During the home program portion, you will be asked to keep a weekly log of your exercises and the trainer will call you weekly to go over the log and provide support. At week 11 the trainer will meet with you to go over your individualized program and review your technique.</description>
