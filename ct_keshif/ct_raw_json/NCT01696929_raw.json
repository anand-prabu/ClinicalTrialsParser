            "textblock": "This study is a Phase 1 clinical trail to determine the safety, tolerability, and efficacy\n      of Tocilizumab (Actemra) as an adjunct to antipsychotic medications in stable outpatients\n      with schizophrenia. Tocilizumab (structural formula C6428H9976N1720O2018S42) is a\n      recombinant humanized anti-human interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor monoclonal antibody of the\n      immunoglobulin (Ig) IgG1 subclass.  Tocilizumab is formulated as a concentrate for solution\n      for infusion, and will be administered by intravenous infusion.\n\n      The investigators propose an 8-week trial to determine the safety, tolerability, and\n      effectiveness of tocilizumab, given in addition to antipsychotic medications, in 10 stable\n      outpatients with schizophrenia. The investigators hypothesize that tocilizumab will be\n      associated with clinically significant improvement in cognition and total psychotic symptoms\n      over the course of the trial. Tocilizumab is administered as an intravenous infusion every 4\n      weeks. Following a screening evaluation, participants will receive two infusions of\n      tocilizumab, one at baseline and another at week 4 of the study. The investigators will\n      measure changes in cognitive function and symptoms over an 8-week period. Complementing\n      previous positive clinical trials of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, this would be a\n      \"proof-of-concept\" study that targeting specific cytokines is a viable treatment for\n      schizophrenia.\n\n      Interleukin 6 and its receptor were discovered and cloned at Osaka University, Japan, by\n      Tadamitsu Kishimoto in the 1980s. In 1997, Chugai Pharmaceuticals began the clinical\n      development of tocilizumab for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Clinical studies for\n      Castleman's disease and systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis started in 2001 and 2002,\n      respectively. Hoffmann-La Roche co-developed the drug due to a license agreement in 2003.\n\n      Data presented in 2008 showed the effectiveness of tocilizumab in combination therapy with\n      methotrexate for RA treatment. In further studies, it was effective and generally well\n      tolerated when administered either as monotherapy or in combination with conventional DMARDs\n      in adult patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis."

            "textblock": "Schizophrenia is a chronic, debilitating disorder with life-long consequences on affected\n      individuals and families. Schizophrenia is also associated with impaired cognition or\n      thinking, which persists despite currently available treatments, and is an important\n      determinant of quality of life and overall function. Associations between immune system\n      abnormalities and schizophrenia, in particular increased inflammation, are one of the more\n      enduring findings in the field. Four of six trials found that treatment with non-steroidal\n      anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) was associated with significant improvement in\n      psychopathology (1,2). Serum cytokine levels predicted response in two studies (3,4), and\n      another study found a trend for improved cognition (5) with adjunctive NSAID treatment.\n      These findings provide important empirical support for a pathophysiological role for\n      inflammation in a subset of patients with schizophrenia.\n\n      Cytokines are key regulators of inflammation that exert effects in the periphery and the\n      brain. IL-6 is a cytokine produced by peripheral blood leukocytes, and CNS microglia and\n      astrocytes. Serum IL-6 levels are increased in patients with schizophrenia, and two studies\n      reported significant positive correlations between IL-6 and total psychopathology at\n      baseline and following antipsychotic treatment (6). Schizophrenia is associated with\n      impaired cognition, which persists despite current treatments, and is an important\n      determinant of quality of life and overall function. In populations outside of\n      schizophrenia, higher serum IL-6 levels are associated with poorer cognition, cognitive\n      decline, and smaller hippocampal gray matter volume (7,8). In a first-episode psychosis\n      sample, IL-6 mRNA expression was a significant predictor of smaller left hippocampal volume\n      (9).\n\n      Several other lines of evidence provide a theoretical background for targeting IL-6 in\n      schizophrenia. Polymorphisms of the gene for IL-6 (10) and its receptor (11) have been\n      associated with schizophrenia. In mice, a single maternal injection of IL-6 during pregnancy\n      caused prepulse and latent inhibition deficits in the adult offspring (12). Prenatal\n      maternal infections are a replicated risk factor for schizophrenia (13). In a rat prenatal\n      immune activation model, adult offspring have increased serum IL-6 levels, at an age with\n      homology to the usual age of onset of schizophrenia, that are significantly decreased\n      following treatment with haloperidol (14,15). Another animal study found that\n      ketamine-induced neuronal production of IL-6 is responsible for the activation of brain\n      NADPH-oxidase and subsequent dysfunction of fast-spiking parvalbumin-expressing interneurons\n      (16). These findings provide further support for a potential role of IL-6 in the\n      pathophysiology of schizophrenia.\n\n      In our Preliminary Study, patients with schizophrenia, age 18-70 and taking non-clozapine\n      antipsychotics, had a fasting blood draw for serum cytokines, and assessment of\n      psychopathology, including cognition. Subjects were not taking NSAIDs, and had no history of\n      immune disorders, illicit drug use in the past month, or antibiotic use in the past 2 weeks.\n      In 39 patients, after controlling for potential confounding effects of age, sex, race,\n      smoking, BMI, SES, serum cortisol, psychotropic medications, IQ, and severity of\n      psychopathology, higher serum IL-6 levels predicted greater cognitive impairment, measured\n      by the Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia (BACS) composite score, in a linear\n      regression model (p=0.002, Figure 1). Higher IL-6 levels were also associated with\n      significantly lower scores on the Verbal Memory (r=-0.40, p<0.01) and Motor Speed (r=-0.42,\n      p<0.01) subtests of the BACS.\n\n      In the first year, one clinical trial is planned.  We will conduct an 8-week open-label\n      trial to determine the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of tocilizumab as an adjunct to\n      antipsychotic medications in 10 stable outpatients with schizophrenia.\n\n      Tocilizumab has not been used before in the treatment of schizophrenia, and using it this\n      way is experimental.  The risks that have been found in people with rheumatoid arthritis are\n      known, but there may be unknown risks when used in schizophrenia.  Clinically significant\n      adverse drug reactions include anaphylaxis (0.4%), infections (0.1-7.8%), intestinal\n      perforation, neutropenia (7.0%), and cardiac failure.  Known side effects of tocilizumab\n      that are common include: increase in hepatic enzymes (AST, ALT), hypertension, headache,\n      neutropenia, infusion-related reactions, upper respiratory tract infections, and\n      nasopharyngitis.\n\n      Less common side effects include: peripheral edema, dizziness, rash, increased total\n      cholesterol and LDL, hypothyroidism, diarrhea, abdominal pain, mouth ulcerations, gastric\n      ulcer, stomatitis, weight gain, gastritis, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, increased\n      bilirubin, conjunctivitis, nephrolithiasis, bronchitis, cough, dyspnea, herpes simplex. Rare\n      side effects include: cellulitis, fungal infections, diverticulitis, gastroenteritis, herpes\n      zoster, hypertriglyceridemia, malignancy (including breast and colon), multiple sclerosis,\n      otitis media, pneumonia, sepsis, tuberculosis, urinary tract infections, and varicella.\n\n      Subjects with schizophrenia will be accessed from outpatient psychiatry clinic at Georgia\n      Health Sciences University or other satellite collaborative sites. The study has 5 visits:\n      screening, baseline, and 2, 4, and 8 weeks. At Screening, all subjects will be administered\n      the evaluation to sign consent, informed consent, and the structured clinical interview for\n      DSM psychosis and affective disorders modules. We will perform a medical history and\n      physical exam, fasting labs (CBC, CMP, lipid panel, urinalysis, and urine drug screen\n      (UDS)), a tuberculin skin test, and a 12-lead electrocardiogram. At Baseline, we will\n      perform the PANSS, BACS, and Clinical Global Impressions scale (CGI), and draw blood for\n      IL-6 and high-sensitivity c-reactive protein (hsCRP). All subjects will receive a 4 mg/kg\n      infusion of tocilizumab, the recommended starting dose for adults with RA. We will contact\n      the subjects by phone on day 1 and 7 after the infusion to assess for any infusion-related\n      events. At Week 2 and 4, we will perform an interval history, physical exam, PANSS, BACS,\n      and CGI. Different versions of the BACS will be used to avoid practice effects. At Week 4,\n      we will obtain fasting labs (CBC, CMP, lipid panel, IL-6, hsCRP, and UDS), and subjects will\n      receive a 4 mg/kg infusion of tocilizumab, We will contact the subjects by phone day 1 and 7\n      after the second infusion to assess for any infusion-related events. At Week 8, we will\n      perform an interval history, physical exam, and administer the PANSS, BACS, CGI, and obtain\n      fasting labs (CBC, CMP, lipid panel, IL-6, hsCRP, and UDS). Patients will be withdrawn if\n      they meet any exclusion criterion at any time point."
