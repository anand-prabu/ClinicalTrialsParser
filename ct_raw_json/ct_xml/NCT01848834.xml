    <textblock>
      This study is being done to investigate the safety, tolerability and anti-tumor activity of
      pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in participants with advanced triple negative breast cancer (TNBC)
      (Cohort A), advanced head and neck cancer (Cohorts B and B2), advanced urothelial cancer
      (Cohort C), or advanced gastric cancer (Cohort D)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Amendment 2 of the protocol added a new study arm (Cohort B2) for participants with advanced
      head and neck cancer who will receive a lower dose of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) every three
      weeks (Q3W);  participants with programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1)-negative tumors will
      also be analyzed separately.
