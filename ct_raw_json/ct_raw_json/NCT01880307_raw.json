            "textblock": "1. Objective: The purpose of this study is to determine whether a top-down treatment\n           approach, prescribing infliximab and azathioprine at diagnose, yields better outcome in\n           comparison to the usual step-up treatment approach, starting with prednison and\n           azathioprine, in moderate-to-severe pediatric Crohn's disease (CD) patients.\n\n        2. Sample size: We will include 90 (2 x 45) patients, so at least 80 patients will be\n           available for evaluation at 52 weeks. With these numbers a difference of 50% and 82% (=\n           32) can be shown at a power of 80% (2-sided \u03b1 0.05; nQuery Advisor). This difference is\n           feasible as in a retrospective study on infliximab step-up vs top-down in pediatric\n           Crohn's disease steroid free remission in the step-up arm in 5 out of 11 (45%) patients\n           was observed vs in 15 out of 18 (83%) in the top-down arm(1).\n\n        3. Study design: an international open-label randomised controlled trial\n\n        4. Study population: Children (age 1-17 yrs) with new-onset, untreated, CD with\n           moderate-to-severe disease activity Intervention: Patients will be randomized to either\n           top-down IFX treatment or conventional step-up treatment.\n\n        5. Main study parameters/endpoints: The primary endpoint at 52 weeks is steroid free\n           clinical remission. The secondary endpoints, amongst others, will be mucosal healing at\n           10 weeks assessed by endoscopy and prevention of complications (fistulas, strictures,\n           need for surgery). Endoscopy at 52 weeks will be performed to assess mucosal healing in\n           case of persisting complaints.\n\n        6. Nature and extent of the burden: In total, approximately 8 study visits will take\n           place. During each visit physical examination will take place. Patients are requested\n           to collect a stool sample twice. Blood draws will be performed when patients undergo\n           venous puncture for routine procedure anyway, in total 6 times. Patients will undergo\n           ileocolonoscopy under general anaesthesia at week 10. During ileocolonoscopy mucosal\n           biopsies of ileum and colon will be taken.\n\n        7. Potential risks and benefit associated with participation: Ileocolonoscopy is a safe\n           procedure. The short-term risks of IFX treatment are the risk of infections and\n           immunogenicity. The long-term risks of IFX treatment are currently unknown. It is\n           likely that patients in treatment arm 2 eventually also will be treated with IFX, but\n           in a later stage of the disease. The benefit with participation is the higher\n           likelihood of early achievement of mucosal healing in treatment arm 1: top-down IFX\n           treatment which may well prevent complications such as growth failure and fistulas or\n           strictures that require surgery. Pediatric CD has a more severe disease course than\n           adult CD, as illustrated by a higher upper gastrointestinal involvement and more\n           extensive disease. Active CD during childhood often leads to growth failure and/or\n           delay of pubertal development. Moreover, short disease history and a younger age at\n           diagnosis are possibly related to a better efficacy of IFX. Therefore, top-down IFX\n           might be even more beneficial in pediatric than in adult patients."
