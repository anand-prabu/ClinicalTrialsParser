  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted in two parts. The first (Part A) will be an open label single
      dose escalation part beginning with the proposed starting dose level of GSK2398852 as 5
      milligram (mg) [approximately equivalent to 0.1 mg/kilogram (kg)]. The next escalation dose
      levels are proposed as 1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg. GSK2315698 will be
      administered at variable doses until the concentration of the serum amyloid P component
      monoclonal antibody (SAP mAb) has fallen below 100 nanogram/millilitre (ng/mL). Decisions
      about these next dose levels will be made following safety review of the prior subjects'
      data; dose levels may be changed (increased and lowered) and dose levels may be repeated
      depending on the observed safety such that Part A extension study may be performed. In
      addition, pharmacokinetics of GSK2315698 (SAP depleter) and GSK2398852 (anti-SAP mAb), and
      circulating SAP concentrations will be assessed. Dose escalation in Part A will continue to
      the highest well tolerated dose or the highest allowable dose. Subjects will be closely
      monitored and will undergo Equilibrium contrast Magnetic Resonance Imaging (EqMRI) including
      organ volume, Elastography and Liver Biopsy if required.

      Part B will be a randomized partially blinded part with the principal objective of assessing
      the dose response of the GSK2398852 in more detail. Subjects will be assigned to one of
      approximately 5 dose groups from Part A. The precise selection of numbers of subjects and
      dose levels will be informed by the results from Part A.
