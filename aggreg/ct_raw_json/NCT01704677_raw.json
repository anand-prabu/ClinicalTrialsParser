            "textblock": "During the past 25-30 years, surgery with total disc replacement (TDR) has become an option\n      for a selection of patients with chronic low back pain (LBP) traditionally treated\n      conservatively or operated on with spinal fusion. Randomized trials comparing TDR with\n      fusion have found the clinical outcome of TDR at least equivalent to that of fusion, and the\n      only study comparing TDR to non-surgical treatment (The Norwegian TDR study) concludes that\n      TDR is significantly more effective than multidisciplinary rehabilitation (REHAB) after 2\n      years. However, the long-term effects of TDR in terms of clinical results, costs,\n      reoperation- and revision rate, degenerative changes and prognostic factors have not been\n      investigated in high quality prospective trials. This is very much required since TDR\n      surgery is offered a great number of patients world wide, and is associated with high\n      complexity and risk of serious complications and difficult revision. Hence, the overall aim\n      of the present study is to evaluate the long term (eight years follow-up) effect of The\n      Norwegian TDR study where TDR surgery were compared to modern multidisciplinary\n      rehabilitation in patients with chronic low back pain and localized degenerative disc\n      changes."

There are no differences in incidence and degree of disc degeneration at adjacent level\n           or facet joint degeneration at index level between groups (radiological analysis).\n\n        2.

There is no difference in cost effectiveness between surgery and REHAB 8 years after\n           inclusion to the study.\n\n      Statistical analysis:\n\n      The investigators will use the same analysis as for 2-years results: two-way ANOVA, mixed\n      model, regression analysis. p<0.05 will be considered statistically significant\n\n      Aditionally analysis (not conducted at 2 years):\n\n        1. cross-overs will receive last value before cross-over/fusion surgery\n\n        2. survival analysis\n\n        3. pelvic anatomy / sagittal balance (defined by lumbar lordosis, pelvic tilt, pelvic\n           incidence angle and sacral slope) will be included in the predictor analysis"
