            "textblock": "The prosthetic suspension plays a pivotal role in an amputee's comfort. It can also\n      significantly impact an amputee's limb health. If the prosthesis is not held securely to the\n      amputee's limb, relative movement between the limb and prosthetic interface can cause\n      bruising, skin irritation and skin breakdown. These poor outcomes are uncomfortable and can\n      lead to much more serious health conditions. A positive solution to creating secure and\n      comfortable suspension is the use of a vacuum suspension socket. The vacuum pressure assists\n      in preventing movement in the socket. The clinical benefits associated with vacuum\n      suspension include volume retention, increased proprioception, secure suspension, and\n      frequently reported observations of wound healing. However, the long term effects of vacuum\n      suspension on circulation remain undetermined or undocumented.\n\n      This study examines a vacuum suspension system on the health of the residual limb (amputated\n      limb). A vacuum socket creates a vacuum between the rigid prosthetic socket and prosthetic\n      liner which is sealed to the socket. Therefore, vacuum is not directly applied to the skin\n      of the residual limb."
