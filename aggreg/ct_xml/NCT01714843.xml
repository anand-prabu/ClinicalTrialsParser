      This study is a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, comparative
      study to investigate dose-responses of efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of ASP0456 in
      patients with constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-C) according to the
      Rome III Diagnostic Criteria (2006 revised edition, established by the Rome III Committee)
      after oral administration of ASP0456.

             or watery during the 3 months before the screening examination.

          -  Patients who had pancolonoscopy or contrast enema (or sigmoidoscopy) after the onset
             of IBS symptom and had no organic changes.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with other concurrent diseases that may affect the assessment of abdominal
             pain/discomfort

          -  Patients with blood pressure, pulse rate, clinical laboratory test, or 12-lead ECG at
             the time of screening examination that was rated as Grade 2 or greater on the
