The training procedure is designed to modify automatic approach responses for\n      positive social stimuli. Previous research has shown that a single administration of\n      approach-positive AAT influences social behavior in the laboratory. The goal of this study\n      is to examine the effects of a four-session AAT procedure on measures of positive\n      social-emotional functioning. The investigators hypothesize that individuals assigned to the\n      approach-positive AAT condition will demonstrate larger increases in positive affect and\n      improvements in social relationship functioning from pre- to post-assessment compared to\n      those assigned to the control condition."
