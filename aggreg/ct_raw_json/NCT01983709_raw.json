Investigators\n      plan to systemically infuse MSCs 4, 6 or 8 days prior to enrolled subjects' planned\n      prostatectomies. Investigators will then quantify the relative amount of donor MSC DNA to\n      recipient DNA present in patients' explanted prostate specimens. This will be accomplished\n      via BEAMing digital PCR. This trial will provide the foundation for future studies aimed at\n      engineering MSCs to deliver a toxin to sites of metastatic prostate cancer."
