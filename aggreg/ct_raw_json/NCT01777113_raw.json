Subject will walk on the treadmill performing three 4-minute steps. The speed of each step will be determinate by the self-selected speed of the subject (obtained through 6MWT). The steps will be 70% of the self- selected speed, 100% and 130%. Throughout the test, ventilatory parameters and heart rate will be collected breath-by-breath using a Quark gas analysis system. The walking energy cost will be calculated according to the formula (O2cost= [VO2/kg walking - VO2/kg rest]/speed).",
