  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A brain-computer interface (BCI) is a system that provides a separate output pathway for
      neurological signals whereby they can be interpreted to determine the user's intended
      cognitive action. Utilizing EEG-based  sensorimotor rhythms (SMRs) generated in the motor
      cortex has allowed subjects to control virtual computer cursors in up to three dimensions by
      simply imagining the movement of a specified body part. Nevertheless, the scalp EEG signals
      are smeared by the volume conduction effect and measurement noise.

      The PI's hypotheses include: (1) The use of advanced signal processing techniques will
      better reveal characteristics of EEG signals that represent the underlying motor cognitive
      function of the subject; (2) BCI systems based on SMR generated using motor imaginations
      will allow effective control of a virtual object in real time; (3) EEG imaging techniques
      will provide insight into the areas of cortical activation during a motor imagery task that
      can be utilized to increase the spatial resolution of non-invasive BCI's. Overall, these
      hypotheses all fall under an overarching hypothesis that EEG-based virtual object control
      will reveal optimal motor imagination tasks best used in a BCI.

      The goal of the present study is to explore advanced signal processing techniques that will
      better reveal characteristics of EEG signals that represent the underlying motor cognitive
      function of the subject, and conduct experiments to better control an virtual object on the
      computer screen including a cursor or a helicopter.

      The primary objective of this study is to test the above hypotheses (1) and (2) in a healthy
      subject population.This study will determine the ability of subjects with full cognitive
      function to control a non-invasive brain-computer interface by imagining a particular
      movement. Using non-invasive methods, we will investigate the neural processes that occur
      during the motor imagination tasks associated with controlling a virtual object. Using a
      variety of motor imaginations, we will determine which tasks are best used for BCI control
      by quantitative means of BCI performance and neurological dynamic system analysis.

      Subjects for this study will be healthy, English speaking adult volunteers (18-64 years old)
      with no history of mental illness, neurological deficit, or traumatic brain injury.
