Pressure ulcers result in significant  pain, changing quality of life, and often\n      leading to significant morbidity and prolonged hospital stays, and ultimately increased the\n      healthcare cost.\n\n      According to the International Pressure Ulcer Prevalence Survey, the prevalence of hospital\n      acquired pressure ulcers in the United States was 13.5% in 2008 and 12.8% in 2009.  This\n      survey also indicated that the highest rate of pressure ulcers is in the long term acute\n      care population (22%)."
