    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study, called MOVE-PD, is to investigate how individuals with
      Parkinson's disease (PD) and chronic constipation (CC) respond to RM-131 as compared to
      placebo. The study will look at how well RM-131 affects the frequency of spontaneous bowel
      movements over a 14-day period. The study will also evaluate the safety and tolerability of
      the study drug and evaluate whether the study drug relieves the uncomfortable GI symptoms
      related to chronic constipation in patients who are unsatisfied with other therapies they
      have tried for constipation.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Able to provide written informed consent and be willing and able to comply with study
             procedures.

          -  Diagnosis of Parkinson's disease

          -  Diagnosis of chronic constipation (CC), including experiencing constipation for ~12
             or more weeks in the preceding 12 months.

          -  Regular treatment for chronic constipation during the last 6 months, and
             dissatisfaction with current treatment for CC, after treatment with at least 2
             regimens for constipation (see note at end of this section).

          -  Stable medication history defined as no changes in regimen for at least 2 weeks prior
             to the baseline period

          -  Body mass index of 18-40 kg/m2

          -  Mini-mental status exam (at screening) ≥26

          -  Female patients must have negative serum or urine pregnancy tests and must not be
             lactating.  For females able to bear children, a hormonal (i.e., oral, implantable,
             or injectable) and single-barrier method, or a double-barrier method of birth control
             must be used throughout the study.  A vasectomized partner will be allowed as one in
             conjunction with another single-barrier method.

          -  Female patients unable to bear children must have this documented in the case report
             form(i.e., tubal ligation, hysterectomy, or post-menopausal [defined as a minimum of
             one year since the last menstrual period]).  Post-menopausal status will be confirmed
             by follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) in women less than 60 years of age

        Note the following medications are allowed:

          -  Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), SNRI, and tricyclic antidepressants
             are permissible at stable doses.  All medications shall be reviewed and dis/approved
             by the investigator on a case-by-case basis.

          -  Benzodiazepines are permissible at stable doses

          -  Stable doses of antacids, NSAIDS, Cox-2 inhibitors, calcium supplements, thyroid
             replacement, estrogen replacements, low-dose aspirin for cardioprotection, and birth
             control (but with adequate back up contraception as drug interactions with birth
             control have not been conducted) are permissible

          -  Dopamine agonists and amantadine allowed if on a stable dose

          -  Deep brain stimulation is allowed.

        Exclusion Criteria:

                  erythromycin, narcotics, and anti-cholinergics (except as protocol defined
                  rescue medications).

               -  GABAergic agents

          -  History of recent major surgery (within 60 days of screening)

          -  Acute or chronic illness or history of illness, which in the opinion of the
             Investigator, could pose a threat or harm to the patient or obscure interpretation of
             laboratory test results or interpretation of study data such as frequent angina,
             Class III or IV congestive heart failure, moderate impairment of renal or hepatic
             function, poorly controlled diabetes, etc.

          -  History of symptomatic orthostatic hypotension or significant history of dizziness

             abnormalities (including prolonged QTc &gt; 500 msec) or abnormal blood pressure at
             screening except minor deviations deemed to be of no clinical significance by the
             Investigator

          -  Acute GI illness within 48 hours of the baseline period

          -  History of major GI surgery, except that patients with uncomplicated appendectomy or
             cholecystectomy are allowed.

             in the present study

          -  Any other reason, which in the opinion of the Investigator, would confound proper
