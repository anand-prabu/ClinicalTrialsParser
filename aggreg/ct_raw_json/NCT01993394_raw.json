The protocol aimed at mimicking a routine\n      peacetime flight in combat aircraft, and included 10-min exposure to +1.4 - +3.5 Gz.\n      Subjects were exposed three times to this sequence, breathing air, 44.5% O2 or 100% O2.\n\n      Ten volunteers wearing anti-G trousers participated in the study. The Ethics Committee\n      Ile-de-France III and the French National Agency for Drug Safety (ANSM) approved the\n      protocol (number 2009-A01092-55).\n\n      Three different imaging techniques, electrical impedance tomography (EIT), pulmonary\n      ultrasound and chest SPECT/CT were used and compared. EIT enabled ventilation monitoring in\n      the human centrifuge, whereas pulmonary ultrasound and SPECT/CT gave functional and\n      topographical information before and after exposure to +Gz accelerations. EIT analysis\n      focused on regional ventilation, SPECT on global lung ventilation and perfusion, CT on the\n      presence of atelectasis, and pulmonary ultrasound analysis looked for comet tails in 64\n      chest areas. Arterial blood pressure was recorded continuously by finger\n      photoplethysmography. Cardiac output and stroke volume were computed from these recordings,\n      using three different algorithms. Echocardiography was used as reference non-invasive\n      technique for stroke volume determination and performed before and after exposure to +Gz\n      accelerations."
