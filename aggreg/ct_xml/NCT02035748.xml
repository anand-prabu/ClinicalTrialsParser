      The purpose of this study is to observe the anatomical and functional outcomes of
      ocriplasmin  (JETREA®) over a 6-month follow-up period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be recruited from approximately 90 centers in approximately 11 countries
      across Europe and Canada. After receiving a single intravitreal injection as per country's
      product label (Day 0), subjects will be followed for a 6-month period (Day 180).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of vitreomacular traction/symptomatic vitreomacular adhesion (VMT/sVMA),
             with evidence of focal VMT visible on Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography
             (SD-OCT).

          -  Read, sign, and date an Institutional Review Board/Ethics Committee-approved informed
             consent form.

          -  Other protocol-defined inclusion criteria may apply.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Women of childbearing potential if pregnant, breastfeeding, or not in agreement to
             use adequate birth control methods to prevent pregnancy throughout the study.

          -  Hypersensitivity to ocriplasmin or any of the JETREA excipients.

          -  Active or suspected intraocular or periocular infection.

          -  Presence of Epiretinal Membrane (ERM) over the macula at baseline.

          -  Broad VMT/VMA &gt;1500 microns at baseline.

          -  History of laser photocoagulation to the macula in the study eye.

          -  Any relevant concomitant ocular condition that, in the opinion of the investigator,
             could be expected to worsen or require surgical intervention during the study period.

          -  Macular hole of &gt;400µm diameter in the study eye.

          -  High myopia in the study eye.

          -  Pseudo-exfoliation, Marfan's syndrome, phacodonesis or any other finding in the
             Investigator's opinion suggesting lens/zonular instability.

          -  Aphakia.

          -  History of retinal detachment.

          -  Diabetic retinopathy, ischaemic retinopathies, retinal vein occlusions.
