Maximum tolerated\n      dose, dose limiting toxicity and the activity of this combination will be assessed.\n\n      This chemotherapy regimen is a two-pronged attack at the way cancer cells replicate. R115777\n      is a compound that may inhibit cancer cell growth by interfering with the p21 ras oncogene,\n      while topotecan, a topoisomerase-1 inhibitor, works on cancer cells not subject to control\n      by the ras oncogene. Animal studies suggest that the combination may be synergistic.\n      Another advantage is that R115777 can be taken by mouth."
