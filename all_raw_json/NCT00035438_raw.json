The approach is\n      to conduct a 12-week, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, parallel group pilot\n      trial with 30 subjects in each of two arms. The Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale\n      (Y-BOCS) will be the primary measure for evaluating OCD. An intention-to-treat analysis will\n      be done to compare the two arms."
