  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Borderline personality disorder is a severe psychiatric disorder marked by emotional
      instability, difficulty with interpersonal relationships, and self-harming behaviors.
      Despite receiving psychotherapy for borderline personality disorder, studies show that
      patient recovery is slow, and there is a high rate of self injury and suicide attempts early
      in treatment. There is thus a clear need to provide therapies to augment psychotherapy. We
      will conduct a pilot trial to determine whether a 6-week Central Meditation and Imagery
      Therapy (CMIT) is feasible for subjects with borderline personality disorder to undergo when
      added on to psychotherapy treatment. CMIT is a non-validated therapy that combines
      principles of mindfulness with meditation techniques and guided imagery. Sessions led by a
      trained clinician in a group setting once a week, and participants are asked to complete
      daily home practice.

      The trial will involve 16 participants, all currently undergoing psychotherapy for
      borderline personality disorder. Participants will be randomly assigned to either a CMIT
      group that lasts 6 weeks, or a wait list group. Those in the wait list group will be able to
      receive CMIT after 6 weeks. All participants will continue to receive psychotherapy
      throughout the trial.

      During the trial, we will also obtain preliminary data to help understand whether CMIT may
      result in psychological benefits for participants. This will include measuring the pulse in
      order to determine variation in beat to beat intervals of the heart during psychological
      tests, and filling out questionnaires before and after participation in CMIT.
