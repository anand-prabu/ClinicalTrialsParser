    <textblock>
      This study consists of phase  Ia and Ib portions for patients with solid tumors.

      Phase Ia portion is the standard 3+3 dose-escalation design with 0.1mg/kg, 0.5mg/kg and
      1.0mg/kg of Mogamulizumab.

      Phase Ib portion is the randomized study comparing 0.1mg/kg and tolerated dose of
      Mogamulizumab based on the  phase Ia portion to pursue safer and immunologically more
      efficient dose.
