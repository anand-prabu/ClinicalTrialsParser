  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial is to investigate the safety and tolerability of BI
      1060469 in healthy male and female subjects after oral administration of repeated rising
      doses of 3 mg, 10 mg, 25 mg, 75 mg, 150 mg and 250 mg qd. of 1 day followed by 14 days and
      in asthmatic male and female subjects after oral administration of repeated rising doses of
      25 mg and 150 mg qd of 1 day followed by 28 days.

      Secondary objectives are the exploration of the pharmacokinetics (PK) including dose
      proportionality, dose linearity after single and multiple dose segments, pharmacodynamics
      (PD) of BI 1060469 and to describe the PK/PD relationship.

             healthy asthmatic subjects

          -  Females (of non-child bearing potential) and males, who have a diagnosis of asthma by

             hours after the last use of short acting bronchodilator at Visit 1 or on the day of
             randomisation.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Any finding in the medical examination (including BP,PR,or ECG) deviating from normal
             and judged clinically relevant by the investigator other than asthma up to GINA
             treatment step 2 or atopic diseases

          -  Repeated measurement of systolic blood pressure greater than 140 mm Hg, diastolic
             blood pressure greater than 90 mm Hg, or pulse rate outside the range of 50 to 90
             mmHg

          -  Any laboratory value outside the reference range that the investigator considers to
             be of clinical relevance

          -  Serum creatinine laboratory value out of the normal range

          -  glomerular filtration rate (GFR) according to CKD-EPI-Formula (Chronic Kidney Disease
             Epidemiology ) &lt; 60 ml/ min at screening

          -  Current or history of relevant kidney, urinary tract diseases or abnormalities (i.e.
             nephrolithiasis, hydronephrosis, acute or chronic nephritis, renal injury, renal
             failure, infections)

          -  Any evidence of a concomitant disease judged clinically relevant by the investigator
