  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The BCPP study is designed to test the hypothesis that implementing an enhanced combination
      prevention package which includes provision of ART as prevention for HIV-infected
      individuals with HIV-1 RNA ≥10,000 copies/ml will impact the HIV/AIDS epidemic by
      significantly reducing population-level, cumulative HIV incidence in a defined geographic
      area over a period of 3 years and will be cost-effective.

    <description>Rapid scale-up of HTC services during two annual HTC campaigns, with a target of ensuring &gt;90% of adults aged 16-64 have documentation of their HIV-infected status or documentation of an HIV-negative test in the preceding 12 months.
Rapid scale-up of ART for adults with CD4≤350 cells/µL, or WHO Stage III/IV, with a target of ensuring that &gt;90% of these ART-eligible adults are receiving ART.
Rapid scale-up of ART for adults with a viral load ≥10,000 copies/ml, CD4&gt;350, and WHO Stage I/II with a target of ensuring that &gt;80% of these ART-eligible adults are receiving ART.
Rapid scale-up of male circumcision service uptake, with a target of ensuring &gt;80% of HIV-negative men (aged 16-49) are circumcised.
Rapid scale-up of PMTCT services, with a target of ensuring &gt;90% of pregnant women with HIV receive recommended PMTCT antiretrovirals before 28 weeks gestation, and &gt;90% continue ART indefinitely after starting ART for PMTCT if otherwise ineligible for treatment.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Protocol #1 - Baseline Household Survey (BHS):  Permanent or part-time study
             community resident in any of the 30 study communities; Botswana citizen or spouse of
             a Botswana citizen; able to provide informed consent if ≥18 years old, or able to
             provide assent to complement a guardian's permission, if a minor (aged 16 or 17).

          -  Protocol #2 - Closed clinical cohort:  Eligible household members identified during
             the initial year BHS who are permanent study community residents, intend to be
             permanent study community residents for the next 12 months, with HIV-1 infection, CD4
             &gt;350 cells/µL and WHO State I/II, ART naïve, and able to provide informed consent if
             ≥18 years old, or able to provide assent to complement a guardian's permission, if a
             minor (aged 16 or 17).

          -  Protocol #3 - Expanded treatment cohort:  HIV-infected persons in Combination
             Prevention communities identified after the initial BHS who are not yet on ART, have
             CD4&gt;350 cells/µL and WHO Stage I/II, and 1) have HIV-1 RNA&gt;10,0000 copies/mL or 2)
             are pregnant, and are able to provide informed consent if ≥18 years old, or able to
             provide assent to complement a guardian's permission, if a minor (aged 16 or 17).
