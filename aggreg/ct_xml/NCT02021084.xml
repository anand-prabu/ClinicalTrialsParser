    <textblock>
      Colchicine is the drug of choice to treat patients with Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF ),
      some of the patients treated with colchicine may suffer from gastrointestinal (GIT) adverse
      effect such as diarrhea and abdominal pain especially in the higher dose.

      5-10% of the patients with FMF that have been treated with colchicine may have partial or no
      response to this therapy.

      Aim of our study: the aim of our study is :.1to evaluate the efficacy of probiotics in
      reducing the number of adverse effect in patients with FMF that are being treated with
      colchicine and suffering from GIT adverse effect.

      .2 To evaluate the efficacy of probiotics in reducing the number of FMF attacks in children
      with FMF that has been treated with colchicine with only partial response.

      Methods: the study will be done among children (5-17 years old) with FMF that are currently
      followed in the pediatric rheumatology clinic at Mayer children  hospital Israel Haifa  that
      are being treated  with colchicine and suffering from either GIT adverse effect or partial
      response to colchicine.

      The study is design to be double blind  placebo control, in the first 3 month patients will
      be with no therapy and will be required to record all  there FMF episodes and their GIT
      adverse effect, in the second period  the patients will be randomly divided into  two groups
      1.patients that will received  placebo (group 1) and the 2. Probiotics group - patients will
      received probiotics (Bio -25 including  11 types of bacteria L.acidophilus, B.bifidum ,
      L.rhamnosus, L.lactis, L.casei, B.breve, B.thermophilus, B.longum, L.paracseis, L.plantarum,
      B.infantis), both for three month, during this period patient will be required to record
      their gastrointestinal  symptoms and other symptoms that may be related to FMF.
