This trial aims to determine whether the\n      combination of oxaliplatin and weekly docetaxel warrants further investigation in a formal\n      phase III trial. The combination of epirubicin, oxaliplatin and capecitabine will be the\n      comparator arm for this evaluation.\n\n      Primary Objective:\n\n      Determine in a randomised study if the response rate to docetaxel and oxaliplatin (ElTax) is\n      comparable to epirubicin, oxaliplatin and capecitabine (EOX) and warrants further evaluation\n      in advanced gastro-oesophageal cancer.\n\n      Secondary Objective:\n\n      To examine the effect of treatment on time to progression, progression free survival,\n      overall survival, quality of life, and the associated toxicity from treatment."
