Patients are randomized to receive\n      interleukin-2 (IL-2) with or without histamine dihydrochloride.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive IL-2 subcutaneously (SC) once daily and histamine\n           dihydrochloride SC twice daily on days 1-5 of weeks 1-3 followed by 2 weeks of rest.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive IL-2 as in arm I. Treatment continues for a minimum of 2\n           courses in both arms in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients (30 per arm) will be accrued for this study."
