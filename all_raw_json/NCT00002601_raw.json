Combining more than one drug and combining chemotherapy with\n      peripheral stem cell transplantation may allow the doctor to give higher doses of\n      chemotherapy drugs and kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of high-dose combination chemotherapy and\n      peripheral stem cell transplantation in treating patients who have advanced or recurrent\n      sarcoma."

Determine the feasibility of sequential high-dose chemotherapy with\n      ifosfamide and doxorubicin followed by melphalan and cisplatin, each followed by autologous\n      peripheral blood stem cell support, in patients with high-risk or advanced sarcomas. II.\n      Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients. III. Determine response rate\n      and disease-free and overall survival in these patients treated with this regimen.\n\n      OUTLINE: Beginning at least 4 weeks prior to the start of chemotherapy, patients receive\n      filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously daily until the completion of peripheral blood stem cell\n      (PBSC) harvesting. Beginning 5 days after the start of G-CSF, PBSCs are collected over\n      several days. Patients who do not mobilize sufficient cells undergo bone marrow harvest.\n      Regimen A: Patients receive high-dose ifosfamide IV and doxorubicin IV continuously over 96\n      hours on days -8 to -4. 12.5% of PBSCs or bone marrow are reinfused on day -2 and 37.5% are\n      reinfused on day 0. Patients receive G-CSF IV beginning on day 0 and continuing until blood\n      counts recover. Regimen B: Beginning at least 4 weeks after day 1 of Regimen A, patients\n      receive high-dose melphalan IV followed immediately by cisplatin IV on days -11 and -4.\n      Patients receive G-CSF IV on days -10 to -6. 12.5% of PBSCs or bone marrow are reinfused on\n      day -3 and the remaining 37.5% are reinfused on day 0. Patients receive G-CSF IV beginning\n      on day 0 and continuing until blood counts recover. Patients are followed monthly for 1\n      year, every 3 months for 1 year, and then as needed for 3 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years."
