The\n      optimal cytotoxic treatment for this group of patients remains uncertain.  Single agents\n      which are most effective include doxorubicin and ifosfamide, but objective response rates\n      and progression-free survival times remain modest. There is clearly a need to improve\n      treatment options for liposarcoma. Eribulin, a antimicrotubule agent that targets the\n      protein tubulin in cells, interfering with cancer cell division and growth , has\n      demonstrated activity in STS. Therefore, it is reasonable to explore whether other\n      anti-microtubule agent like  cabazitaxel have a role in STS. Cabazitaxel has been shown to\n      be a relatively safe, effective and tolerated. This drug has been approved by FDA for\n      prostate cancer. The main objective of this trial is to determine whether cabazitaxel or\n      prolonged infusional ifosfamide demonstrate sufficient antitumor activity for liposarcoma."
