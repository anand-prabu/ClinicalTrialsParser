  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to better understand how the use of antibiotics changes
      micro-organisms in the intestines. The change to micro-organisms in the intestines may
      change the body's vaccine immune response and alter the effectiveness of the IIV (seasonal
      flu) vaccine.

      In particular, the investigators will be looking at certain markers in blood after
      vaccination with IIV (seasonal flu vaccine) with or without the use of antibiotics before
      vaccination.

      There will be two randomized groups. Group A will start taking antibiotic by mouth 3 days
      prior to vaccination and continue taking antibiotics the day of vaccination and one day
      after vaccination for a total of 5 days. Group B will only receive the IIV (seasonal flu
      vaccine) and will not take any antibiotics.

      The investigators hope to enroll 22 subjects at Emory.
