The research results will be used to determine if the type of bacteria\n      present in the intestines play a role in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease.\n      Patients with coronary artery disease will be enrolled for up to 12 weeks.   Patients will\n      take the probiotic for 6 weeks. Following the 6 week period there is a washout period of 4\n      weeks, and an optional antibiotic study called vancomycin. Patients will take the vancomycin\n      for 10 days.  Blood vessel function will be measured by ultrasound before and after the\n      probiotic supplement and vancomycin antibiotic.  Blood will also be taken before and after\n      to evaluate for markers of inflammation."

Subjects will be allowed to take their blood pressure\n      medication on the morning of their screening visit, but not the mornings of any of the other\n      study visits to limit the acute influence  of these medications on endothelial function. If\n      the potential  participant qualifies for the study,  he will return 1 week after the screen\n      for a study visit(Visit 2) where he will turn in his stool sample, undergo initial tests of\n      endothelial function and receive 3 week supply of GoodBelly Probiotic. After 3 weeks he will\n      have to return (Visit 3) for another 3 week supply of his probiotic.  After a total of 6\n      weeks of taking the probiotic he will have to return (Visit 4) with his stool sample. He\n      will be asked to fast for 6-8 hours prior to the visit to limit the acute dietary influences\n      on vascular endothelial function. During Visit 4, endothelial function will determined by\n      brachial artery reactivity testing  His stool samples will be collected and blood samples\n      will also be taken at this visit for systemic measurements inflammatory markers.
