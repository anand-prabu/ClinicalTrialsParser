      The purpose of this study is to find out the safety and effectiveness of 1064 Q-Switch Laser
      Therapy compared to Glycolic Acid Chemical Peels for the treatment of melasma.

      Participants in this study will be patients at the dermatology clinic who are clinically
      diagnosed with at least a 2X2 cm patch of melasma on each side of their face (forehead or
      cheek). Starting at 2 weeks before treatment (week 2), both sides will be pretreated and
      primed with 4% hydroquinone with, if necessary, 2.5% hydrocortisone cream BID. On the
      treatment day (2-weeks) and 6-weeks one half of the subject's face will receive glycolic
      acid peels and the other half of the face will receive  1064nm  Q-switch laser. This study
      is a pilot study designed to determine feasibility of these procedures.

    <description>The primary outcome was a blinded rating of the treatment area (1064nm Q-switch Laser Versus Glycolic Acid Peels) with the best overall cosmetic appearance. A dermatologist will blindly evaluate the treated areas of each side from live subjects at baseline and on the final follow up visit (week 10).</description>
