  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if zinc therapy: (1) strengthens your intestine's
      defensive barrier preventing damaging substances from reaching your liver, (2) decreases
      liver injury (inflammation, oxidative stress, cell death) and scarring, and (3) improves
      your liver-related health. Based on our preliminary animal data and other published reports,
      we expect zinc therapy to achieve all of these goals. Zinc is affordable, available over the
      counter or by prescription, and has an excellent safety profile. Positive results from this
      study will show that zinc is a significant therapy for millions of Americans with alcoholic
      liver disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Two-thirds of Americans consume alcohol, and an estimated 14 million Americans are
      alcoholics.  It has been estimated that 15%-30% of heavy drinkers develop advanced Alcoholic
      liver disease (ALD).  The prevalence of ALD in the United States is conservatively estimated
      at 2 million persons.  Nearly 50% of liver-related deaths and 30% of hepatocellular
      carcinomas in the US are due to alcoholic cirrhosis.  Despite recent advances in our
      understanding of ALD, there is currently no FDA approved medication for any stage of ALD.
      Zinc sulfate is inexpensive, available over the counter, and has an excellent safety
      profile.  If zinc positively influences the mechanisms postulated to play a role in human
      ALD, this affordable treatment would become relevant to millions of people worldwide.
