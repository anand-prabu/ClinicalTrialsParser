      This study will evaluate the recovery from copperhead snake bite in patients with mild or
      moderate venom effect. Potential subjects will receive CroFab antivenom or placebo.  The
      trial is conducted by emergency room doctors, toxicologists, or surgeons at hospitals in
      regions where copperhead bites are common. After blinded treatment and discharge, the
      subject returns to the clinic for follow-up assessments at day 3, 7, 14, and 28 after snake
      bite.  The subject will also be called by telephone for follow-up assessments on day 10, 17,
      and 24 after snake bite. The purpose of this study is to compare recovery in copperhead
      snake bite patients treated with antivenom versus placebo (no active drug) as measured by
      the Patient Specific Functional Scale (PSFS) at Day 14 follow-up.

          -  Clinical evidence of mild or moderate venom effect (limb swelling and/or tenderness)
             is present (Venom effects need not be progressing.)

          -  Patient willing and able to complete follow-up schedule of assessments

          -  Patient is able to read, comprehend and sign the IRB approved consent document(s)
