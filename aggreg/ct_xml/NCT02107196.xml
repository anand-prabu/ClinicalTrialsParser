    <textblock>
      Irritable Bowel Syndrome with diarrhoea (IBS-D) is a functional gastrointestinal disorder
      characterised by chronic or recurrent abdominal pain or discomfort and diarrhoea. This trial
      aims at the evaluation of the efficacy and safety of oral ibodutant 10 mg once daily  as
      compared to placebo in women with IBS-D over a 12-week treatment period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study evaluates the efficacy and safety of ibodutant 10 mg, given once daily for 12
      weeks in comparison with placebo in female IBS-D patients. Randomisation to ibodutant and
      placebo will be 1:1.  Efficacy is evaluated in terms of weekly response for abdominal pain
      intensity and stool consistency over 12 weeks of treatment in at least 50% of the weeks of
      treatment.

      The clinical phase of the study comprises up to 2 weeks of screening for patient's
      eligibility, a 2-week run-in period (treatment-free) for IBS severity assessment, a 12-week
      double-blind treatment period, a 4-week randomised withdrawal (RW) period and a 2-week
      safety follow-up, resulting in a maximum 22-week overall duration of the study for each
      patient.

      Patients report their IBS-related symptoms daily in a telephone-based electronic diary from
      run-in until end of treatment.
