  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to test whether treatment with kudzu extract will increase the rate
      at which alcohol enters the brain as measured by rapid proton magnetic resonance
      spectroscopy (1H-MRS).

             chemistries, no psychopathologies)

          -  Body Mass Index between 18-30, inclusive

          -  Age 21-40 years

          -  Moderate alcohol drinkers (less than 20 drinks/week)

          -  Have a stable living situation with current postal address

          -  No contraindications to MR scanning (see MR scanning exclusion criteria below)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Concurrent diagnosis of Axis I disorder

          -  Current or past alcohol dependence; may meet criteria for alcohol abuse.  Other drug
             dependence acceptable only if greater than 3 years.

             acceptable if the use criteria is met.

          -  Maintained on an antipsychotic or antidepressant medication; taking prescription
             medications except certain short-term anti fungal agents and some tropical creams for
             dermal conditions.

          -  Tobacco use greater than 10 cigarettes per day

          -  History of major head trauma resulting in cognitive impairment or history of seizure
             disorder
