  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This primary aim of this study was to critically assess whether or not sweat water content
      and sodium concentration were acutely regulated by dynamic changes in antidiuretic hormone
      (arginine vasopressin or AVP) acting on the Vasopressin 2 receptor (V2R) during exercise.
      Secondary aims were to evaluate running performance and core temperature to further
      characterize the role of AVP in the coordinated balance of fluid and temperature homeostasis
      during exercise. The primary hypothesis was that activation of the V2R in sweat glands would
      result in water reabsorption and fluid conservation during endurance exercise.

      Ten healthy habitual runners (&gt; 50km running per week) between 18-60 years of age
      participated in this double blind randomized control trial. Each subject presented to the
      exercise lab on four separate occasions. Trial 1 was a familiarization trial to determine
      each subject's maximal aerobic capacity and peak treadmill running speak (VO2 Peak test).
      Trials 2, 3 and 4 utilized the same exact protocol, differing only in pharmacological
      intervention. In a randomized, double-blind order (both participant and investigator blinded
      to the intervention), either a placebo pill, the V2 receptor antagonist tolvaptan (Samsca™,
      30mg tablet), or the V2 receptor agonist desmopressin (DDAVP™, 0.2mg tablet) was ingested
      along with the CorTemp™ Core Temperature Sensor two hours before commencement of the
      Exercise Trial with 240mL of bottled water. The exercise protocol consisted of 60 minutes of
      treadmill running at 60% of peak speed (steady-state) followed by a performance test (the
      VO2 Peak test). Blood, saliva and urine, were collected before the exercise trial (baseline)
      and again after both the steady-state run and performance runs. Sweat was obtained from
      sweat patches after both the steady-state and performance runs. Core temperature, fluid
      intake, performance time, body weight, thirst and sodium palatability ratings were also
      assessed. Free access to water was allowed during the trial and all urine produced during
      the trial was measured and collected. The main outcome measure was sweat sodium
      concentration.

    <description>Measurement of salivary sodium concentration will allow us to determine if the V2R antagonist, agonist and placebo interventions activate aquaporin-5 (AQP5) water channels that are also located in sweat glands. If the V2R acts on the sweat glands through AQP5, there should be parallel changes in sweat, urine and saliva sodium concentrations with each pharmaceutical intervention.</description>

    <description>This study was a double-blind randomized controlled trial in which all ten subjects participated in three trials under three separate pharmacological interventions: V2R antagonist, agonist and placebo conditions.  A standardized exercise protocol was performed in the laboratory, separated by one week.  Each subject served as his or her own control and the key which identified which intervention was utilized in the exact order (all tablets customized to appear identical) was unlocked only after data collection was completed. Therefore, all ten subjects participated in a total of thirty intervention exercise trials after the initial treadmill familiarization trial was completed.</description>
