Define the safety\n      profile of every 3 week dosing of irinotecan in these patients. III. Characterize the\n      pharmacokinetic profile of this regimen in these patients. IV. Assess evidence of antitumor\n      activity in these patients. V. Determine the efficacy of irinotecan in these patients as\n      measured by 6 month progression-free survival and objective tumor response. VI. Evaluate\n      further the safety profile of irinotecan in these patients during phase II study.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients are stratified according to concurrent\n      enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (EIAEDs)(yes vs no). Group A (without EIAEDs): Patients\n      receive irinotecan IV over 90 minutes on day 1, followed by up to 3 weeks of rest. Group B\n      (with EIAEDs): Patients receive the same treatment but dose escalation is performed in\n      cohorts of 3 patients. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is defined as the dose below that at\n      which 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicities. The Phase I MTD is the starting\n      dose recommended for use in the Phase II portion of the study. Treatment continues every 3\n      weeks for up to 12 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n      Patients are followed every 2 months for 1 year, every 3 months for 1 year, every 4 months\n      for 1 year, then every 6 months until disease progression. Patients are then followed every\n      4 months for survival.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Up to 30 patients will be accrued for phase I within 10 months. A total\n      of 48 patients will be accrued for phase II within 6-8 months."
