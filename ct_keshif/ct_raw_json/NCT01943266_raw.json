            "textblock": "Minimal data are available on protein requirements throughout the lifespan. Currently\n      available recommendations are based on nitrogen balance data. The limitations of the\n      nitrogen balance method have been well described. Importantly, nitrogen balanced\n      underestimates requirements.\n\n      The current dietary reference intakes (DRI) requirement for healthy adult males is based on\n      the reanalysis of the nitrogen balance date from Young and Scrimshaw. This data was\n      reanalyzed statistically by Rand et al.  and he  concluded that the protein requirement of\n      healthy adults was 0.65 and 0.83 (mean and RDA) g/kg/day of good quality protein. Using\n      indicator amino acid oxidation (IAAO), our group estimated the protein requirement of young\n      men (mean age 27 years)  to be 0.93 and 1.2 g/kg/day (mean and RDA).\n\n      Currently there are no studies on protein requirement in the elderly. In a recent nutrition\n      survey conducted by national health and nutrition examination survey (NHANES), the authors\n      concluded  that adults between the ages of 51 - 70 years old consumed an average on 1.0\n      g/kg/day  (ideal body weight) of protein which represents about 15 % of calories. Depending\n      on the calculations used for ideal body weight some older adults could be getting higher or\n      lower than requirement.  There is no scientifically derived protein estimate for older\n      adults. Therefore there is a need to measurer protein requirement in that population.\n\n      The goal of this study therefore is to measure the protein requirement of male elderly\n      subjects between the ages of 65 - 75 years using the IAAO technique."
