Leukocyte activation is an important and\n      obligatory aspect in the process of atherosclerosis. Complement system is another important\n      inflammatory component in atherosclerosis, which becomes activated in the postprandial\n      phase.\n\n      In this study, we will investigate both inflammatory systems in healthy volunteers and\n      patients with T2DM on insulin therapy and hyperlipidemia (both familial hyperlipidemia (FH)\n      and familial combined hyperlipidemia (FCH)) during an OGTT."
