One of the results of chorioamnionitis is brain injury of the fetus.\n      Fetus' brain is highly vulnerable and could be harmed even by mild inflammation before\n      fulminant infection is developed. The aim of this study is to identify, as early as,\n      possible signs of brain injury. S100B protein will be used as a marker for brain insult.\n      S100b level were associated with the occurrence and size of stroke and brain trauma in\n      adults and children. Moreover, S100B crosses the membrane and its level in women with\n      preterm labor was associated with brain injury of preterm infant.\n\n      The study question is whether the levels of S100B in women with early amniotic fluids\n      breakdown are associated with future brain injury of the infant, as assessed by head\n      ultrasound and neurological examination."
