This recommendation has been challenged by a\n      number of alternative dietary strategies, particularly low-carbohydrate diets. In several\n      recent weight loss studies insulin resistant adults had more success with low- vs.\n      high-carbohydrate diets, in contrast to insulin sensitive adults who had either more success\n      or comparable success with the low-fat diets. The investigators plan to enroll 80 people\n      with a wide range of insulin sensitivity/resistance. After determining their insulin\n      resistance status, the investigators will split them in the middle and randomly assign them\n      to one of four groups: (1) Low-Carbohydrate/Insulin Resistant (LC/IR); (2)\n      Low-Carbohydrate/Insulin Sensitive (LC/IS); (3) Low-Fat/Insulin Resistant (LF/IR); and (4)\n      Low-Fat/Insulin Sensitive (LF/IS) (20 people/group). The purpose of this study is to\n      determine whether weight loss success can be increased if one follows the dietary approach\n      appropriately matched to their insulin resistance status.\n\n      --------------------------------------------------------------------------------"
