            "textblock": "Viral infections are common complications after allo-HSCT. With wide use of HLA-mismatch,\n      unrelated and cord blood donors as alternative sources of hematopoietic stem cells, and\n      anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) as the standard prophylaxis of graft versus host disease\n      (GVHD) in HLA-mismatch and unrelated donor transplantation, allo-HSCT recipients are at\n      increasing risk for viral infections.\n\n      Till now, CMV remains one of the most important viruses and causes of death in the\n      recipients of allo-HSCT. Approximately 75% of CMV-seropositive recipients develop CMV\n      reactivation, and 20-30% of these patients develop CMV disease without intervention.\n      Ganciclovir is the first-line treatment of CMV diseases.  However, bone marrow suppression,\n      which is the main and common side effect, limits the utility of ganciclovir in allo-HSCT\n      recipients. Besides,  ganciclovir and other antiviral agents resistance has been reported up\n      to 28%. Since it has been known that specific immune response to CMV is important to control\n      reactivation, CMV-specific CTL has been used in prophylaxis and treatment of CMV viremia in\n      several studies. In view of the fact that CMV infects 70-80% of the healthy individuals,\n      most donors have CMV-specific cytotoxic T cell (CTL) in lymphocytes in theory. Therefore, we\n      hypothesise that DLI might be effective to treat CMV infection. In addition, Mesenchymal\n      stem cells (MSCs) are a form of multipotent adult stem cells that can be isolated from bone\n      marrow (BM), adipose tissue, and cord blood. In vivo experiment showed that MSCs have\n      antimicrobial activity.\n\n      In this trial, we will use DLI or DLI combined with MSCs in the recipients with refractory\n      CMV infections."
