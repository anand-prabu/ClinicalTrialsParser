            "textblock": "Although infection with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) can result in acute hepatitis; it more\n      commonly progresses to chronic hepatitis.  The acute process is most often asymptomatic.\n      Acute HCV typically leads to chronic infection. Chronic HCV infection is usually slowly\n      progressive. Approximately 5 to 20 percent of chronically infected individuals develop\n      cirrhosis over a 20-30 year period of time. Chronic HCV is the most common cause of chronic\n      liver disease, cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and the most frequent indication for\n      liver transplantation in the United States.\n\n      Screening for chronic HCV infection is crucial because chronic HCV infection is often\n      asymptomatic, effective treatment is available, and untreated disease carries a high risk of\n      morbidity and mortality.  Expert opinion, recommendations, and guidelines for HCV screening\n      do not all agree.  All guidelines recommend screening patients at increased risk for HCV\n      (ie: typical risk factors). In 2012, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\n      recommended screening all persons born between 1945 and 1965. At least two studies suggest\n      that screening persons born between 1945 and 1964 or 1946 to 1970, respectively, is\n      cost-effective.  The studies estimated that if patients found to be HCV positive were\n      treated with pegylated interferon, ribavirin, and direct acting antiviral therapy (for\n      patients with HCV genotype 1), it would cost $35,700 to 37,700 per quality adjusted\n      life-year.  Screening based upon a birth cohort in patients without risk factors may lead to\n      more false positive results.\n\n      Currently only 1 % of patients in the birth cohort of 1945-1965 who cared for by\n      Intermountain Healthcare providers have been screened. Ambulatory care physicians are not\n      effectively screening patients.  It is unclear whether screening based on risk factors alone\n      versus screening based upon risk factors and birth cohort most effectively manages the\n      burden of chronic HCV infection for patients managed by Intermountain Healthcare providers.\n      It is possible that the Intermountain Healthcare population differs in risk from the U.S.\n      population,making guideline application less certain.\n\n      A well-designed prospective cohort study is needed to understand the risks and benefits of\n      different HCV screening strategies on diagnostic yield and clinical outcomes.\n\n      The investigators hypothesize that screening based on a person's history of risk factors\n      will detect chronic HCV infection in 2.7 % of the  population tested; this would be\n      according to national average.  The investigators further hypothesize that screening based\n      on birth cohort and risk factors will identify roughly the same percentage in the tested\n      population. The investigators anticipate usable data within three months which should give\n      us data to describe and publish the effectiveness of different screening strategies.\n\n      The investigators will identify patients with chronic HCV infection through this initial\n      study who now require treatment and management. The investigators believe this group could\n      be followed inexpensively for clinical endpoints for many years. This would then\n      definitively define the effectiveness of screening strategies based on good evidence. No\n      study has evaluated clinical outcomes associated with the different screening strategies for\n      chronic hepatitis c virus infection."

Listing of risk factors for each patient and analysis of risk factor tools to discover\n           new risk factors and causes.\n\n      B. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE (Limit two pages)\n\n      There has been much published in regards to recommendations to screen patients for HCV.\n      Much of the attention is due to new treatments. Specific antiviral treatments to genotype 1\n      of HCV have received much attention.  The reported sustained viral response in HCV genotype\n      1 with these new agents have been impressive but currently at great expense(12). With these\n      new advances it has become paramount to identify patients early to avoid great morbidity and\n      early mortality.\n\n      There are also disparate recommendations on screening for HCV between the Centers for\n      Disease Control and Prevention and the United States Preventive Task Force. The American\n      Association for the Study of Liver Diseases has sided with the CDC.  The CDC has a new birth\n      cohort recommendation in addition to risk factor screening versus the USPTF recommendation\n      to do screening based upon risk factors only.\n\n      Given conflicting guidelines, tailored evidence to provide guidance to Intermountain\n      clinicians would be useful; especially as the Intermountain population may differ from the\n      U.S. population in risk making application of national guidelines more uncertain. This study\n      will delineate the most effective screening approach for the population served, identify the\n      rates of false positive tests, and delineate the costs of the screening strategies as\n      recommended.\n\n      Currently only one percent of patients in the birth cohort of 1945-1965 and cared for by\n      Intermountain Healthcare providers have been screened.  Ambulatory practitioners are not\n      effectively screening patients or may not believe these patients to be at sufficient risk to\n      merit screening.  It is unclear whether screening based on risk factors alone, or screening\n      based upon risk factors and birth cohort recommendations most effectively manages the burden\n      of chronic HCV infection for patients managed by Intermountain Healthcare providers.\n\n      A well-designed prospective cohort study is needed to understand the risks and benefits of\n      different HCV screening strategies on diagnostic yield and clinical outcomes (9).\n\n      We hypothesize that screening based on established risk factors will detect HCV 2.7 % of the\n      population tested. We believe that adding the proposed birth cohort in addition to risk\n      factors for screening will not increase the number of those we identify with chronic HCV.\n\n      Once we have generated a registry of patients through this Initial study we believe this\n      group could be followed inexpensively for clinical endpoints for many years to come.  We\n      would have a group of newly diagnosed chronically infected patients with HCV, identified by\n      the CDC and USPTF guidelines.  We then could ensure evidence base HCV treatment and follow\n      endpoints of chronic liver disease and its complications.  We would then be able to know if\n      screening for hepatitis C virus is beneficial to the patient we care for and cost effective.\n\n      We have 885,000 patients of intermountain healthcare born between 1945 and 1965. Only one\n      percent of them have been screened for HCV. In those screened 11% had positive HCV tests.\n      The national average is 2.7 percent.  This is not based upon any clear screening program. We\n      appear to be screening for hepatitis C well below the national average.  The state of Utah\n      Epidemilogist's data indicate that 1% of Utahns have hepatitis C.\n\n      If we tested per CDC recommendation we would expect to diagnose 20,000 additional patients\n      with HCV.  If each individual were screened and those who tested positively received liver\n      biopsy and treatment we could expect this to cost the system close to 3 billion dollars.\n\n      In summary, it is likely that many people with chronic HCV have not been identified and\n      treated.  In this study, we will determine the effectiveness of each screening strategies.\n      This will inform clinicians about how to screen know how to screen for chronic HCV based on\n      evidence and not recommendations. Further as we follow the newly diagnosed patients we will\n      determine if our screening was effective following our evidence based management. We will\n      also be able to measure costs as opposed to just calculations based on quality of life year.\n\n      C. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN AND METHODS (Limit five pages)\n\n      We have identified 9 internal medicine offices in the Salt Lake area.  We will divide the\n      clinics into three groups (three clinics per each group).  We are currently performing a\n      prestratification of the groups to make sure there isn't an age, sex, or racial divergency.\n      Group 1 would be our control group.  The providers at these facilities will perform any\n      hepatitis C virus screening as they would normally.  Group 2 would provide risk factor\n      screening per USPTF guide lines.  Group 3 would use the CDC's recent birth cohort\n      recommendations in addition to risk factor screening.  The only exclusion criteria is if the\n      patient has a test positive for hepatitis C virus or they give a positive history regarding\n      infection.\n\n      We would like to identify 2000 patients for each strategy in 3 months.  We would do this by\n      asking office manager and physicians of clinics to let their office staff give a screening\n      strategy form to each patient and ask them to be a part of this study.  We will create\n      sheets the patients can complete while they are waiting for their appointment.  The clinical\n      staff would then be asked to interpret and order the appropriate testing.\n\n      We will place the strategy on a one sided sheet of paper that can be given to all internal\n      medicine patients between the age of 18 and 75.\n\n      I have enlisted the help of Dr. Greg Elliott, Scott Stevens, and Scott Woller and others in\n      an steering committee to offer expert advice and guidance.\n\n      Strategies:\n\n        1. Screen for hepatitis C as per regular practice as is occurring in their clinics\n           currently.\n\n             1. Form would ask them if they ever had been tested for Hepatitis C.\n\n             2. The rest of screening would be left to the provider's discretion.\n\n        2. Screen for hepatitis C as per conventional risk factors:\n\n           a. A sheet with these risk factors will be provided i.

If the HCV RNA is negative and EIA is +, will order a HCV RIBA. (not\n      PCR); if RIBA is negative this indicates a false positive EIA test.\n\n      Those patients with positive results would be notified by their primary physicians.  We\n      would provide a decision tree for work up and treatment of a newly found infection.\n      Patients can be referred to gastroenterologists, hepatologists, and primary care providers\n      who treat chronic hepatitis C virus infection.\n\n      F. IMPACT (Limit one page)\n\n      Hepatitis C virus is the leading cause of chronic liver disease in the United States, and is\n      the leading reason for liver transplantation.  Recent advances, in treatment , have made\n      Hepatitis C virus chronic infection curable for many patients.  It is important to identify,\n      treat, and attempt to cure these patients, many of whom don't know they are affected.\n\n      Recommendations have been made to try and accomplish this.  There needs to be evidence to\n      guide our screening and therapy. With this study we could provide evidence to Intermountain,\n      Utah, and I believe the greater medical community.  In a few months we could have data that\n      is publishable having compared the screening recommendations for HCV.  We would know which\n      if any of the screening strategies are superior in identifying chronic HCV.\n\n      We would do a follow up study, hopefully with additional funding from an outside group,\n      having identified new carriers of chronic Hepatitis C. We would provide current evidence\n      based antiviral treatments that are available based on genotype.  This would allow us to see\n      the comparative progression of liver disease with its subsequent complications in the three\n      screened groups.  We could follow these groups for up to 20 years and have evidence that\n      would guide screening and treatment for HCV."
