The study will investigate\n      the efficacy of sodium cridanimod in conjunction with progestin therapy in a population of\n      patients with recurrent or persistent PrR-negative endometrial cancer.\n\n      The PrR-negativity is determined based on immunohistochemistry (IHC). Eligible patients will\n      be enrolled into the study and administered sodium cridanimod  in combination with megestrol\n      acetate or medroxyprogesterone acetate. Objective responses will be assessed at 12 week\n      intervals. Confirmation of objective response will be performed \u22654 weeks. Patients will be\n      followed for 12 months or to disease progression whichever occurs first.\n\n      Important objectives of the study are  to investigate the effect of sodium cridanimod in\n      conjunction with progestin therapy on the level of PrR in tumor tissue and how this\n      correlates to efficacy. To accomplish this objective, some of the patients enrolled in the\n      study will undergo two tumor biopsies that will allow measurement of PrR levels (using IHC\n      semi-quantitative method or/and quantitative PCR) in the tumor tissue before the treatment\n      and after 4 weeks of therapy."
