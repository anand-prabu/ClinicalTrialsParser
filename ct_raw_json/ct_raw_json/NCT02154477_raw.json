            "textblock": "Over the last few years, studies have shown that men with type 2 diabetes sometimes develop\n      a condition called hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism (HH).  People with this condition produce\n      little or no sex hormones.  Obesity and metabolic syndrome are also associated with HH.\n      Research suggests that insulin in the brain may benefit the glands that release these\n      hormones. During this study, subjects will spray a small amount of insulin into their\n      nose.This will increase insulin concentrations in the brain. The purpose of this study is to\n      find out the effect of one dose of intranasal insulin on release of LH (a sex hormone) in\n      obese diabetic men with HH."

            "textblock": "Studies over the last few years have clearly established that at least 25% of men with type\n      2 diabetes have subnormal free testosterone (T) concentrations in association with\n      inappropriately low LH and FSH concentrations. These patients thus suffer from\n      hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism (HH).  Obesity and metabolic syndrome are also associated\n      with HH. Animal studies and in vitro data have shown that insulin action and insulin\n      responsiveness in the brain are necessary for the maintenance of the functional integrity of\n      the hypothalamo-hypophyseal-gonadal axis. Insulin concentrations can be increased in the\n      brain by delivering insulin intranasally with vianase device. The aim of this project is to\n      study the effect of one dose of intranasal insulin on release of LH in obese diabetic men\n      with HH. 15 obese men with type 2 diabetes and low free T along with normal LH\n      concentrations will be recruited for the study. The study will be carried out at the\n      clinical center of TTUHSC-PB (Odessa campus). There will be two study visits, each\n      comprising of blood tests every 15 minutes over 6 hours. 40 IU of intranasal insulin or\n      saline will be given after a baseline period of blood sampling of 2 hours. Student's t-test\n      will be used to compare the change in LH concentrations after intranasal saline or insulin."
