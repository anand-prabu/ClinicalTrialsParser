The patient must have sufficient auditory capacity at enrollment, with or without\n             hearing aids, in the Investigator's judgment to complete the required protocol\n             testing, and be compliant with wearing the aids on scheduled study visits.\n\n          4.

The patient has a general conceptual ability score (GCA) or a developmental quotient\n             on the cognitive scale below 55 at Screening.\n\n          3. The patient is participating in an interventional clinical trial or has participated\n             in an interventional clinical trial within 30 days prior to enrollment; participation\n             in non interventional observational studies is permitted."
