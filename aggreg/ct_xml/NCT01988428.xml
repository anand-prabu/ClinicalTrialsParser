      Sepsis is one of the most frequent reasons for referral to emergency departments (EDs)
      worldwide. The incidence of sepsis is likely to rise in the upcoming years. Sepsis has a
      tendency to become more serious when left untreated with a high mortality rate, exceeding
      even those of myocardial infarction and stroke. Therefore, much effort has been put in to
      start with appropriate therapy as early as possible. Early goal-directed therapy (EGDT) in
      the emergency department with fluid resuscitation, administration of
      vasopressors/vasodilators and intravenous antibiotics in patients with severe sepsis and
      septic shock has indeed decreased mortality substantially. Emergency medical personnel have
      already made a significant difference in improving care for patients with  acute coronary
      syndrome, multiple trauma and stroke. Patients with severe sepsis or septic shock could also
      benefit greatly from timely pre-hospital care. Earlier recognition and initiation of
      treatment by emergency medical personnel may improve survival even more.

      Interestingly, the first hour of ED presentation seems to be the most critical hour.
      Administration of antibiotics and fluid resuscitation in the pre-hospital setting will
      reduce the time to administration substantially. In adults, to the best of our knowledge, no
      studies on the effect of pre-hospital administration of antibiotics have been performed. In
      children with meningitis, some uncontrolled studies show contradictory results, most
      probably due to bias by severity. We propose a non-blinded randomised multi-centre clinical
      trial study on the efficacy of early, pre-hospital intravenous administration of broad
      spectrum antibiotics (ceftriaxone), which are effective against a wide variety of infectious
      pathogens that cause most common community-acquired infections) in patients referred to the
      ED with suspected severe sepsis or septic shock.

      Objective: To evaluate whether early, pre-hospital administration of antibiotics, together
      with training of ambulance personnel in recognizing and initiating treatment reduces 28-day
      mortality in patients referred to the ED with suspected severe sepsis or septic shock Study
      design: Non-blinded randomized multi-centre clinical trial nested within a step wedge design
      Study population: All patients above the age of 18 years, with suspected severe sepsis or
      septic shock and transferred to the ED by ambulance, are eligible for study inclusion
      Intervention: prehospital antibiotics (ceftriaxone 2000 mg intravenously) Main study
      parameters/endpoints: 28-day mortality, hospital length of stay,  admission to intensive or
      medium care unit (ICU/MC). Follow  up of  one year. QoL after six and twelve months after
      discharge.

      Introduction Sepsis is one of the most common and life-threatening diseases in the world,
      causing more deaths than AIDS, breast cancer and prostate cancer put together (8-10).
      Despite the fact that the mortality of sepsis is ten times higher than myocardial infarction
      and to five times higher than stroke, relatively little attention is given to sepsis
      (23-25). In recent years successful clinical care management pathways have been developed
      for patients suffering from a myocardial infarction, stroke or a trauma.  Even though there
      is strong evidence in scientific literature to support the need for a series of
      time-dependent actions, for sepsis this is still not the case.

      On 13 September 2012, the first ' World Sepsis Day ' was held with as main objective : 'to
      increase awareness for sepsis as a potentially lethal condition, which should be considered
      as a medical emergency ' (26). Prompt recognition and treatment are extremely important for
      improving survival, while patients who survive sepsis can still continue to suffer from
      physical or psychological symptoms. The likelihood and severity of these complications
      depends on a number of factors including the severity of sepsis and the length of stay in
      hospital stay and in ICU.

      Definition Sepsis is defined as a proven or strongly suspected infection that is associated
      with a 'systemic inflammatory response syndrome(SIRS) (29,30). SIRS exists if at least two
      of the four criteria are met: abnormal body temperature, increased heart rate (over 90 beats
      per minute), increased respiratory rate (more than 20 per minute) and an abnormal white
      blood cell (WBC) count. There are different degrees of sepsis on the basis of severity.
      Sepsis may develop to severe sepsis or septic shock, if treatment is not timely initiated.
      Severe sepsis is defined as sepsis with failure of one or more organ systems and septic
      shock and severe sepsis with persistent low blood pressures despite adequate resuscitation.
      In particular organ failure and shock cause high mortality.

      In the Netherlands, more than 10,000 patients with sepsis are admitted to a hospital
      annually, with an average stay of 15 days. The medical costs being approximately $ 20,000
      per person, the total cost of severe sepsis is estimated at nearly 170 million per year
      (1-3).

      Mortality can be very high if sepsis is not timely or adequately treated, especially among
      the vulnerable elderly population. The mortality rates vary from 20 to 60 percent, depending
      on namely age and other underlying diseases such as diabetes and cancer. Multi-organ failure
      due to sepsis and septic shock is the leading cause of death in the ICU (31,32). The
      incidence of sepsis has increased in recent years and it is expected that this trend will
      continue, partly due to the aging population and partly because of increasing numbers of
      immune-compromised patients who are highly susceptible to all kinds of (opportunistic)
      infections.

      Early Goal Directed Therapy (EGDT) The advent of antibiotics was a major step forward in the
      treatment of sepsis, causing a mortality decrease by approximately 25 percent (33,34).  It
      is noteworthy that in the decades hereafter very little progress in the treatment of sepsis
      was made, until the introduction of the 'Early goal directed therapy (EGDT). A study by
      Rivers and colleagues (4) shows that by applying EGDT during the first six hours after
      detection of sepsis, an absolute mortality reduction of almost 16% is achieved. This EGDT
      consists of a number of interventions, which have the purpose to optimize hemodynamics as
      quickly as possible by means of tight monitoring of arterial / venous pressures and oxygen
      saturation. The cornerstones of this treatment include aggressive fluid resuscitation,
      administration of vasopressors, giving protective ventilation and administration of
      broad-spectrum antibiotics. Several large clinical trials have confirmed the value of EGDT
      with sometimes even greater mortality reduction (35-38).

      Survival Sepsis Campaign Timely recognition and rapid treatment of sepsis appears crucial,
      but recognizing sepsis still remains a challenge: the symptoms are often non-specific and
      various other diseases might fit as well. Therefore the &quot;Surviving Sepsis Campaign&quot; (SSC)
      was launched in 2003 (13), with the aim of creating awareness for sepsis for better
      recognition and treatment of sepsis to improve the prognosis.  Through this campaign a
      directive was developed wherein a somewhat modified form of the EGDT was incorporated. This
      directive also states that broad-spectrum antibiotics should be administered as soon as
      possible, preferably within one hour after arrival in the emergency room.

      Despite extensive attention in the last few years ( major campaigns of VMS) in shortening
      time to administration of antibiotics (the so called &quot;onset to needle time&quot;), there are
      still delays in the start up of antibiotic therapy in the emergency department (ED) (6-7).
      EDs are still not functioning optimally, with waiting times sometimes exceeding 6 hours.
      This is also the conclusion of the report: 'Haastige spoed niet overal goed' from 2004
      (Inspectie der Volksgezondheid). Herein EDs in the Netherlands are described as the weakest
      link in the emergency care, and in addition according to this report,  little progress in
      the quality of care in the emergency department was made from 1994 to 2004. After much
      effort and recommendations, progress was made in the last few years but not sufficiently
      enough (see report '' Ziekenhuizen goed op weg met implementatie normen voor afdelingen
      spoedeisende hulp' &quot;).Our study will therefore be able to contribute to the improvement of
      both the emergency and strengthening of the acute care chain.  Not only will we save costly
      time in the trip till reaching the hospital, but  moreover we will also overcome (potential)
      delays in the emergency department by starting therapy in the ambulance. Delays which can
      amount from one to even six hours.

      Why antibiotics should be administered early? The first hour of presentation in the
      emergency room, also known as the 'Golden Hour' seems to be the most critical one in the
      treatment of a septic patient. Rapid antibiotic administration means better chance of
      survival as well as a reduction in the chance of lasting physical problems.  Moreover, rapid
      intervention can shorten hospital stay and even prevent the need for ICU admission (1-5). In
      daily practice however,  implementation of the SSC directives is not always easy, and there
      may be several reasons to delay the start of treatment (6.15). The so-called 'onset to
      needle time' can be as high as several hours. A recent pilot study in the VUMC showed that
      25% of patients had to wait longer than three hours at the emergency department before
      treatment was initiated with antibiotic therapy (16). Not only in the pilot study of our
      university but also in a retrospective study conducted by Kumar and colleagues only 32.5% of
      the patients received the first gift within the first 3 hours (6) Any delay in the
      administration of antibiotics, causes an increase in mortality rate with almost 8 percent
      per hour!(6).

      The later the treatment is initiated, the greater the chance of multi-organ failure. Besides
      higher mortality-rates, multi-organ failure is directly correlated with more complications,
      longer hospital stay and higher use of costly healthcare facilities (10). So it is very
      important that the onset to needle time is as short as possible.

      Moreover in the long term sepsis can cause much damage (17-20). Patients who survive sepsis
      often suffer for months of complications that arise during or after a prolonged
      hospitalization in intensive care (eg critical illness neuropathy, problems with speech or
      swallowing by prolonged ventilation). The quality of life can also sharply deteriorate after
      experiencing sepsis (18).

      An important point to note is that all the studies which state that early antibiotic
      administration is associated with improved survival, were retrospective and uncontrolled
      studies, making occurrence of selection bias probable. In order to investigate the optimal
      timing of antibiotic administration, prospective randomized controlled studies should be
      performed at the emergency department. However, it would  be completely ethically
      unjustified to randomize patients and delay initiation of antibiotic therapy. An alternative
      and perhaps a better option is to perform a prospective randomized trial in the pre-hospital
      setting, i.e in the ambulances. In current practice, initiation of antibiotic therapy starts
      at the emergency department (ED) and not in the ambulances. Pre-hospital antibiotic
      administration may be a solution to avoid delays in treatment at the ED and contribute to
      improved clinical outcomes such as improved survival, shorter hospital stay and better
      quality of life.

      Prehospital care, even in sepsis? Ambulance personnel have already made a significant
      contribution in improving care for patients with acute coronary syndrome, stroke and
      multiple trauma (42, 43). Patients with severe sepsis or septic shock can also benefit from
      early pre-hospital care (44). Pre-hospital care is the first medical care, which is given by
      ambulance personnel at reaching the patient. Since time plays a crucial role in the
      treatment of sepsis, early recognition and initiation of treatment by the ambulance
      personnel may help to reduce mortality. The provision of pre-hospital care is associated
      with a shorter start-up time of EGDT and antibiotic therapy in the hospital (44-47). In
      addition, it appears that this pre-hospital care leads to quicker achievement of an optimal
      blood pressure, and oxygen saturation. Therefore, it can be expected that by the
      administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics in the ambulance, the survival of sepsis can be
      improved by greatly reducing the time to the administration of the necessary antibiotics.

      To date no randomized controlled trials on the effect of antibiotics in the pre-hospital
      settings on adults have been conducted. In children with meningitis some uncontrolled
      studies have been done. In the studies by Strang and Cartwright (50,51), a clear beneficial
      effect on survival is seen after pre-hospital administration of antibiotics by general
      practitioners. Hamden and Sorensen (52.53) on the contrary showed that administration of
      antibiotics in the pre-hospital setting was associated with worse outcomes. A possible
      explanation for these divergent results is that there occurred a  strong selection bias.
      The group of children receiving pre-hospital antibiotics could be in a more critical stage
      of illness.

      A definitive answer to the question whether administration of antibiotics in pre-hospital
      setting is effective, can only be obtained by a prospective randomized controlled trial. In
      this form of study selection bias can be avoided.

      However recognition of sepsis is difficult, Suffoletto et al investigated how accurately the
      ambulance personnel in Pennsylvania were able to recognize a serious infection, the negative
      predictive value was 93%. In contrast, 69% of the patients with a severe infection were
      missed (8). A pilot study in Maastricht showed, that this situation can probably be
      extrapolated to the Netherlands as well: a large proportion of patients with septic shock
      was in fact not recognized as such and transported with a B-ride (low priority). The
      information transfer is hereby often incomplete or not entirely accurate causing substantial
      delays in initiating treatment. Therefore, much can be gained by training ambulance
      personnel and getting them skilled enough in recognizing sepsis and improving the transfer
      of information.

      Research Consortium Through an intensive collaboration of some of Netherlands major medical
      centres and ambulance services a research consortium has been established to start a
      nationwide project in the form of a multi-centre randomized trial. This consortium has a
      joint goal namely evaluating the effect of early administration of antibiotics in patients
      with suspected sepsis in the pre-hospital setting compared to that with the regular
      treatment. Our hypothesis in this study is that administration of antibiotics in the
      pre-hospital setting will significantly shorten the time to administration of antibiotics,
      which subsequently will lead to improved survival. In addition, the pre-hospital
      administration of antibiotics shortens hospital stay which, simultaneously has a favorable
      effect on the cost and quality of life (QoL).

      Importance of this project Sepsis is a major global health problem with an increasing
      incidence and high mortality rate. While in the past decades, modern medicine has become
      increasingly sophisticated, and the treatment and care around diseases, such as heart
      failure and cancer is greatly improved, treatment of sepsis remains a problem with a high
      mortality. Early administration of antibiotics in critically ill patients with sepsis could
      possibly change that. It is not clear what the best time of administration should be,
      because how early is early? Moreover, in practice it often happens that the time limits are
      not, or not sufficiently monitored closely, whilst increasing the risk of death.

      Moreover,  the treatment of an acutely ill patient requires teamwork and an optimally
      functioning acute-care chain. Through this project it will be possible to investigate
      whether pre-hospital antibiotic therapy leads to better outcomes for this category of
      seriously ill and vulnerable patients.
