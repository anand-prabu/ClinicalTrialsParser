After\n      complete islet graft loss is determined, patient's maintenance immunosuppression (i.e.\n      sirolimus, tacrolimus, MMF and/or Myfortic\u00ae) will be discontinued and they will be monitored\n      for 10 years thereafter, for the appearance of allosensitization using panel reactive\n      antibody (PRA) levels and monitor the persistence of elevated PRA levels. Primary objective\n      is to determine the rate of allosensitization in patients 3 years after failed islet\n      transplantation (i.e. stimulated c-peptide <0.3mg/mL) and monitor the persistence of\n      elevated PRA levels (\u2265 20%) at year 3, 6, and 9. Timing, frequency and level of change in\n      PRA will be monitored after all immunosuppression is discontinued."
