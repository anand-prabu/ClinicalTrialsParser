            "textblock": "The purpose of this research study is to investigate the mechanism of action of a new\n      investigational medication (drug), NNC 90-1170, which is being developed for the treatment\n      of type 2 diabetes (adult onset type of diabetes.\n\n      NNC 90-1170 is a modified form of a hormone, Glucagon-Like Peptide 1 (or GLP-1), which is\n      important for controlling insulin levels. Insulin, another hormone, is also important for\n      controlling blood glucose levels, which are higher than normal in people who have type 2\n      diabetes. This study will measure the effect of NNC 90-1170, active investigational drug, to\n      cause insulin to be released from the pancreas in response to increasing blood glucose\n      concentrations. These results will be compared to that of a group of healthy volunteers of\n      similar age and body weight who do not have diabetes. Also, various other hormones and\n      substances that are known to control blood sugar will be measured in blood samples that will\n      be drawn.\n\n      One dose of NNC 90-1170 will be given to subjects with type 2 diabetes only in this study,\n      and the effects of this dose will be compared to a placebo (inactive substance that looks\n      like the active drug). This is a crossover study, which means that subjects will be treated\n      both with NNC 90-1170 and with placebo. The order in which subjects will receive the\n      treatments will be determined by chance (randomly).\n\n      The study will be conducted as a so-called \"double-blind\" study, meaning that neither\n      subjects nor  study doctors will know the order in which subjects will be given each\n      treatment until the study is over.\n\n      The study will include approximately 15 healthy volunteers and 15 volunteers with type 2\n      diabetes, and it will be conducted at 1 clinic (the University of Michigan Health System) in\n      the United States."
