In severe cases, it can be accompanied by agitation, paranoia(overly\n      suspicious), and hallucinations(seeing or hearing things that are not really there).\n\n      Bright light uses no medication and is often used to treat seasonal affective depression and\n      multiple sleep disorders. The light boxes are portable and are placed in front of\n      individuals for about 30 minutes every day."
