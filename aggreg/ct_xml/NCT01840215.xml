  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anaesthetic procedures in ophthalmology surgery have been a subject rapidly evolving in the
      past decades. In this era of topical anesthesia for ocular surgery, anesthetic ocular blocks
      are still important when profound anesthesia and akinesia are required. It is therefore
      still a popular choice in many practices worldwide for glaucoma and vitreoretinal surgery.

      When deciding for a retrobulbar block, the local injection of varying mixtures and volumes
      of fast-acting anesthetics (such as lidocaine) - with or without a vasoconstrictive agent
      (such as adrenaline) - coupled with Hyaluronidase have been the standard care to provide
      painless surgery while minimizing the possible risks such as increased intraocular pressure
      (IOP), brainstem anesthesia, toxic reaction and ocular blood flow changes. Considering this
      latter issue, there has been a number of anecdotal reports of orbital vascular occlusion
      following local anesthetic procedures. These iatrogenic-induced vascular dysfunctions have
      been also suggested to play a role in intra-operatory vision loss (a &quot;wipe-out&quot; phenomenon)
      in patients with advanced glaucoma.

      The rationale for the use of epinephrine in retrobulbar anesthesia is to slow absorption of
      the anesthetic in general circulation and thus to achieve a longer effect in the orbit.
      However, studies on ocular blood flow after adrenaline-containing compounds have
      consistently showed a decrease in ocular blood flow, thus raising the issue of whether it
      should be used in patients with known vascular dysfunction, namely glaucoma patients.
      Nevertheless, there has been no study to verify this claim concerning the safety of
      non-adrenaline containing anesthetics.

      Injecting a pre-determined volume of anesthetic compound behind the globe, regardless of its
      formulation has also been debated. The orbital pressure increase can lead to a number of
      adverse reactions, not only increasing IOP but also potentially decreasing vascular input by
      local compression. This may be of particular interest in cases where the orbital structures
      may be altered. In glaucoma for instance, there has been suggested optic nerve sheaths to be
      less elastic than in healthy individuals, potentially making this structure less compliant
      to outside compression. In addition, there has been suggested that a number of glaucoma
      medications (especially if long term usage is considered) can induce an irreversible
      lipodystrophy of the orbit. These more rigid orbital tissues could also impair the orbit's
      ability to deal with the iatrogenic increased volume.

      As seen, the current concepts on the impact of ocular anesthesiology in the orbit and the
      vascular supply to the eye are limited to a small number of non-homogeneous studies. We aim
      to study this impact through a non-invasive, widely established ultrasound based method of
      ocular blood flow research (color Doppler Imaging). Potentially, our study could help
      determine a taylor-made choice of the anesthesiology procedure to apply to a specific
      patient, thereby advancing the current standard of care in ophthalmology.

      1. Ultrasound B-mode scans will be performed before and after the anesthetic procedure

        2. Doppler scan will be added to the B-mode ultrasound to register the blood flow pattern
           of the ophthalmic and central retinal arteries

        3. Blood pressure and heart rate will be monitored
