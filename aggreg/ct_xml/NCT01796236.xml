  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To demonstrate that the minimally invasive surgical procedure in combination with the use of
      the Cochlear Baha BA400 abutment is associated with a reduction of inflammation/infection,
      overgrowth, pain and numbness at the site of implantation compared to the traditional
      surgical procedure in combination with the use of the standard Baha abutment (Cochlear Baha
      BA300 Abutment).

      To demonstrate that the minimally invasive surgical procedure in combination with the use of
      the Cochlear Baha BA400 abutment is associated with a reduction in direct medical costs, due
      to shorter surgical procedures, faster wound healing and less complications compared to the
      traditional surgical procedure in combination with the use of the standard Baha abutment
      (Cochlear Baha BA300 Abutment).

    <description>The Cochlear Baha BA400 Abutment has been designed with a concave shape at the lower aspect of the abutment. The abutment is made of commercially pure titanium and is coated with a hydroxyapatite layer on the entire soft tissue-contacting surface of the abutment up to 3 mm below the top surface (2 mm below the top surface on 6 mm abutments).</description>
