Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different\n      ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Monoclonal antibodies,\n      such as bevacizumab, can block cancer growth in different ways. Some block the ability of\n      cancer cells to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and help kill them or deliver\n      cancer-killing substances to them. Combining chemotherapy with a monoclonal antibody may\n      kill more tumor cells"
