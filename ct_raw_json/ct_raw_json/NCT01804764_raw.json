            "textblock": "Sepsis is widespread (1.8 million cases annually worldwide) and accounts for a very high\n      mortality: 20-25% of all severe sepsis, 40-70% of all septic shock. The Surviving Sepsis\n      Campaign (SSC) recommends a first 6 hours \"resuscitative bundle\" to improve patient's\n      outcome. Despite this, the bundle is poorly performed, because of a superficial knowledge of\n      the guidelines and several difficulties in their clinical implementation. In recognition of\n      this, a \"sepsis six\" bundle is designed to facilitate early intervention with just three\n      diagnostic and three therapeutic steps to be delivered by staff within 1 h.\n\n      The aim of our study is to evaluate if an Educational and Organizational Intervention (EOI)\n      could improve septic patient's outcome in no Critical Care Units. The second endpoint is to\n      evaluate if the compliance to the \"sepsis six\" bundle could improve after this sort of\n      intervention."

            "textblock": "Methods 39 Medical Wards and 12 Emergency Departments, belonging to 12 hospitals, were\n      voluntarily enrolled. Through the collaboration of 12 Multidisciplinary Teams (MT), we took\n      a Pre-EOI picture of the human resources (i.e. doctors to patients ratio) and of the\n      organisational structures (i.e. laboratory's opening hours) of each hospital. For six\n      months, each unit enrolled was asked to fill in a Clinical Checklist for every patient\n      suspected for severe sepsis or septic shock; so that the Pre-EOI \"sepsis six\" bundle\n      compliance could be evaluated. Then, we planned several pre-agreed educational meetings for\n      all of the doctors and nurses belonging to the enrolled wards. In the meanwhile the MT\n      worked to overcome any impediment to a better septic patient management. Finally, the\n      educated medical staff  was asked to fill in again the same Clinical Checklist used in the\n      Pre-EOI phase; so that the Post-EOI \"sepsis six\" bundle compliance could be evaluated and a\n      comparison with the Pre-EOI phase could be done.\n\n      Hypothesis This is the first study aimed to analyze the impact of an Educational and\n      Organizational Intervention in the outcome of septic patients managed in no Critical Care\n      Units. We guess that the differences showed in human resources and organizational structures\n      among the hospitals could have a role in the \"sepsis six\" bundle compliance and in the\n      patient's outcome, but only a comparison with data collected from the clinical checklist and\n      patient's outcome will confirm our guess. Likewise, we believe that an educational\n      intervention could improve the septic patient's management, but we need the Post-EOI phase\n      conclusion to demonstrate or not our hypothesis."
