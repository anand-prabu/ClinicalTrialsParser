            "textblock": "Remifentanil is a widely used potent intravenous opioid with the advantage of having a short\n      time of action. Compared to other opiates however remifentanil generates more intense\n      hemodynamic side-effects. In ophthalmic surgery the specific anesthesiological challenges\n      necessitate the administration of a combination of relatively high doses of analgesics on\n      the one hand and a short time for postoperative recovery from anesthesia on the other. For\n      these reasons, anesthetic management often consists of a combination of relatively high\n      doses of propofol and remifentanil. A primary concern during this deep propofol/remifentanil\n      anesthesia is preserving hemodynamic stability and adequate tissue oxygenation. Previous\n      research of the investigators group has revealed that atropine has an exceptionally\n      beneficial effect on hemodynamics as well as on tissue oxygenation. Therefore, the\n      investigators hypothesize that administration of intravenous atropine during induction of\n      propofol/remifentanil may have a positive effect on the hemodynamic profile and peripheral\n      and cerebral tissue oxygenation during and after induction of anesthesia."
