      The investigators seek to determine the feasibility of assessing neurologic injuries
      subsequent to transcathether aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Such a model has been applied
      previously by the principal investigator to assess and improve neurologic outcomes for other
      cardiac surgical procedures. The investigators shall assess patients during the following
      intervals: pre-procedure, within 72-96 hours post-procedure, and 3 months post-procedure.
      Case videos will be established to assist in identifying and associating emboli (using
      transcranial Doppler) and processes of clinical care during the TAVR procedure. Neurologic
      injury will be assessed in the following ways: stroke (neurologic exam, NIH Stroke Scale),
      silent infarcts (diffusion-weighted MRI, diffusion-tensor imaging), and neurobehavioral
      deficits (a battery of neuropsychological tests). Secondly, the investigators will
      investigate changes in the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), a measure of sleep-disordered
      breathing, before vs after surgery between those subjects who develop post-operative acute
      brain infarction and those who do not.  The investigators hypothesize that subjects who
      develop acute brain infarction will have an increase in AHI between baseline and post-op
      measurements compared with those subjects who do not develop acute brain infarction.  A
      research coordinator will coordinate the testing.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nearly 1 in 10 adults over 65 years have aortic valve stenosis (AS), defined as an
      obstruction of blood flow across the aortic valve.(Faggiano, Antonini-Canterin et al. 2006)
      AS is a life-threatening disease, and one whose incidence increases with age. Natural
      history studies suggest that the long-term survival among patients with severe AS is
      unfavorable, even among patients who are asymptomatic, with event-free survival for AS being
      64% at 1-year, 36% at 2-years, 12% at 4-years, and 3% at 6-years.(Rosenhek, Zilberszac et
      al. 2010) Until recently surgery has been the gold standard approach for treatment for
      severe AS. Recently, a less invasive approach, transcathether aortic valve replacement
      (TAVR) has emerged as a viable treatment alternative, including among those previously not
      thought of as suitable candidates for surgery. Unlike its surgical counterpart that utilizes
      cardiopulmonary bypass and direct vision by a cardiothoracic surgeon, TAVR is performed (by
      a surgeon in conjunction with an interventional cardiologist) by threading a wire mesh valve
      through a catheter using fluoroscopy while the heart is still beating. Concern regarding
      broader adoption of TAVR often revolves around the higher stroke rate relative to surgery
      (5.5% vs. 2.4%, p = 0.04).(Leon, Smith et al. 2010) Much of the risk associated with
      neurologic injuries (whether stroke, neurocognitive deficits or silent infarcts) revolves
      around embolically-generated sources, including: threading a guidewire across diseased
      vessels, removal of the native valve, or insertion/expansion of the new valve.(Miller,
      Blackstone et al. 2012) Among 47 patients studied by Miller within a neurologic sub-study of
      the PARTNER Trial, there were 49 (n=31 TAVR, 16 AVR) neurologic events (defined as a
      transient ischemic attack or stroke).(Miller, Blackstone et al. 2012)  In a recent review
      article, Daneault cited risk of post-procedural cerebral infarcts within 5-7 days (using
      Diffusion-weighted MRI) of 38-47% with standard aortic valve surgery  vs. 68-84% with
      TAVR.(Daneault, Kirtane et al. 2011) Given the growing interest and anticipated broadening
      of indications for TAVR in and outside of the United States, it is increasingly important to
      develop a sound methodological approach for evaluating the safety and effectiveness of this
      emerging treatment modality. In the absence of such information, it is impossible for a
      patient or clinician to estimate the likelihood for developing a neurologic injury
      subsequent to TAVR. Additionally, linkage of processes of care with embolism detection
      (through transcranial Doppler) would provide evidence to support targeted quality
      improvement efforts. Such a strategy has been useful in prior studies applied to coronary
      artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery.(Groom, Quinn et al. 2009) Indeed, early studies
      evaluating TAVR have found periods of the TAVR procedure which may be more prone to the
      generation of embolic debris, although they have used varied methodological approaches.
      Importantly, the relationship between these emboli and development of neurobehavioral or
      ischemic lesions has not been explored in this setting.

      The overlap between sleep disorders and stroke is an emerging field. Sleep apnea is a
      serious medical condition that is very common after stroke, affecting over half of acute
      ischemic stroke patients. (Broadley, Jorgensen et al. 2007) Recently, sleep apnea has been
      recognized as an independent risk factor for stroke. (Munoz, Martinez-Vila et al. 2006;
      Redline, Gottlieb et al. 2010; Yaggi, Kernan et al. 2005)  Furthermore, sleep apnea has been
      identified as an important predictor of both poor functional outcome and death following
      stroke. (Sahlin, Sandberg et al. 2008; Turkington, Allgar et al. 2004) There remains
      controversy over whether OSA predates stroke, whether stroke predates sleep apnea, and
      whether stroke exacerbates sleep apnea severity. To answer the questions definitely, sleep
      apnea testing would have to be performed just prior to and again after stroke. Because
      stroke is typically unpredictable, this has been logistically challenging to pursue. The
      current study however provides a rare opportunity to study patients for sleep-disordered
      breathing just prior to and after a type of procedure that has an association with acute
      cerebral infarction identified on MRI. (Kalert, Knipp et al. 2010) Within this context, we
      seek to determine the feasibility of assessing neurologic injuries subsequent to TAVR. Such
      a model has been applied previously by the principal investigator to assess and improve
      neurologic outcomes for other cardiac surgical procedures.(Groom, Quinn et al. 2009) We
      shall assess patients during the following intervals: pre-procedure, within 72-96 hours
      post-procedure, and 3 months post-procedure (see Appendix). Case videos will be established
      to assist in identifying and associating emboli (using transcranial Doppler) and processes
      of clinical care during the TAVR procedure. Neurologic injury will be assessed in the
      following ways: stroke (neurologic exam, NIH Stroke Scale), silent infarcts
      (diffusion-weighted MRI, diffusion-tensor imaging), and neurobehavioral deficits (a battery
      of neuropsychological tests). Secondly, we will investigate changes in the apnea-hypopnea
      index (AHI), a measure of sleep-disordered breathing, before vs after surgery between those
      subjects who develop post-operative acute brain infarction and those who do not.  We
      hypothesize that subjects who develop acute brain infarction will have an increase in AHI
      between baseline and post-op measurements compared with those subjects who do not develop
      acute brain infarction.  A research coordinator will coordinate the testing.

    <description>The primary neurological outcome will be defined by the change in the NIH stroke scale from the pre-procedure examination. We will display this outcome visually using spaghetti plots labeled with emboli count for each patient.  Using the method of mixed models with an empirical small-sample correction, a longitudinal model adjusted for follow-up time will be used to compare this outcome at each post-procedural assessment to emboli count. While tracked, we don't anticipate any strokes within this first set of 8 pilot patients.</description>

    <description>The primary neurobehavioral outcome will be defined at each post-procedural visit by a 20% or greater decline on at least 20% of neurobehavioral tests relative to pre-procedural levels.    A similar longitudinal model to that used for NIH stroke score will be used to generate odds ratios for the effect of emboli count on post-procedural neurobehavioral deficit.  Secondary outcomes, including the change over time in the mini mental status examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), will be assessed as continuous outcomes in longitudinal models predicted by emboli count as well as visually in plot form.</description>
