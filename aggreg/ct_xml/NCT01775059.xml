  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, non-randomized, and interventional study in which subjects will use
      the Integrated sensor and infusion set with MiniLink Transmitter and the Medtronic Paradigm®
      VEO™ insulin pump (Sensor augmented pump) for 15 days.

      The purpose of this study is to collect performance data on the Integrated sensor and
      infusion set for approximately 15 days, with the intention for each subject to wear 5 sets
      for 3 days each.
