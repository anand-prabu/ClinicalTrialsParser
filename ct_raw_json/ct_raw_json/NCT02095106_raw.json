            "textblock": "Distal radius fractures are one of the most commonly seen fractures in children.\n      Traditionally, minimally angulated or non-displaced distal radius fractures are treated with\n      short or long-arm cast immobilization for up to 8 weeks. The traditional fiberglass casts\n      used must be kept dry to prevent inflammation and potential infection.  If a fiberglass cast\n      gets wet, it must be removed and replaced.  In general, waterproof casting has been shown to\n      improve patient comfort and overall satisfaction.\n\n      We intend to explore the efficacy of a new, waterproof cast made of a hybrid mesh in the\n      treatment of minimally angulated distal radius fractures in children using a randomized,\n      controlled, cross-over study design.   We will include patients between 4 and 14 years of\n      age with minimally angulated distal radius fractures (<15 degrees of angulation on sagittal\n      or coronal planes) presented to the Orthopaedic Institute for Children Urgent Care Facility\n      within 7 days of injury. As determined by a power analysis, a total of 26 patients will be\n      enrolled in the study.\n\n      Patients eligible for the study will be randomized into one of two equally sized (n=13)\n      groups:  patients in Group 1 will receive a short arm cast made of the waterproof hybrid\n      mesh material and patients in Group 2 will receive a regular fiberglass cast.  Both groups\n      will follow-up at two weeks for clinical and radiological evaluation, after which they will\n      be transitioned into a regular fiberglass cast (Group 1) or a hybrid mesh waterproof cast\n      (Group 2) for an additional two weeks.  This crossover will allow both groups to experience\n      each type of cast.  After four weeks of immobilization, patients in both groups will\n      discontinue casting and be advised to avoid contact sports or strenuous activities until\n      week 8.\n\n      Patients in both groups will follow up 8 weeks after initial treatment for clinical and\n      radiological evaluation to evaluate range of motion, pain, and fracture alignment. Physical\n      function will be evaluated at weeks 1, 2, and 4 using the Activities Scale for Kids -\n      Performance, a validated, highly reliable, self-reported measure that assesses physical\n      function in children between 5 and 15 years.  Pain will be evaluated using the Faces Pain\n      Scale, a validated, highly reliable scale commonly used in the pediatric population.\n      Patient satisfaction will be measured at Weeks 1, 2, and 4, and the radiographs at Week 8\n      will be compared with initial radiographs to assess fracture displacement and angulation.\n      Skin changes will be assessed at week 2 and week 4 by an independent observer blinded to the\n      type of cast that has been removed and digital photographs will be obtained and analyzed\n      using ImageJ Image Processing and Analysis Software to calculate the surface area of any\n      described skin changes as a percentage of total skin area originally covered by the cast.\n      Itching will be assessed at weeks 1, 2, and 4 using a visual analogue scale in which a\n      horizontal line of 100 mm will be presented to the patient with \"no itching\" at the left end\n      of the scale and \"strongest itching\" at the right end.\n\n      We hope to determine whether the new, waterproof cast can result in similar clinical\n      outcomes and patient satisfaction for distal radius fractures as compared with the\n      traditional fiberglass cast."
