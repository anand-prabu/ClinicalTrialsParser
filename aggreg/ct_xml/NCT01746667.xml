  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study aims at comparing the efficacy of exposure in vivo and exposure via
      virtual reality for social anxiety disorder. 70 patients with social anxiety disorder will
      be randomized to either one of the active conditions or to a waiting-list condition.
      Participants on the waiting-list will be offered either exposure in vivo of in virtual
      reality after a waiting period of five weeks. Levels of psychopathology will be assessed at
      pre- and post-treatment as well as three and 12 months after treatment.
