  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical study is composed of two steps. The first step aims at validating the
      pharmacokinetic approach based on the magnesium concentration in erythrocyte and plasma.

      According to these results and if this pharmacokinetic approach is validated, the second
      step will set up. The second phase aims at comparing the relative bioavailability of
      magnesium administrated by two different drug formulations: ChronoMag Smart Tablet® (two
      tablets50mg) versus Mag2® (three tablets100mg).
