Besides, We will measure\n      the length of the colon from the anastomosis to the level of the root of the IMA. Expecting\n      Results\uff1aThe blood pressure of the arterial arcade in Group A will be higher than that in\n      Group B. And the patients in Group A will have less chance to get anastomotic fistula.\n      Expecting Conclusions: Preserving the LCA and resecting the No. 253 lymph node specifically\n      in the radical resection of rectal carcinoma can improve the blood supply of the anastomosis\n      and decrease the incidence of anastomotic fistula, and won't affect the harvest of the No.\n      253 lymph node."
