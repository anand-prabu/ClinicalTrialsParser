  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a substudy of the Generation-100 study (NCT01666340). Self reported physical
      activity versus objectively measured physical activity and its correlation to maximal oxygen
      uptake in an elderly Norwegian population (observational study).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Data is collected using activity monitors.  This data then compared to self reported
      physical activity obtained through questionnaires.  Questionnaires are based on recall.
      Overall physical activity will then be correlated to maximal oxygen uptake to see whether
      people with high activity also have high maximal oxygen uptake.
