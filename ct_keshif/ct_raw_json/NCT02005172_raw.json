We will also examine by means\n      of a questionnaire the compliance, ease of use and patient satisfaction for each device.\n\n      Hypothesis:\n\n        1. The AliveCor monitor will be non-inferior to the 14 day event monitor with respect to\n           diagnosis of the arrhythmia responsible for a patient's symptoms.\n\n        2. The AliveCor monitor will have better compliance and acceptability compared to the 14\n           day event monitor, and thus there will be a greater number of days with recordings from\n           the AliveCor monitor."
