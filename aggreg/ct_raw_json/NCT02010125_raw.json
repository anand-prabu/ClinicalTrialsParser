SOC MR imaging will be\n      captured at baseline, then a quantitative morphological MRI and quantitative T1\u03c1 andT2\n      imaging of the injured and contra-lateral knees will be taken within 7 days of baseline, and\n      again at 6 months, and 1 year post-injury or post-surgery. Scans will not take place\n      immediately after surgery because we are not attempting to study the immediate effect of ACL\n      reconstruction. The physical performance testing will not be acquired until 6 months\n      follow-up because patients will have unstable knees.\n\n      For the 6 healthy volunteers, only an MRI of the right knee will be required at 4 time\n      points - baseline, 6 months, 12 months, and 18 months. The control volunteers will be used\n      as a measure of reproducibility. The control volunteers will not perform any physical\n      performance testing or study questionnaires. The purpose of the six control subjects is to\n      track the reproducibility and physiologic variation in T1p and T2 values in a normal knee.\n      These subjects will complete imaging at four time points, spaced six months apart. The\n      results will help evaluate the expected range of differences in knees without a traumatic\n      injury. This information will assist in the interpretation of values from the patients with\n      ACL injuries as to if any observed variation is outside the expected magnitude for a healthy\n      individual. The control subjects will also help monitor for any changes in the scanner\n      reliability at our site and compared to the other two clinical sites. Phantoms will be\n      scanned each month to aid in this process, and control subjects will add and help ensure\n      that data collection is constant over time."

The aim is to investigate longitudinal changes in cartilage matrix in ACL-injured and reconstructed knees using T1\u03c1 and T2. We hypothesize that T1\u03c1 and T2 will be significantly higher in defined sub-compartments of injured knees compared to the contralateral un-injured knees at baseline and follow-ups.
