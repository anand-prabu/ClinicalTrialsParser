  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness worldwide, whose treatment - intraocular pressure
      lowering - is only partially effective in preventing disease progression. Accordingly, other
      variables, such as ocular blood flow-related factors, have been implicated in disease
      pathogenesis. However, most findings involving vascular variables come from partial,
      small-scale studies. Furthermore, recent technological advances have identified a number of
      ocular blood flow variables that have yet to be tested in large scale trials. Therefore, a
      study that specifically aims at uncovering the role of vascular aspects in glaucoma is
      needed.

      For this purpose, a cross-sectional, observational case-control study will be conducted in
      the University Hospitals Leuven. This will be the largest-yet study on the subject,
      involving more than 750 patients. This will allow the creation of a specific cohort of
      patients where the vascular aspects are thought to be particularly important (low-tension
      glaucoma). It will use the largest combination yet of vascular-related measuring techniques
      (dynamic contour tonometry, optic coherent tomography, colour Doppler imaging and retinal
      oximetry)

      1. Demographic and clinical ophthalmology-related examination data will be collected,
           including intraocular pressure measurement using dynamic contour tonometry

        2. Visual field testing will be performed.

        3. Structural damage will be documented by a retinal nerve fiber layer analysis (through
           Heidelberg Retinal Tomograph)

        4. High Definition Optical coherent tomograph imaging of the submacular and peripapillary
           choroidal thickness will be performed.

        5. Color Doppler Imaging of the retrobulbar vessels will be performed, with analysis of
           the Doppler waveform (peak systolic, end diastolic velocities and resistivity index)

        6. Retinal oximetry will be performed with the analysis of the arterial and venous
           saturations of retinal vessels
