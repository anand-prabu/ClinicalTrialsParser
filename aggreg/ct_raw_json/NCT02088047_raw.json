Self-stimulating behaviors like hand flapping, eye blinking, and\n      rocking, can interfere with the individual's ability to interact with their peers.\n      Participants will wear the pellets for four week and measures with taken again. Another\n      group of participants will not get the pellets. Both groups will be tested at the beginning\n      and end of the study.  Any variations in self-stimulating behaviors will be documented\n      through parent report, Observational data. The investigators hypothesize that they will see\n      changes in self- stimulating behaviors as a result of the strategic placement of the\n      ProFoveate\u2122 pellets on the ears of one group of the participants."

Within each package, all spheres are individually contained on a single paper backing measuring approximately 8.5 cm by 1.7 cm.
