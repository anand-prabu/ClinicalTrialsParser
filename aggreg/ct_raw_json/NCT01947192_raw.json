Patients with at\n      least two non-carious cervical lesions (NCL) will be selected. NCL will be randomly assigned\n      according the type of teeth (incisors, canine or pre-molars) into two groups: control or\n      experimental group (application of 2% CRX for 60 seconds after the acid etching procedure).\n      Class V restorations will be performed out with an etch-and-rinse adhesive system (Adper\n      Single Bond 2-3M ESPE) and a composite resin (Filtek Z350-3M ESPE) according the manufacture\n      instructions, by previously trained operators. The restorations will be evaluated by a\n      calibrate examiner at 1 week (baseline), and 6-month, 12-month and 24-month, using the World\n      Dental Federation (FDI) criteria. The outcome is retention of the restoration."
