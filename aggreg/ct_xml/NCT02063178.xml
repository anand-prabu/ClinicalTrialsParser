      Purpose: This study aims to take the procedural and research-based lessons learned from a
      pilot weight loss intervention (IRB # 13-02563-XP), conducted by The University of Tennessee
      Health Science Center in 2013, and apply them to the current study of 204 active duty
      military personnel.  The pilot study translated and tailored the Look Ahead weight loss
      intervention to an overweight/obese active duty U.S. Air Force population, while
      accommodating the lifestyle and environment that is unique to military members and evaluate
      materials and procedures used.

      Rationale: Being overweight is now by far the leading medical reason for rejection in the
      military. Unfortunately, the impact of weight problems on the military does not stop with
      those turned away from military service. From 1998 to 2008, the Armed Forces Health
      Surveillance Center reported the percent of active military members who experienced medical
      encounters for overweight or obesity significantly increased. The estimated total days of
      work lost from absenteeism associated with active-duty personnel who are overweight or obese
      was 658,000. Using Department of Defense (DOD) estimates of average daily based, it was
      estimated that overweight and obesity costs the DOD $103 million dollars in health care
      costs annually. Note this estimate is for active duty personnel only. Furthermore, obesity
      is a major cause for the discharge of uniformed personnel.

      The current study is inspired by the successful Look Ahead trial, a behavioral science
      obesity intervention treatment program that included: a collaborative approach, education,
      behavioral support, and motivational interviewing. The unique nature of this weight
      reduction study is significant. To our knowledge, there had not been a successful
      translation of a highly efficacious obesity treatment in the military until The University
      of Tennessee Health Science Center implemented a pilot version of the Fit Blue program for
      active duty U.S. Air Force members in 2013.  Following a successful pilot and extant results
      from the Look Ahead trial, Investigators expect success during the full scale Fit Blue
      study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a weight loss intervention program tailored to a military population.
      Investigators will randomize 204 consented participants to either an intensive
      counselor-initiated weight loss intervention or a self-paced weight loss intervention.
      Neither of the aforementioned conditions are controls and both treatments are expected to
      result in weight reduction.

      Procedures: This is a two-arm individually randomized trial.  The Counselor-initiated group
      will follow a more intense counselor-initiated approach, where the counselor schedules
      weekly telephone sessions and contacts them directly.  The Self-paced group uses a less
      intense approach, where the participants can receive the same telephone counseling sessions
      as the counselor-initiated group, only if they call the counselor.

      Potential participants will be recruited through the use of advertisements, electronic
      bulletins, emails, newspapers, and word-of-mouth.  Prior to randomization, interested
      individuals will complete a phone screening, informed consent, two in-person data collection
      visits and obtain medical clearance, as well as participate in 1 week of dietary and
      physical activity self-monitoring.

      The randomized participants will spend the next year involved in study interventions (either
      the Counselor-Initiated intervention or the Self-Paced intervention), diet and exercise
      self-monitoring, daily weighing, and may also include telephone counseling sessions.

      The follow-up data collection visits will occur at 4 and 12 months after randomization.   At
      these visits, physical measurements will be collected (i.e. height, weight, abdominal
      circumference, blood pressure and heart rate) and participants will complete various
      questionnaires.  A Quality of Life questionnaire will also be administered by study
      personnel.

    <description>Participants will receive 28 telephone sessions over a 12 month period by interventionists trained in behavior change skills  and motivational interviewing techniques.  Participants will be asked to monitor food intake and physical activity using the LoseIt website/app and weight daily using a Body Trace e-scale. Participants will receive feedback on self-monitoring through e-mail. Dietary goals will be based on weight and participants' weight-loss progress. Participants will be encouraged to replace 2 meals and a snack with meal replacements (provided). Participants will be asked to gradually increase their moderate to vigorous exercise to 225-250 minutes per week. The Toolbox includes additional treatment options (e.g., food scales, exercise videos, cookbooks) for those who wish to take advantage of them. There will be several challenges that will provide a specific goal (e.g. increase self-monitoring), with a small award for completion.</description>
