            "textblock": "Recent studies have shown that exercise training could decrease the risk of dementia in the\n      elderly population. Exercise training could also slow down the speed of deterioration of\n      memory and other cognitive functions in patients who already have mild cognitive impairment\n      or early Alzheimer's disease. However, the mechanisms of such effects are still unknown.\n      Whether exercise training could improve neural fiber integrity, blood flow, or motor\n      performance of these patients also remain unexplored.\n\n      Therefore, the purposes of this study are:\n\n        1. To investigate whether a 3-month exercise training program would improve cognitive\n           function, motor performance, integrity of brain fiber tracts and cerebral blood flow;\n\n        2. To investigate the possible neuro-anatomical and neurophysiological mechanisms of\n           exercise training on cognitive function, motor performance, integrity of brain fiber\n           tract and cerebral blood flow in patients with mild cognitive impairment and in those\n           with early Alzheimer's disease;\n\n        3. To investigate the influence of different APOE genotypes on the above-mentioned\n           exercise effects.\n\n      We will conduct a single-blinded, randomized controlled clinical trial. We will recruit 60\n      patients with mild cognitive impairment or early Alzheimer's disease. The participants will\n      be randomly classified into the exercise training group or control group. The exercise\n      training group will receive health education and exercise training of moderate intensity, 3\n      times a week, for 12 weeks. The control group will receive health education only. Both\n      groups will receive pre- (week 0), post- (week 12), and follow-up (week 24 after the end of\n      the program) examinations for cognitive function, motor performance, diffusion tensor or\n      diffusion spectrum magnetic resonance imaging, and transcranial duplex. We will compare the\n      group differences on the aforementioned outcome measures brought by 12-week exercise\n      training. We will also perform analysis of the correlations between the changes in these\n      outcome measures to explore the possible neural or physiological mechanisms mediating the\n      training effects. The effects of different APOE genotypes on these outcome measures will\n      also be compared.\n\n      The results of this study will provide medical evidence for the effects of exercise training\n      on mild cognitive impairment and on early Alzheimer's disease; and will provide\n      understanding of the mechanisms mediating these effects. More importantly, the results serve\n      as the basis for future larger-scale exercise clinical trials for these two patient\n      populations."
