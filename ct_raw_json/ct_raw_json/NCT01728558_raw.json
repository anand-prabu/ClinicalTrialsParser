            "textblock": "The Use of sedative drugs in intensive care is widespread. A cohort study conducted in\n      Australia and New Zealand in 2010 revealed a high prevalence of deep sedation within the\n      first 48 hours of mechanical ventilation which was independently linked to prolonged\n      ventilation, hospital and 180 days mortality. Clinical practice is moving towards the use of\n      lighter levels of sedation. Recent RCTs in Europe (JAMA 2012) and previous RCTs (JAMA 2009)\n      supports growing evidence that dexmedetomidine facilitates rousable sedation, shortens\n      ventilation time and attenuates delirium when compared to midazolam and propofol.\n\n      The investigators confirmed in a pilot study the feasibility, efficacy and safety of a\n      process of care known as Early Goal Directed Sedation (EGDS) that delivers:\n\n        1. Early randomization after intubation or arrival in the ICU (intubated).\n\n        2. Early Adequate analgesia after randomization.\n\n        3. Goal directed sedation titrated to achieve light sedation.\n\n        4. Dexmedetomidine based algorithm as the primary sedative agent with avoidance of\n           benzodiazepines.\n\n      The aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness of Early Goal Directed Sedation when\n      compared to standard care sedation in critically ill patients.\n\n      The study hypothesis is that Early Goal-Directed Sedation (EGDS), compared to standard care\n      sedation, reduces 90-day all-cause mortality in critically ill patients who require\n      mechanical ventilation."

The primary aim of this study is to determine whether\n      Early Goal Directed Sedation therapy, compared to standard care sedation, reduces 90-day\n      mortality in critically ill patients ventilated > 24 hrs.\n\n      The study will be a randomized, unblinded, controlled trial conducted in approximately 35-50\n      intensive care units (ICUs) and will recruit 4000 mechanically ventilated patients (life\n      support) who are expected to remain on the ventilator > 24 hours AND require immediate\n      ongoing sedative medication for comfort, safety, and to facilitate the delivery of life\n      support measures, including mechanical ventilation.\n\n      Patients with primary brain injury or prolonged weakness are excluded. Participants will be\n      randomized into one of 2 study groups. All patients will receive adequate analgesia at\n      randomization at the discretion of treating clinician. All randomized patients will have\n      Light sedation as the default target unless otherwise clinically indicated. The intervention\n      group will receive EGDS with dexmedetomidine as the primary sedative agent to achieve light\n      sedation, with the addition of propofol as required. The use of benzodiazepines in the\n      intervention group is not allowed, with the exception of specific, defined circumstances.\n\n      The control group will have sedation according to usual practice as chosen by the treating\n      clinician.  The use of dexmedetomidine is not allowed, with the exception of specific,\n      defined circumstances.\n\n      Deidentified data will be collected and will include\u037e Baseline demographic information\u037e\n      Doses of all sedative, analgesic and other related medications\u037e Pain, sedation and delirium\n      scores and major treatments such as ventilation time, tracheostomy and dialysis.
