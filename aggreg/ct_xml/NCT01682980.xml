  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall contribution of this study is to increase the knowledge of the efficacy of
      strength and aerobic exercise on knee related quality of life, knee pain,physical function
      and the morphology of the cartilage in patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA). Knee OA is
      one of the most important diseases within musculoskeletal conditions affecting a
      considerable amount of people worldwide. The randomized controlled trial will involve one
      intervention group delivered strength exercises compared to another intervention group
      delivered aerobic exercise (ergometer cycling). The two intervention groups will be compared
      to a control group undergoing usual care. Cost-effectiveness analysis will be performed
      comparing the three groups. The study is funded from The Research Council of Norway.

    <description>The aerobic exercise group will cycle on an ergometer bicycle 2-3 times a week for 12 weeks on moderate loading. The loading will be controlled by a heart rate monitor and is defined as 75% of maximal heart rate (calculated with formula for maximal heart rate reserve).</description>

    <description>The strength training will be delivered 2-3 times per week for 12 weeks, 5-8 repetitions maximum in 3 series. The patients must warm up 5 minutes on an ergometer cycle. The following muscle groups will be trained: Quadriceps and hamstrings, hip muscles (abductors and extensors), calf muscles. A home exercise program will be delivered including one leg exercises and balance exercises. Progression will follow a 2+ principle. For instance, when the study participant is able to perform 2 more repetitions, more loads are required.</description>
