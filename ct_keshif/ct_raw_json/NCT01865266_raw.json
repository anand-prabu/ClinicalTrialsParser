            "textblock": "Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in\n      ventilated critically ill patients specially in intensive care unit (ICU). It is associated\n      with an increased duration of mechanical ventilation, high death rates and increased\n      healthcare costs in the development country.\n\n      Although VAP is preventable and many practices have been demonstrated to reduce the\n      incidence of this disease, the morbidity is still so high. VAP is hard to cure and the\n      mortality is about to 40% which was reported in China in 2004. If the bacteria of\n      multidrug-resistance(MDR) is isolated, the mortality can increase to 70%. So much more\n      methods should be needed in treating VAP in addition to using antibiotics.\n\n      Ulinastatin is a serine protease inhibitor with a molecular weight of 67,000 found in\n      healthy human urine. It is used worldwide for patients with inflammatory disorders,\n      including disseminated intravascular coagulation(DIC),shock, and pancreatitis . Furthermore,\n      ulinastatin administration can help reduce sepsis, prevent multiple organ dysfunction, and\n      modulate immune functions.\n\n      Actually, three studies have showed that ulinastatin treatment is associated with reduced\n      the levels of inflammatory factors in blood serum in patients with acute respiratory\n      distress syndrome(ARDS).Though analyses of serum inflammatory factors such as tumor necrosis\n      factor (TNF)-\u03b1 and interleukin (IL)-6 have been used to determine the degree of systemic\n      inflammation under various clinical conditions, they can not reflect the degrees of lung\n      infection directly.\n\n      Basing on the results of previous studies, meta analyses and system reviews, the\n      investigators hypothesized that the anti-inflammatory function of ulinaststin may also\n      decrease the levels of inflammatory factors in bronchoalveolar lavage(BAL) fluid in Patients\n      with VAP.\n\n      In addition there is no prospective study to investigate the role of ulinastatin in BAL. The\n      investigator hopes that this study can approve the relationship between ulinastatin and\n      inflammatory factors in BAL. And it can improve the processes,outcomes and costs of critical\n      care as well."
