    <description>In the single dose regimen, 50 mg/m2 intramuscular methotrexate was given on day one and hCG level was measured on days four and seven. If the hCG level did not decrease by 15% between day four and seven, a second dose of methotrexate was injected on day seven, hCG level was measured weekly until a level of 15 mlU/ml or less was achieved</description>
