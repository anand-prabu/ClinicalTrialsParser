            "textblock": "Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is also known  recurrent polyserositis the most common\n      hereditary recurrent febrile disorder. It is characterized by paroxysmal episodes of the\n      high fever and signs of serositis-peritonitis, pleuritis, synovitis. Between these attacks,\n      patients are usually asymptomatic. FMF mainly affects populations of the Mediterranean\n      region such as Turks.\n\n      The diagnosis of FMF may be extremely difficult to establish in the presence of atypical\n      signs, and absence of family history . Colchicine is effective in most of the patients with\n      FMF. The one the most important complications of FMF is the development of renal\n      amyloidosis. It  potentially progress sequentially through preclinical, proteinuric,\n      nephrotic, azotemic and uremic stages to end stage renal disease if not treated properly\n      with colchicine. Previous studies suggests that colchicine does not appear to be a major\n      human teratogen, and, probably, has no cytogenetic effect.\n\n      FMF affects females mainly in their childbearing years. FMF is associated with higher rates\n      of recurrent abortion, premature rupture of membranes (PROM) and  preterm birth. Despite of\n      adverse outcomes have been reported in pregnants with FMF the outcome of pregnancies in FMF\n      appear favorable with the healthy population since the usingof the colchicine. Although the\n      effect of pregnancy on the course of FMF related amyloidosis is controversial, it is\n      generally accepted that renal function may disrupt  during pregnancy.\n\n      Few studies have investigated the effect of FMF complications (amyloidosis and nephrotic\n      syndrome) on pregnancy course.\n\n      The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of basal proteinuria on pregnancy outcome\n      of patients with Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF)."
