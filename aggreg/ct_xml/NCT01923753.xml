  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind randomised controlled crossover study to investigate whether high
      frequency airflow oscillation (HFAO), delivered using Aerosure, improves sputum clearance in
      patients admitted to hospital with infective exacerbations of cystic fibrosis (CF). This
      study will test the hypothesis that the wet weight of sputum expectorated is greater
      following the use of Aerosure than following the use of a sham Aerosure device.
