This study aims to\n      replicate this methodology in Vanuatu and Solomon Islands, to provide a more complete\n      picture of primaquine efficacy and safety in each of the three countries of this region."

Any signs of severe malaria (see WHO definitions) including: impaired consciousness,\n             respiratory distress, severe anaemia (Hb<5), multiple seizures, frequent vomiting/\n             inability to swallow tablets, prostration, jaundice, hypotension, abnormal bleeding\n             or hypoglycaemia.\n\n          2.
