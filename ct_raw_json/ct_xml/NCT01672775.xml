  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics and assess the
      immunogenicity and effectiveness of AGS-16C3F in subjects with renal cell cancer (RCC).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study has two components.  The first aims to establish a safe dose for AGS-16C3F.  Once
      identified, the safety and effectiveness will be tested in additional subjects with either
      clear cell or papillary histology in expanded cohorts.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Dose determination cohorts:  Histologically confirmed diagnosis of metastatic RCC of
             either clear cell or non-clear histology.

               -  Tumors with clear cell histology: subject must have progressed after at least
                  one anti-vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (anti-VEGFR) therapy

               -  Tumors with non-clear cell histology must be ectonucleotide
                  pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase family member 3 (ENPP3) positive at
