            "textblock": "The GyneFix-Viz is a frameless copper intrauterine device (IUD) used for contraception. The\n      GyneFix IUD has been marketed in Europe and Asia for about 10 years. The new anchor in the\n      GyneFix IUD was designed to be more visible on ultrasound and this could improve safety by\n      reducing failed insertions and perforations. We now need to know how easy it is for doctors\n      to see and measure the distance of the anchor to the outside of the uterus. The purpose of\n      this open, prospective, observational study is to assess the feasibility of measuring the\n      distance from the serosa of the uterus to the anchor following insertion of the GyneFix-Viz\n      and at follow-up 6-8 weeks later. Secondary objectives are to assess the ease and pain of\n      insertion, the acceptability of the device to Canadian women and any complications. We will\n      also compare expulsion rates in post-abortion and other women."
