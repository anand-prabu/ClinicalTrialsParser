The hypothesis is that milking the umbilical cord prior\n      to clamping is superior to simply delayed cord clamping, presumably providing an increased\n      blood volume to the preterm neonate improving its outcomes."

            "textblock": "The optimal timing for clamping the umbilical cord after birth in preterm infants has been a\n      subject of controversy and debate for many years.   It has been until recently the standard\n      practice in ob/gyn to clamp the umbilical cord immediately post delivery to allow for\n      immediate transition resuscitation of the neonate, especially in preterm infants.  Due to\n      the fact that optimal timing for cord clamping has yet to be definitively established in the\n      preterm population, more information is needed. Immediate cord clamping, however, could\n      preclude the infant from an extra boost in blood volume that may prove beneficial later in\n      the newborn life. Directly comparing the recently recommended practice of delayed umbilical\n      cord clamping to milking the umbilical cord prior to clamping has the potential to prove\n      beneficial for the neonates in question, as well as change daily obstetrical practices.  In\n      this study all infants below 34 weeks will be randomized into one of two groups: delayed\n      cord clamping and milking the umbilical cord prior to clamping. The decision was made not to\n      include immediate cord clamping due to a recent American Congress of Obsetricians and\n      Gynecologists (ACOG) recommendation that all preterm infants have their cord clamping be\n      delayed.  Their outcomes will be measured by serial hemoglobin and hematocrit levels while\n      in the NICU, the incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis, incidence of intraventricular\n      hemorrhage, and the need for neonatal blood transfusions."
