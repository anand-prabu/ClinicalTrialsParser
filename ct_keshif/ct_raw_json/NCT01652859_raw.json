Evidence of impaired renal function\n             as indicated by clinically significant abnormal creatinine or BUN values or abnormal\n             urinary constituents (e.g., albuminuria) as judged by the investigator. Evidence of\n             liver disease, hepatitis B, hepatitis C or liver injury as indicated by an clinically\n             significant abnormal liver function profile such as GOT, GPT, g-GT, alkaline\n             phosphatase, serum bilirubin, HBs Ag, or HCV Ab as judged by the investigator.\n\n          4.

Participation in any clinical investigation within 2 months or 5 half-lives,\n             whichever is longer, prior to investigational products administration.\n\n          6. Donation or loss of more than 500 mL blood within 3 months prior to investigational\n             products administration.\n\n          7. Subject is known for HIV infected.\n\n          8. Known allergy or hypersensitivity to amphotericin B or its analogs.\n\n          9. History of drug or alcohol abuse within 12 months prior to investigational products\n             administration ; current consumption of alcohol in excess of 28 units/week (one unit\n             is 6 oz of beer, \u00bd oz of hard liquor, or 2 oz of wine)\n\n         10. Subjects who, in the opinion of the investigator, should not participate in the study\n             or may not be capable of following the study schedule for any reason.\n\n         11. Consumption of more than 36 to 40 oz (1.1-1.2 L) of caffeine-containing beverages per\n             day\n\n         12.
