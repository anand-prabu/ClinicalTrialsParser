Therefore, the objectives for this study are to\n      compare the in vivo kinematic patterns for subjects implanted with either a Stryker\n      Triathlon CR total knee arthroplasty (TKA) or Zimmer PCR TKA design to determine if there\n      are any kinematic differences between these TKA designs and to compare the sounds emitted\n      from each kind of implant during activities. Each subject will be asked to undergo a\n      fluoroscopic evaluation while performing weight-bearing activities under surveillance using\n      the University of Tennessee's new mobile tracking fluoroscopic unit while wearing sound\n      sensors to correlate the sounds emitted from the implanted knees with the movements while\n      performing activities. The mobile fluoroscopy unit is approved for use by the State of\n      Tennessee on a study-by-study basis after IRB approval is obtained for each study."
