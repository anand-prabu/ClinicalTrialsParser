The\n      study doctor will choose the hormonal drug you receive based on your previous hormonal\n      therapy for breast cancer. The study doctor will give you instructions for taking your\n      hormonal drug.\n\n      Study Visits:\n\n      On Day 1 of Cycle 2:\n\n        -  Blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.\n\n        -  Blood (about 5 teaspoons) will be drawn for CTC testing and to check your immune\n           system.\n\n        -  Urine will be collected to test for a biomarker that is used to measure the rate of\n           bone breakdown.\n\n        -  If the study doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a PET scan, a bone scan, or an\n           MRI to check the status of the disease.\n\n      On Day 1 of Cycle 3, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for routine tests.\n\n      Length of Study:\n\n      You may receive the denosumab and hormonal therapy combination for up to 13 weeks. You will\n      be taken off study if the disease gets worse or intolerable side effects occur.\n\n      End of Study Visit:\n\n      After your last dose of the study drug, the following tests and procedures will be\n      performed:\n\n        -  You will have a physical exam.\n\n        -  Blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.\n\n        -  Blood (about 5 teaspoons) will be drawn for CTC testing and to check your immune\n           system.\n\n        -  Urine will be collected to test for a biomarker that is used to measure the rate of\n           bone breakdown.\n\n        -  If the study doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a PET scan, a bone scan, or an\n           MRI to check the status of the disease.\n\n      This is an investigational study.   Denosumab is FDA approved and commercially available to\n      prevent bone-related events caused by breast cancer that has spread to the bone. Using\n      denosumab to lower CTCs in patients with breast cancer that has spread to the bone is\n      investigational.\n\n      Up to 35 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson."
