Evaluate the toxicities of this drug\n      in this patient population.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive irinotecan intravenous (IV) over 90\n      minutes once a week for 4 weeks followed by a 2 week rest period. Treatment continues in the\n      absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Patients are followed every 3\n      months until death.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-32 patients will be accrued for this study."
