            "textblock": "Background:\n\n      - Malaria is caused by small germs carried by mosquitoes. People can get malaria if an\n      infected mosquito bites them. Malaria destroys red blood cells and reduces oxygen in the\n      blood. Most malaria is mild, but severe malaria kills at least 660,000 people each year.\n      About 75% of these are children in Sub-Saharan Africa, most under age 5. Researchers want to\n      find a safe vaccine that helps prevent malaria.\n\n      Objectives:\n\n      - To see if a new malaria vaccine is well tolerated and effective.\n\n      Eligibility:\n\n      - Healthy adults 18   35 years old who are not pregnant and live in Mali.\n\n      Design:\n\n        -  Participants will be screened with medical history, physical exam, and blood test. They\n           will also have an ECG. Soft electrodes will be stuck to the skin. A machine will record\n           the heart   s electrical signals.\n\n        -  Study participation will last about 1 year.\n\n        -  Participants will be randomly placed in 5 groups. Some will get 2 doses of the PfSPZ\n           vaccine weeks apart; some will get 3 or 5 doses of vaccine; some will get 3 or 5 doses\n           of placebo.\n\n        -  Doses will be given through a needle in the arm directly into the bloodstream. Then\n           participants must stay at the clinic for 2 hours.\n\n        -  After each dose, participants will return to the clinic several times for blood tests\n           and physical exam.\n\n        -  A week before the first dose and 2 weeks after the last, participants will take a full\n           course of anti-malaria drugs.\n\n        -  If a participant gets malaria during the study, they will take another course of\n           anti-malaria drugs."

            "textblock": "For decades it is known that humans can be protected against malaria by repeated\n      immunization with radiation-attenuated sporozoites. Traditionally, those sporozoites are\n      administered by exposing the vaccinee to at least 1000 bites of sporozoite-infected\n      irradiated mosquitoes, an approach that is unsuitable for mass vaccination campaigns.\n      Recently, Sanaria Inc. 1 has developed a process for manufacturing, in compliance with\n      current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMPs) aseptic, purified, radiation attenuated\n      cryopreserved sporozoites from a wellcharacterized isolate of P. falciparum. This product,\n      which is called PfSPZ Vaccine, can be administered by needle and syringe. Previous studies\n      conducted by the Vaccine Research Center, National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Navy\n      have established that IV administration of PfSPZ Vaccine can induce sterile protection\n      against controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) with a homologous strain of P. falciparum\n      in up to 100% of malaria na(SqrRoot) ve individuals.\n\n      The next logical step is to test the safety and immunogenicity of PfSPZ Vaccine in malaria\n      experienced individuals. As an exploratory objective, this study will collect initial data\n      to find out if the vaccine can protect against naturally occurring infection. Here, we\n      propose a randomized double blind controlled trial to assess the safety and immunogenicity\n      of IV administration of PfSPZ Vaccine in African adults.\n\n      Subjects will be recruited from a rural village in Mali. The study will be conducted as\n      collaboration among the Malaria Research and Training Center (MRTC, Mali), the Laboratory of\n      Malaria Immunology and Vaccinology (LMIV) National Institute of Allergy and Infectious\n      Diseases (NIAID), and Sanaria, Inc. Group 1 (n=12), will receive 135,000 PfSPZ Vaccine,\n      followed by 270,000 PfSPZ Vaccine 2 weeks later for safety purposes. An independent Data\n      Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will determine whether it is safe to proceed with 270,000\n      PfSPZ Vaccine.\n\n      At Study Week 4, Group 2 (n=50) will receive their first of 3 injections of 270,000 PfSPZ\n      Vaccine administered at 4, 12 and 24 weeks, alongside Group 3 (n=25), receiving a similar\n      volume of normal saline as placebo. Also at Study Week 4, Group 4 will receive their first\n      of 5 doses of 270,000 PfSPZ Vaccine given at 4, 8, 12, 16, and 24 weeks, alongside Group 5\n      (n=25) receiving a similar volume placebo. Safety data will be collected at defined time\n      points after each immunization. Two weeks after the last vaccination (Week 26) all subjects\n      will receive a full course of antimalarial treatment. From Week 28 until Week 48 all\n      subjects will be monitored for parasitemia detected by slide microscopy in bi-weekly\n      intervals, and by passive case detection."
