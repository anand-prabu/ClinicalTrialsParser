  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lazanda is a prescription nasal spray medicine that contains the medicine fentanyl.  It is
      used to manage breakthrough pain in adults with cancer who are already routinely taking
      other opioid pain medicines around-the-clock for cancer pain. Lazanda is started only after
      taking other opioid pain medicines and the patient's body has become used to them (opioid
      tolerant).

      The purpose of this study is to assess the ability of Lazanda to control pain during an
      episode of breakthrough pain in cancer patients.

    <description>The primary efficacy outcome measure is pain intensity difference at 15 minutes (PID15) after dosing during the Maintenance Stage. (PID15 is defined as the difference between pain intensity at 15 minutes and baseline.)Maintenance stage is defined as 6 breakthrough pain episodes for up to 6 weeks.</description>

    <time_frame>participants will be followed during maintenance phase, up to 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The key secondary outcome measure is the proportion of episodes that the patient defines as satisfactorily managed at 15 minutes.
Satisfaction will be considered to have been achieved for an individual episode of BTPc(Breakthrough pain)if the patient rates pain management as &quot;Satisfied&quot; or &quot;Very Satisfied.&quot; Patients complete a satisfaction questionnaire at end of study.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who meet the following criteria will be eligible:

               1. At least 18 years of age or older.

               2. Diagnosed with cancer.

               3. Have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0, 1, or
                  2.

               4. Patients with cancer who are experiencing episodes of BTPc in spite of optimized
                  background analgesia with at least 60 mg/day of morphine (or equivalent
                  analgesic) for at least 7 days.

               5. Patients with cancer currently using an SAO (short acting opioid) to manage
                  their episodes of BTPc.

               6. Patients with cancer who have failed to obtain a timely response, as determined
                  by the Principal Investigator, to pain from their SAO therapy.

               7. Laboratory values consistent with the stage of disease that are deemed
                  clinically insignificant by the investigator.

               8. Female patients of child bearing potential or male patients with partners of
                  child bearing potential who are using an adequate form of contraception before
                  study entry, and agree to use an adequate form of contraception for an
                  additional month after the study. Adequate contraception is defined as the use
                  of any hormonal contraception or intra-uterine device by the female
                  patient/partner plus use by at least 1 of the partners of an additional
                  spermicide-containing barrier method of contraception. The use of a barrier
                  method alone or abstinence is not considered adequate.

               9. Willing and able to give written informed consent before participating in the
                  study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients meeting the following criteria will be excluded from the study:

               1. Patients who are not opioid tolerant.

               2. Patients with a known intolerance or hypersensitivity to fentanyl.

               3. Physical abnormalities of the nose that could affect nasal absorption.

               4. Patients with uncontrolled or rapidly escalating pain.

               5. Patients with a history of alcohol or substance abuse.

               6. A clinically significant medical history (past or present) of any disease that
                  would compromise the study or the well-being of the patient .

               7. Patients who have participated in another clinical trial with an analgesic
                  within the last month.

               8. Patients who have previously used FCNS and did not have adequate responses.

               9. Female patients with a positive pregnancy test or who are currently lactating.

              10. Patients who are taking medications that are known inhibitors of the CYP3A4
                  isoenzyme, such as ketoconazole.

              11. Patients who have taken a monoamine oxidase inhibitor within 14 days before a
                  dose of study medication.

              12. Patients who are unsuitable for inclusion for any other reason, in the opinion
                  of the investigator.
