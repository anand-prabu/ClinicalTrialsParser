However, definitive\n      radiation treatments can cause side effects (like mouth sores, difficulty swallowing) that\n      often cause weight loss. It has been shown that a significant percentage of the weight loss\n      is due to loss of muscle mass. Resistance exercise training works to increase muscle\n      strength and endurance by doing repetitive exercises with weights, weight machines, or\n      resistance bands."
