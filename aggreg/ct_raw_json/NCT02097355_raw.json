            "textblock": "The Integrated Clinical Information Sharing System (ICISS) is a web-based patient management\n      and monitoring system designed to track patients' disease symptoms and response to therapy\n      over time. ICISS enables clinics to use electronic surveys to gather data remotely from\n      multiple responders, including patients, parents/guardians, school personnel and ancillary\n      providers, and view the responses in a timely manner via graphical, tabular, and narrative\n      summary formats.\n\n      This quality improvement (QI) initiative will implement ICISS as the standard of care for\n      all patients who receive care for ADHD, asthma, autism, depression, and epilepsy within\n      seven ambulatory specialties at Boston Children's Hospital. Patients and families will use\n      ICISS to report on patient health status and will complete clinically-relevant\n      questionnaires at routine intervals. Providers will use the information collected through\n      ICISS to inform their clinical care of the patient/family.\n\n      To evaluate the effectiveness of ICISS, we will conduct a 24-month phased, cluster\n      randomized controlled trial (RCT) where we randomize providers to \"active\" vs.\n      \"delayed-start\" to ICISS use, with patients clustered by provider (within specialties) for\n      analytic purposes. Delayed-start providers will crossover to active ICISS use after 12\n      months. Patients/families will complete additional surveys in  order to assess the system's\n      actual or potential effects on patient/family-provider interactions, healthcare utilization\n      and costs."
