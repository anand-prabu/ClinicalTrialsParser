Eighty healthy volunteers were evaluated; 40 women and 40 men divided into two equal\n      groups of young and elderly subjects.

The  threshold of sensory perception was\n      identified as the first sensation of increased current intensity and the threshold of motor\n      response as the minimum muscle contraction detected. The results were submitted to ANOVA\n      test, followed by the Tukey test, with a significance level of 5%."

At this point, the intensity was reset and the procedure began again, followed by the next pulse duration, progressively evolving up to 3000\u00b5s and repeated three times with a 10-minute interval between the tests.
