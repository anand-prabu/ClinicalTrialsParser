      This prospective, non-interventional, multi-center study documents observational data on
      subjects under routine treatment of Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension, functional class III
      with inhaled Iloprost administered with I-Neb AAD (Adaptive Aerosol Delivery) device. The
      observation period for each subject covers a one year treatment period with inhaled
      Ventavis. For each subject, the investigator or a delegate collects data as defined in the
      case report form at an initial visit, routine follow-up visit at 6 months and final visit at
      12 months.
