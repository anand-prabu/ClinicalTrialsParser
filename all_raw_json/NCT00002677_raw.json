Determine the toxic effects of tributyrin in these patients. III. Determine the\n      pharmacodynamics of tributyrin, including modulation of tumor markers, evaluation of\n      clinical remission (when possible), assessment of F-reticulocytes and/or F cells, and\n      evaluation of hemoglobin F before and after treatment, in these patients.\n\n      IV. Determine the pharmacokinetics of tributyrin, including maximum plasma concentration,\n      terminal half-life, area under the concentration time curve, volume of distribution, and\n      clearance of butyrate, in these patients.\n\n      V. Determine the relationship between the pharmacokinetics and toxic or therapeutic\n      pharmacodynamic effects of butyrate in these patients.\n\n      VI. Calculate a tributyrin dose, using results from pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic\n      studies, that achieves sustained butyrate concentrations capable of increasing therapeutic\n      effects with reduced toxicity.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study.\n\n      Patients receive oral tributyrin every 8 hours for 3 weeks. Treatment continues every 4\n      weeks for 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients\n      who achieve stable disease may receive additional courses at the discretion of the protocol\n      chairperson. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of tributyrin until the\n      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at\n      which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity."
