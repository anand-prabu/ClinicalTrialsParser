Cohort 4 will have 10 subjects randomized to receive active drug (7 subjects)\n      or placebo (3 subjects). Each cohort will be divided into at least 2 groups; the first group\n      will have 2 subjects, 1 receiving active drug and 1 receiving placebo. Dosing of the\n      remaining 6 subjects in each cohort will be completed in a manner agreed upon by the Sponsor\n      and the Principal Investigator in keeping with the randomization schedule and blinded\n      conditions.\n\n      The planned cohorts are:\n\n      Cohort    CARD-024 Dose*\n\n        1. 3 \u03bcg\n\n        2. 9 \u03bcg\n\n        3. 27 \u03bcg\n\n        4. 81 \u03bcg"
