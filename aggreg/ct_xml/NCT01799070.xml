    <textblock>
      Background: Cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome (CHS) is a life threatening complication of
      carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and the changes of middle cerebral artery velocity are used to
      predict the occurrence of CHS but the accuracy is limited. In addition, changes of BP
      post-operatively comparing with baseline BP should be a predictive factor of CHS.

      Objective: The investigators aimed to create a predictive index, velocity systolic blood
      pressure index (VSI), for improving the predictive power of Transcranial Doppler monitoring
      regarding CHS.

      Methods: The study design is a diagnostic test, which is an observational analytic clinical
      study. From March 2013 to September 2014, 200 patients will be recruited. Patients will be
      classified according to the CHS occurrence. VSI combined the changes of middle cerebral
      artery velocity and blood pressure crossing CEA and the intra- and post-operative increase
      ratios of middle cerebral artery velocity were calculated. Their prediction power of CHS
      will be compared. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive
      value of them will be calculated. Receiver operating characteristic analysis will be
      performed.

      Expected Outcomes: Comparing with the commonly used intra-operative and post-operative TCD
      monitoring, VSI may be more useful to select CHS in patients who underwent CEA. As far as
      the investigators know, analysis or studies combining the BP and velocity changes in the
      prediction of CHS have never been performed.

    <textblock>
      This study is designed as a standard diagnostic test. It is designed to verify the
      predictive power of VSI with CHS, and which is an observational analytic clinical study. The
      investigative parameters of patients will be collected prospectively by the designed case
      report form. According to the incidence of CHS, the estimated enrollment amount is set as
      200. Patients will be recruited by the inclusion and exclusion criteria below. All the
      patients included will accept the standard CEA surgery treatment in the department of
      vascular surgery of PUMCH. MCAV and systolic BP data will be recorded cross CEA.
      Post-operatively the CHS patients will be identified according to the golden standard. The
      golden standard is the clinical diagnose of CHS (the detailed diagnostic criteria will be
      stated in the methodology part). The TCD operator is blind to the patients. The predictive
      power of VSI will be identified by the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value,
      negative predictive value and ROC plot comparing with the golden standard. The study start
      date is March 2013, the estimated study completion date is December 2014 and the primary
      completion date is September 2014 (final data collection date for primary outcome measure).

    <description>CHS will be diagnosed if (1) the patient developed symptoms that ipsilateral moderate or severe headache, confusion, seizures, intracranial hemorrhage or focal neurological deficits after a symptom-free interval. (2) symptoms not secondary to cerebral ischemia which will be excluded by CT or MRI. (3) MCAV increasing &gt;100% from baseline which identified by TCD. (4) within 7 days after surgery. (5) An independent neurologist made the diagnosis of CHS.</description>
