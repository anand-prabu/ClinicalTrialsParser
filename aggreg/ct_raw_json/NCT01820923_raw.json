Each coherence map will be proportionally thresholded, preserving 50% of the strongest coherence values, to produce a weighted adjacency matrix. The estimated functional connectivity patterns will be characterized by means of two global network metrics derived from graph theory: modularity and global efficiency. Modularity measures how the network is organized into modules with high level clustering. Global efficiency measures how efficient the network is in exchanging information at the global level.",
