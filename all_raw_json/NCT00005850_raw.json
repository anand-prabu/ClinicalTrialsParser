To test the feasibility of conducting a multi-center clinical trial of fluoxetine\n           administered by oncologists concurrently with chemotherapy in patients with non-small\n           cell lung cancer.\n\n      Secondary Objectives:\n\n        1. To describe the tumor response rate associated with the administration of\n           gemcitabine/cisplatin in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.\n\n        2. To describe the overall survival and failure-free survival associated with the\n           administration of gemcitabine/cisplatin.\n\n        3.
