            "textblock": "Today prostate cancer (PC) treatment with curative intent is primarily surgical removal of\n      the prostate gland (prostatectomy) which may be associated with immediate and long lasting\n      erectile dysfunction and decline in urinary function. Besides these physical late effects\n      patients operated for PC have a twofold increased risk for depression up to ten years after\n      the diagnosis. To reduce these late effects affecting both patient and partner the\n      investigators have developed a sexual and urological intervention (PROCAN). The intervention\n      is based on epidemiological data, evidence from previous clinical trials, a feasibility\n      study and qualitative explorations among PC patients and partners. The investigators hereby\n      suggest the conduction of a randomized controlled trial to test the effect of the PROCAN\n      intervention on urological and sexual dysfunction, couples adjustment and quality of life.\n      Results of the proposed trial may provide clinicians and decision makers with the evidence\n      needed to optimize rehabilitation after PC."

            "textblock": "Although the potential negative impact of prostate cancer on sexual and urological function\n      is well documented there is no evidence based and standardized rehabilitation offer\n      available for Danish couples affected by prostate cancer. This study proposal is based on a\n      thorough literature review on PC treatment and late effects and interventions targeting\n      sexual and urological late effects and a qualitative study including interviews with 6\n      couples affected by PC. The literature review showed that; medical treatment is effective\n      for the treatment of erectile dysfunction, psychosocial intervention may ease sexual\n      problems secondary to operation for prostate cancer and sexual counseling may improve\n      compliance with medical treatment of erectile dysfunction. In regard to treatment of\n      urological dysfunction studies showed that the effect of pelvic floor muscle training is\n      enhanced by follow-up instructions by physiotherapist. Our interview study among patients\n      operated for prostate cancer and their partners indicated a general need and demand for\n      professional help to discuss the changed sexual life.  Also studies have shown that health\n      professionals find it difficult to discuss sexual problems with the patients. Medical\n      treatment for erectile dysfunction is prescribed to patients operated for prostate cancer,\n      however the treatment is not offered systematically in all hospitals and furthermore the\n      drugs are sold on the internet.In view of this knowledge we determine that there is a need\n      for studies which include patients  systematically offered medical treatment for erectile\n      dysfunction and further is offered sexual counseling and thus focusing on: i) treatment of\n      physical, psychological and social aspects of sexual dysfunction ii) improvement of\n      compliance with the medical treatment for erectile dysfunction and iii) reducing barriers\n      among patients and health professionals for resolving sexual problems secondary to operation\n      for prostate cancer.\n\n      The purpose of the PROCAN study is in a randomized design to test the effect of a theory\n      based intervention on sexual and urological dysfunctions secondary to operation for prostate\n      cancer. The PROCAN intervention consists of: i) Digital Video Disc (DVD) instruction in\n      pelvic floor muscle training ii) group instructions in pelvic floor muscle training by\n      physiotherapist including up to three individually follow-up and ii) up to six couple\n      sessions performed by a sexual nurse counselor. The intervention is based on social and\n      cognitive behavioral techniques and techniques derived from sexual therapy and counseling\n      with a psycho-educational approach, in which sexuality is defined as a multidimensional\n      construct involving biological, psychological and social aspects. The intervention is\n      documented and developed in collaboration with urologists, physiotherapists and sexologists.\n      The investigators will enroll patients and partners from the Urological Department\n      Rigshospitalet and randomize 160 couples. Patients and partners will be randomized (1:1) to\n      standard care plus the PROCAN intervention and to standard care (control Group). The\n      investigators hypothesize that the PROCAN intervention will:\n\n        -  Improve urological and sexual functioning among prostate cancer patients and sexual\n           function and satisfaction among patients and female partners\n\n        -  Improve the dyadic adjustment and the overall quality of life in prostate cancer\n           patients and their partners\n\n        -  Reduce the prevalence of depression and anxiety in patients and their partners"
