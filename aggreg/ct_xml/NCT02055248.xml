      Background:

      - Moebius syndrome limits the ability to make facial expressions     like smile, frown or
      blink - and move the eyes laterally. It can also cause speech, swallowing or breathing
      difficulties and affect parts of the body, such as the limbs, jaw, muscles, or the heart.
      Some individuals with Moebius can have intellectual impairment or behavior problems.
      Researchers want to study the clinical features of individuals with Moebius or related
      disorders and explore the genetic and/or environmental causes of these conditions.

      Objective:

      - To learn more about the genetics and clinical characteristics of Moebius syndrome and
      other Congenital Facial Weakness disorders.

      Eligibility:

      - People ages 2 to 80 years with congenital facial weakness, isolated or combined with other
      congenital anomalies, and their family members.

      Design:

        -  Participants with Moebius syndrome or other congenital facial weakness disorder will be
           evaluated at the NIH Clinical Research Center over 3 to 5 days and undergo the
           following procedures:

        -  Medical and family history and physical examination, including body measurements and
           vital signs.

        -  Blood or saliva will be collected for genetic tests and to evaluate liver, kidney,
           heart and hormonal

      functions.

        -  Eye examination, including having a video taken of their eyes moving.

        -  Hearing evaluation.

        -  Speech and language assessment, including swallowing studies.

        -  Dental exam.

        -  Detailed neurological evaluation, including electromyogram/nerve conduction and blink
           reflex study.

        -  Rehabilitation medicine evaluation, including muscle and tongue strength testing and
           assessment of balance.

        -  Neurocognitive and behavioral testing and questionnaires to assess quality of life and
           copying mechanisms.

        -  Imaging studies of their head, by magnetic resonance and diffusion tensor imaging
           -MRI/DTI. Participants

      will lie on a table that slides into a metal cylinder that takes images of internal body
      structures using

      magnets. Child participants may be sedated.

        -  Some adults may have additional X-rays of their head or limbs, if there are abnormal
           findings.

        -  Medical photographs of the face and affected body parts may be taken.

        -  Other specialized tests or consultations, as indicated.

        -  Participants can choose to have a skin biopsy taken.

        -  A follow-up visit will be offered to participants for review of genetic test findings
           and possibly additional clinical tests, as indicated.

      Family members of the patients will have a medical and family history and physical
      examination. Blood or saliva will be obtained for genetic studies.

      This is a natural history study with a cross-sectional design of Moebius syndrome (MIM
      157900), a heterogeneous developmental disorder defined as a congenital, non-progressive
      facial weakness with limited abduction of one or both eyes, often associated with additional
      features such as other cranial nerve dysfunction, craniofacial, skeletal and limb
      deformities, as well as intellectual or behavioral impairments. In this study we will
      attempt to characterize the clinical phenotype of Moebius and associated congenital facial
      weakness syndromes, collect thorough information on possible prenatal environmental
      exposures and use genetic studies, including whole exome sequencing, on DNA from patients
      and family members of patients to identify disease-causing genes. We will also conduct brain
      magnetic resonance- and diffusion tensor imaging- studies in these patients in order to
      explore brainstem and cranial nerve structure and associated white matter tract anomalies.
      Through this combined clinical, molecular and imaging approach, we anticipate that
      phenotype-genotype correlations will be revealed. These results will lead to new insights
      into the clinical definition of these conditions, molecular pathways, and potential networks
      involved in the pathogenesis of facial weakness and associated multisystem dysmorphogenesis.
      Our population will consist of patients, ages 2 to 80 years, inclusive of any gender, race,
      or ethnic group, with congenital facial palsy, isolated or combined with other congenital
      anomalies, and their families. We will recruit approximately 24 probands each year of the
      first three-years of the study, ages 2 to 80 years, inclusive of any gender, race, or ethnic
      group, and their parents and unaffected family members for a total of 72 patients/families.
      In most cases, patients will be referred through the Moebius Syndrome Foundation, a patient
      organization with a current membership of 2000 people in its database, 1400 of whom have
      been diagnosed with Moebius syndrome. Outcome measures will include the results from a
      battery of clinical evaluations, including ophthalmology, audiology, neurology, psychiatry,
      and rehabilitative medicine. Patients will also undergo neurocognitive and autism screening
      assessments, electromyography/nerve conduction, and blink reflex studies. Imaging and
      genetic studies will provide the most robust data for analysis in this study. A skin biopsy
      may be performed on some patients in order to culture fibroblasts for additional
      biochemical, cell biological, and molecular analyses.
