A large amount of trimmings from\n      various fish species such as cod is thrown away or sold at very low prices for animal feed,\n      and analyses of the amino acid composition reveals that this can be a good protein source\n      for humans. Two fractions are normally isolated from intact fish meal, i.e. water soluble\n      and non-water soluble proteins. In the present study the investigators will compare these\n      fractions, by studying their effects on glucose homeostasis and inflammatory markers in\n      overweight/obese adults."
