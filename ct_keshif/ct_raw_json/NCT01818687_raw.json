Such subjects do not\n             require wash-out and should proceed to baseline for the next visit if additional\n             screening visits are not required.\n\n        Baseline inclusion criteria for subjects treated with phosphate binders:\n\n          -  The subject must enter the wash-out period, during which he/she must demonstrate\n             serum P levels >1.5 SD above the KDOQI 2008 age-related mean value at any time during\n             the wash-out period (after stopping phosphate binders), and;\n\n          -  The subject must demonstrate an increase in serum P levels by at least 10% above the\n             pre wash-out level (after stopping phosphate binders).\n\n        Note: should a subject fail to meet any of the above criteria, the subject is permitted to\n        be re-screened once after an interval of at least three months.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  The subject has been diagnosed with hypocholesterolaemia (i.e., cholesterol levels\n             below age-related normal ranges, per local practices)\n\n          -  The subject has current clinically significant medical comorbidities, which may\n             substantially compromise subject safety, or expose him/her to undue risk, or\n             interfere significantly with study procedures and which, in the opinion of the\n             Investigator, make the subject unsuitable for inclusion in the study (e.g., the\n             subject currently has or has had a history of seizure disorders, dysphagia,\n             swallowing disorders, predisposition to or current bowel obstruction, ileus or\n             gastrointestinal [GI] disorders such as chronic or severe constipation [as judged by\n             the Investigator], intestinal stenosis, intestinal diverticulum, sigmoid colitis, GI\n             ulcers, current or a history of GI bleeding, or major GI tract surgery)\n\n          -  The subject cannot stop treatment (prescription or over the-counter) of any of the\n             following orally taken medications during the wash-out period: any product containing\n             calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), aluminium compounds, sevelamer, lanthanum, ketosteril\n\n          -  The subject is receiving immunosuppressant treatment for any medical condition at the\n             baseline visit or is expected to receive such treatment during the course of the\n             study\n\n          -  The subject is considered as unstable on his/her current treatment for CKD within one\n             month prior to screening (e.g., subjects starting treatment with vitamin D or its\n             analogues, or other agents/procedures that may influence bone mineral metabolism\n             [i.e, serum P and Ca levels]\n\n        Exclusion criteria for subjects treated with phosphate binders:\n\n          -  The subject was treated with a combination of two or more phosphate binders within\n             one month prior to screening"
