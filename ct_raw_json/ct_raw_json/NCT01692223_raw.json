Genome sequencing can study all of a person's genome\n      (whole genome sequencing) or just parts of their genome (whole exome sequencing). In the\n      study, the investigators refer to all these research methods as 'genome sequencing'. Genome\n      sequencing typically shows a large number of gene changes, known as \"variants.\" Some (but\n      not all) of these genetic variants may be linked to increased risks of diseases other than\n      cancer.\n\n      The purpose of this study is to learn what kinds of genetic variants the patient wants to\n      learn about from their genome."
