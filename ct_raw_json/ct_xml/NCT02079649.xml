    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate two investigational ophthalmic solutions for
      reduction in ocular redness in subjects with allergic conjunctivitis. Eligible subjects will
      attend 8 study visits, 5 of which include a 3-hour period of ragweed exposure in an
      Environmental Exposure Chamber. At the sixth visit, subjects will receive study product and
      begin dosing for up to 9 days.  The final visit will be the final day of dosing.
      Participation in this study will last up to 68 days.
