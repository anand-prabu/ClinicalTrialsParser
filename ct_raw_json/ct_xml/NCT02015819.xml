    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of genetically-modified neural
      stem cells and flucytosine when given together with leucovorin calcium in treating patients
      with recurrent high-grade gliomas. Placing the gene for Escherichia coli (E. coli) cytosine
      deaminase into neural stem cells may improve the body's ability to fight cancer or make the
      cancer more sensitive to chemotherapy. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as flucytosine, work
      in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by
      stopping them from dividing. Leucovorin calcium may help flucytosine kill more tumor cells
      by making tumor cells more sensitive to the drug. Giving genetically-modified neural stem
      cells and flucytosine with leucovorin calcium may be an effective treatment for high-grade
      gliomas.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To define the phase II recommended dose of intercerebrally administered cytosine
      deaminase (CD)-expressing neural stem cells (NSCs) (E. coli CD-expressing genetically
      modified neural stem cells) in combination with oral 5-fluorocytosine (FC) (flucytosine) and
      leucovorin.

      II. To determine the feasibility of treating study patients with more than 1 dose of NSCs
      followed by 7-day courses of 5-FC and leucovorin.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess for possible development of NSC immunogenicity (anti-NSC T cell and/or antibody
      response) with repeat doses of NSCs.

      II. To characterized the relationship between intracerebral and systemic concentrations of
      5-FC and 5-FU at the maximum tolerated dose level.

      III. To evaluate the intracerebral distribution of NSCs using iron-labeling as a cellular
      tracker.

      IV. To describe the clinical benefit (defined as stable disease, partial response, or
      complete response) of this treatment regimen.

      V. To determine, at time of autopsy, the fate of the NSCs.

      OUTLINE: This is dose-escalation study of E. coli CD-expressing genetically modified neural
      stem cells and flucytosine.

      Patients receive E. coli CD-expressing genetically modified neural stem cells intracranially
      (IC) on days 1 and 15 and flucytosine orally (PO) every 6 hours and leucovorin calcium PO
      every 6 hours on days 4-10 and 18-24. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3 months, 6 months, 1 year,
      and then annually thereafter.
