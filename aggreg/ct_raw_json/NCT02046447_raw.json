The drug,\n      trihexyphenidyl, is FDA approved to treat Parkinson's Disease and is commonly prescribed by\n      physicians as a treatment for symptoms of primary cervical dystonia."

During the experiment, you may be asked to complete\n      the following: (1) questionnaires about quality of life and depression; (2) tests to measure\n      your strength and motor function; (3) tests to measure your cognition; (4) functional and\n      structural MRI scan of your brain while performing a precision gripping task; (5)\n      intravenous blood draw; (6) urine pregnancy test (if applicable); (7) trial of\n      anticholinergic therapy drug trihexyphenidyl (if applicable - cervical dystonia only).\n\n      Participants with DYT 1 dystonia and healthy controls are not eligible to receive the trial\n      drug.  All women of childbearing potential will be given a urine pregnancy test.  The\n      questionnaire about depression will not be given to subjects under the age of 18.\n\n      If you have any metal in your eye or eyes, the researchers may require additional screening\n      to ensure that it is safe for you to enter the MRI environment.  If additional screening is\n      determined to be necessary, you will be referred to Radiology at Shands UF for an\n      orbitofrontal x-ray.\n\n      Blood will be collected for all subjects, including healthy control subjects.  The blood may\n      be analyzed, at the University of Florida, to assess potential biomarkers for cervical\n      dystonia and DYT 1 dystonia.
