  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a great need for new therapies for carcinomas that have progressed on or not
      responded to current therapy. There are no approved Met targeted agents in standard clinical
      use. In the population of subjects with advanced carcinomas that are unresponsive to
      standard of care, and based on the relatively safe, reversible and monitorable toxicity
      profile of ASLAN002 in non clinical studies, the potential for benefit from ASLAN002
      outweighs the potential risks for toxicity.

      The purpose of this study is to identify the maximum tolerated dose of ASLAN002 in subjects
      with advanced or metastatic solid tumours, as well as to define the overall safety profile
      of ASLAN002.

      The purpose of the study is

        -  To identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of ASLAN002  in subjects with advanced or
           metastatic solid tumours

        -  To define the overall safety profile of ASLAN002

        -  To assess the effects of ASLAN002  on overall cardiac function as measured by blood
           pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, and left ventricular
           function

      Secondary:

        -  To characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of ASLAN002  and its N-oxide metabolite,
           following single and multiple dosing

        -  To provide a preliminary assessment of anti-tumour activity, as assessed by the Overall
           Response Rate (ORR) and changes from baseline in tumour size
