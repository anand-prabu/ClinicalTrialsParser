            "textblock": "Study Groups:\n\n      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a\n      combination dose level of the study drugs based on when you join this study.  Up to 6\n      participants will be enrolled at each dose level. The first group of participants will\n      receive the lowest dose level of LDE225.  Each new group will receive a higher dose than the\n      group before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen.  All participants will receive\n      the same dose level of everolimus.  This will continue until the highest tolerable\n      combination dose of LDE225 and everolimus is found.  Up to 24 participants will be enrolled\n      in this part of the study.\n\n      Once the highest tolerable dose of the combination of LDE225 and everolimus is found, up to\n      18 participants will receive the combination dose level that was found to be well tolerated\n      in the earlier part of the study.\n\n      Study Drug Administration:\n\n      Every study cycle is 28 days.\n\n      You will take up to 4 capsules or tablets of LDE225 by mouth 1 time every day.  Your doctor\n      will tell you how many capsules/tablets you will need to take.  You should take the study\n      drug each time with a glass of water (about 8 ounces total) at the same time every day.  You\n      should swallow the study drug whole, one capsule/tablet every 2 minutes, without chewing or\n      opening the study drug.  You should eat a light breakfast (such as toast and jam) at least 2\n      hours before taking the study drug, then you should not eat or drink anything for at least 1\n      hour after the dose.\n\n      You will take up to 2 tablets of everolimus by mouth 1 time every day with the LDE225\n      capsules without food.  You will take the tablets each time with a glass of water at the\n      same time every day.  The tablets should be swallowed whole and not chewed or crushed.\n\n      If you cannot swallow the everolimus tablets, the tablets should be dissolved in water just\n      before taking them.  Add about 2 tablespoons of water into a glass.  The tablets should then\n      be added and stirred gently until the tablets are dissolved.  This mixture should then be\n      drunk.  Afterwards, the glass should be rinsed with an additional 2 tablespoons of water and\n      drunk.  Your doctor will discuss this with you.\n\n      If you vomit after taking your dose of study drugs, you should not take another dose that\n      day.\n\n      It is very important that you take the study drugs given to you just as the study doctor\n      tells you and that you do not miss any dose.  If you forget to take a dose of LDE225, take\n      it as soon as you remember (within 6 hours of the missed dose).   If more than 6 hours have\n      passed, skip that dose and take your next dose the next day as planned.  If you forget to\n      take a dose of everolimus, skip that dose and take your next dose the next day as planned.\n\n      If you have a study visit that day, you should take your dose of study drugs at the clinic.\n\n      You will need to store LDE225 in your refrigerator at all times.  Everolimus can be stored\n      at room temperature.  You should not share your supply of LDE225 and everolimus with anyone.\n       You will keep a study drug diary to help you keep track of your study drug doses.  If you\n      miss or delay a dose, you should write it down in the diary.  You should bring the diary to\n      every study visit.\n\n      At the end of each cycle and when you stop taking part in the study, you will return any\n      leftover study drugs to the study nurse.\n\n      Study Visits:\n\n      On Day 1 of every cycle:\n\n        -  You will have a physical exam.\n\n        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.\n\n        -  If you can become pregnant, blood (about 1 teaspoon) or urine will be collected for a\n           pregnancy test.\n\n      On Day 1 of Cycle 2 and every 2 cycles after that, you will have an EKG.\n\n      On Day 1 of Cycle 3 and every 2 cycles after that, you will have a CT scan or MRI of the\n      chest, abdomen, and pelvis to check the status of the disease.\n\n      If the doctor thinks it is needed, extra blood may be drawn to follow up on any side\n      effects.\n\n      Length of Study:\n\n      You may continue taking the study drugs for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best\n      interest.  You will no longer be able to take the study drugs if the disease gets worse, if\n      intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.\n\n      Your participation on the study will be over after the follow-up visit (described below).\n\n      End-of-Study Visit:\n\n      Within 14 days after your last dose of study drugs:\n\n        -  You will have a physical exam.\n\n        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, to check the cholesterol\n           levels in your blood, and to check how well your blood clots.  You will need to fast\n           for at least 8 hours before this blood draw.\n\n        -  You will have an EKG.\n\n        -  You will have a CT scan or MRI of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis to check the status of\n           the disease, if the doctor thinks it is needed.\n\n        -  If you can become pregnant, blood (about 1 teaspoon) or urine will be collected for a\n           pregnancy test.\n\n      Follow-Up Visit:\n\n      At 30 days after the end-of-study visit:\n\n        -  You will have a physical exam.\n\n        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.\n\n        -  You will have an EKG.\n\n        -  If you can become pregnant, blood (about 1 teaspoon) or urine will be collected for a\n           pregnancy test.\n\n      About 3 months after the follow-up visit, you will be contacted by the study staff by\n      telephone and/or seen in the clinic.  You will be asked about any drugs you may be taking\n      and about your general health.  If you are called, the call will take about 5-10 minutes.\n\n      This is an investigational study.  LDE225 is not FDA approved or commercially available.\n      Everolimus is FDA approved and commercially available to treat kidney, breast, and\n      pancreatic cancers.  The combination of LDE225 and everolimus to treat esophageal or GEJ\n      cancer is investigational.\n\n      The study doctor can explain how the study drugs are designed to work.\n\n      Up to 42 participants will be enrolled in this study.  All will take part at MD Anderson."

Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women.\n\n          7. Women of child-bearing potential (WOCBP), defined as all women physiologically\n             capable of becoming pregnant, must use highly effective methods of contraception\n             during the study and 6 months after. Hormonal contraception methods (e.g. oral,\n             injected, implanted) are not allowed as it cannot be ruled out that the study drug\n             decreases the effectiveness of hormonal contraception. Highly effective contraception\n             methods include combination of any two of the following: a) Placement of a\n             non-hormonal intrauterine device (IUD) or non-hormonal intrauterine system (IUS); b)\n             Barrier methods of contraception: condom or occlusive cap (diaphragm or\n             cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/ vaginal suppository; c.\n             Total abstinence (When this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the\n             patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,\n             post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.);\n\n          8. (Continued from # 7): or d) Male/female sterilization. (Sterilization: Patient has\n             had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation\n             at least six weeks before taking study treatment. In case of oophorectomy alone, only\n             when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone\n             level assessment. Male partner sterilization (with the appropriate post-vasectomy\n             documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate). [For female study patients,\n             the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that patient.]).\n\n          9. (Continued from # 8): Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child-bearing\n             potential if they have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an\n             appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or\n             have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal\n             ligation at least six weeks prior to randomization. In the case of oophorectomy\n             alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up\n             hormone level assessment is she considered not of child-bearing potential.\n\n         10. Male patients whose sexual partner(s) are WOCBP who are not willing to use adequate\n             contraception, during the study and for 6 months after the end of treatment (Male\n             patients must use highly effective (double barrier) methods of contraception (e.g.,\n             spermicidal gel plus condom) for the entire duration of the study, and continuing\n             using contraception and refrain from fathering a child for 6 months following the\n             study drug. A condom is required to be used also by vasectomized men as well as\n             during intercourse with a male partner in order to prevent delivery of the study\n             treatment via seminal fluid.).\n\n         11. Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial\n             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic\n             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse\n             events.\n\n         12. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic\n             composition to LDE 225 or Everolimus in the study or other rapamycin analogs (e.g.\n             sirolimus, temsirolimus).\n\n         13. Patients who are receiving treatment with medications known to be moderate and strong\n             inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4/5 or drugs metabolized by CYP2B6 or CYP2C9 that have\n             narrow therapeutic index, and that cannot be discontinued before starting treatment\n             with LDE225. Medications that are strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors should be discontinued\n             at least 7 days and strong CYP3A/5 inducers for at least 2 weeks prior to starting\n             treatment with LDE225.\n\n         14. Patients receiving any medications or substances that are inhibitors or inducers of\n             CYP 450 3A4 are ineligible.\n\n         15. Patients who have neuromuscular disorders (e.g. inflammatory myopathies, muscular\n             dystrophy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and spinal muscular atrophy) or are on\n             concomitant treatment with drugs that are recognized to cause rhabdomyolysis, such as\n             HMG CoA inhibitors (statins), clofibrate and gemfibrozil, and that cannot be\n             discontinued at least 2 weeks prior to starting LDE225 treatment. Patients who are\n             planning on embarking on a new strenuous exercise regimen after initiation of study\n             treatment, should also be excluded. Muscular activities, such as strenuous exercise,\n             that can result in significant increases in plasma CK levels should be avoided whilst\n             on LDE225 treatment.\n\n         16. Concurrent medical condition requiring the use of immunosuppressive medications or\n             immunosuppressive doses of systemic or absorbable topical corticosteroids (doses\n             greater than 10mg/day prednisone or equivalent). Inhaled or intranasal\n             corticosteroids (with minimal systemic absorption) may be continued. Non-absorbed\n             intra-articular steroid injections are allowed. The exception to the use of steroids\n             is the treatment of serious adverse events (SAEs) such as pneumonitis and the\n             prevention of emesis.\n\n         17. Known history of HIV seropositivity.\n\n         18. Patients who have received live attenuated vaccines within 1 week of start of\n             Everolimus and during the study.\n\n         19. Impaired cardiac function or clinically significant heart disease, including any one\n             of the following: a) Angina pectoris within 3 months; b) Acute myocardial infarction\n             within 3 months; c) QTcF greater than 450 msec for males and greater than 470 msec\n             for females on the screening electrocardiogram (ECG); d) A past medical history of\n             clinically significant ECG abnormalities or a family history of prolonged QT-interval\n             syndrome; e) Other clinically significant heart disease (e.g. congestive heart\n             failure, uncontrolled hypertension, history of labile hypertension, or history of\n             poor compliance with an antihypertensive regimen).\n\n         20. All patients known to be positive for hepatitis B will be excluded from the study,\n             and those at high risk for hepatitis B infection will be screened."
