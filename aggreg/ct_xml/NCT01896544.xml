  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sepsis in a clinical entity that occurs in patients with serious infections. Though the
      severity of illness may vary, every year, approximately 1.6 million Americans are treated
      for sepsis. Even with timely interventions, anywhere from 16% to &gt;80% of patients with
      sepsis will not survive. Immune dysfunction is thought to play a critical role in the
      ability for infections to evolve into sepsis and to eventually lead to death. Recently,
      vitamin D has been identified as a key regulator of the immune system. While it remains
      unclear whether optimizing vitamin D status may improve outcomes in sepsis, little is known
      about the effects of vitamin D supplementation in patients with severe infections. As such,
      our goal is to study whether high doses of cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) can improve vitamin
      D status and boost certain aspects of the immune system in patients with sepsis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sepsis is a clinical syndrome that complicates severe infections. It is characterized by the
      cardinal signs of inflammation (e.g. vasodilation, leukocytosis, increased microvascular
      permeability) occurring in tissues that are remote from the site of an infection. Current
      theories about the onset and progression of the sepsis syndrome focus on dysregulation of
      inflammatory responses, including the possibility that a massive and uncontrolled release of
      pro-inflammatory mediators initiates a chain of events that lead to widespread tissue
      injury. The degree of immune dysfunction is thought to correlate with the severity of the
      sepsis syndrome. Sepsis syndrome can range from sepsis, to severe sepsis, septic shock, and
      multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). The mortality associated with each of these is
      estimated to be 16%, 20%, 46%, &gt;80%, respectively. The annual incidence of sepsis syndrome
      exceeds 1.6 million cases in the United States alone.

      Recently, cells of the innate and adaptive immune system have been shown to express the
      vitamin D receptor. Vitamin D appears to be necessary for interferon-γ dependent T cell
      responses to infection. In low vitamin D states, dysfunctional macrophage activity becomes
      evident. Vitamin D is also an important link between Toll Like Receptor (TLR) activation and
      antibacterial response. Human macrophages stimulated by TLR induce: 1) vitamin D receptor
      expression; 2) conversion of 25(OH)D to its most biologically active form of
      1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D; and 3) production of cathelicidin (LL-37), an endogenous
      antimicrobial peptide with potent activity against bacteria, viruses, fungi, and
      mycobacteria. LL-37 is highly expressed in both the plasma and at natural barrier sites
      (e.g. skin, gut, lungs) and may represent an important first-line of defense for the innate
      immune system.

      In humans, cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) is either obtained through the diet or synthesized
      by skin upon exposure to ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation. Cholecalciferol is converted to
      25(OH)D in the liver or by cells of the immune system. Serum 25(OH)D can be measured with
      relative ease and is the most abundant vitamin D metabolite. It is therefore, often used as
      a proxy for total body vitamin D status and 25(OH)D levels &lt;30 ng/mL characterize an
      insufficient state. A growing body of evidence suggests that a significant proportion
      (50-90%) of critically ill patients may have insufficient 25(OH)D levels during admission to
      the intensive care unit (ICU). 25(OH)D insufficiency, in turn, appears to be associated with
      a higher risk of mortality in critically ill patients. However, randomized,
      placebo-controlled trials (RCTs) aimed at studying the effect of vitamin D supplementation
      in critical illness are limited and have largely focused on superficial assessments of
      vitamin D status. While it is known that septic patients have nearly universally low 25(OH)D
      levels and that the vitamin D levels are inversely correlated with the severity of sepsis,
      little is known regarding the effects of vitamin supplementation in this patient cohort.
      Therefore, our goal is to determine whether vitamin D supplementation in patients highly
      suspected of sepsis syndrome may be effective in optimizing 25(OH)D levels and in improving
      host production of the antimicrobial polypeptide LL-37.
