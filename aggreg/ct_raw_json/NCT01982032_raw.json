            "textblock": "Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is a good alternative treatment for patients\n      with severe aortic valve stenosis with similar mid-term success rates as compared to\n      surgery. Periprosthetic aortic regurgitation (PAR) after TAVR remains an important\n      limitation of this technique. Moderate to severe PAR occurs in 15-45% of the cases and it is\n      an independent predictor of mortality after TAVR. Little is known about potential\n      differences in severity of PAR among different types of aortic valve prosthesis. The current\n      randomized study aims to evaluate potential differences between the Edwards SAPIEN\n      bioprosthesis and the Medtronic CoreValve\u00ae system with main focus on PAR and additional\n      focus on other clinical and imaging endpoints. Primary objective of this study is to\n      investigate the difference in the severity of PAR, measured with 3-dimensional\n      transesophageal echocardiography (3DTEE), between patients undergoing the implantation of\n      the Edwards SAPIEN bioprosthesis versus patients receiving the Medtronic CoreValve\u00ae\n      bioprosthesis. Secondary objectives of this study include: investigating the value of\n      different imaging modalities in evaluating periprosthetic regurgitation after TAVR and\n      studying the difference in clinical endpoints according to VARC-2 definitions and quality of\n      life after TAVR between two available aortic valve prostheses."
