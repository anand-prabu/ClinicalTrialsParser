Compare the clinical benefit of\n      these regimens as measured by improvement in pain and performance status in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter study. Patients are randomized 2:1 to\n      irofulven and fluorouracil treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive irofulven IV over 30\n      minutes on days 1 and 15. Arm II: Patients receive fluorouracil IV continuously on days\n      1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 350 patients (233 for arm I and 117 for arm II) will be\n      accrued for this study."
