  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate long-term safety and effectiveness of the NuNec速
      Cervical Arthroplasty System in a small patient population.  The NuNec device is currently
      CE marked and commercially available in Europe.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The NuNec速 feasibility study is a prospective, multi-centered, non-randomized clinical
      trial.  Only patients who have been diagnosed with single level, C3 to C7, symptomatic
      cervical degenerative disc disease and have failed at least 6 weeks of conservative
      treatment or present signs of progression of spinal cord/nerve root compression with
      continued non-operative care will be enrolled.

      Patients will be evaluated preoperatively and postoperatively at discharge, 6 weeks, 3, 6,
      12 and 24 months.

          -  chemical dependency problem that may interfere with study requirements

          -  current smokers
