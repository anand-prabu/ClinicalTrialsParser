Enrollment into Group 1 (control group with normal hepatic function) should be similar to the enrollment into Group 2, 3 and 4 with respect to age, gender, and body weight. Enrollment into Group 1 will remain open until the enrollment into the mild, moderate, and severe impairment groups are complete with matching controls for comparison. Serum level of total bilirubin will be used to determine which group the hepatic impaired patient will be allocated l. Dosing of the different treatment groups will be staggered. Initially, 6 subjects in Group 1 (normal hepatic function) and 6 subjects in Group 2 will receive a single oral dose of MEK162 on Day 1."

A minimum of 24 evaluable\n      subjects (6 subjects per group) will be enrolled. The groups are: Group 1-healthy\n      volunteers, Group 2-Mild hepatic impairment, Group 3-Moderate hepatic impairment and Group\n      4-Severe hepatic impairment.   Once approved for enrollment, participants will be confined\n      to the facility for 5 days, given a single dose of MEK162 and monitored for safety\n      assessments, labs and PK will be assessed."
