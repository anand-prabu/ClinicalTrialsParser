    <textblock>
      When a doctor performs Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography &quot;ERCP&quot;  (Endoscopy to
      examine the bile duct) a flexible tube is inserted into the mouth and into the stomach. The
      tube passes beyond the stomach and into an opening in the liver called the bile duct.
      Another small flexible endoscope is inserted inside the ERCP scope to directly visualize the
      bile duct to ensure that there are no cancers or stones in the bile duct and occasionally to
      take a sample from the bile duct. The purpose of our study is to examine wither performing
      this procedure can transmit bacteria from the bile duct to the main blood stream.

      This is a prospective study to measure the frequency of bacteremia in patients undergoing
      ERCP with direct cholangioscopic examination of the Common Bile Duct &quot;CBD&quot;. A blood culture
      will be drawn from patients prior to the procedure, 5 minutes after the procedure and 30
      minutes after the procedure. The patient will be followed up for 7 days after procedure for
      fever and sepsis. The estimated sample size is 60 patients.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  1- Adult patients (18-80) who are undergoing ERCP with direct cholangioscopic
             examination of the common bile duct to ensure the clearance of the common bile duct
             from stones.

             2- Adult patients (18-80) who are undergoing ERCP with direct cholangioscopic
             examination of the common bile duct for  stone removal.

             3- Adult patients (18-80) who are undergoing ERCP with direct cholangioscopic
             examination of the common bile duct for tissue acquisition from the common bile duct
             mass.

             4- Adult patients (18-80) who are undergoing ERCP with direct cholangioscopic
             examination of the common bile duct for tissue acquisition from common bile duct
             strictures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  1- Patients younger than 18 yrs old or older than 80 yrs. 2- Pregnant patients. 3-
             Patient with ascending cholangitis, pneumonia or urinary tract infection 4- Patients
             who received antibiotics in the last 2 weeks prior to the procedure.
