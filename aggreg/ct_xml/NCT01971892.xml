  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute respiratory failure may occur early in the postoperative course, requiring
      endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation in selected patients, thus increasing
      morbidity and mortality and prolonging intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital stay.We will
      perform a multicenter, prospective, randomized clinical trial to compare the efficacy of non
      invasive ventilation (NIV) which associated pressure support ventilation (PSV: 5 to 15
      cmH2O) and positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP: 5 to 10 cmH2O) with standard oxygen
      therapy in the treatment of postoperative acute respiratory failure. We also set out to
      examine the hypothesis that early application of NIV may prevent intubation and mechanical
      ventilation in patients who develop acute respiratory failure after abdominal surgery.

      The Non-Invasive Ventilation After Surgery (NIVAS) is an investigator-initiated,
      multi-center, stratified, two-arm parallel-group trial with a computer-generated allocation
      sequence and electronic system based randomization. The study protocol and statistical
      analysis plan were approved for all centers by a central Ethics Committee (France) according
      to French law.The NIVAS study is conducted in accordance with the declaration of Helsinki
      and was registered on August 2013.All centers have a long experience with NIV (more than 10
      years of NIV use for ARF, and more than 5 years of NIV use for ARF following abdominal
      surgery). Randomization will stratified by department, age (less or more 60 years), site of
      surgery (upper or lower abdominal) and according to the presence or absence of postoperative
      epidural analgesia as this may influence outcomes. Treatment assignments will concealed from
      patients, research staff, the statistician, and the data monitoring and safety committee.
