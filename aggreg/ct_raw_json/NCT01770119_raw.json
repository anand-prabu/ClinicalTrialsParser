The lot number and the expiration date will both be recorded\n      on the patient's case report form (CRF). A serological evaluation 4-8 weeks after MMR will\n      identify children requiring an additional dose given 1-2 months apart, as currently\n      recommended for subjects 1 year-old or with limited immune competence (i.e. HIV-infected\n      children). Serological evaluation 4-8 weeks after the second dose or at the one-year\n      follow-up will identify eventual non-responder requiring a third dose. Three will be the\n      maximal number of administrated dose according to this protocol. The persistence of\n      measles-specific antibodies will be assessed yearly, when patients come for their routine\n      visit to the transplant center.\n\n      Children who do not need MMR immunization because of protective levels will be monitored\n      yearly for maintenance of antibody levels during routine yearly visits/ blood samplings and\n      will not have further intervention."
