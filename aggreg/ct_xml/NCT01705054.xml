      The purpose of this study is describe the frequency of chest pain and how chest pain impacts
       patients' quality of life in the outpatients with chronic coronary artery disease in
      contemporary cardiology practice settings.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary goals in the management of stable coronary artery disease (CAD) are to reduce
      risk factors for heart attack and to control the symptoms of angina (chest pain). Ideally
      angina is well controlled with medications alone, but  invasive procedures are a valuable
      option for patients with persistent angina. The amount of angina among patients with stable
      CAD in the outpatient setting, however, is unknown.  An Australian study reported that
      almost 1 in 3 patients with stable angina being treated by primary care doctors had angina
      at least once a week, which was associated with worse quality of life. We propose to examine
      the burden of angina in outpatients with stable CAD who are being medically managed by
      cardiologists in the United States through administration of a one-time survey.  The
      information from this study could ultimately help improve management of stable CAD and
      angina and illuminate potential underuse of revascularization.  While cardiologists are
      generally expected to provide better angina control than primary care doctors, establishing
      the prevalence of angina among the best providers will help with a framework for
      interpreting symptom control among other practitioners.
