ASCT2 is widely expressed in gastric cancer and increased expression levels\n      correlate with poor tumor prognosis. The preliminary in vitro studies indicated that the\n      anti-tumor activity of K94 is through antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity (ADCC),\n      complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and through inhibition of glutamine uptake. These\n      observations suggest that the K94 mAb can have an efficient ADCC activity against gastric\n      cancer cells by patient`s derived PBLs."

            "textblock": "Despite multimodality therapy, including surgical resection combined with chemotherapy and\n      chemo-radiotherapy, gastric cancer remains the second leading cause of cancer death\n      worldwide; the prognosis of patients with advanced disease is dismal. To improve clinical\n      outcomes, more specific and effective treatment must be developed. Recently, based on the\n      RCT with Herceptin against HER2-expressing gastric cancer, immunotherapy with mAbs having an\n      ADCC activity is considered to be a promising tool as novel strategies for gastric cancer.\n      In fact, Herceptin has been approved by FDA for HER2-positive advanced gastric cancer.\n      Pharmaceutical company, Kyowa Hakko Kirin (KHK) has recently developed a humanized IgG1\n      monoclonal antibody (K94) against the ASC-like Na(+)-dependent neutral amino acid\n      transporter 2 (ASCT2) using the POTELLIGENT\u00ae technology. POTELLIGENT\u00ae technology is a\n      technology developed to amplify the Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) of\n      antibodies through de-fucosylation of the N-linked sugar at amino acid ASN 297 of the heavy\n      chain. ASCT2 regulates the uptake of glutamine, which is critical for tumor cell metabolism.\n      It is widely expressed in various tumors, including gastric cancer and increased expression\n      levels correlate with poor tumor prognosis. Although preliminary in vitro studies indicated\n      that the anti-tumor activity of K94 is through ADCC, complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC)\n      and through inhibition of glutamine uptake, there is no solid conclusion regarding the ADCC\n      using peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) from gastric cancer patients.Based on the research\n      collaboration between NUS, NUH and Kyowa Hakko Kirin (SINGAPORE) Pte. Ltd (KKSG), we are\n      planning to perform a panel of in vitro experiments using PBLs donated by gastric cancer\n      patients at NUH and by healthy donors in order to evaluate the efficacy and mechanisms of\n      K94 mAb against gastric cancer cells.Although immunotherapy with mAbs having an ADCC\n      activity is considered to be a promising tool as novel strategies for gastric cancer, it is\n      well-known that NK cells exerting an ADCC activity are functionally impaired in gastric\n      cancer patients and the number of CD56dim NK cells was down-regulated both in patients` PBLs\n      and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). In order to further develop the new mAb, K94, the\n      evaluation of K94 mAb-mediated ADCC activity by patient-derived PBLs is important and vital.\n      Thus, we are planning to perform the in vitro ADCC assay by using PBLs donated from gastric\n      cancer patients and healthy donors to determine if the K94 mAb has efficient ADCC activity\n      against gastric cancer cells"
