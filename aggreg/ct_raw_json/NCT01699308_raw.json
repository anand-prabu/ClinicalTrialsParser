To meet this aim, we are in the process of screening 40\n      persons with mild to severe TBI, ages 18-55, who are at least six months post injury. After\n      screening, 10 persons with TBI and GHD (Growth Hormone deficiency) will receive daily rhGH\n      injections titrated to bring their GH levels into the normal range over the course of twelve\n      months. Treatment will be initiated using rhGH (Genotropin).  Subjects with TBI and GHD will\n      be assessed at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months with EEG, fMRI and DTI, and\n      neuropsychological measures. 5 persons with TBI who do not have GHD will be assessed at\n      baseline and at 12 months with EEG, fMRI and DTI, and neuropsychological measures."
