In total between 60\n      and 70 eyes will be included in the study. Pre-operative examinations are included to\n      confirm to the clinical practice. Examinations on the day of surgery and any occurrence\n      during the procedure are also listed. Post-operative examinations, which should document any\n      occurrence, the outcome of and possible differences between the treatment techniques, are to\n      be carried out after 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months and 6 months. After 6 month a final\n      report including the study results will be produced.\n\n      The study is carried out in compliance with MEDDEV 2.7.1 Evaluation of Clinical Data: A\n      Guide for Manufacturers and Notified Bodies, ICH E6 (R1) Good Clinical Practice (GCP),\n      Declaration of Helsinki as well as the applicable local regulations such as notification\n      requirements and current order of profession of the primary investigators."
