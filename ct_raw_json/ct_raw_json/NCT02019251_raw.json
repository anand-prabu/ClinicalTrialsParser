            "textblock": "This is an open label study in up to 10 lung transplant recipients post lung transplantation\n      whose post-transplant status is being monitored according to local standard of care.  Each\n      subject will receive up to 20 liters of PFP/oxygen gas mixtures as a contrast agent to\n      visualize the airway and alveolar spaces in their lungs using 19F magnetic resonance imaging\n      of inert gas/oxygen mixtures.\n\n      The goal of this study is to evaluate the utilization of conventional 'thermally' polarized\n      perfluorinated gases mixed with oxygen as an exogenous inert contrast agent to image the\n      airway spaces in subjects with transplanted lungs.  This is an open label proof of concept\n      study expanding on work here at Duke.\n\n      The central hypothesis and current observation is that PFx gases, when used as contrast\n      agents, provide functional images of the lung airways including important regional\n      ventilation information such as ventilation defect severity and gas trapping. We will test\n      the central hypothesis and accomplish the overall objective by addressing the following\n      specific aims:\n\n      Primary Study Aims/Secondary Aims Aim 1: Determine qualitative and quantitative measures of\n      lung ventilation performance in terms of ventilation efficiency during wash-in evaluation of\n      the 19F images of lung airspaces.\n\n      Aim 2:  Determine qualitative and quantitative measures of lung ventilation performance in\n      terms of direct measures of gas trapping measured during washout of the perfluorinated gas\n      mixture.\n\n      The outcomes of the work proposed in the aims is expected to demonstrate a non-invasive\n      novel quantitative approach for evaluation of regional lung function in subjects with lung\n      transplants that would allow repeated evaluation of lung function post-transplant to monitor\n      for chronic allograft rejection."
