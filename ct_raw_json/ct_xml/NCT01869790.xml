      The purpose of this study is examine the effect of different fat types on postprandial
      glucose control in patients with type 1 diabetes.

      Subjects will have several admissions and, in random order, will receive lunches with
      identical carbohydrate content but different fat content: lunch A will minimal fat content,
      lunch B will contain added butter, lunch C will contain added olive oil, and lunch D will
      contain added cheese. Total fat content in lunches B-D will be the same.  Subjects will
      receive identical insulin doses (calculated using the subject's usual
      insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio) for the meals.

      The investigators hypothesize that, despite identical carbohydrate content,the lunches
      higher in saturated fat will lead to more postprandial hyperglycemia than the lunch
      containing minimal fat and the lunch high in monounsaturated fat.

      The hypothesis is that from time points 0-180 minute area under the curve for Lunches A, B,
      C, and D will be the same, whereas from time points 180-360 minutes for Lunch B and D will
      be greater than that of Lunch A and C.

      Subjects for this study will be adults with type 1 diabetes who use insulin pump in their
      diabetes self-management. Prior to admission the the clinical research center the basal
      rates and insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio of the subjects will be optimized using standard
      clinical procedures.

      Subjects will be admitted to the clinical research center in mid-morning following a light
      breakfast at home. Subjects will have several admissions and, in random order, will receive
      lunches with identical carbohydrate content but different fat content: lunch A will minimal
      fat content, lunch B will contain added butter, lunch C will contain added olive oil, and
      lunch D will contain added cheese. Total fat content in lunches B-D will be the same.
      Subjects will receive identical insulin doses (calculated using the subject's usual
      insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio) for the meals. Blood samples for measurement of plasma
      glucose and insulin levels will be drawn for the subsequent 6 hours. We hypothesize that
      postprandial glucose levels 3-6 hours after start of the meal will be higher following
      lunches B and D, compared to lunches A and C.
