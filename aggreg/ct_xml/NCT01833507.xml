  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is common in adults with complex medical problems with ensuing complications
      afterwards.  Obese patients suffer higher mortality and impaired functional status often as
      a result of their obesity.  One primary goal to reduce both obesity and improve functional
      status is exercise.  The investigators hypothesize that a simple exercise intervention with
      limited behavioral goal-setting will reduce weight and increase functional status compared
      to usual care.  As a secondary measure, the investigators hypothesize that using this
      intervention will reduce hospital admissions and ER visits.
