The study visits will consist of 6 visits:\n      pre-study (optional), Baseline, Weeks 1, 2, 3 and 4. The ointment should be applied at least\n      2 hours  before or at least 30 minutes after bathing, showering, shaving, use of sauna, or\n      heavy exercise (i.e. causes sweating). On study visit days, the ointment should be applied\n      at least 2 hours before the visit. Efficacy evaluation will be done at all subsequent study\n      visits in participants receiving study drug for at least 3 consecutive days (minimum of 5\n      applications) while the participants who will receive at least 1 application of the study\n      drug, will be evaluated for safety. Primary efficacy evaluation will be based on the\n      Physician's Global Evaluation of Clinical Response (PhGECR). Participants' safety will be\n      monitored throughout the study."
