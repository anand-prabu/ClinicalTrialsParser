Indications for this procedure are chiefly lack of peripheral catheters,\n      administration some medications, renal replacement therapy, parenteral nutrition and\n      hemodynamic monitoring.\n\n      The procedure is performed by percutaneous puncture of large vein of the neck and the thorax\n      - internal jugular vein or subclavian vein, then insertion of guidewire through the needle\n      and placement of the catheter over the guidewire. The tip of the catheter is situated in the\n      superior vena cava.\n\n      There are two techniques of catheterizations: landmark-based and ultrasound-guided. The most\n      frequently cannulated veins in landmark-based approach are internal jugular and subclavian\n      vein. The cannulation of the axillary vein is not common procedure in the intensive care\n      unit, mainly due its complicated original technique.\n\n      The primary intention of this study was to describe and assess usefulness and safety of the\n      new landmark-based technique of catheterization of the axillary vein in patients admitted to\n      the intensive care unit."
