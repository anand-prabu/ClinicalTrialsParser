However, several variables may exclude patients\n      from these treatments such as multiple tumors, multiple previous surgeries, pulmonary\n      dysfunction, or co-morbid medical conditions.  For these patients, percutaneous cryoablation\n      may be a suitable option.\n\n      Ablation of metastatic lung tumors is a rapidly  expanding area within interventional\n      oncology.  Cryotherapy, radiofrequency, laser and microwave have all been shown to be\n      effective.  Cryotherapy offers a wide range of anatomic and tumor treatment options because\n      of the ability to visualize the ice under imaging guidance  and the preservation of\n      collagenous tissue structure.  Cryoablation has been extensively performed in the prostate\n      and  kidney with favorable  outcomes reported in the literature.  More recently,\n      cryoablation has been shown to be safe in the treatment of lung tumors with CT guidance."
