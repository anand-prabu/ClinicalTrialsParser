Determine the safety, tolerability, and optimal clinical dose of\n      interleukin-4(38-37)-PE38KDEL cytotoxin (NBI-3001) followed by surgical resection in\n      patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-escalation, multicenter study. Patients receive\n      interleukin-4(38-37)-PE38KDEL cytotoxin (NBI-3001) intratumorally as a continuous infusion\n      over 4-5 days beginning within 12-36 hours after ventricular catheter placement. Patients\n      then undergo surgical tumor resection approximately 3 weeks after drug infusion. Cohorts of\n      6 patients receive escalating doses of NBI-3001 until the maximum tolerated dose is\n      determined. Patients are followed within 1 week and then at 8, 16, and 26 weeks.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 30-36 patients will be accrued for this study."
