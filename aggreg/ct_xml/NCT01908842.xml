      The purpose of this study is to assess treatment efficacy and adherence of
      OX219(Buprenorphine/Naloxone) versus SUBOXONE Film (Buprenorphine/Naloxone)and to explore
      switching between treatments.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, multicenter, parallel-group, active-controlled
      non-inferiority study comparing treatment efficacy and adherence of the sublingual (SL)
      tablets of OX219 versus SUBOXONE Film during the first 15 days of treatment and to explore
      switching between OX219 and SUBOXONE Film treatments.

      Approximately 787 opioid-dependent adult subjects will be screened.

      Total study treatment 36 days (screening 1-7 days) , number of visits 9-10.
