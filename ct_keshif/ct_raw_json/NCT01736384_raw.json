The investigators\n      will also study if adenovirus infection can influence the outcome after surgery. In a\n      subgroup of patients, hormonal changes after gastric by-pass surgery will be assessed. Lipid\n      and protein patterns will be assessed in plasma and tissues. Omental and subcutaneous fat as\n      well as liver biopsies and whole blood are stored in a biobank. The same tissues will be\n      collected from non-obese controls undergoing gallbladder surgery."
