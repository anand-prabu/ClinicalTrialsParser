Group Tizanidin (Group T)\n      will receive 4 mg tizanidin per oral twice a day during the postoperative first week and the\n      first dose was administered 1 hour before surgery. Group Placebo (Group P) will receivedthe\n      same treatment with a placebo sugar pil Heart rate (HR), peripheral oxygen saturation\n      (SpO2), systolic arterial pressure (SAP), diastolic arterial pressure (DAP) and mean\n      arterial pressure (MAP), end tidal CO2 pressure (EtCO2), end tidal desflurane concentration\n      (Et Des) and the bispectral index (BIS) will be monitored. Baseline values will recorded.\n\n      All patients will receive dexketoprofen 50 mg intravenous before the induction of\n      anesthesia. Anesthesia induction and muscle relaxation will be standardized with 2 mg kg-1\n      propofol, 0.6 mg kg-1 rocuronium and 50 \u00b5g fentanyl. Anesthesia will be maintained with\n      oxygen in nitrous oxide and desflurane. The desflurane concentration will be titrated to\n      keep BIS between 40-60. The patients will receive 50 \u00b5g fentanyl boluses in case hemodynamic\n      variables changed \u226530% from baseline values. Hypotension will be defined as \u226520% decrease in\n      MAP from baseline values and will be treated with fluid boluses and efedrin. Bradycardia\n      will be defined as a heart rate <50 beat min and will be treated with atropine. All\n      treatments will be recorded. At the end of surgery volatile anesthesia will be discontinued\n      and the patients will be extubated according to clinical extubation criteria. The time\n      elapsed from discontinuation of volatile anesthesia  to eye opening with verbal commands\n      will be recorded as time to emergence. The patients will be transferred to the post\n      anesthesia care unit (PACU). The modified Aldrete score will be used to evaluate recovery in\n      the PACU and the patients will be discharged from the PACU when the Aldrete score is \u22659 ( ).\n      Time spent in the PACU will be recorded. Post operative pain will be evaluated with a Visual\n      Analogue Scale (VAS) score of 0-10 (0= no pain and 10= worst imaginable pain) at 1, 6 and 24\n      hours postoperatively. Dexketoprofen 25 mg oral 3X1 will be used for post operative\n      analgesia. Acetaminophen 500 mg iv will be used for rescue analgesia if pain scores are >3.\n      On discharge, patients will be instructed to use dexketoprofen 25 mg 3 times a day, the\n      study drug twice a day and as rescue analgesic acetaminophen 500 mg up to 4 times a day. The\n      patients will be instructed to contact the hospital if they have pain despite all three\n      medications. During the control visit 1 week after surgery total analgesic consumption and\n      analgesic related adverse events (nausea, vomiting, dizziness\u2026) will be evaluated.\n      Difficulty with normal daily activity will  also be evaluated during this visit with the\n      Likert score (1; no difficulty, 2; mild difficulty, 3; difficulty,  4; severe difficulty, 5;\n      unable to perform daily activity due to pain). Return to daily activity will also be\n      evaluated 6 weeks after surgery; the SF-36 will be used for this purpose ( ).\n\n      Main outcome measures are the postoperative VAS scores, Likert scores and the SF-36 scores\n      of the patients. Total analgesic consumption and analgesic related side effects, intra\n      operative hemodynamic variables and desflurane consumption, will also becompared."
