However, the successful outcome of variceal\n      bleeding is compromised in some patients because of initial failure to control bleeding or\n      early re-bleeding, both of which have a significant impact on mortality.\n\n      The SX-Ella Danis stent (Ella-CS, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic) is a removable, covered,\n      self-expanding mesh-metal stent (SEMS) that can be deployed in the lower oesophagus over an\n      endoscopically placed guidewire without radiological screening. The stent controls bleeding\n      by tamponade of varices in the lower oesophagus.\n\n      The series reported to date suggest that the self-expandable covered stents can provide 100%\n      haemostasis rates when applied for refractory oesophageal variceal bleeding.  Given the\n      potentially lower risks of re-bleeding and safe, easy insertion techniques the\n      self-expandable covered stents may offer a superior alternative to standard endoscopic\n      therapy."
