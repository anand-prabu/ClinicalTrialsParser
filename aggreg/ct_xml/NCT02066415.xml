      Phase 2, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of patients with
      chronic migraine. Approximately 490 subjects will be randomized 3:2:2 to receive either
      placebo, AMG 334 subcutaneous (SC) every month for the duration of the12-week double-blind
      treatment phase. There will also be a 12-week safety follow-up (16 weeks ) after the last
