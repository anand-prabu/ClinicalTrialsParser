  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The experience of negative emotions is associated with an increased risk of incident
      atherosclerosis-related cardiovascular disease (CVD) events, independent of traditional risk
      factors.  The strongest data supporting this relation is with provoked anger. There is also
      some evidence that becoming acutely depressed or anxious are also triggers of incident CVD.
      The underlying putative mechanisms are poorly understood. Vascular endothelial cells (ECs)
      play an essential role in maintaining vascular tone and the integrity of blood vessels.
      Evidence suggests that dysfunction of the endothelium is an early pathogenic process
      underlying atherosclerosis development and CVD event onset. The aims of this study are to
      primarily examine the acute effects of provoked anger and secondarily depressed mood and
      anxiety on EC health. Examination of these critical pathways will help determine whether
      endothelial dysfunction is a biological mechanism linking the experience of core negative
      emotions and incident CVD risk. In this application, a state-of-the-art, laboratory-based,
      randomized controlled experiment is proposed that will test whether provoked anger,
      depressed mood and anxiety will induce endothelial dysfunction in humans. We hypothesize
      that compared to an emotionally neutral condition, an anger recall task will impair
      endothelium-dependent vasodilation, injure ECs, and reduce EC reparative capacity.  We will
      also examine whether a depressed mood and anxiety induction task will similarly induce
      endothelial dysfunction, as well as whether levels of provoked self-reported anger,
      depressed mood, and anxiety are associated with the degree of endothelial dysfunction.
      Finally, given that endogenous nitric oxide (NO) inhibition plays a central role in
      exacerbating endothelial dysfunction, we will explore whether NO inhibition partially
      mediates the acute adverse effects of provoked anger, depressed mood, and anxiety on
      endothelial function. In the United States, atherosclerosis-related CVD events remain the
      leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Further, anger, depressed mood, and anxiety are
      negative emotions commonly experienced by adults in the general population on a day-to-day
      basis. Therefore, evaluation of these hypotheses is timely and highly significant, as it
      will help identify a putative biological pathway linking the experience of core negative
      emotions to CVD incidence, for a large number of individuals who are at increased risk for
      CVD events.

    <textblock>
      Atherosclerosis-related cardiovascular disease (CVD) events remain the leading causes of
      morbidity and mortality in industrialized nations. Atherosclerosis is a diffuse disease
      characterized by the deposition of lipid and other blood-borne material within the arterial
      wall. Evidence demonstrates that disruption of an arterial atherosclerotic plaque and
      subsequent thrombus formation is responsible for the onset of CVD events. Cardiovascular
      research efforts have been directed toward the identification of early underlying factors
      that initiate this cascade.

      It has been known for some time that the experience of negative emotions is associated with
      an increased risk of incident CVD events, independent of traditional risk factors. Among the
      best-studied negative emotions is anger. Population-based studies have demonstrated that the
      experience of anger is a trigger of incident CVD events. The mechanism(s) by which provoked
      anger acutely affects the pathways that underlie atherosclerosis development and progression
      remain to be fully characterized.

      Endothelial dysfunction is a promising mechanism that may explain the link between anger and
      incident CVD events. Vascular endothelial cells (ECs) play essential roles in maintaining
      vascular tone and the integrity of blood vessels.  Evidence suggests that endothelial
      dysfunction is an early pathogenic process underlying atherosclerosis development and CVD
      event onset. Our preliminary findings show in apparently healthy individuals, an anger
      recall task acutely induces endothelial dysfunction by impairing endothelium-dependent
      vasodilation, injuring ECs, and disrupting the molecular processes underlying EC reparative
      capacity. We have additionally found that this task may induce endogenous nitric oxide (NO)
      inhibition, which plays a central role in aggravating endothelial dysfunction. Therefore, NO
      inhibition may partially mediate anger-provoked endothelial dysfunction.

      Although the strongest data are on anger-provoked CVD events, there is also some evidence
      that the experience of other core negative emotions such as depressed mood and anxiety may
      trigger CVD events.  Whether the provocation of depressed mood and anxiety acutely induces
      endothelial dysfunction and NO inhibition remains to be determined. The overall aim of this
      study is to primarily examine the acute effects of provoked anger and secondarily depressed
      mood and anxiety on EC health. We will also explore whether NO inhibition partially mediates
      the acute effects of anger, depressed mood, and anxiety on endothelial function. Examination
      of these critical pathways will help identify the biological pathways by which the
      experience of core negative emotions leads to incident CVD risk.

      To address these highly significant research questions, we propose a state-of-the-art,
      laboratory-based, randomized controlled experiment in which 280 participants will be
      randomized to one of four experimental conditions: an anger recall task (N=70), a depressed
      mood recall task (N=70), an anxiety recall task (N=70), and an emotionally neutral condition
      (N=70). Our specific study aims and hypotheses are as follows:

      Primary Hypotheses:

      Compared to the neutral condition, the anger recall task will acutely induce endothelial
      dysfunction by: impairing endothelium-dependent arterial vasodilation (Hypothesis 1a);
      increasing circulating levels of EC-derived microparticles (EMPs), a marker of EC injury
      (Hypothesis 1b); and reducing circulating levels of bone marrow-derived endothelial
      progenitor cells (EPCs), a marker of EC reparative capacity (Hypothesis 1c).

      Secondary Hypotheses:

      Compared to the neutral condition, the depressed mood and separately the anxiety recall
      tasks will acutely impair endothelium-dependent arterial vasodilation, increase circulating
      levels of EMPs, and reduce circulating levels of bone marrow-derived EPCs. There will be a
      relation of the level of self-reported anger, depressed mood, and anxiety with endothelial
      dysfunction.
