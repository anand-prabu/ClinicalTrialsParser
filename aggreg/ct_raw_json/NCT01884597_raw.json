Major surgery is defined as a surgical procedure that is more\n             extensive than needle biopsy/aspiration placement of a central venous access device,\n             removal/biopsy of a skin lesion, or placement of a peripheral venous catheter.\n\n          -  Myocardial infraction, other cardiac event requiring hospitalization, stroke,\n             transient ischemic attack, or treatment for acute congestive heart failure within 6\n             months prior to randomization.\n\n          -  Systemic anti-VEGF or pro-VEGF treatment within 3 months prior to randomization.\n\n          -  History of recurrent significant infections or bacterial infections\n\n          -  Pregnancy (positive pregnancy test) or lactation\n\n          -  Premenopausal women not using adequate contraception.
