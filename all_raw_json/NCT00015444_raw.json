The screening visit will include review of outside\n      medical records, neurological examination, and diagnostic testing to determine possible\n      causes of spasticity. Patients fulfilling the clinical criteria for primary lateral\n      sclerosis by history or examination will be followed to determine the natural history of\n      this disorder. Measures of motor and cognitive function will be made at baseline and\n      follow-up visits to follow clinical progression. Magnetic resonance imaging will be carried\n      out to determine if imaging changes occur over time.
