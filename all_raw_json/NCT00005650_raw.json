Blood collection and/or a buccal scrape is also performed for genetic studies.\n\n      Genetic studies include molecular linkage analyses, genetic mapping, and gene mutation\n      identification based on large deletions.  Microsatellite markers are used to identify\n      polymorphism.\n\n      Genetic counseling is provided to all participants."
