    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial is to show that an hypoallergenic infant starter formula
      containing starch and the probiotic L. reuteri decreases the severity of
      regurgitation/spitting-up in infants presenting regurgitation/spitting-up , and who have
      taken it for 4 weeks, in comparison with a standard infant starter formula.

      The primary objective of this trial is to show that the test formula (HA formula + starch +
      L. reuteri) decreases the severity (frequency + volume) of regurgitation/spitting-up in
      infants and ultrasound gastric emptying time, compared to a classical infant starter
      formula.
