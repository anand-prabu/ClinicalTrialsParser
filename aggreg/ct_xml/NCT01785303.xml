  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this project is to determine the efficacy of a multidisciplinary
      treatment model for patients with Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) and comorbid Insomnia.

      Specific Aim 1: To determine the efficacy of a treatment model combining Cognitive
      Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Continued Positive Airway Pressure(CPAP) for individuals with
      OSA and comorbid insomnia.

      Specific Aim 2: To determine if there are relative benefits in the sequence of treatment
      initiation.

      Specific Aim 3: To examine the mechanisms between insomnia symptoms and CPAP adherence.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      OSA is a sleep-related breathing disorder that is growing in prevalence and is associated
      with negative cardiovascular consequences and adverse events from excessive daytime
      sleepiness. Insomnia is a frequently co-occurring sleep disorder that adds significant
      morbidity and is a potential barrier to adherence of OSA treatment.  It is currently unknown
      if direct treatment of insomnia will enhance outcomes of OSA treatment.  The investigators
      at the Rush Sleep Disorders Center have developed an approach that combines CBT for insomnia
      delivered by a psychologist with CPAP therapy managed by a physician.  Building upon
      preliminary data collected in the clinic, the investigators seek to test the efficacy and
      mechanisms of this multidisciplinary model against the standard practice of treating OSA
      using CPAP alone.
