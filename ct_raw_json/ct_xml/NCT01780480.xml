      To evaluate the effect of the dynamic combination therapy on Chinese herbal granule formula
      (Fangji) based on differentiation of syndromes (&quot;Zhenghou&quot;) according to the theory of
      traditional Chinese medicine for improving the symptoms in the convalescent phase of
      ischemic stroke, and to establish the pharmacodynamic model of &quot;Zhenghou&quot; according to the
      results of this trial.
