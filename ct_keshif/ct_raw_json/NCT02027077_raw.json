            "textblock": "Obesity is a major risk factor for disease and a public health problem.  Recent information\n      suggests that while it is possible for most overweight adults to lose a substantial amount\n      of weight, maintaining the weight loss for any extended time (2 to 3 years) is very\n      difficult.  This is because trying to maintain big changes in exercise and/or eating\n      behaviour is very difficult in today's environment that makes sustain big changes in\n      behaviour (Example: eat allot less or exercise allot more) very hard.  In fact at this time\n      health professionals are unsure of how best to help overweight adults maintain big\n      behavioral changes for long periods of time.  In response, we propose that making smaller\n      changes in eating and exercise habits every day may be possible in today's environment and\n      if so, small weight changes may be possible to maintain for long periods of time.  This\n      study is designed to  assess whether making small changes in eating and exercise behavior\n      will be associated with sustained weight loss over three (3) years.  The results of the\n      study may have important implications for development of public health messages and clinical\n      guidelines for prevention and treatment of obesity through small changes in both exercise\n      and eating habits."

            "textblock": "The prevalence of obesity and associated morbidity among Canadian adults is already high and\n      increasing. Prevalence estimates for overweight determined from measured height and weight\n      now exceeds 62 % in Canadian adults1; approximately 15.5 million Canadian adults are now\n      overweight and obese1. Obesity is associated with a wide range of health outcomes from\n      co-morbidities including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and certain cancers, to\n      psychiatric disorders such as depression1. Direct costs attributed to obesity in Canada\n      range from 4.6 to 7.1 billion dollars annually1. Despite agreement concerning the urgent\n      need to address the obesity problem; few strategies have been successful on a wide scale\n      basis. Past efforts to achieve and sustain weight loss have not been particularly\n      successful. We3 and others4 have repeatedly demonstrated in randomized controlled trials\n      that most adults are not able to sustain the major changes in behaviour that are required to\n      maintain weight loss long term. Thus, although it is an admirable goal to substantially\n      reduce the number of overweight or obese Canadians, this goal may be totally out of reach in\n      the short term. The question then is what can be done to address the obesity problem now?\n      We propose that a reasonable start point in addressing the obesity problem is to develop\n      behavioural goals for prevention of weight gain. This strategy can at least keep the problem\n      from getting worse and at best, can reduce obesity rates over time."
