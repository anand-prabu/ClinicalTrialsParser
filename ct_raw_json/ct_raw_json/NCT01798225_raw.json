The gingival\n      crevicular fluid (GCF) aMMP-8 levels will be measured through a site-specific, novel\n      noninvasive technique allowing the pathophysiological status of the periodontium tissue to\n      be monitored. The investigators will conduct an interventional study on this population with\n      minimal genetic admixture."
