  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is a technology using harmless near infra-red light
      scatter to produce an image. Prior studies with OCT have demonstrated that OCT of the
      uterine cervix can differentiate between grades of pre-invasive and invasive cervical
      disease and cancer. This study will evaluate the ability of the NIRIS 1300e imaging (OCT)
      system to detect pre-invasive cervical disease and cervical cancer.

      B. Specific Aims

        1. Primary. To determine the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive
           values for Niris 1300e OCT enhanced gynecologic examination (VIA-OCT
           vs.colposcopy-biopsy) for the detection of lesions equal or greater than  cervical
           intraepithelial neoplasia II (CIN II) and cancer in a &quot;real time&quot; clinical evaluation.

        2. Secondary. To examine the ease of use of Niris 1300e OCT in a real time clinical
           setting in order to assess its potential application during a &quot;see and treat&quot; or
           &quot;single episode of care&quot; clinic visit.

    <description>Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is similar to ultrasound pulse-echo imaging, with optical scatter rather than acoustic reflectivity being measured.  OCT employs harmless near-infrared light technology which uses low coherence interferometry to produce an image (based on optical scattering) of tissue microstructure.</description>
