Depending on the device type\n      and patient's dependency, these guidelines recommend the intraoperative magnet use,\n      reprogramming of devices or no action. Magnet placement on a CIED (very simple and\n      applicable method) has become the standard approach in many centers, while CIED reprograming\n      by trained personnel is required in most centers. Therefore, our objective is to compare in\n      a prospective randomized clinical trial the safety of intraoperative magnet use vs. CIEDS\n      reprogramming vs. no intervention (in the appropriate subjects)"
