Antibiotics are\n      known to give a quick relief of symptoms and shorten the course of the condition by a few\n      days. The aim of this study is to evaluate ibuprofen versus mecillinam in the treatment of\n      uncomplicated cystitis in otherwise healthy, non-pregnant women. Our main objective is to\n      see whether symptomatic treatment with ibuprofen is equally efficient as treatment with\n      mecillinam in this group."

The study will follow the principles of Good Clinical Practice\n      (GCP).\n\n      Urine cultures will be obtained on day one and after two weeks. The patients will be given a\n      diary where they daily will register symptom load, possible complications or adverse effects\n      and on which day they feel completely cured. We will contact the patients after two weeks to\n      make sure they have followed the study procedures. After four weeks we will perform a final\n      interview with the patient."
