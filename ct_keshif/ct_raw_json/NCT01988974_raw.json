The\n      proposed research will also test the feasibility of studying the effect of the Alert for\n      Atrial Fibrillation program on treatment-seeking for symptoms of AF in a larger, randomized\n      trial. This research is significant, because current research suggests that treatment\n      seeking for AF is hindered when people do not recognize symptoms that represent AF,\n      attribute those symptoms to alternative causes, or do not believe symptoms are serious\n      enough to require medical evaluation. Interventions tailored to modify patient-specific\n      knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs that hinder early treatment-seeking are critically needed\n      in order to improve early detection of AF. The long term goal of this research is to improve\n      health outcomes of those at risk for developing AF."
