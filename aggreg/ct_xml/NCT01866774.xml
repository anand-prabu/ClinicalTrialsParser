  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Triaging new pediatric gastroenterology consultations is challenging as both inflammatory
      and non-inflammatory gastrointestinal (GI) diseases can present with non-specific chronic
      abdominal pain and/or diarrhea.  Examples of inflammatory GI diseases include Crohn's
      disease, ulcerative colitis and celiac disease and non-inflammatory GI diseases lactose
      intolerance, irritable bowel syndrome and non-ulcer dyspepsia. Inflammatory GI diseases
      require different investigations and treatment than non-inflammatory GI diseases and
      ideally, would be identified early.  Higher priority triage of these patients would allow
      timely organization of further investigations including pertinent laboratory testing,
      radiologic studies and gastrointestinal endoscopies.  These more invasive procedures are not
      needed in most patients presenting with non-specific gastrointestinal symptoms.  Therefore,
      the investigators do not routinely ask for screening laboratory testing or other studies in
      children referred to our clinic.

      Non-invasive screening tests for GI disorders may aid in appropriately triaging new
      consultations to pediatric gastroenterology.  Calprotectin is a protein found in
      inflammatory cells called neutrophils.  The concentration of calprotectin in stool reflects
      the presence of an inflammatory process occurring in the GI tract.  Thus, testing for
      calprotectin has been proposed as a potentially useful test for detecting some inflammatory
      GI diseases, most notably Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.  Alternatively, a simple
      gastrointestinal questionnaire of &quot;red flag&quot; symptoms and family history of GI disorders may
      also be of benefit.  The investigators hypothesize that the use of fecal calprotectin and a
      screening GI questionnaire will aid in identifying children at higher risk of an
      inflammatory GI disorder.  Subsequently, higher priority triaging of these patients will
      decrease the time to diagnosis of inflammatory GI disease.

      This will be a single centre, stratified, randomized clinical trial conducted in Kingston,
      Ontario, Canada.  Patients referred to the pediatric gastroenterology service without a
      known diagnosis for non-specific chronic abdominal pain and/or diarrhea will be asked to
      participate in the study.  All patients who meet the inclusion criteria will be consented by
      telephone with a standard form.  Consenting patients will be mailed the GI questionnaire and
      the fecal calprotectin test kit.  The fecal calprotectin test kid includes instructions, a
      stool collection kit and return postage.  All patients will be given the next available
      appointment with a pediatric gastroenterologist.  Patients will then be randomized to
      receive either usual care (50%, 40 patients) or to have a screening fecal calprotectin (FC)
      measurement (50%, 40 patients).  Patients in the FC group will have FC measured by the
      Quantum Blue® Rapid Calprotectin Assay.  If the calprotectin level is high (above 50 μg/g),
      the patient will be contacted again by telephone and given a new appointment time (within 14
      working days).  This study may have a positive impact by demonstrating a novel method for
      decreasing the time to diagnosis of inflammatory GI disease.
