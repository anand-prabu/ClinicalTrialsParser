  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a multilevel mHealth intervention (mCRC)
      can increase the percentage of patients who receive colorectal cancer screening.  The mCRC
      intervention will include a tablet-based patient education program, clinic protocols to
      facilitate the ordering of CRC screening tests, and electronic messaging with patients to
      promote screening.  The investigators hypothesize that participants randomized to mCRC will
      be more likely to complete screening compared with those randomized to the control arm of
      the study.  Additionally, the investigators hypothesize mCRC will increase several
      intermediate outcomes (such as knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and test ordering) which will
      predict completion of screening.  Lastly, the investigators hypothesize the mCRC
      intervention will add little to the overall cost of screening.
