  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Limb length inequality is when a person has one leg that is longer than the other.  This
      research will look at correcting limb length inequality in adults with knee or hip symptoms.
      This study will examine whether ways of measuring leg length inequality in the clinic are
      valid and reliable, determine whether foot posture (flat foot, normal, and high arch) is
      related to leg length inequality, and determine whether shoe lifts are a helpful treatment
      for leg length inequality and knee/hip symptoms.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the optimal clinical assessment method(s) for leg
      length inequality (LLI), determine if there is an association between foot posture (flat
      foot, normal, and high arch) and LLI, and gather preliminary data on lift therapy as a
      treatment for LLI and knee/hip symptoms. The specific aims of the project are as follows:

      Specific Aim 1: Determine the validity and reliability of 4 clinical methods for assessing
      LLI.

      Specific Aim 2: Determine differences in static and dynamic foot postures between longer and
      shorter limbs.

      Specific Aim 3: Assess the feasibility of conducting a specific lift therapy intervention
      among individuals with a LLI and knee or hip pain, refining procedures as needed.

      Public Health Impact: Results from the proposed research will be used to: 1) improve
      diagnosis of LLI by providing evidence on the various assessment methods for the clinicians
      who most frequently use clinical methods (i.e., physical therapists, chiropractors,
      podiatrists, and primary care physicians), and 2) develop and test new
      non-pharmacologic/non-invasive intervention strategies aimed at reducing pain and improving
      function in individuals with osteoarthritis and LLI.

    <description>Lift therapy will be administered by a physical therapist. Heel lifts and full length inserts used inside participants' shoes will be constructed on-site. If an external shoe lift is required for a participant, a local shoe repair shop will construct the lifts and add them to the outside of the shoe. Participants will be required to wear the lift in their shoes when they are walking or standing while enrolled in the study; participants will keep a daily diary to record their compliance (number of hours lift worn per day, amount of lift used, type of shoes worn, general symptoms experienced, and activities performed). They will be contacted weekly to be reminded to increase their lift height and identify when they have achieved their optimal lift height.</description>
