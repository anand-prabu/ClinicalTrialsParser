      The objective of this study is to to determine if a patient activation tool (PAT) can
      improve decision making and patient centered outcomes in pediatric patients with
      appendicitis and their caregivers.

      Hypothesis: A PAT that activates patient-caregiver dyads will improve decision making and
      patient centered outcomes without compromising medical outcomes in children with
      appendicitis. Specifically,the investigators expect the PAT to improve decision
      self-efficacy and healthcare satisfaction without increasing disability days.

      Methods/Outcomes: The investigators will perform a randomized controlled trial comparing a
      PAT to standard surgical consultation in patient-caregiver dyads choosing between either
      antibiotics alone or appendectomy for early appendicitis. The investigators will identify
      differences in various components of decision making and patient centered outcomes including
      caregiver decision self-efficacy, preparedness for decision making, decisional conflict,
      decision regret, caregiver activation, caregiver and child satisfaction with care and health
      related quality of life (HRQOL), and caregiver and child knowledge. The investigators will
      also characterize the effects of a PAT on medical outcomes from appendicitis in patients
      receiving the PAT compared to those receiving standard surgical consultation alone. The
      investigators will determine differences in disability days, length of stay, readmission
      rates, and medical complications related to treatment choice (e.g. infection, recurrence).
