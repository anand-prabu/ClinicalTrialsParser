Between 10-20% of patients may develop PTSD in response to\n      the traumatic experience of myocardial infarction (MI). PTSD is associated with impaired\n      quality of life, social functioning, and high economic burden to the society. Posttraumatic\n      stress attributable to MI has also been shown to be predictive of poor cardiovascular\n      prognosis, whereby this link might relate to several atherothrombotic processes. Therefore\n      the prevention of PTSD after MI is of high relevance. Guidelines have been published for\n      early interventions to prevent the development of posttraumatic stress after different types\n      of trauma but not in terms of acute MI as a traumatic event.\n\n      The overarching aim of the planned trial is to test whether a minimal behavioral\n      intervention performed shortly after acute MI in patients at a high risk to develop PTSD and\n      in the setting of a coronary care unit reduces the development of posttraumatic stress.\n\n      The primary hypothesis is that posttraumatic stress levels at the 3-month follow-up will be\n      at least 20% lower in the intervention group than in the control group, and that this effect\n      will last up to 12 months after the intervention. The secondary hypothesis is that the\n      intervention group will show better psychosocial functioning, and a more favourable\n      cardiometabolic biomarker profile than the control group 3 and 12 month after the\n      intervention."

            "textblock": "Background\n\n      Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a mental disorder that may occur after someone\n      experiences a traumatic event. Between 10-20% of patients may develop PTSD in response to\n      the traumatic experience of myocardial infarction (MI). Sociodemographic and psychosocial\n      variables, including perceived distress during MI, have been identified as \"risk factors\"\n      for the development of posttraumatic stress in the aftermath of MI. PTSD is associated with\n      impaired quality of life, social functioning, and high economic burden to the society.\n      Posttraumatic stress attributable to MI has also been shown to be predictive of poor\n      cardiovascular prognosis, whereby this link might relate to atherothrombotic processes like\n      endothelial dysfunction, dyslipidemia, inflammation, and coagulation. Therefore the\n      prevention of PTSD after MI is of high relevance. Guidelines have been published for early\n      interventions to prevent the development of posttraumatic stress after different types of\n      trauma. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis on randomized controlled trials of\n      early psychological interventions designed to prevent symptoms of PTSD found a benefit, but\n      only if treatment was provided to symptomatic individuals and trauma-focused. The impact of\n      such an intervention on posttraumatic stress in response to a myocardial infarction has not\n      been assessed so far. The planned project is the first to test, if the development of\n      posttraumatic stress can successfully be prevented in MI patients at high risk to develop\n      PTSD through a minimal behavioral intervention that is feasible.\n\n      Objective\n\n      Primary aim: The overarching aim of the planned project is to investigate in a\n      randomized-controlled trial whether a minimal (single counseling session of 45 minutes plus\n      an information booklet) and early-on (within 48 hours after myocardial infarction)\n      administered behavioral intervention reduces the development of clinician-rated\n      posttraumatic stress levels attributable to MI in patients at a high risk to develop\n      clinically relevant levels of posttraumatic stress.\n\n      Secondary aim: A further aim is to investigate whether the behavioral intervention improves\n      psychosocial functioning and favorably affects cardiometabolic risk markers.\n\n      Methods\n\n      Patients considered to be at \"high risk\" to develop posttraumatic stress will be randomized\n      to one single counseling session of 45 minutes (either targeting specific MI-triggered\n      traumatic reactions or more general information about the role of psychological stress in\n      coronary heart disease). The session will be performed by the study therapist in the\n      coronary care unit within 48 hours after the patient has reached stable circulatory\n      condition. Each patient will additionally receive written study material in the form of an\n      information booklet. Medical variables, sociodemographic factors and cardiometabolic\n      biomarkers will also be determined.\n\n      At 3-month and 12-month follow-up each patient will be assessed for interviewer-rated\n      posttraumatic stress levels, psychosocial functioning, and biomarkers."
