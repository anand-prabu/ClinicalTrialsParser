  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine whether aspirin is effective in
      alleviating symptoms of the clinical high risk (CHR) syndrome for psychosis.  The
      investigators further aim to determine whether it may delay or prevent the onset of
      psychosis in those currently experiencing CHR symptoms.  As secondary measures the
      investigators aim to collect laboratory studies of inflammation markers and genetic samples
      to determine whether certain genetic profiles correlate with risk for psychosis, or response
      to aspirin treatment.
