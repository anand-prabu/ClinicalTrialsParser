  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a Phase 1, randomized, open-label, single-dose, three-period, crossover study
      to assess the bioequivalence of propafenone hydrochloride manufactured at two different
      sites in healthy adult volunteers.  Approximately 36 subjects will receive a 3 single doses
      of propafenone hydrochloride 425mg, each administered separately, in the fasted state with a
      7 day washout period between doses.  Propafenone hydrochloride is an antiarrhythmic
      indicated to prolong the time to recurrence of symptomatic atrial fibrillation in patients
      with episodic (most likely paroxysmal or persistent) atrial fibrillation who do not have
      structural heart disease.  A follow-up visit will occur 7-10 days after the final dose of
      study drug.

             bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin
             &lt;35%).

          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she postmenopausal or on a stable
             regimine of an approved contracetive

          -  Capable of giving written informed consent,

        Exclusion Criteria:

             result within 3 months of screening.

          -  Current or chronic history of liver disease, or known hepatic or biliary
             abnormalities (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones).

          -  A positive pre-study drug/alcohol screen.  A minimum list of drugs that will be

          -  A positive test for HIV antibody.

          -  History of regular alcohol consumption within 6 months of the study defined as:an
             average weekly intake of &gt;14 drinks for males or &gt;7 drinks for females.  One drink is
             equivalent to 12g of alcohol: 12 ounces (360ml) of beer, 5 ounces (150ml) of wine or
