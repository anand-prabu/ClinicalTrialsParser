  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess coughing force during reflex coughing test in those with dysphagia and determine
      if those with silent aspiration (SA)have more compromised coughing force during reflex cough
      testing than those with non-silent aspiration (NSA).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Silent aspiration (SA) can be a risk factor of aspiration pneumonia. SA has been reported to
      occur in over 40% of patients referred for dysphagia evaluation in a rehabilitation
      hospital.

      Reflexive coughing can be tested by administration of citric acid via a nebulizer. The
      objective of this study is to measure the cough force, and determine if those with SA have
      more weak cough force during reflexive cough testing.
