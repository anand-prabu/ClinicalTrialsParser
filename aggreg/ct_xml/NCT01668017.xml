    <textblock>
      This is a two-part trial. &quot;Solid tumor&quot; in this protocol means solid tumor excluding
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

      Part 1: Dose Escalation Phase in subjects with solid tumor (Cohort A) and HCC (Cohort B).
      The dose will be increased from 45 mg twice a day (BID) with 3+3 cohort method up to the
      recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of pimasertib established as single agent in the global
      studies for each arm independently.

      Part 2: The Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) defined in Part 1 will be confirmed in more
      subjects in Cohort A (N=18) and Cohort B (N=6) separately.
