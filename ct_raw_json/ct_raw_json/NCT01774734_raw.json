The investigators hypothesize that daily use of the neck strength exerciser (NSE),\n           combined biofeedback technique with muscle strengthening exercise posture adjustment,\n           in addition to traditional physiotherapy, could have more long-lasting and prominent\n           effect on pain and functional improvement in patients with chronic neck pain."
