To diagnose antiphospholipid syndrome it is mandatory that the woman has two positive\n             tests at least 12 weeks apart for either lupus anticoagulant or anticardiolipin\n             antibodies of immunoglobulin G and/or immunoglobulin M class present in a medium or\n             high titre over 40 g/l or ml/l,or above the 99th percentile).\n\n        In the detection of lupus anticoagulant, the dilute Russell's viper venom time test\n        together with a platelet neutralisation procedure is more sensitive and specific than\n        either the activated partial thromboplastin time test or the kaolin clotting time test.\n        Anticardiolipin antibodies are detected using a standardised enzyme linked immunosorbent\n        assay.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          1. Age above forty years old .\n\n          2. Intrauterine abnormalities (as assessed by ultrasound, hysterosonography,\n             hysterosalpingogram, or hysteroscopy).\n\n          3.

Other identifiable causes of recurrent miscarriages (tests initiated only if\n             clinically indicated) e.g., diabetes, thyroid disease and systemic lupus\n             erythematosus (SLE)."
