She will also a pelvic ultrasound on each participant\n      so that the characteristics of her cervix, uterus, and ovaries (such as the cervical length,\n      endometrial thickness and ovarian volume) can be evaluated. If the participant has an\n      obstetric fistula, she will also complete an additional blood draw for lab testing. The\n      laboratory tests will evaluate three hormones that are associated with amenorrhea and\n      infertility: follicle stimulating hormone, estradiol, and antimullerian hormone."
