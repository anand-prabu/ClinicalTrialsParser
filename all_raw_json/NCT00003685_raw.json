Compare the toxicity of these two\n      regimens in these patients. III. Compare the quality of life and survival of patients\n      treated with these two regimens.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to\n      center, weight loss in the previous 6 months (no greater than 10% vs greater than 10%), and\n      performance status (ECOG 0 or 1 vs 2 or 3). Patients are randomized to undergo radiotherapy\n      as 5 fractions over 5 days or 1 fraction on 1 day. Quality of life is assessed before\n      treatment, weekly for 5 weeks, and monthly thereafter. Patients are followed weekly for 5\n      weeks, then every 2 months for 1 year.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 210 patients will be accrued for this study."
