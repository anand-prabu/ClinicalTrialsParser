  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Demineralization during orthodontic (brace) treatment is a common clinical problem leading
      to unsightly white or brown marks on the teeth. A recent systematic review has shown little
      evidence that current methods of delivering fluoride are effective at reducing this problem.

      Design: A multi-centre randomised single blinded controlled clinical trial will be conducted
      with two parallel groups.

      Setting: The trial patients will be treated by eight named operators on the Specialist List
      for Orthodontics held by the General Dental Council and who work either within the hospital
      service or specialist orthodontic practice. The sample size calculation suggests that each
      operator will need to treat 40 patients in the trial (approx 1 session per week) plus up to
      10 familiarisation patients before.

      Planned trial interventions: Brackets will be bonded to all teeth in front of the first
      permanent molars with either a resin-modified glass ionomer cement (Fuji Ortho LC) or a
      light cured composite control (Transbond).  The material to be bonded will be allocated
      randomly.

      Outcome measures: The two main outcome measures will be the difference in demineralization
      of the anterior teeth before and after treatment assessed from photographs and the number of
      debonded brackets during treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Demineralization (dental decay) around fixed appliance components has been reported to occur
      in up to 95% of cases where brackets are bonded with composite resins.  Although early
      lesions appear clinically as opaque white or brown areas, if mineral loss continues
      cavitation will occur.  Following appliance removal, the lesions may regress or disappear
      but may still present an aesthetic problem more than 5 years after appliance removal.
      Fluoride is known to inhibit lesion development and to enhance remineralization following
      treatment. Resin-modified glass ionomer cements, which release and absorb fluoride, may be
      used for bracket bonding thereby offering the possibility of less demineralization around
      bonded attachments.  In addition, these cements appear to behave as reliably as composite in
      terms of bracket failure rate recorded but these data are from case series rather than
      optimally designed randomised clinical trials.  A bonding agent that can behave as reliably
      as composite and minimize unwanted enamel demineralization would be optimal; saving on
      restorative costs that may be required should cavitation occur.  From the patients
      perspective, subjective assessment of treatment outcome is likely to be enhanced as ugly
      demineralised enamel white lesions will be eliminated.
