            "textblock": "Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic or chronic recurring inflammatory skin disorder.\n      Patients suffer from eczema and often severe pruritus on the affected skin, as well as from\n      frequent complications and secondary infections. Next to a genetically predetermined defect\n      in epidermal barrier function and vegetative dysfunction, AD arises from an upregulation of\n      Th2-modified immune responses inducing increased IgE-antibody production, cytokine secretion\n      and subsequently, local inflammation.\n\n      Although standard therapies of AD, modern topical corticosteroids, show a better ratio of\n      therapeutic effects to side effects, they retain a moderate acceptance due to their\n      non-specific action, strict compliance requirements and possible adverse effects. As a newer\n      alternative, calcineurin inhibitors show fewer side effects but raise concerns regarding\n      long term risks including the possibility of skin carcinogenicity. Therefore, medical need\n      remains for novel therapies for this major public health problem, directed in particular at\n      specific early disease-causing mechanisms and/or molecular targets, with an improved\n      efficacy, safety and compliance.\n\n      Novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases by targeting\n      early disease-causing mechanisms are a promising approach for the treatment of AD.\n\n      The transcription factor GATA-3 represents the key regulatory factor of Th2-driven immune\n      responses. It is indispensable for the differentiation and activation of Th2 cells; it\n      integrates Th2 signals and induces Th2 cytokine expression. The investigational product\n      SB011 contains the DNAzyme hgd40 that targets GATA-3. By cleaving GATA-3 mRNA hgd40 reduces\n      specific cytokine production and thereby reduces key features of allergic airway\n      inflammation.\n\n      DNAzymes are completely generated by chemical synthesis and can be produced under Good\n      Manufacturing Practice (GMP) controlled conditions. The DNAzymes are not biological drugs,\n      i.e. they are not generated by use of any living organism including cell culture or\n      bacteria. The molecules are highly water-soluble and will be applied as a water/oil/water\n      (W/O/W) formulation since multiple emulsions have been shown to protect the active\n      ingredient from degradation on the skin and have penetration enhancing properties in\n      comparison to other carrier systems.\n\n      This proof-of-concept study will evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability,\n      pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of the topical formulation SB011 containing\n      2 % hgd40 twice daily (BID) in patients with mild to moderate atopic eczema."
