    <textblock>
      Protocol VRXP-A106 will enroll patients with Stage II-IVA head and neck cancer patients who
      will be treated with surgical resection. Cetuximab and VTX-2337 will be administered for a
      3-4 week period before surgery. The primary objective of the study is to determine the
      extent to which the administration of neoadjuvant VTX-2337 plus cetuximab modulates immune
      biomarkers (NK, mDC and T cell activation as well as tumor infiltration and serum cytokines)
      in peripheral blood and head and neck cancer tumors. An exploratory objective of the study
      is to assess whether modulation of biomarkers as described above can predict anti-tumor
      response.
