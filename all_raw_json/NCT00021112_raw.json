Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor\n      cells. Combining chemotherapy with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining chemotherapy and radiation\n      therapy before surgery in treating patients who have stage IIIB non-small cell lung cancer."

Chemotherapy repeats every 3 weeks for 3 courses. Beginning on day 2 of the second\n      course of chemotherapy, patients undergo induction radiotherapy once daily 5 days a week for\n      5-7 weeks. Chemoradiotherapy continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable\n      toxicity.\n\n      At 3-6 weeks after completion of the last dose of induction radiotherapy, patients undergo\n      lobectomy or pneumonectomy.\n\n      Patients are followed at 30 days and 4 months, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually\n      thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 27-62 patients will be accrued for this study."
