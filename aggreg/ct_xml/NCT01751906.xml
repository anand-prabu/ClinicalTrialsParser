      ABSORB III Primary Objective: The pivotal trial to support the US pre-market approval (PMA)
      of Absorb BVS. ABSORB III will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Absorb BVS
      System compared to the XIENCE in the treatment of subjects, including those with diabetes
      mellitus, with ischemic heart disease caused by up to two de novo native coronary artery
      lesions in separate epicardial vessels.

      ABSORB III Secondary Objectives:

        -  Lead-In Phase Objective: To evaluate the applicability and transferability of the
           didactic Absorb BVS physician training plan to US clinical practice.

        -  Imaging Cohort Objective: To evaluate long-term vascular function and patency of the
           Absorb BVS treated segments compared to XIENCE treated segments in the treatment of
           subjects with ischemic heart disease caused by up to two de novo native coronary artery
           lesions in separate epicardial vessels.

             the index procedure per site standard.

          6. Female subject is not breast-feeding at the time of the screening visit and will not
             be breast-feeding for up to 1 year following the index procedure.

          7. Subject agrees to not participate in any other investigational or invasive clinical
             study for a period of 1 year following the index procedure.

        General Exclusion Criteria:

          4. Subject had an acute myocardial infarction (AMI: STEMI or NSTEMI) within 72 hours of
             the index procedure and both CK and CK-MB have not returned to within normal limits
             at the time of index procedure.

          5. Subject is currently experiencing clinical symptoms consistent with new onset AMI

             least one of the following criteria is met:

               1. Subject requires coumadin or any other agent for chronic oral anticoagulation

             etc. LVEF may be obtained within 6 months prior to the procedure for subjects with
             stable CAD. For subjects presenting with ACS, LVEF must be assessed during the index
             hospitalization (which may include during the index procedure by contrast left
             ventriculography) but prior to randomization in order to confirm the subject's
             eligibility.

             malformation, etc.).

         20. Subject has extensive peripheral vascular disease that precludes safe 6 French sheath
             insertion. Note: femoral arterial disease does not exclude the patient if radial

                  native coronary artery with RVD by visual estimation of ≥ 2.75 mm and ≤ 3.25 mm.
                  The lesion length by visual estimation is ≥ 8 mm and ≤ 14 mm.

        Angiographic Exclusion Criteria:

        All exclusion criteria apply to the target lesion(s) or target vessel(s).

             expansion with the following outcomes:

               -  Residual %DS is a maximum of &lt; 40% (per visual estimation), ≤ 20% is strongly
                  recommended.

               -  TIMI Grade-3 flow (per visual estimation).

               -  No angiographic complications (e.g. distal embolization, side branch closure).

               1. side branch ≥ 2 mm in diameter, or

               2. side branch with either an ostial or non-ostial lesion with diameter stenosis &gt;
                  50%, or

               3. side branch requiring pre-dilatation or protection guide wire.

          6. Anatomy proximal to or within the lesion that may impair delivery of the Absorb BVS

         10. Vessel has been previously treated and the target lesion is within 5 mm proximal or
             distal to a previously treated lesion.

         11. Target lesion located within an arterial or saphenous vein graft or distal to any
             arterial or saphenous vein graft.
