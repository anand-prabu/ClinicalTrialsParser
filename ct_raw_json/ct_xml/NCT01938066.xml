  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if Procellera speeds wound healing.  The study
      will examine colonization (bacterial growth), pain and pain medication and reduced cost of
      care by using Procellera (an antimicrobial agent) under Negative Pressure Therapy placed  on
      the wound  after abdominal wall surgery.  Procellera is a single layer dressing that helps
      to kill germs that cause infections.  Negative Pressure Therapy is a vacuum device with a
      sponge that is placed in your wound to help heal the wound faster.

      The study will consent 30 patients undergoing surgery through the abdominal wall and the
      skin incision will intentionally be left open.    Subjects will be randomized using a random
      number generator.  Each number will be placed in an envelope numbered 1-30.  Arm 1 will be
      even numbers and Arm 2 will be odd numbers.  A researcher not affiliated  with the study
      will generate the numbers and place them in the envelopes.  Arm 1 will place fifteen
      subjects on Negative Pressure Therapy Only and Arm 2 will place fifteen subjects on Negative
      Pressure and Procellera.   Arm 1 (Negative Pressure Only)  will have their dressing changed
      3 times per week which is the standard of care for Negative Pressure Therapy.  Arm 2
      (Negative Pressure Therapy and Procellera) will have their dressing changed every 5 days.
      Arm 1 and 2 will have a tissue specimen taken on the 5th day only.  The tissue will be taken
      from debrided material and sent for culture.  The Negative Pressure Therapy Sponge, which is
      discarded after each dressing change, will be collected, lavaged with saline and the cells
      will be examined for macrophage function and the wound fluid will be tested for inflammation
      response. Photographs, wound measurements, pain scale and pain medication will also be
      completed at each dressing change.  We will check the progress of the wound along with your
      surgeon during the subject's  30 day surgical follow up in the surgeon's office.  The wound
      will be measured (if not healed), photograph's taken and their pain level assessed.
