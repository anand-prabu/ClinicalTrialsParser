      To conduct a case collection of breast imaging studies from approximately 300 women with
      mammographically-detected breast masses for the purpose of conducting Reader Studies to
      answer specific questions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective case collection clinical study for the purpose of conducting
      subsequent Reader Studies.

      Potential participants will be recruited from the group of women presenting for mammography
      at two clinical sites and approximately 300 women will be enrolled.  At least 50% of the
      collected cases will be from subjects with &gt;50% dense breast tissue. Patients will undergo
      both standard Handheld (HHUS) and Quantitative Transmission (QTUS), following a diagnostic
      mammogram (XRM) with a mammographically-detected mass in at least one mammographic view. All
      patients will undergo an ultrasound guided aspiration/biopsy with cytology to determine
      whether the mammographically-detected index lesion, as seen in the corresponding lesion on
      HHUS, is a cyst or solid lesion.

      Each study site is projected to collect approximately 75 cyst cases and 75 solid cases
      stratified across the four (4) recognized breast tissue density categories with 50% of cases
      from subjects with &gt;50% breast density. The composition of the cyst cases at each site is
      projected to consist of simple (n=25), and both complicated and complex cysts (n=50).
      Cytologic or histologic results for all lesions will be used as the standard criterion for
      definitive lesion determination for the Lesion Ground Truth.  All enrolled subjects will
      undergo ultrasound guided aspiration or ultrasound guided biopsy or surgical excision, as
      applicable for the index lesion, with cytologic examination. If the cytologic findings are
      discordant with the imaging findings or if insufficient sampling is indicated, then that
      case may be excluded from inclusion as a candidate case for the subsequent Reader Studies.

        Eligibility for enrollment will be open to women of all races and ethnicity who have
        completed diagnostic mammography at the study site. Women younger than 25 years of age
        will not be eligible to participate. Potential participants must not be breastfeeding at
        the time of diagnostic breast imaging. Patients who have had breast surgeries or
        interventional breast procedures in the past 12 months will not be eligible to enter the
        study. All subjects must have the decisional capacity to provide informed consent. No
        subjects from vulnerable populations will be enrolled (children, institutionalized
        persons, fetuses, prisoners, persons with decisional incapacity).
