Courses repeat every 28 days in the\n      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 6-8 patients receive escalating doses of S-3304 until the maximum tolerated dose\n      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 or 3 of 8\n      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed at 30 days.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 6-28 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year."
