  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this prospective, multicenter observational study we assess the diagnostic validity of
      the following standard screening instruments for delirium regarding sedation, analgesia and
      ventilator status in critically ill patients:

        -  Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU)

        -  Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC)

        -  Nursing-Delirium-Screening-Scale (Nu-DESC)

      The definite delirium diagnosis (definite in terms of reference standard)  is made according
      to the criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 4th Edition,
      text revised (DSM-IV-TR) published by the American Psychiatric Association (APA) which is
      the Gold Standard to diagnose delirium.

      Primary research question: Does sedation, ventilator status and analgesia influence the
      sensitivity of delirium screening tools (DST)?
