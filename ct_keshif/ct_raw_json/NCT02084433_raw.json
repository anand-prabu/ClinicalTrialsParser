            "textblock": "Local anesthesia is commonly used in oral health care and intra-mucosal infiltration\n      anesthesia is most commonly used by practitioners. Anesthesia may cause children a great\n      deal of anxiety because of the fear of the injection. The latter can be painful if the\n      product is delivered too quickly in the mucosa. Recent developments in the techniques and\n      anesthesia systems allow reducing pain during the injection. In particular, computerized\n      systems (electronically assisted local anesthesia) allow a slow injection limiting pressure.\n      Moreover, these systems look like a pen which prevents the negative impression of the image\n      related to the syringe metal. The intraosseous electronically-assisted anesthesia could be\n      an interesting alternative to conventional infiltration anesthesia by making the act less\n      stressful but also less painful for the child."
