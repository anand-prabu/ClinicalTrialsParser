  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Belmont Rapid Infuser is a device currently approved to replace larger volumes of
      necessary fluids such as blood in a fast and safe manner.  The purpose of the study is to
      evaluate proficiency and the retention of knowledge of how to use the device based on
      current methods of training compared to revised training methods.

      Hypotheses:

        1. The use of the traditional method of training is not effective, predicting less then
           half of staff will pass on the first attempt.

        2. Restructured test with hands-on training as opposed to oral presentation only with a
           written test will result in a pass rate of &gt; 80%.

        3. Staff members who work in pairs will perform better than working alone when setting up
           the Belmont Rapid Infuser (BRI).

        4. Retention at 3 months will be higher with the restructured training method than with
           the traditional training method.

      Participants will be recruited to complete a test after undergoing either the traditional or
      the restructured training method.   This training will be completed on one day and takes
      about 1 hour.

      All participants who pass via either method of training are evaluated again to test
      retention 3-4 months later .
