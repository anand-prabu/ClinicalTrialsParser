    <textblock>
      The purpose of this extension study is to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of a
      booster dose of a MenABCWY vaccine, administered 24 months after completion of the primary
      vaccination series, in subjects who previously received the same vaccine formulation in
      study V102_03 (Groups I and II). Antibody persistence at 24 and 36 months after the primary
      vaccination and 12 months after the booster dose will also be evaluated in these subjects.

      In addition, safety and immunogenicity of two investigational MenABCWY vaccine formulations
      (either a MenABCWY+ OMV or a MenABCWY+¼ OMV) will be assessed in subjects who previously
      received two doses of MenB vaccine (Group III) or one dose of Menveo vaccine (Group IV).
      These subjects will be followed for safety and immunogenicity for 12 months after
      vaccination in study V102_03E1.
