Thus, this study will help to expand the information that is\n      available regarding the impact of BoNT-A treatment in routine clinical practice conditions.\n\n      Treatment goals can vary greatly from one patient to another and there is no unique, single\n      outcome that reflects the treatment benefits in all the cases. Therefore, this study with\n      special focus on the achievement of therapeutic goals, will allow the identification of each\n      patient's specific goals regarding the improvement of the functional outcomes, the quality\n      of life and patient well-being."
