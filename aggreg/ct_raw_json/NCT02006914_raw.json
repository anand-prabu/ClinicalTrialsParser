The investigators have\n      shown that the insulin resistance (i.e. the inability of insulin to stimulate glucose uptake\n      into peripheral tissues like muscle) in patients with HIV disease is associated with a\n      defect in the insulin-signaling pathway leading from the insulin receptor, through\n      phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase(PI 3-K, Figure 5). A similar defect in intracellular signaling\n      has also been reported in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus ):15-171. The cellular\n      mechanism of improved insulin sensitivity with chromium supplementation will be determined\n      in Specific Aim 2.\n\n      Specific Aim 2 will assess the effect of chromium supplementation on the insulin-stimulated\n      activity of insulin receptor substrate-I-associated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase in\n      biopsies of muscle and fat tissue. This aim will also test the hypothesis that these\n      physiological effects of chromium are mediated by alterations in the activity of insulin\n      signaling. Understanding this mechanism may facilitate the design of even more effective\n      strategies for improving insulin sensitivity."
