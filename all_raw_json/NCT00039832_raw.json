This treatment, however, is effective only if begun within 3\n      hours of onset of the stroke and most patients do not get to the hospital early enough to\n      benefit from it. There is thus a pressing need to develop effective stroke treatments that\n      can be initiated more than 3 hours after onset.\n\n      Patients between 18 and 80 years of age who have experienced a mild or moderate acute stroke\n      between 3 and 24 hours before starting study drugs may be eligible for this study.\n      Candidates will be screened with a physical examination, blood tests and a magnetic\n      resonance imaging (MRI) scan (if an MRI was not done during the stroke evaluation).\n\n      All participants will receive ReoPro. Some will also receive Retavase, which may boost the\n      effectiveness of ReoPro. Retavase is administered in a single dose through a needle in the\n      vein over 2 minutes. ReoPro is infused into the vein over 12 hours. Patients will be\n      monitored with physical examinations, blood tests, computed tomography (CT) scans, and three\n      or four MRI scans of the brain to evaluate both the response to treatment and side effects\n      of the drugs. An MRI scan will be done 24 hours, 5 days and 30 days after starting the study\n      medication, and possibly during screening for this study.\n\n      CT involves the use of specialized x-rays to obtain images of the brain. The patient lies\n      still in the scanner for a short time while the X-ray images are formed. MRI uses a strong\n      magnetic field and radio waves to demonstrate structural and chemical changes in tissue. MRI\n      is more sensitive than x-ray in evaluating acute stroke. The patient lies on a table in a\n      metal cylinder (the scanner) while the pictures are being taken. During part of the MRI, a\n      medicine called gadolinium contrast is injected in a vein. This medicine brightens the\n      images, creating better pictures of the blood flow."

            "textblock": "Objectives:  This is a clinical trial to determine an acceptable dose of reteplase in\n      combination with a fixed dose of abciximab for ischemic stroke 3-24 hours from onset.\n\n      Study Population:  Patients will be selected by criteria to minimize likelihood of toxicity\n      and maximize likelihood of response. These criteria include age 18-80 years old, acute\n      ischemic stroke of moderate severity (NIH Stroke Scale less than or equal to 16 and lesion\n      volume on diffusion MRI less than approximately one third of the volume of the middle\n      cerebral artery territory), positive MRI evidence of hypoperfusion corresponding to the\n      acute stroke symptoms, no MRI evidence of chronic micro-hemorrhages, and no other clinical,\n      radiological or laboratory features associated with risk of hemorrhage with thrombolytic\n      therapy.\n\n      Design:  The study is open-label, dose escalation, safety and proof of principle study of\n      the combination of intravenous abciximab and reteplase. A fixed dose of abciximab will be\n      used in all patients: 0.25 mg/kg bolus (to a maximum of 30 mg) followed by a 0.125\n      microgram/kg/minute infusion (to a maximum of 10.0 microgram/minute) for 12 hours. The five\n      dosing groups for the reteplase dose are 0 U, 2.5 U, 5.0 U, 7.5 U, and 10.0 U. A maximum of\n      72 patients will be treated using an adaptive statistical design, in which data on both the\n      response and toxicity will be used to determine the dose for subsequent patients, thereby\n      minimizing exposure to either ineffective or toxic doses. Non-investigational patient\n      management will be standardized across all patients according to the NIH Stroke Center\n      Clinical Care Pathway.\n\n      Outcome Measures:  The primary efficacy endpoint for response will be reperfusion by MRI 24\n      hours after start of therapy. The primary safety endpoint for determination of toxicity will\n      be any one of the following: symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), major systemic\n      hemorrhage, or other serious adverse event related to study drug administration, including\n      death, within 48 hours from start of therapy. The maximum acceptable rate of toxicity will\n      be 10% of patients treated at any dose level and the minimum acceptable rate of response\n      will be 50% of patients treated at any dose level. The outcomes will be monitored by a Data\n      and Safety Monitoring Committee, which will have the authority to stop or recommend\n      modifications of the trial for safety concerns. Other clinical outcome variables and imaging\n      variables will be recorded and analyzed in secondary and exploratory analyses. If an\n      acceptable dose is identified, then that will be investigated in a subsequent randomized\n      placebo-controlled trial."

                "textblock": "-  INCLUSION CRITERIA:\n\n        Patients may be enrolled in the study only if they meet all of the following criteria:\n\n          1. Diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke with onset between 3 and 24 hours prior to planned\n             start of study drugs. Acute ischemic stroke is defined as a measurable neurological\n             deficit of sudden onset, presumed secondary to focal cerebral ischemia, and not\n             otherwise attributable to ICH or another disease process. Stroke onset will be\n             defined as the time the patient was last known to be without the new clinical\n             deficit. Patients whose deficits have worsened in the last 24 hours are not eligible\n             if their first symptoms started more than 24 hours before. If the stroke started\n             during sleep, stroke onset will be recorded as the time the patient was last known to\n             be intact. A careful history is important to determine when the patient was last\n             without the presenting deficits.\n\n          2. Disabling neurological deficit attributable to the acute stroke at the start of study\n             drugs.\n\n          3. NIHSS less than or equal to 16.\n\n          4. Evidence on PWI MRI of a perfusion defect corresponding to the acute stroke syndrome\n             of at least 2cm in diameter in both long and short axis in any slice. The PWI will be\n             assessed by relative mean transit time (MTT) images. The MRI evaluation must involve\n             echo planar diffusion weighted imaging, MRA, and MRI perfusion. A normal appearing\n             MRA with an appropriate perfusion defect is eligible. An apparent stenosis or\n             occlusion on MRA with normal appearing perfusion distally will not be eligible. Poor\n             quality or uninterpretable MRA will not make patient ineligible. Patients who have a\n             normal DWI are eligible.\n\n          5. Age 18 - 80 years, inclusive.\n\n        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:\n\n        Patients will be excluded from the study for any of the following reasons:\n\n        General:\n\n          1.

Time interval since stroke onset of less than 24 hours impossible to determine with\n             high degree of confidence.\n\n          3.

EKG\n             findings of ST elevation of greater than 0.2 mV in 2 contiguous leads, new onset left\n             bundle branch block, ST segment depression, or T-wave inversion; 3.) Elevated\n             troponin I\n\n          5. Contraindication to MRI scan.\n\n          6. Women known to be pregnant, lactating or having a positive or indeterminate pregnancy\n             test.\n\n          7. Patients who would refuse blood transfusions if medically indicated.\n\n             Stroke Related:\n\n          8.
