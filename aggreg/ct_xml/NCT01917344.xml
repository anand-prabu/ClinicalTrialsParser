  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Newborn screening and early treatment prevent the most severe manifestations of
      phenylketonuria (PKU). However, executive functioning deficits, attention deficit disorder,
      slow processing speed, and visual-motor problems commonly occur. Many adults with this
      disorder also suffer depression and anxiety. Using advanced electroencephalogram (EEG) and
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques, including novel MR spectroscopy (MRS) we hope
      to discover why this distinct constellation of deficits occurs in PKU. Adult subjects with
      PKU will undergo EEG and comprehensive MRI evaluations, including a novel method of MR
      spectroscopy to determine brain phenylalanine levels. In addition, they will receive
      neurological and neuropsychological examinations and dietary evaluation.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Adult with classic PKU who has been seen at one of the hospitals collaborating in
             this study

          3. Medical Records available that include genotype and blood phenylalanine levels during
             the first 6 years of life.  (We have over 300 patients with PKU with genotypes in our
             clinic, of whom about half are adults.)

          5. Able to undergo MRI procedures without sedating medication

          6. Does not have metal implants

          7. Not currently on Kuvan, Large Neutral Amino Acid therapy or involved in any clinical
             trials.

             -

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Mild PKU or mild hyperphenylalaninemia

          2. Less than 18 years old or great than 55 years old

          3. No medical records available for the first 6 years of life

          4. No record of genotype

          5. Not capable of providing informed consent

          6. Not able to undergo MRI without sedating medication

          7. Has metal implants
