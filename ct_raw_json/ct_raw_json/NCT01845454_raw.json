Each cohort will receive a similarly\n      dosed spray cryotherapy treatment, based on outcomes from the previous cohort.  Participants\n      will receive one treatment with spray cryotherapy per the protocol and will then be followed\n      clinically. During the next scheduled clinical endoscopy, participants will be assessed for\n      percent regression of disease following the spray cryotherapy treatment.  A determination\n      will be made regarding effectiveness of each dose based on the number of subjects that\n      achieve the primary outcome criterion (>= 50 percent BE segment regression).\n\n      The first cohort of up to 15 participants will receive an upper endoscopy in which\n      systematic images of the esophagus will be taken for the research study and will then\n      receive a treatment with spray cryotherapy using the tr\u016bFreeze\u2122 system.  These participants\n      will have a clinical follow-up endoscopy scheduled approximately 2 months after the initial\n      spray cryotherapy procedure.  During the follow-up endoscopy, physicians will be asked to\n      provide an estimate of the percent regression of disease as well as systematic images of the\n      esophagus.   These images will be sent to a central panel of masked experts who will assess\n      percent regression of disease compared to images taken prior to the first ablation\n      procedure.\n\n      Interim reviews of potential dose effectiveness will occur when 7 and 11 participants have\n      completed the follow-up visit.  If during an interim review at least 5 participants\n      experience a sub-therapeutic response, the dose will be considered sub-therapeutic as not\n      meeting the definition of \"fully effective,\" the cohort will be closed to new enrollment,\n      and enrollment on a new cohort at the next higher dose will begin.  If during an interim\n      review less than 5 participants experience a sub-therapeutic response, enrollment on that\n      cohort will continue.\n\n      If/when enrollment on a cohort reaches 15 participants a decision will be made regarding the\n      effectiveness of the dose.  If a dose is found to be \"ineffective\" or \"partially effective,\"\n      then a new cohort of individuals will be enrolled at a prescribed higher starting dose. If a\n      dose is found to be \"fully effective,\" then a confirmatory cohort will be enrolled at the\n      same dose to confirm results. Enrollment will continue until a \"fully effective\" therapeutic\n      dose of spray cryotherapy is identified and confirmed in two cohorts of 15 participants\n      each."
