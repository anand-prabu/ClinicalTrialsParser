A positive outcome will be a curve different from a straight line, with a rise and fall of lactate levels. Baseline lactate serum level is expected to be less than 2.2 mM/L. A useful outcome of this study will be identification of lactic acid above 4.4 mM/L (more than doubling) within 5 minutes of a seizure, occurring in at least half of the subjects.",
