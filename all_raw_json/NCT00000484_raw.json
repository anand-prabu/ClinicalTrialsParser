Six centers (USPHS hospitals) and a coordinating center were involved in the\n      trial.\n\n      DESIGN NARRATIVE:\n\n      Randomized, double-blind, fixed sample.  Three hundred and eighty nine eligible patients\n      were assigned to drug therapy consisting of chlorothiazide plus Rauwolfia serpentina or to\n      placebo.\n\n      The study completion date listed in this record was inferred from last publication listed in\n      the Citations section of this study record."
