The Rapid\n      Intervention group will be seen by an addiction physician from one of these services, within\n      a day or two of their admission to the WOD or the SMH WMS.  The addiction physician will\n      prescribe buprenorphine or anti-alcohol medications, and the physician, nurse and/or\n      therapist will provide ongoing counseling, follow-up and shared care with the family\n      physician.  Outcomes (measured at 6 and 12 months) include treatment retention, health care\n      utilization and cost, medications prescribed, and alcohol and opioid use."
