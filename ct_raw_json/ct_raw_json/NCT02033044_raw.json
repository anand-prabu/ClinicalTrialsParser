Clinical interviews were performed by\n      experienced psychiatrists and psychologists during 3 months to ensure the follow-up of all\n      participants prospectively. The following sociodemographic and clinical variables were\n      collected: age at recruitment, gender, education level, occupational status, and\n      pharmacological treatment. All participants were then randomized to receive CR or PE in a\n      1:1 ratio stratified by center, age, and education level. Randomization was accomplished\n      with the use of computer-generated sequence.\n\n      During the study, subjects did not receive any other individual or group psychotherapy. All\n      patients continued pharmacological treatment if it had been initiated prior to inclusion.\n      Type and doses of medication could not be modified during the study period. Both\n      interventions were applied in a group format and were conducted by two psychologists with\n      experience in managing patients with BPD. Subjects were instructed not to disclose any\n      information about the intervention to maintain blind conditions. Participants were evaluated\n      at baseline, after completion of the intervention, and six months after the end of the\n      interventions.\n\n      The study was conducted in accordance with the ethical principles of the Declaration of\n      Helsinki and the approval of the Ethical Committee for this study was obtained. All subjects\n      received extensive information about the study and provided written informed consent before\n      they were enrolled in the study."
