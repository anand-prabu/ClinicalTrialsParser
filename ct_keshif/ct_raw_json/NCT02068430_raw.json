            "textblock": "This study is designed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of using the UV-X\u2122 system\n      for treating corneal ulcers that have proven refractory to conventional antibiotic\n      treatment.\n\n      The UV-X\u2122 system is a combination product consisting of a UVA 365 nm wavelength light source\n      (UV-X\u2122 Illumination System) and riboflavin (Medio-Cross\u00ae Riboflavin 0.1%) ophthalmic\n      solution.  The therapeutic effect is mediated by the photochemical interaction of the\n      ultraviolet (UV) light with the riboflavin that has been saturated into the infected corneal\n      stromal tissues.\n\n      The photochemical interaction of UVA light with riboflavin has been used to sterilize\n      pathogens in blood and blood products.  Pathogens including viruses, bacteria, fungi, and\n      protozoa have shown to be sterilized using this photochemical process.  Presumably singlet\n      oxygen is produced by the interaction of the UVA with the riboflavin.  It is this singlet\n      oxygen that interacts with the pathogen's Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in a sufficiently\n      disruptive manner to render the exposed field sterile.\n\n      The cross-linking improves mechanical properties in the anterior stroma and has been shown\n      to stabilize corneal structure in patients with progressive keratoconus and ectasias\n      following refractive surgery.  The same technology has been applied to a handful of patients\n      with corneal ulcers and a single small series with bullous keratopathy.  In no case was the\n      patient worsened by this treatment.  In the majority of the cases, considerable clinical\n      reversal of a deteriorating clinical course was obtained.   There has been debate about the\n      mechanism of action of this beneficial effect.  It has been speculated that a proteolytic\n      collagenase enzyme was destroyed by the photochemical process.  As an alternate, it has been\n      suggested that the corneal collagen is strengthened by the cross linking and becomes more\n      resistant to the infectious process.  Finally a direct sterilization effect of the UVA\n      light, the riboflavin, or the combination has been postulated.  Recent laboratory work has\n      shown that staphylococci cultures on an agar plate will be killed when exposed to the\n      combination of UVA and riboflavin as used in these experiments.  Neither the UVA nor the\n      riboflavin alone had any bactericidal effect.\n\n      The procedure that has been used and that the investigators propose to study to treats\n      corneal infections and ulcerations is identical to the procedure used to strengthen the\n      cornea.  It is performed by saturating the cornea with riboflavin 0.1% riboflavin solution\n      and then exposing the riboflavin soaked cornea to UVA light.  After the corneal stroma\n      saturation is achieved, the infected tissues are exposed to UVA light at 365 nm and an\n      irradiance of 3 mW/cm2 for 30 minutes. Exposure of the cornea to this combination of UVA\n      light (365 nm; 3 mW/cm2 irradiation; 30 minutes duration) after topical administration of\n      riboflavin  appears to have a broad sterilization effect based on the photochemical\n      interaction of the UVA and the riboflavin."
