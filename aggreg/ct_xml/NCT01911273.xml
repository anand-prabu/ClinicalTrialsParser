  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of the study is to explore whether treatment with PF-03446962 and best
      supportive care is better than placebo plus best supportive care in prolonging survival of
      patients affected by recurrent liver cancer. In addition, the study will explore if adding
      PF-03446962 to best supportive care is safe, how PF-03446962 is metabolized, if there are
      patients' characteristics (biomarkers) that may predict response to PF-03446962, and if
      PF-03446962 has any effect on the patients' quality of life.
