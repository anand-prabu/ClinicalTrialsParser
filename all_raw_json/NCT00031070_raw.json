            "textblock": "The availability of HAART has substantially decreased the morbidity and mortality caused by\n      HIV-1 infection. There is clinical and laboratory evidence suggesting that treatment of\n      HIV-1 infection not only arrests the progressive immune deterioration caused by HIV-1, but\n      also is associated with at least partial immune reconstitution. After starting HAART, most\n      patients with chronic HIV-1 infection experience an increase in CD4 T-cells, but the\n      magnitude of CD4 lymphocyte rise is highly variable. Patients who do not experience a\n      substantial rise in circulating CD4 lymphocytes remain at risk for opportunistic infections.\n      Strategies to enhance immune restoration in HIV-1 disease are needed. Studies have shown\n      that immune restoration after HAART in patients with chronic HIV-1 infection is incomplete.\n      There are, however, several potential methods that can be used that possibly may enhance the\n      magnitude of CD4 lymphocyte rise induced by HAART. It is proposed that the lymphoid tissues,\n      in which lymphocytes are trapped and activated to die, are a major site of immunopathology\n      and cellular losses in HIV-infection. Interference with lymphocyte trapping and death in\n      lymphoid tissues when cyclosporine, an immunosuppressant, is administered at the time of\n      initiation of HAART may result in an enhancement of the magnitude of cellular restoration in\n      patients who initiate HAART.\n\n      Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms:\n\n      Arm A: Weeks 1 to 2: abacavir (ABC)/lamivudine (3TC)/zidovudine (ZDV). Weeks 3 to 48:\n      ABC/3TC/ZDV and efavirenz (EFV).\n\n      Arm B: Weeks 1 to 2: ABC/3TC/ZDV and cyclosporine. Weeks 3 to 48: ABC/3TC/ZDV and EFV.\n\n      Patients in both arms receive the following immunizations: Weeks 8 and 12: Hepatitis A\n      vaccine inactivated and rabies vaccine.\n\n      Week 16: Rabies vaccine. To ascertain whether the augmentation in the rise in CD4\n      lymphocytes is sustained, the number of circulating CD4 lymphocytes 48 weeks after starting\n      therapy is compared. To examine the functional significance of the cellular increases, the\n      ability of patients to respond to immunization with recall and neoantigens are compared\n      between the cyclosporine plus HAART arm and the HAART alone arm.\n\n      Substudy A5139: A 2-week substudy designed to explore the mechanisms of first-phase cellular\n      restoration is performed. Patients undergo 4 lymph node aspirates. Lymphocytes are analyzed\n      by the use of flow cytometry and correlated with findings in the main study. There is no\n      limit on patient enrollment. Patients register to the substudy immediately after randomizing\n      to the main study."
