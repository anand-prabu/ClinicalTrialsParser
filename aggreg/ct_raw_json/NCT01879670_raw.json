We need new treatments that improve patients' symptoms and extend\n      life. Recently the new CircuLite Synergy pump has come into use. It is the smallest pump\n      manufactured to date and does not cover the full work of the heart, instead providing\n      \"partial\" support. One interesting thing about this is that taking some strain off the heart\n      might allow the muscle to repair and rebuild its own strength. This process is called\n      reverse remodelling, and is the topic of this research. Our hypothesis is that \"partial\"\n      support improves patients' symptoms and causes improvement in heart muscle function. We also\n      want to examine the best techniques for assessing this, including new scanning and molecular\n      tests, and study some practical aspects of the pump to do with blood clotting."

We will assess whether\n      the Synergy pump facilitates functional, structural and molecular LV reverse remodelling in\n      vivo; assess how this can be determined and predicted by analysis of circulating micro RNA\n      profiles and specific echocardiographic parameters; and evaluate the haematological\n      abnormalities associated with this new LVAD.\n\n      We will address these questions with a prospective, observational study comparing patients\n      implanted with the Synergy device with matched heart failure controls. The two study centres\n      will be Royal Brompton & Harefield NHS Foundation Trust (Harefield Hospital) and University\n      Hospitals Leuven, Belgium. We will recruit a total of 64 patients. The primary outcome will\n      be change in peak VO2 at 6 months. Secondary outcomes will include functional parameters,\n      profiling of circulating microRNA, multimodal echocardiographic assessment and comprehensive\n      assessment of platelet activation and coagulopathy.\n\n      We will quantify the LV reverse remodelling associated with partial support; define new echo\n      and microRNA markers of reverse remodelling for clinical use, with insights into underlying\n      pathophysiology; and describe the haematological profile of these patients to guide future\n      antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy."
