  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the combination of low frequency
      repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and motor-imagery-based brain computer
      interface (BCI) training is effective for enhancing motor recovery after stroke.

      The PI's hypothesis is that, in comparison with traditional physical therapy alone, subjects
      receiving supplementary rTMS and BCI training will show greater functional improvements in
      hand motor ability over time as well as recovery of normal motor connectivity patterns.

      The goal of the present study is to develop and evaluate a brain based approach to improve
      motor recovery after stroke, by combining rTMS and BCI training. Treatments will consist of
      low frequency rTMS applied to the contralesional hemisphere, followed by BCI training to
      encourage activity within the lesioned hemisphere. The primary objective of this study is to
      test the main hypothesis above in a stroke patient population. Subjects will also undergo a
      period of BCI only treatments after completion of the combined rTMS and BCI portion.
