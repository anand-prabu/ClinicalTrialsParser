  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the skeleton of the legs and the running style in
      order to predict a possible overuse injury.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The running style and the training composition and the body composition are thought to have
      a major effect on the development of overuse injuries.

      To define a prevention strategy, one must have the knowledge about risk factors and
      causation. The training composition is very relevant clinically but the underlying factors
      have not been studied yet. Until now, no research shows the possible relation between the
      body composition such as the mutual length and width of femur and tibia and the development
      of overuse injuries.

      Therefore, the aim of this study is to achieve evidence-based knowledge about these factors
      in order to advice runners about the precautions and to avoid that people get a sedentary
      lifestyle.
