Confirmed TB cases will be followed up during TB\n      therapy until month six after treatment initiation in order to obtain clinical and\n      microbiological data on treatment including treatment response. Apart from relevant research\n      questions in the field of TB diagnostics and treatment, the main objective of this study\n      will be the development of a clinical TB research site, including capacity development in\n      clinical and laboratory based TB research methods, in Mavalane, Maputo."

In\n      patients with signs of extrapulmonary TB manifestation, specimen collection other than\n      sputum are to be decided by the treating physician in the patient' s best interest, to\n      establish TB diagnosis by using smear microscopy and/or Xpert MTB/RIF assay. Patients\n      without a positive Xpert MTB/RIF-assay result will not continue in the study but will be\n      referred to the National TB Program for further evaluation and treatment. In patients with a\n      positive Xpert MTB/RIF result in any specimen anti TB treatment will be commenced according\n      to the National Guidelines. All TB positive study participants will be followed up until 6\n      months after TB treatment initiation.\n\n      Study methods:\n\n      Follow up visits will occur at week 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 17 and 26 after commencement of TB\n      therapy. An optional visit will be performed in selected patients at week 52 in order to\n      confirm cure of TB disease. At each study visit, a clinical investigation will be performed\n      and a medical questionnaire will be completed for each participant. Further, sputum and\n      urine samples will be collected for the evaluation of the new TB diagnostics. A chest x-ray\n      will be performed and blood for HIV testing, CD4 count, biochemistry and full blood picture\n      will be collected at baseline only or when medically indicated during the course of the\n      study.\n\n      Data recording and analysis:\n\n      The study will follow ethical principles as outlined in the declaration of Helsinki and its\n      revisions (last in 2008) and will be performed in compliance with the guidelines of Good\n      Clinical, Laboratory (GCLP) and Clinical Data Management Practice (GCDMP). All essential\n      documents will be archived for 3 years. All patient information will be treated in a\n      strictly confidential manner and will be linked to a unique ID number and not to personal\n      identifiers. Data will be collected on paper CRFs, which will be entered into a secured\n      clinical data management system, for which daily backups will be done. Double data entry\n      will minimize data entry errors, and full data validation and cleaning process will be\n      employed."
