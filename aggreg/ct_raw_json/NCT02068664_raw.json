The study investigators would like to screen stroke\n      survivors with aphasia because they may also have spatial neglect (right neglect after left\n      hemisphere stroke), which is said by the literature to occur in 25% of cases. If it is\n      identified, a treatment approach will be offered, to attempt to remediate the condition\n      using prism goggles, following a prism treatment protocol based on previous studies."
