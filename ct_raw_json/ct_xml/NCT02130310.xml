    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to evaluate the clinical benefit of CureXcell® as adjunct to
      Standard of Care in the treatment of Chronic Venous Leg Ulcers. CureXcell® is a cell based
      therapy, containing activated homologous white blood cells prepared from donated healthy
      whole blood. A total of 252 patients will be randomized to receive either CureXcell® or
      Placebo.
