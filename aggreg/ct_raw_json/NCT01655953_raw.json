Due to increased urinary calcium excretion and bone resorption a high\n      NaCl-intake is considered as a risk factor for osteoporosis. On the contrary an alkaline\n      diet is known to have a beneficial influence on bone metabolism. Therefore the investigators\n      hypothesized that an alkaline diet can reduce NaCl-induced bone resorption.\n\n      8 healthy male volunteers took part in a stationary study carried out in the metabolic ward\n      of the German Aerospace Center. The study consisted of 2 campaigns, each lasting 16 days.\n      Both campaigns were divided into 5 days of adaptation, 10 days of intervention and 1.5 days\n      of stationary recovery. During the intervention period the volunteers diet was NaCl-rich\n      (7.7 mmol Na/kg body weight/day) and supplemented in one campaign by 90 mmol potassium\n      bicarbonate (KHCO3) in a randomized cross-over design. The other campaign served as control.\n\n      Bone metabolism was studied by bone formation markers in the fasting morning blood and\n      24h-urinary bone resorption markers. Acid base status was assessed by blood gas analyses in\n      the fasted and the postprandial state as well as urinary markers. Protein turnover was\n      studied with stable isotopes. Further physiological systems like energy metabolism and the\n      cardiovascular system are also under investigation."
