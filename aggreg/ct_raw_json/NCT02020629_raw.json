Type 1 diabetes (including LADA)\n\n          3. Pregnant or lactating female.  Women of childbearing potential with no effective\n             contraceptive method.

They must use an\n             effective contraceptive method throughout the study, and agree to repeat pregnancy\n             tests at designated visits. The applied methods of contraception have to meet the\n             criteria for a highly effective method of birth control according to the \"Note for\n             guidance on non-clinical safety studies for the conduct of human clinical trials for\n             pharmaceuticals (CPMP/ICH/286/95)\"\n\n          4.

Donation of one unit (500 ml) or more of blood, significant blood loss equaling to at\n             least one unit of blood within the past 2 weeks or a blood transfusion within the\n             past 8 weeks.\n\n          8. Treatment with growth hormone and oral or parenteral corticosteroid (> 7 consecutive\n             days of treatment) within 8 weeks prior to visit 1 and thereafter during the whole\n             study period.\n\n          9. Use of other investigational drugs within 30 days prior to visit 1.\n\n         10. Laboratory findings at the time of screening, including amylase and/or lipase > 3\n             times the upper limit of the normal laboratory range (ULN) and P-calcitonin \u226520 pg/ml\n             (5.9 pmol/L).\n\n         11. Personal or immediate family history of medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) or genetic\n             condition that predisposes to MTC (e.g. multiple endocrine neoplasia syndromes).\n\n         12. History of unexplained pancreatitis, chronic pancreatitis, pancreatectomy,\n             stomach/gastric surgery\n\n         13. Allergic reaction to any GLP-1 receptor agonist or to metacresol\n\n         14. Clinically relevant history of gastrointestinal disease associated with prolonged\n             nausea and vomiting,\n\n         15. Cardiovascular, hepatic, neurological, or endocrine disease, active malignant tumor\n             or other major systemic disease or patients with short life expectancy making\n             implementation of the protocol or interpretation of the study results difficult."
