  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study aims to objectively assess 2-year clinical and radiographic results for
      the rate of glenoid component loosening in total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA). This
      retrospective radiographic review will provide evidence for equivalence or superiority in
      curtailing loosening, a known complication in arthroplasty, when a hemostatic agent is
      utilized in conjunction with cement at the glenoid.

    <description>Radiographic loosening is defined by the presence of radiolucent lines at the bone-cement interface at 2 years. Lines are measured as being either not-present, less than 2mm or greater than/equal to 2mm, in addition to implant seating and the radiodensity between the flanges of the central peg.</description>
