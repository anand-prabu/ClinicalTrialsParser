The dorsal digital island flap can be used\n      for repairing the defect of adjacent finger, but the limited length of the pedicle precludes\n      its use for a more distal defect. The heterodigital neurocutaneous island flap of the dorsal\n      branch of the digital nerve can be used as an alternative to resolve this problem."

The test determines the minimal distance at which a subject can sense the presence of two needles. The modified American Society for Surgery of the Hand guidelines were used to stratify Discriminator measurements (excellent <6 mm; good 6-10 mm; fair 11-15 mm; poor >15 mm. The test point is at the center of the flap.  Each area was tested 3 times with a Discriminator (Ali Med, Dedham, MA). Two out of 3 correct answers were considered proof of perception before proceeding to another lower value. We stop at 4mm as a limit of 2PD and considered this normal. These assessments take place at a single time point at the final follow-up.",
