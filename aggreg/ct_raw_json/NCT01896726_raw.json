The\n             pregnancy test result must be negative at screening and at each check-in visit.\n             Participants must have a regular menstrual cycle of approximately 28 days duration\n             for at least 4 previous cycles prior to screening\n\n          -  Postmenopausal females, or women not of child-bearing potential due to surgical\n             sterilization (at least 3 months after surgical hysterectomy, or at least 3 months\n             after bilateral oophorectomy or bilateral tubal occlusion with or without\n             hysterectomy) confirmed by medical history, or menopause.
