  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a progressive degenerative disease of the retina, which often
      leads to blindness. 1 in 4000 people in the UK are affected by RP yet there is no
      established therapy for treating or delaying its progression.

      Transcorneal electrical stimulation (TES) has garnered attention as a possible therapeutic
      option for RP. Research has shown that TES improves retinal cell viability and visual
      function. An initial pilot study of TES on 24 participants with RP demonstrated that it was
      safe and improved vision.

      This study aims to confirm the safety of the new CE-approved Okustim device and to further
      characterise the benefits of TES on a larger scale. 12 participants will be enrolled for 1
      year across two sites in the UK - the Oxford Eye Hospital and London Moorfields Eye
      Hospital.

      Recruited participants will undergo weekly TES of 1 eye for 30 minutes for a period of 6
      months. This will be followed by a further 6 months of observation without stimulation
      giving a total participation time of 1 year. Participants will be assessed at 3, 6, 9 and 12
      months after their initial baseline visit by clinical examination, investigations and
      questionnaires.

      Participants should have a diagnosis of RP and be capable of giving consent. Participants,
      or a carer, should have sufficient motor skills to attach the device themselves. As this
      study seeks to ascertain the impact of TES on RP, participants with other eye diseases (e.g.
      diabetic retinopathy) cannot be included in the study.

             study

          -  Male or Female, 18 or more years of age

          -  Diagnosis of retinitis pigmentosa (rod-cone dystrophy) made by an ophthalmologist

          -  Participants should have a visual acuity of ≥ 0.02 (Snellen Chart)

          -  Able (in the investigators opinion) and willing to comply with all study requirements

          -  Willing to allow his or her General Practitioner and consultant, if appropriate, to
             be notified of participation in the study

          -  Participants, or a designated other, should have sufficient motor skills (assessed by
             the investigator) to apply the device independently

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Female participants who are pregnant, lactating or planning pregnancy during the
             course of the study

          -  Diabetic Retinopathy

          -  Any other significant disease or disorder which, in the opinion of the Investigator,
             may either put the participants at risk because of participation in the study, or may
             influence the result of the study, or the participant's ability to participate in the
             study

          -  Forms of mental illness related to bipolar affective and schizoid-affective
             disorders, and all forms of dementia
