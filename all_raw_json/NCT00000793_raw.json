In\n      this comparative study of amitriptyline and mexiletine, benztropine mesylate also will be\n      included as an active placebo to mimic the side effects of the study drugs.\n\n      Patients are randomized to receive amitriptyline, mexiletine, or benztropine mesylate as an\n      active placebo to mimic the mild side effects associated with both amitriptyline and\n      mexiletine. Doses are gradually increased over 4 weeks until a minimum effective dose or MTD\n      is reached, then patients are treated for at least 4 additional weeks at the final dose\n      before gradually tapering off. Neurologic exams are performed at screening and at the end of\n      treatment. Intensity of pain is rated twice daily by the patient. Patients are followed at\n      Weeks 2, 4, and 8, and at 10 days after completely tapering off of drug.\n\n      PER 3/16/95 AMENDMENT: Patients with no pain relief 14 days after initiation of study\n      therapy may have dose doubled or increased to maximum allowable dose, whichever is lower.\n      Then if no improvement occurs within 14 days after dose increase, patients have the option\n      of discontinuing study medication."
