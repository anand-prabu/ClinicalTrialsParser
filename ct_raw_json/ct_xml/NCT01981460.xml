      We are evaluating the effect of methylene blue and visible light activation on the
      microbiome of the skin.

    <textblock>
      Antiseptics are routinely utilized to prevent infections of vascular catheters. We are
      evaluating the addition of methylene blue and light activation on skin to determine whether
      this inexpensive and non-toxic treatment can decrease skin pathogens and prevent blood
      stream infections of long-term vascular catheters. This is a pilot study of normal
      volunteers to determine the effect on the microbiome of the addition of methylene blue and
      light activation on antiseptic-treated skin.

    <description>We compared the two arms of each subject --one arm treated with chloraprep and a biopatch [routine treatment of skin] to the routine treatment with the addition of methylene blue spray and light activation. The microbiome of both skin areas were assessed before and after the routine treatment and the treatment with the addition of methylene blue therapy;</description>
