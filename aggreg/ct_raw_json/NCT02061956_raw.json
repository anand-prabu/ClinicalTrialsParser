The 2005 guidelines of the American Association for the\n      Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) for HCC states that hepatic resection(HR) can be offered to\n      patients with a solitary lesion if they are non-cirrhotic, or have cirrhosis but still have\n      well-preserved liver function. With the improvement of surgical technique and perioperative\n      care, the surgical mortality for HCC resection can be reduced to less than 1%, and the\n      5-year overall survival can exceed 50%. Although with the development of medical science,\n      more and more patients diagnose HCC at early stage, a lot of  patients with HCC still\n      continue to present with multiple tumors or port vein thrombosis.
