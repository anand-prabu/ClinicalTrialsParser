The T-cells involved in\n      psoriasis exhibit a Th17-like and a Th1-like cytokine secretion profile.  This excess\n      Th17/Th1 response is thought to play a critical role in the development of psoriasis, and\n      reducing Th17/Th1 activity would be a potential way of halting the inflammatory process\n      leading to psoriasis."
