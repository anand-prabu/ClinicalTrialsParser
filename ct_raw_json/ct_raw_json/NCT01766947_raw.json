            "textblock": "Primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) is associated with inadequate drainage of the aqueous\n      humor via the trabecular meshwork through the Schlemm's canal towards the systemic\n      circulation. This may lead to an increase in IOP and may damage the optic nerve. The purpose\n      of glaucoma management is to lower IOP in order to prevent progression of the optic\n      neuropathy and subsequent visual loss. Firstline treatment usually includes IOP-lowering\n      drug therapy. However, if IOP remains uncontrolled and/or the optic nerve damage progresses\n      despite controlled IOP, surgery may be indicated. Deep sclerectomy (DS) is a non-penetrating\n      surgical procedure for the treatment of open angle glaucoma that allows the enhancement of\n      the aqueous outflow by removing part of the inner wall of Schlemm's canal and trabecular\n      meshwork. DS was shown to achieve a good control on IOP over the long term.\n\n      The purpose of this study is to assess the 24-hour IOP fluctuation profile recorded with\n      Triggerfish in patients with POAG before and after DS."
