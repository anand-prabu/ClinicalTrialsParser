    <textblock>
      This study is to prove that there is no difference in the number of healthy male volunteers
      that will experience pyrexia (i.e. fever with body temperature of 38°C or higher) within a
      24 hour period after administration of a single dose of 6mg/kg of PF-05280014 or trastuzumab
      sourced from the United States (trastuzumab-US).  The study will also compare the safety of
      both drugs.

             lbs).

          -  Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) within the normal range as measured by

          -  Subjects who have previously been exposed to a biologic agent (other than a HER2
             inhibitor) may enroll provided that at least 3 months have passed since the last
             administration of that drug.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence or history of clinically significant hematological, renal, endocrine,
             pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric, neurologic, or
             allergic disease (including drug allergies, but excluding untreated, asymptomatic,
             seasonal allergies at time of dosing).

          -  Previous exposure to an anti-HER2 antibody.

          -  History of serious allergic or anaphylactic reaction to a therapeutic drug or benzyl
