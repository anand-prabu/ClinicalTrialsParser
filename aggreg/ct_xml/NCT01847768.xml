  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although changes in the lungs, known as remodeling, are a feature of asthma, the causes and
      mechanisms involved in the process have not yet been found. Recently, it has been
      established that remodeling can be observed in children prior to a formal diagnosis of
      asthma. Clinical studies indicate that human rhinovirus (HRV) &quot;common cold&quot; infections are a
      common cause of recurrent respiratory illnesses in childhood, and children with
      HRV-associated wheezing episodes have an increased risk of developing asthma. This led to
      the hypothesis that HRV infections may play a central role in the start of the airway
      remodeling leading to asthma.

      The investigators plan to perform a study in which the investigators will expose subjects
      with mild-moderate asthma and healthy control subjects to HRV. This will allow us to
      accurately study the kinetics of HRV-induced inflammatory and remodeling responses in a well
      characterized group of asthmatic subjects and compare these outcomes to those in a healthy,
      non-asthmatic control group. The investigators will try to determine if alterations in
      relevant airway remodeling growth factors differ between healthy controls and asthmatic
      subjects, pre- and post-HRV infection. These growth factors will be assessed in
      bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and endobronchial biopsy tissues and correlated with
      viral levels in both nasal lavage and BAL fluid.
