  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2 study of oral dacomitinib given every 12 hours over days 1-4 of each
      two-week cycle to patients with Non-small cell lung cancer.  The study includes two groups
      of patients, those whose tumor has a documented T790M mutation, and those without this
      mutation.  All patients will receive repeated cycles of dacomitinib until disease
      progression, occurrence of unacceptable toxicity, or other withdrawal criteria are met.

    <description>Number of participants with best overall response recorded from the start of treatment until disease progression according to RECIST 1.1. Complete Response are defined as disappearance of all non-nodal lesions (target and/or non-target) without new lesions. All lymph nodes must have reduction in short axis to &quot;normal&quot; size (&lt;10mm). Partial Response are those with at least 30% decrease in sum of the diameters of target lesions (short diameter for target nodes and longest diameter for other target lesions) taking as a reference the baseline sum diameters, with absence of new lesions and persistence of any non target lesions and/or tumor marker level above the normal limits. Best Overall Response of Stable Disease may be assigned when response cannot be confirmed given minimum criteria for Stable Disease duration is met.</description>

    <description>Percentage of participants with Overall Response based assessment of confirmed complete response or confirmed partial response according to RECIST 1.1. Confirmed response are those that persist on repeat imaging assessment at least 4 weeks after initial documentation of response and before progression. Complete Response are defined as disappearance of all non-nodal lesions (target and/or non-target) without new lesions. All lymph nodes must have reduction in short axis to &quot;normal&quot; size (&lt;10mm). Partial Response are those with at least 30% decrease in sum of the diameters of target lesions (short diameter for target nodes and longest diameter for other target lesions) taking as a reference the baseline sum diameters, with absence of new lesions and persistence of any non target lesions and/or tumor marker level above the normal limits.</description>

    <description>For patients in Cohort A, Disease Control is the best response of Complete Response, Partial Response or Stable Disease from the start of treatment until disease progression according to the RECIST v1.1 guidelines.  Disease Control Rate is calculated as the proportion of patients with an objective response or Stable Diseaes relative to the total number of patients enrolled.</description>

    <description>For patients in Cohort A, Duration of Response is defined as the time from first documentation of response (Complete Response or Partial Response whichever occurs first) to the date of disease progression or to death due to any cause, whichever occurs first.</description>
