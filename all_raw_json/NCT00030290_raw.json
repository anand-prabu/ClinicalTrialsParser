High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) energy using\n      the Sonablate system is delivered to the prostate tissue over approximately 2-3 hours.\n      Patients with residual cancer lesion (by biopsy), PSA greater than 0.5 ng/mL or increasing\n      PSA levels taken at least 2 months apart, visible prostate tissue on ultrasound, and no\n      local or distant metastases after day 90 undergo retreatment with HIFU.\n\n      Patients are followed at 2, 14, 30, 90, and 180 days.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued for this study."
