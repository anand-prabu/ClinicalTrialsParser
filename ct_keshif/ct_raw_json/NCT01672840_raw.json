The randomized, controlled, modified\n      Latin square parallel design will compare the effects of two doses of cocoa consumption on\n      blood pressure, endothelial function and arterial stiffness in 120 adults with stage 1\n      hypertension.\n\n      Hypothesis #1 To verify the efficacy of an 8-week course of cocoa-containing product\n      consumption on blood pressure in adults with stage 1 hypertension. Specifically, to\n      demonstrate at least 3.5 mmHg improvement in 24-hour mean systolic blood pressure following\n      8 weeks of treatment with cocoa- containing products when compared to placebo. Our\n      hypothesis is that cocoa-containing product consumption will result in clinically\n      significant improvement of systolic blood pressure at the conclusion of an 8-week course of\n      treatment.\n\n      Hypothesis #2 To identify a dose-response relationship in which increasingly higher doses of\n      cocoa powder in cocoa-containing products will demonstrate correspondingly greater\n      beneficial effects on blood pressure over an 8-week period in individuals with stage 1\n      hypertension. Specifically, to investigate the effects of the variation of dose of cocoa\n      powder in cocoa-containing products (i.e. 5 grams or 10 grams of cocoa powder) for 8 weeks\n      on blood pressure. We hypothesize that increasingly higher doses of cocoa powder in\n      cocoa-containing products will demonstrate correspondingly greater beneficial effects on\n      blood pressure.\n\n      Hypothesis #3 To assess the effects of different doses of cocoa-containing product\n      consumption over an 8-week period on 24-hour diastolic blood pressure, endothelial function,\n      arterial stiffness, serum lipids, theobromine, CRP, glucose, insulin, body weight, and waist\n      circumference in adults with stage 1 hypertension. We hypothesize that consumption of\n      cocoa-containing products will lower diastolic blood pressure; improve endothelial function\n      of our participants; reduce arterial stiffness; improve serum lipids; theobromine; and will\n      have no clinically meaningful effects on body weight and waist circumference, CRP, glucose,\n      or insulin."
