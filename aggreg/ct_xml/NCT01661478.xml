      The purpose of this quality improvement research project is to briefly survey attitudes
      among healthcare providers toward patients with substance use disorders before and after
      substance abuse counselors are placed in the Emergency Room. SBIRT stands for Screening
      Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment.  The pre-test survey contains 10 questions
      about attitudes toward patients with substance use disorders and the post-test survey
      consists of 13 questions about attitudes toward patients with substance use disorders and
      questions regarding the SBIRT model itself. Health care providers will be surveyed before
      the SBIRT Counselors begin and again at 6 months, after full SBIRT program with substance
      counselors on site has been in place, as a part of their regular staff education
      requirements.  Part of the goal of the SBIRT counselors is to educate providers about
      treatment and analyze data collected by and comments of Emergency Room staff.
