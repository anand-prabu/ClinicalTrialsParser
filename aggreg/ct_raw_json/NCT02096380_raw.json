However, whether three cycles induction\n      could delay the whole time of treatment and reduce the survival benefit are still unknown. A\n      retrospective study of one cycle TPF induction chemotherapy by the investigators group (not\n      yet published) could improve survival in NPC. It encourage us to conduct this clinical\n      trial."

Patients in both arms receive radical Intensity modulated radiation\n      therapy (Trilogy, Varian), and cisplatin (30mg/m2) every weeks for six cycles during\n      radiotherapy. Radiation is delivered to GTV at 70 Gy in 30 fractions, CTV1 at at 60 Gy in 30\n      fractions and CTV2 at 54 Gy in 30 fractions. Patients in the investigational arm receive\n      docetaxel (60mg/m2 on day 1), cisplatin (20mg/m2 on day 1-4) and fluorouracil\n      (800mg/m2/d,continuous infusion, day 1-4) every three weeks for one cycle or three cycles\n      before the radiotherapy. The primary end point is response rates after radiotherapy,\n      failure-free survival (FFS) and toxic effects and treatment compliance. Secondary end points\n      include overall survival (OS), distant failure-free survival (D-FFS), locoregional\n      failure-free survival (LR-FFS). All efficacy analyses are conducted in the\n      intention-to-treat population; the safety population include only patients who receive their\n      randomly assigned treatment."
