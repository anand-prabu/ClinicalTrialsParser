Patients are\n      randomized to one of two treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral exisulind 4 times daily.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo 4 times daily. Treatment continues for 1 year.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 100 patients (50 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this\n      study."
