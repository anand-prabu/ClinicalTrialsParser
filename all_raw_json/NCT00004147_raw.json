Patients are stratified by\n      anticonvulsant (anticonvulsants that cause induction of CYP450 vs anticonvulsants that cause\n      modest or no induction of CYP450 or no anticonvulsant).\n\n        -  Phase I: Patients receive oral COL-3 daily. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks in the\n           absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of COL-3 until the maximum tolerated dose\n      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients\n      experience dose limiting toxicity.\n\n        -  Phase II: Patients receive oral COL-3 daily at the MTD from the phase I portion of this\n           study.\n\n      Patients are followed every 2 months until death.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-18 patients will be accrued for phase I of the study and a\n      total of 35 patients will be accrued for phase II of the study at a rate of 3 patients per\n      month."
