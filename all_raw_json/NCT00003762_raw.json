Evaluate the\n      toxicity of this treatment in these patients. III. Describe the quality of life parameters\n      of patients receiving this combination therapy. IV. Determine the survival rate of these\n      patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified by disease (stage IIIB vs stage\n      IV) and performance status (0 vs 1). Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms\n      (Arm I now closed). Arm I: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 1 followed by\n      gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. (closed as of 8/31/1999) Arm II:\n      Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour and gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and\n      15. Arm III: Patients receive docetaxel IV on day 1 and gemcitabine IV on days 1, 8, and 15.\n      Patients continue treatment every 28 days for a maximum of 6 courses in the absence of\n      unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Patients with either stable disease or\n      complete/partial response who discontinue treatment after 4-6 courses may be eligible for\n      NCCTG-97-24-51. Quality of life is assessed before treatment and before each course of\n      therapy. Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, then every 3 months for 5 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 19-53 patients will be accrued for this study within 6-18\n      months."
