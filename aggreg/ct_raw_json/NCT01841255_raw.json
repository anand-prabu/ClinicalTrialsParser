            "textblock": "Background - Preoxygenation is performed before general anesthesia to increase the oxygen\n      reserves of the body and prolong the safe period of apnea without hypoxia. However, it is\n      often impossible to obtain a perfect face mask fit, and optimal end-tidal fractional oxygen\n      concentration (EtO2) are not attained.  The investigators designed a new oropharyngeal\n      preoxygenation device, UMOX\u2122, to avoid leaks during preoxygenation. In this study, the\n      investigators compared the efficacy of  UMOX\u2122 with that of a conventional face mask.\n\n      Methods - In 50 healthy volunteers breathing 100% oxygen from a circle absorber system for a\n      5 minute-period, the investigators compared preoxygenation using the 1) a conventional mask;\n       2) UMOX\u2122 without any instruction; 3) UMOX\u2122 with instruction on mouth breathing; and 4)\n      UMOX\u2122 with a nose clip, in random order.  Each subject underwent all steps with a 10-minute\n      rest period of room air breathing between each step.  Inspired and end-tidal respiratory\n      gases were measured every 10 seconds.  EtO2 variation was analyzed using Anova."

            "textblock": "This study was as a single center, crossover, randomized trial.  Following approval from\n      research and ethics committee from our hospital and written consent from healthy subjects\n      recruited, 50 consenting volunteers were enrolled over a three-month period, from: September\n      29, 2008 to November 5, 2008.\n\n      Subjects enrolled were of both genders, smokers and non-smokers, American Society of\n      Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I or II, 18 to 65 years old.  Nonrecruitment\n      depended on the presence of any craniofacial abnormality, facial hair (beard or moustache)\n      or absence of teeth.  Well-controlled non-severe asthma was not a criterion for exclusion.\n\n      The trial was conducted in an operating room, using the Dr\u00e4ger Fabius GS (Dr\u00e4ger, Canada),\n      anesthesia machine in a usual set up with the operating table.  The investigators used a,\n      patient circuit system consists of 1.5-L lime soda absorber connected to disposable\n      corrugated tubing and a 2-L breathing bag.  Gases were analyzed through a Marquette Medical\n      Systems\u2122 SAM module (GE Healthcare), volumes monitored with a GE Respirator Mechanics-M (GE\n      Healthcare) and SpO2 measured with a Nellcor\u2122 (Covidien) pulse oximetry positioned on a\n      finger.  Preoxygenation procedures were explained to the subjects and ample time was allowed\n      so they could become familiar with the mask and mouth piece.  Set up for the measure was\n      conducted by the same experimenter.  Subjects laid supine and preoxygenation was performed\n      with fresh gas flow: 100% oxygen (O2) 10L/minute, administered trough facemask or mouth\n      piece sequentially in a random order.  Randomization was established with a random\n      assignment table (ww.randomization.com). The envelope was open as the subject entered the\n      operating room (OR).  At the beginning and between each step, the anesthesia circuit was\n      flushed with 100% (O2).  Each subject went through all steps in random order, each requiring\n      a 5-min period of: 1) tidal breathing using the facemask (TVFM); 2) tidal volume breathing\n      with the UMOXTM mouthpiece (TVMP); 3) tidal volume breathing with the UMOXTM mouthpiece and\n      verbal instructions to favor mouth breathing (TVMPMB); (4) tidal volume breathing with the\n      UMOXTM mouthpiece and a nose clip (TVMPNC).  The experimenter conducting the steps\n      instructed participants to create a seal with their lips around the mouthpiece and\n      readjusted the facemask when the subject signalled a discernable leak.  Each step was\n      interrupted by 10 minutes of breathing normal room air to allow for return to original\n      respiratory status.  Continuous recording of experimental measures, displayed on the\n      anesthesia monitoring system, was done on digital films (Canon PowershotS5 IS\u2122).  For the\n      purpose of our trial, 10 seconds intervals were considered adequate for following\n      preoxygenation trends.  End-tidal O2 was measured continuously for 5 min.  We have also\n      evaluated the level of satisfaction of the subject with each technique using a 1-4\n      scale.Participants were asked to asses their comfort by showing the associated number with\n      their fingers.  Finally we described the performance of the facemask ventilation technique\n      as reported by the experimenter on a scale of 1 to 4.Primary outcome was the end-tidal O2\n      at the end of the 5-minutes preoxygenation period.  Secondary outcomes included endtidal O2\n      as a function of time, the number of subjects reaching at least 87% EtO2, subject\n      satisfaction and ease of ventilation.\n\n      Based on the few studies available on different preoxygenation technques, the end-tidal\n      oxygen fraction standard deviation can range from 5% to about 20% depending on the device\n      used for preoxygenation3,4,14,15.  Assuming a 12% value for standard deviation, sample size\n      calculations were made for Type I and Type II errors of 5% and 20%, respectively (power of\n      80%).  From these numbers and taking account that we would rely on multiple comparisons, the\n      power analysis suggested that 50 subjects would allow us to find a difference between groups\n      around 9%. The 9nvestigators analyzed the EtO2 final value with one-way ANOVA followed by\n      the Tukey's Multiple Comparisons test.  Percentage of participants reaching at least 87%\n      EtO2 are described with survival curves compared with Kaplan-Meier log rank test.  Tolerance\n      is presented using Kruskal-Wallis with Dunn's Multiple Comparisons test."
