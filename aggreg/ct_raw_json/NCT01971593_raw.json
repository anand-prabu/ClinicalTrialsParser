Half of enrolled patients will have the 3 month drug free period at the end of 12\n      months on therapy. Patients will be randomly assigned to drug free period up front versus at\n      the conclusion of the trial period. Eplerenone will be started at a dose of 25mg and\n      titrated up to 50mg at 4 weeks if tolerated.
