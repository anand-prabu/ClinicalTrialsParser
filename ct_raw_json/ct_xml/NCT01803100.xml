      Overall Aim: To describe and to assess the change in the temporal profile and transmission
      of microorganisms between patients and environmental surfaces after admission into a newly
      disinfected room.

      Study Activities: Investigators will prospectively and concurrently perform microbiological
      sampling of body sites (nose, throat, axillae, perineal and wounds) high touch surfaces
      (e.g. bedside rail, bed surface, toilet seat, IV pump and tray table) for consented adult
      patients admitted to freshly cleaned patient rooms. The microbiological sampling of body
      sites is already performed in many units of the hospital as standard of care. Infection and
      readmission related data from enrolled patients will be collected for upto 1 year after
      enrollment.

      Data analysis: Standard surveillance for hospital-acquired infections will be performed by
      the infection control group of the hospital. The identity and the nature of micro-organisms
      colonizing the high touch surfaces of rooms and of patient's body sites will be determined
      and compared. Risks involved is no more than minimal risk.
