Expected results\n      include the relief of symptoms and improvement of function in patients with symptomatic\n      osteoarthritis (OA) of the CMC-1 joint. Evaluation of device performance will be achieved\n      through measurements of pain, pain medication use, and joint function in up to 40 subjects.\n      Each subject will be compared to their pre-surgery status for each endpoint."

CMC-1 joint function will be\n      assessed by measurement of lateral key and tripod pinch strength, grip strength, and range\n      of motion. Patient reported physical functioning and symptoms will be measured by DASH\n      scores. Trapezial height will be measured on standard PA xrays of the CMC joint. Incidence\n      of unanticipated device and procedure related adverse events will be documented\n      intraoperatively through one year follow-up.\n\n      Primary and secondary outcomes will be evaluated through one year and subjects will continue\n      to be followed for two years for evaluation of longer term performance."
