II. Examine the\n      immune response to HSPPC-96 in this group of patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Six weeks after surgery patients are given\n      autologous tumor derived gp96 heat shock protein peptide complex (HSPPC-96) subcutaneously\n      once a week for 4 weeks. Five patients are initially enrolled at each of two dose levels. An\n      additional three patients may be enrolled at each dose level to determine the optimal dose\n      of HSPPC-96. Patients are followed at weeks 1, 4, and 12 after treatment.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 16 patients will be accrued for this study."
