  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: The oral bioavailability of curcumin is low due to its limited intestinal
      uptake, rapid metabolism and excretion from the body. Considering its potent reported
      health-beneficial properties, researchers have tried to increase its bioavailability as a
      means to enhance its biological activities.

      Objective: The aim of the project was to develop novel curcumin formulations with enhanced
      oral bioavailability and to study the safety of the formulations and potential
      sex-differences in humans.

      Design: In this single-blind crossover study with three arms separated by â‰¥1-week washout
      periods, healthy subjects (13 women, 10 men) were provided standardized meals and took, in
      random order, a single oral dose of 500 mg curcumin as native powder, micronized powder, or
      liquid micelles. Blood and urine samples were collected in intervals for 24 h and total
      curcumin, demethoxycurcumin, and bis-demethoxycurcumin were quantified.
