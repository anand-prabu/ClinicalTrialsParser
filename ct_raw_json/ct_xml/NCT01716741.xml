  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Partners HealthCare maintains a Patient Data Registry (PDR) with information from all
      patient encounters at Partners HealthCare facilities. We intend to utilize the PDR to
      identify groups of patient who are of high clinical suspicion for undiagnosed Gaucher
      disease. A group of potential participants will be identified through the PDR.  Detailed
      records will be requested to further narrow to ideal participants based upon previously
      existing diagnoses and symptoms.  Participants will be invited to partake in the study via a
      letter from their Partners care provider with supporting study details.  Study participants
      will be evaluated in a one-time visit. A complete family and medical history will be
      collected.  A physical exam will be performed, and up to 20cc of blood will be drawn. All
      participants will be notified of their disease status via letter and phone call from the
      study staff.  If the study participant is diagnosed with GD through this evaluation, proper
      follow-up recommendations and referrals will be provided. Our intent is to determine if
      existing patient data can successfully be utilized to aid in the identification of patients
      with rare genetic disease.
