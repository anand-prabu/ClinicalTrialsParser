Patients with stable\n      or responding disease may receive additional doses in the absence of disease progression or\n      unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of doxorubicin until the maximum tolerated\n      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2\n      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed at 3 weeks and 3 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 33 patients will be accrued for this study within 18-24\n      months."
