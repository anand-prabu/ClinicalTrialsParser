The subject has a body mass index (BMI) range of 18.5 to 25.0 kg/m2, inclusive, and\n             weighs at least 50 kg.\n\n          3. The subject provided written, informed consent prior to any clinical study-specific\n             procedures.\n\n          4. Male subject and his female spouse/partner who is of childbearing potential must be\n             using highly effective barrier method of contraception starting at screening and\n             continue throughout the clinical study period and for 3 months after final study drug\n             administration.\n\n          5. Male subject must not donate sperm starting at screening and throughout the clinical\n             study period and for 3 months after final study drug administration.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          1. Any clinically significant history of allergic conditions\n\n          2. Any history or evidence of any clinically significant disease or as judged by the\n             Investigator.\n\n          3. Any clinically significant abnormality after the Investigator's review of the\n             physical examination, ECG and clinical study protocol-defined clinical laboratory\n             tests at screening or admission to the clinical unit.\n\n          4. A mean pulse of <45 or >90 beats per minute (bpm) and mean systolic blood pressure\n             (SBP) >140 mmHg; mean diastolic blood pressure (DBP) >90 mmHg\n\n          5. A mean QTcB interval >450 ms at screening.  If the mean QTcB exceeds the limits\n             above, one additional triplicate ECG may be taken.  If this triplicate also gives an\n             abnormal result, the subject should be excluded.\n\n          6. Use of any prescribed or non-prescribed drugs in the 2 weeks prior to study drug\n             administration, except for the occasional use of paracetamol (up to 2 g/day).\n\n          7. Consumption of grapefruit, pomelo, citrus fruits, starfruit, pomegranate, papaya,\n             mango, rambutan, kiwi fruit, dragon fruit or passion fruit and products containing\n             these fruits in the 2 weeks prior to study drug administration.\n\n          8. Excessive use of caffeine-containing beverages exceeding 500 mg caffeine/day (5 cups\n             of coffee) and the inability to refrain from the use of caffeine-containing beverages\n             during confinement in the clinical unit.\n\n          9. Current smokers and history of smoking within 3 months prior to screening.\n\n         10.

Any use of drugs-of-abuse within 3 months prior to the first admission to the\n             clinical unit.\n\n         12. Any significant blood loss, donated one unit (450 mL) of blood or more, or received a\n             transfusion of any blood or blood products within 60 days, or donated plasma within 7\n             days prior to the first admission to the clinical unit.\n\n         13. Positive serology test for hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis A virus antibodies\n             (immunoglobulin M), hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibodies or human immunodeficiency\n             virus (HIV) 1 and/or 2 antibodies.\n\n         14. Participation in any clinical study within 3 months prior to the expected date of\n             enrolment into the clinical study, provided that the clinical study did not entail a\n             biological compound with a longer t\u00bd or participation in more than 3 clinical studies\n             within 12 months.\n\n         15. The subject has any other condition, which in the opinion of the Investigator\n             precludes the subject's participation in the clinical study.\n\n         16. Employee of the Sponsor or the site.\n\n         17. Vulnerable subjects, e.g. subjects kept in detention.\n\n         18. Veins unsuitable for repeat venipuncture.\n\n         19. Are unlikely to comply with the protocol requirements, instructions and study related\n             restrictions; e.g. uncooperative attitude, inability to return for follow-up visits\n             and improbability of completing the clinical study."
