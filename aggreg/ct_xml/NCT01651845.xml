  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have recently developed an innovative optical molecular imaging platform
      (called PRODIGI(TM)) based on high-resolution fluorescence and white-light technologies in a
      hand-held, real-time, high-resolution, non-invasive format. PRODIGI(TM) offers a non-contact
      means of obtaining instantaneous image-based measurements of diagnostically-relevant
      biological and molecular information of a wound and surrounding skin tissues for the first
      time and could have significant impact on improving conventional wound care, management, and
      guidance of intervention.  In preliminary preclinical testing, the investigators have
      discovered that when wounds are illuminated by violet/blue light, endogenous collagen in the
      connective tissue matrix emit a characteristic green fluorescent signal, while most
      pathogenic bacterial species emit a unique red fluorescence signal due to the production of
      endogenous porphyrins. Therefore, with autofluorescence imaging, no exogenous contrast
      agents are needed during imaging, making this approach particularly appealing as a
      diagnostic imaging method for clinical use.

      Based on extensive preclinical studies in our labs, PRODIGI(TM) has demonstrated its
      capability at collecting autofluorescence images of wounds and detecting the presence and
      relative changes in connective tissue (e.g. collagen) content and bio-distribution involved
      in wound healing. It can also detect the presence and relative amounts of commensal and
      pathogenic bacteria within the wound based on autofluorescence alone (these bacteria are
      invisible to standard visualization with the naked eye using white light), thus providing a
      measure of infection status. This could significantly impact clinical wound care and
      management by i) reducing the complications associated with missed detection of bacterial
      infection under conventional practice, ii) facilitating image-guided wound sampling by
      targeted swabbing/biopsy and iii) monitoring wound healing and treatment response over time.

      Previous Related Studies: A pilot-level clinical study (UHN REB protocol # 09-0015-A, PI:
      DaCosta, 50 patients imaged to date) performed by our group from 2008-2011 to assess the
      clinical utility of the device successfully demonstrated that tissue autofluorescence
      produced by endogenous collagen/elastin in the skin appears green in the fluorescent images,
      while most clinically-relevant bacterial colonies present in the wound produce a red
      fluorescence signal caused by endogenous porphyrins. Some bacterial species (e.g.
      pseudomonas aeruginosa) produce a green fluorescence signal that can be differentiated
      spectrally and texturally from the fluorescence of the dermis (another hue of green,
      discernable by our proprietary image analysis software). The PRODIGI(TM) device is sensitive
      enough to detect these green and red fluorescence signals from tissue and bacteria
      confirming the utility of this compact and portable imaging platform for clinical wound
      care.

      The investigators hypothesize that real-time imaging of tissue autofluorescence signals
      emanating from endogenous connective tissue (e.g. collagen) and pathogenic bacteria within
      complex wounds can be used to determine healing status (i.e., collagen re-modeling and wound
      closure), detect wound bacterial contamination and/or infection that is occult under
      standard clinical white light evaluation, and guide intervention during wound care.

        The study will be conducted at the Judy Dan Research and Treatment Centre in Toronto.
        Patients of the JDRTC typically present with diabetic foot ulcers.  Eighty new patients
        with wounds will be entered into this trial, based on statistical power-based calculations
        for sample size determined in collaboration with the UHN Biostatistics Group (assuming one
        wound per patient).
