  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to test if brentuximab vedotin has an effect on cancer in
      patients with a certain type of large B-cell lymphoma.  The side effects (unwanted effects)
      of SGN-35 in patients with this certain type of large B-cell lymphoma will also be studied.
      It is not known if brentuximab vedotin is better or worse than other treatment patients
      might be given.

    <description>To evaluate the activity of Brentuximab vedotin in patients with relapsed/refractory Peripheral T cell Lymphoma (PTCL) expressing CD30 receptor. The ORR [complete response (CR)+ partial response (PR)] will be used as the primary endpoint to assess efficacy.The primary efficacy parameter is objective response rate, defined as the proportion of patients with complete response (CR) and partial response (PR). Follow-up assessments after cycle 16 will be done every 12 weeks for up to 24 months. Restaging imaging computed tomography (CT) scans will be repeated 12 and 24 months from the beginning of the follow-up period. Objective disease response (CR and PR) will be defined according to the modified 2007 International Working Group (IWG) response criteria for non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL). CR = Disappearance of all evidence of disease; PR = Regression of measurable disease and no new sites.</description>
