  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial seeks to describe the effect of withdrawal from mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) on
      risk of clinically significant disease reactivation in quiescent SLE patients who have been
      on long-term MMF therapy.  Participants who have had inactive disease for at least 24 weeks
      will be enrolled. Half the subjects will continue on MMF and half the subjects will be
      tapered off their MMF within 12 weeks. All subjects will continue hydroxychloroquine and
      small doses of prednisone as needed. Subject visits to assess endpoints will occur every 4
      weeks from Day 0 through Week 24 and then at Weeks 32, 40, 48, and 60.

    <description>Subjects will be on concurrent anti-malarial agents (hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine). Hydroxychloroquine is approved by the FDA for the treatment of SLE. Hydroxychloroquine has been shown to help prevent flare in SLE, and to improve skin and musculoskeletal activity in particular [7, 8]. Even lupus nephritis outcomes appear improved on a background of hydroxychloroquine therapy</description>

    <description>Once the subject is randomized into the trial, the prednisone (or other corticosteroid) dose must be stable through Week 36 (24 weeks following protocol taper of MMF), in the absence of flares as described in Section 3.2, Description of Primary Endpoint. Further taper of prednisone after that point is by the investigator's discretion based on the subject's clinical status.</description>
