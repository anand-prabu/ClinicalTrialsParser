    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine safety and effectiveness, as measured by changes
      in pain, disability, patient satisfaction, and claudicatory symptoms, at 6 months following
      treatment with the Totalis™ Direct Decompression System or Sham Surgery in patients with
      lumbar spinal stenosis
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects suffering from symptoms of neurogenic intermittent claudication secondary to a
      radiographically-confirmed diagnosis of central canal stenosis, with or without mild or
      moderate lateral recess stenosis, at one or two levels from L1 to L5 who meet all
      inclusion/exclusion criteria, including ≥6 months of non-operative management.

      Patients included in the clinical investigation will return for follow-up visits at 1 week
      for safety evaluation, and at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, 18 months and 24
      months post-treatment to collect data for evaluation of safety and effectiveness.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female subjects 55 to 85 years of age

          -  Neurogenic intermittent claudication (NIC) symptoms defined generally as leg/buttock/
             groin pain and/or paresthesias that are exacerbated with standing and walking and
             relieved by flexion

          -  VAS leg symptom severity &gt;50 (in either leg) during episodes of neurogenic
             claudication

          -  Subjects who are able to walk a minimum of 50 feet without experiencing NIC symptoms

          -  Diagnosis of central canal spinal stenosis, with or without mild to moderate lateral
             recess stenosis, at one or two levels from L1-L5 with radiologic evidence

          -  Subjects with persistent lumbar spinal stenosis symptoms that, during the course of
             the last year, have been unresponsive to a minimum of 6 months of conservative
             therapy

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Lumbar spinal stenosis at more than two levels determined pre-operatively to require
             surgical intervention

          -  Prior decompressive surgery at index level (s) or fusion at any lumbar level

          -  Epidural steroid or nerve block steroid injection at index level(s) within 6 weeks of
             baseline assessments

          -  Spondylolisthesis (anterolisthesis or retrolisthesis) greater than grade 1
