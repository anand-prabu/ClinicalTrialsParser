Specifically, we want to measure, by way of\n      fat and muscle biopsies, the quantitative postprandial storage of VLDL-TG FA's in skeletal\n      muscle and adipose tissue in relation to a series of tissue specific proteins and enzymes\n      that might be involved in regulating skeletal muscle and adipose tissue FA storage."
