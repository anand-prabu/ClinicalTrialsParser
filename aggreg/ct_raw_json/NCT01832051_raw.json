            "textblock": "Information about the presence of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) in tumor\n      lesions in breast cancer patients is essential for diagnostic and therapeutic management of\n      metastatic breast cancer. In daily practice however, obtaining a metastasis biopsy can be\n      difficult or impracticable. Therefore, clinicians can be faced with a persistent clinical\n      dilemma in some breast cancer patients, leading to suboptimal therapy decisions due to lack\n      of HER2 receptor information. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs), which may provide additional\n      information, have so far not been able to replace the biopsy. To solve this problem,\n      non-invasive whole body visualization and quantification of HER2 expression by means of the\n      HER2-PET may be a valuable tool.\n\n      In this prospective multicenter imaging study, eligible patients will receive one HER2-PET\n      and CTC analysis in addition to standard work up for metastatic disease. Subsequent\n      administration of anti-HER2 therapy will be evaluated. Referring physicians fill in three\n      questionnaires, one before HER2-PET and two after HER2-PET."
