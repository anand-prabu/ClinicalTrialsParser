  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a frequently occurring and often debilitating
      anxiety disorder resulting from exposure to trauma. Trauma-focused cognitive-behavioural
      therapies, such as Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR), are generally
      considered to be evidence-based treatments for PTSD. Although a majority of patients achieve
      improvement, a substantial minority either drop out of treatment, present with residual
      symptoms following treatment or fail to make any improvement. Furthermore, a substantial
      portion of the clinical trials on PTSD is characterised by major methodological limitations.
      In addition, there's a pressing need for research on mediators of treatment outcome. Taken
      together, these results highlight the need for methodological rigorous and stringent
      clinical trials comparing treatment modalities for PTSD. The first aim of this study is to
      investigate whether a treatment not based on the principles of exposure, i.e. metacognitive
      therapy (MCT) is as efficient as exposure-based treatments. The second aim to elucidate
      potential mediators of treatments effects by incorporating process-related variables.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      EMDR is based on the assumption that posttraumatic symptoms are due to the traumatic
      experience(s) being stored in an unprocessed way disconnected from existing memory networks.
      The procedure in EMDR is postulated to facilitate the processing of the traumatic memory
      into existing memory networks. There is currently no empirical knowledge as to the
      therapeutic mechanisms of EMDR, but the protocol overlaps with core components of cognitive
      behavior therapy (CBT), such as imaginal exposure and cognitive restructuring of negative
      trauma-related cognitions. Thus, EMDR could be viewed as a form of CBT, although its
      originator maintains that it is a distinct treatment. EMDR is usually considered an
      evidence-based treatment of PTSD.

      MCT is one of the new approaches in the treatment of PTSD. The metacognitive model posits
      that adaptation following exposure to trauma depends on metacognitive beliefs that guide how
      the individual interprets and responds to posttraumatic symptoms and can lead to styles of
      thinking that facilitate or impede emotional processing. MCT focuses on &quot;unlocking&quot; or
      removing the barriers to natural adaptation. This equips the client with general skills and
      therefore protects the individual from the risk of any future re-traumatisation. In contrast
      to EMDR, MCT does not involve proscribed exposure exercises or restructuring of negative
      trauma-related cognitions.
