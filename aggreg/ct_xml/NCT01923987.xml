  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Radical treatment of primary rectal cancer with synchronous distant metastases includes
      surgical resection of primary and metastatic lesion. However, primary rectal cancer in case
      of metastasized disease are often locally advanced disease and need downsizing before
      surgery. It is reported that pelvic recurrence rates and distant metastasis rates outside
      liver are 30~35% and 60%, respectively. Therefore, combined treatment with radiotherapy and
      chemotherapy is used. However, the sequence of treatment modalities is not yet definitely
      established and preoperative chemoradiotherapy and surgical resection is accepted as an
      option of treatment. Conventional long course chemoradiotherapy delays administration of
      full-dose chemotherapy, and metastatic lesion can be progressed during chemoradiotherapy. In
      present study, we evaluate the efficacy of short course radiotherapy (SCRT) followed by
      full-dose chemotherapy with delayed surgical resection of the primary tumor and metastases.

- Radiotherapy to tumor and draining lymph node with 25 Gy in 5 fractions within 5 working days
Chemotherapy
Modified FOLFOX6, comprising Oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2 IV over 2 hours on Day 1, Leucovorin 400 mg/m2 IV over 2 hours on Day 1, and 5-fluorouracil bolus+400 mg/m2 IV push on Day 1 (or 5-fluorouracil infusion 2400 mg/m2 IV continuous infusion over 46~48 hours). Treatment repeats every 14 days for up to 3 courses.
Patients who have surgical resection of primary tumor and metastases were treated with postoperative modified FOLFOX6 for up to 9 cycles (total 12 cycles)
Surgery - If primary tumor and metastases is resectable after modified FOLFOX6 of 3 cycles, patients have surgical resection (and/or radiofrequency ablation to metastases).</description>
