A high-resolution 3D map of the lung spaces filled with HXe gas will be acquired during a short breath-hold. Additionally, proton MRI of the chest cavity will be recorded during the same breath-hold for registering the lung boundaries. All subjects will undergo Pulmonary Function Tests. Subjects suffering from obstructive lung disease will have Tc-99m DTPA lung scintigraphy performed for comparing with HXe images."

            "textblock": "HXe MRI provides a diversity of imaging techniques for interrogating  pulmonary function and\n      lung microstructure. The most mature of these techniques utilizes HXe spin-density MRI to\n      depict regional lung ventilation. Prior work suggests that ventilation imaging has utility\n      in all obstructive lung diseases. This is a Phase II clinical trial to assess HXe MRI\n      capability of providing qualitative and quantitative clinical information regarding lung\n      ventilation. Proton and xenon images will be acquired within single breath holds on 28\n      subjects per year, including healthy volunteers and patients with COPD and asthma. All\n      studies will include repeat scans and Pulmonary Function Tests (PFT). Ventilation scans with\n      Technetium-99m (Tc-99m) diethylene-triamine-pentaacetate (DTPA) aerosol scintigraphy will be\n      acquired on lung patients.\n\n      The primary goal of this aim is to validate the effectiveness of HXe  ventilation MRI for\n      delineating regions of normal and abnormal lung ventilation. To validate the regional\n      depiction of ventilation, HXe MRI ventilation will be compared with nuclear medicine Tc-99m\n      DTPA ventilation scintigraphy. The comparatively low spatial and temporal resolution of\n      ventilation scintigraphy will limit this study to demonstrating only that HXe MRI\n      ventilation is not inferior to the current clinical standard. Additionally, the concordance\n      between measurements of the whole lung volume from both proton MRI and HXe MRI with PFT, the\n      current clinical standard for lung volume measurement, will be assessed as a secondary\n      outcome of the study."
