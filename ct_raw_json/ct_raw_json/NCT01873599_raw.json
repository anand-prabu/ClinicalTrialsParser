Patients randomized to use the online\n      intervention will be asked to journal about one of seven topics, several days each week, for\n      three months. The topics (e.g., \"What went well\") are designed to help the individual focus\n      on some positive aspect of their life or themselves over the past day. Each topic is based\n      on prompts shown to be effective in studies of up to one week in duration. In the summer of\n      2012, our research team pilot tested each prompt with 20 patients with high levels of\n      anxiety, which led to important changes to the prompts, to increase their potential impact.\n      The main aim is to understand the impact of Positive Affect Journaling on psychological\n      distress, as measured by the National Health Interview Survey."
