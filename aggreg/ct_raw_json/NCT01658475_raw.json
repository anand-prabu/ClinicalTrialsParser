Therefore, efficient screening of patients is\n      essential for general health. This study was performed to evaluate prospectively the\n      diagnostic utility of a blood IgG antibody titer test against periodontal pathogens.\n\n      Methods: Oral examination was performed and blood IgG antibody titers against periodontal\n      pathogens were measured by ELISA, in 1387 subjects. The cut-off value of IgG titer was\n      determined in receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, and changes in periodontal\n      clinical parameters and IgG titers by periodontal treatment were evaluated. The\n      relationships between IgG titers and severity of periodontitis were analyzed."
