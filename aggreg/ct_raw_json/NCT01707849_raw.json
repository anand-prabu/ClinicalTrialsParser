Since treatment after LT has a low efficacy, the overall survival of\n      HCV-infected LT recipients is shorter than that of uninfected LT patients.\n\n      New immunosuppressive agents such as mTOR inhibitors (Everolimus/Sirolimus) reduce the risk\n      of liver graft rejection, have antifibrotic properties and do not worsen HCV recurrence.\n      Moreover new directly-acting antiviral agents have increased efficacy of interferon-based\n      treatment but their use in LT recipients may be limited by side effects.\n\n      Hypothesis:\n\n      Use of individualized immunosuppressive regimen and early personalized anti-viral treatment\n      based on recipient and viral factors would improve outcome of HCV infected liver transplant\n      recipients.\n\n      Objectives:\n\n        1. To evaluate safety and efficacy of two steroid-free immunosuppressive regimens to\n           reduce hepatitis C recurrence associated to fibrosis progression (F\u22652 under ISHAK\n           score) at one year post-transplant.\n\n        2. To identify viral and recipient factors associated with liver fibrosis progression\n           using ultra-deep pyrosequencing (UDPS)."

Serum samples will be taken immediately before\n           liver transplantation, in the anhepatic phase, at the beginning and at the end of the\n           reperfusion, and at 1h, 4h, 8h, 12h, 18h, 1d, 3d, 7d, 14d, 28d, 2m, 3m, 6m, 9m and 12m.\n           Blood samples will be taken from the peripheral circulation and centrifugated within 2\n           to 3 hours after extraction, aliquoted, and frozen at -80 \u00baC.
