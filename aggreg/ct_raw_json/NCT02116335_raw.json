However, the pressor response is suppressed by\n      ETA/B receptor antagonism. Moreover, the investigators have identified that the increase in\n      8-isoprostane occurs downstream of ET receptor activation. These data indicate that ET\n      receptor acfivafion is a main player In the pressor response to acute stress in\n      pre-hypertensive animals; however, this phenomenon has yet to be elucidated in humans."
