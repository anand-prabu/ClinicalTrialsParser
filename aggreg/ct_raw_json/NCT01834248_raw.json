            "textblock": "This phase I trial studies the side effects and immune response to DEC-205/NY-ESO-1 fusion\n      protein CDX-1401 and decitabine in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid\n      leukemia. DEC-205-NY-ESO-1 fusion protein, called CDX-1401, is a full length NY-ESO-1\n      protein sequence fused to a monoclonal antibody against DEC-205, a surface marker present on\n      many immune stimulatory cells. This drug is given with another substance called PolyICLC,\n      which acts to provoke any immune stimulatory cells which encounter the NY-ESO-1-DEC-205\n      fusion protein to produce an immune response signal against NY-ESO-1. Immune cells which\n      have thus been primed to react against NY-ESO-1 may then attack myelodysplastic or leukemic\n      cells which express NY-ESO-1 after exposure to the drug decitabine. The chemotherapy drug\n      decitabine is thought to act in several different ways, first, it may directly kill cancer\n      cells, secondly, the drug can cause cancer cells to re-express genes that are turned off by\n      the cancer, including the gene for NY-ESO-1. Giving DEC-205/NY-ESO-1 fusion protein\n      (CDX-1401) and polyICLC together with decitabine may allow the immune system to more\n      effectively recognize cancer cells and kill them."

To evaluate NY-ESO-1 specific cellular and humoral immunity by determination of NY-ESO-1\n      specific antibody, and T-cell clones following standard treatment with\n      5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (decitabine) in conjunction with immune sensitization with Anti-DEC\n      205-NY-ESO-I fusion protein (CDX-1401).\n\n      II. To determine the impact of decitabine treatment on peripheral blood cells from patients\n      treated in this manner on NY-ESO-1 target gene expression, NY-ESO protein expression,\n      NY-ESO-1 promoter methylation, and global deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation.\n\n      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. To record the response rate (complete response, partial response and hematological\n      improvement) in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or low blast count acute myeloid leukemia\n      (AML) patients treated with the combination in order to provide descriptive characteristics.\n\n      OUTLINE:\n\n      Patients receive DEC-205/NY-ESO-1 fusion protein CDX-1401 subcutaneously (SC) and\n      intradermally (ID) and poly-ICLC subcutaneously (SC) on day -14 and day 15 of courses 1-4.\n      Patients also receive decitabine intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 1-5. Treatment\n      repeats every 28 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or\n      unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30, 60, 90, and 180 days."
