During the visits, the patient will be taught deep breathing and will be instructed to practice it 10 times every hour. They are also shown shoulder movements and lung expansion exercises. They will receive a sheet summarizing the exercises for future reference. The patient is discharged from physiotherapy when they are ambulatory, on room air, and able to clear their respiratory secretions independently, although they will be asked to continue the exercises on their own until 30 days from surgery."

After lung surgery to remove tumours,\n      there is a particularly high chance of a person developing an infection or needing help\n      breathing, called post operative pulmonary complications. Currently, the risk of these\n      complications is reduced through the completion of light physical and deep breathing\n      exercises and walking around as soon as possible after surgery. Another possible way of\n      helping these patients is to use a small device called an Incentive Spirometer to encourage\n      and measure deep breathing. This study wants to compare how often postoperative pulmonary\n      complications happen after major lung surgery between a group completing the exercises alone\n      and a group using the Incentive spirometer in addition to the exercises. It is hoped that\n      the combined therapy will reduce the amount of time patient must stay in hospital, have\n      fewer complication events and have fewer patients re-admitted back into the hospital after\n      they go home, so that patients overall have better outcomes."
