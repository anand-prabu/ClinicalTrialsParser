            "textblock": "Restenosis rates after plain-old balloon angioplasty (POBA) are with 30-50 % very high.\n      Therefore, this interventional concept is of limited use today. However, dual antiplatelet\n      therapy (DAPT) is not necessary after POBA. Contrary, 3rd generation drug-eluting stents\n      (DES) proved to be very effective showing delayed restenosis only in 5-15%, but require DAPT\n      for at least 6 months. Drug-eluting balloons (DEB) might be a promising trade-off between\n      POBA and DES, since they effectively inhibit neointimal proliferation despite minimal\n      duration of DAPT. However, there is still very limited data on this interventional strategy.\n      Thus, we aimed to investigate feasibility  of fractional flow reserve (FFR) - guided use of\n      paclitaxel-eluting balloons (Sequent Please\u2122, B Braun) with provisional bare metal stenting\n      for elective PCI of de novo coronary lesions, evaluating the 6-month outcomes by angiography\n      and optical coherence tomography (OCT)."
