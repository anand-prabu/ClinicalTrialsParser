    <textblock>
      This is an open-label phase III study with a 12-week wash-in/wash-out period followed by a
      12-month efficacy period. The main goals of the study are to assess the efficacy of octanorm
      in preventing serious bacterial infections (SBI) compared with historical control data and
      to evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) characteristics of octanorm.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age of at least 2 years up to and including 75 years.

          2. Confirmed diagnosis of PI as stated by the WHO and requiring immunoglobulin
             replacement therapy due to hypogammaglobulinaemia or agammaglobulinaemia. The exact
             type of PI should be recorded.

          3. Patients on regular octagam 5 percent or 10 percent treatment for at least 6
             infusions prior to entering the study at a constant dose between 300 and 800 mg/kg
             body weight (20 percent of the mean dose for the last 6 infusions).

          4. Availability of the IgG trough levels of 2 previous octagam 5 percent or 10percent
             infusions before enrolment, and maintenance of greater than or equal to 5.0 g/L in
             the trough levels of these 2 previous infusions.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Acute infection requiring intravenous antibiotic treatment within 2 weeks prior to
             and during the screening period.

          2. Known history of adverse reactions to IgA in other products.

          3. Patients with body mass index ³30 kg/m2.

          4. Exposure to blood or any blood product or plasma derivatives, other than octagam

          5. Ongoing history of hypersensitivity or persistent reactions to blood or plasma
             derived products, or any component of the investigational product.

          6. Requirement of any routine premedication for IgG administration.

          7. History of malignancies of lymphoid cells and immunodeficiency with lymphoma.

          8. Severe liver function impairment (ALAT 3 times above upper limit of normal).

          9. Known protein-losing enteropathies or proteinuria.

         10. Presence of renal function impairment (creatinine greater than 120 uM), or
             predisposition for acute renal failure (e.g., any degree of pre-existing renal
             insufficiency or routine treatment with known nephritic drugs).

         11. Treatment with oral or parenteral steroids for equal to 30 days or when given
             intermittently or as bolus at daily doses equal to 0.15 mg/kg.

         12. Treatment with immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory drugs.

         13. Live viral vaccination (such as measles, rubella, mumps and varicella) within the
             last 2 months prior to first infusion of octanorm.

         14. Treatment with any investigational medicinal product within 3 months prior to first
             infusion of octanorm.

         15. Presence of any condition, that is likely to interfere with the evaluation of study
             medication or satisfactory conduct of the trial.

         16. Known or suspected to abuse alcohol, drugs, psychotropic agents or other chemicals
             within the past 12 months prior to first infusion of octanorm.

         17. Known or suspected HIV, HCV, or HBV infection.
