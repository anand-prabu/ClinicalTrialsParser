It is in the form of gel or\n      sustained release device whose effectiveness and side effects are comparable. The vaginal\n      misoprostol has no marketing authorization in France, but is sometimes used. Some data in\n      the scientific literature have showed  that its use with low-dose (25 mcg) vaginally did not\n      lead to more complications, was at least as effective and seems to be cost-effective\n      compared with dinoprostone. Misoprostol with this dose and route of administration is now\n      recommended by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologist (ACOG), Grade A (ACOG\n      Practice Bulletin August 2009). This is not the case in France (French HAS  2008 Guidelines\n      on induction of labor). According to HAS, the investigators still lack data on large samples\n      to confirm the benefits of misoprostol 25 mcg vaginally, in terms of efficiency, rate of\n      cesarean section, and lower cost compared to dinoprostone."
