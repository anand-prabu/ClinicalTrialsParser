To compare echocardiography-based PTTs and cardiac MRI-based PTTs obtained using a\n           'peak-to-peak' method\n\n        2. To further quantify the relationship between echocardiographically-derived PTT, using\n           Optison, and existing echocardiographic methods used to determine ventricular function\n\n        3. To measure the reproducibility of echocardiographically-based PTT using Optison."
