    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to examine the flow characteristics of deep venous
      flow in the leg veins using Doppler ultrasound imaging and how this flow is modified by the
      application of a plaster and with a geko™ device in healthy volunteers

          6. Has not used any medications (prescribed or over-the-counter including herbal
             remedies) judged to be significant by the Principal Investigator during the thirty
             (30) days preceding the study, and agrees not to use any medications during the
             course of the study without informing the Research Team.

          7. Able to understand the Volunteer Information Sheet and signed the written Informed
             Consent Forms.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Previous leg fracture. (within the last 12 months)

          2. Any evidence of organ dysfunction, or any clinically significant deviation from
             normal in the physical determinations.

          3. History or signs of haematological disorders (especially in relation to clotting or
             coagulation or previous Deep or superficial vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism) or
             familiar history of such.

          4. Peripheral arterial disease (ABPI&lt;0.9), clinically significant varicose veins or

             osteoarthritis).

          6. Neurological disorders,(such as stroke, multiple sclerosis)

          7. Recent surgery (such as abdominal, gynaecological, hip knee replacement).

          8. Recent trauma to lower limbs.

          9. Chronic Obesity (BMI Index &gt;34).

             diabetes), psychiatric, haematological (especially in relation to clotting or
             coagulation), or systemic disease judged to be significant.

         14. A pulse rate of less than 50 beats/minute, a sitting systolic blood pressure &gt;160 or
             &lt;80 mmHg and/or a sitting diastolic pressure of &gt;90 or &lt;60 mmHg.

         15. Any significant illness during the four (4) weeks preceding the screening period of
             the study.

         16. Any contraindication to blood sampling.

         17. Donation of blood during the eight (8) weeks preceding the screening period of the
             study or during the investigation.

         18. Participation in any clinical study during the 8 weeks preceding the dosing period of
             the study
