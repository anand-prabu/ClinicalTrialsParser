Treatment repeats every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable\n      toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed at 30 days and then every 3 months thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 26-54 patients (13-27 per stratum) will be accrued for this\n      study."

Mediastinal or hilar lymph nodes assessed by CT or MRI scans must be at\n             least 2 cm in the largest dimension to be considered measurable.\n\n          -  Prior limited radiation therapy is permitted.  Prior radiotherapy must not have\n             included major bone marrow containing areas (pelvis, lumbar spine), or contained the\n             single evaluable lesion in a radiation field. A recovery period of at least 4 weeks\n             after completion of radiotherapy is required prior to study treatment.\n\n          -  Patients must have an anticipated life expectancy of at least 12 weeks.\n\n          -  Patients must have a performance status of 0 or 1 on the ECOG performance scale.\n\n          -  Patients must be > 18 years old.\n\n          -  Patients must give written informed consent prior to enrollment.\n\n          -  Patients should have adequate organ function defined as follows: Absolute\n             granulocytes > 1,500/mm3 and platelets > 100,000/mm3; serum bilirubin < 1.5 mg/dL and\n             SGOT < 3X upper limit of institutional norm; and serum creatinine < 1.5 mg/dL.\n\n          -  Patients must have recovered from recent surgery.  One week must have elapsed from\n             the time of a minor surgery and 3 weeks from major surgery.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria\n\n          -  Patients who have received more than one prior chemotherapy regimen or  immunotherapy\n             for metastatic disease.  Prior 5-FU alone as an adjuvant therapy or radiosensitizer\n             is not counted.  Patients must have an interval of 4 weeks from prior chemotherapy or\n             immunotherapy with full recovery.\n\n          -  Patients receiving concurrent chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or radiotherapy.\n\n          -  Patients who are potentially curable with a chemotherapy, radiotherapy, surgery, or\n             any combination of the above.\n\n          -  Patients with known brain metastases.\n\n          -  Patients with a history of seizures or are receiving phenytoin, phenobarbital, or\n             other antiepileptic prophylaxis.\n\n          -  Pregnant or lactating women.

Patients with previous malignancies but without\n             evidence of disease for > 5 years will be allowed to enter the trial.\n\n          -  Patients with known Gilbert's syndrome.\n\n          -  Patients who have a significant clinical neuropathy of greater than grade 2.\n\n          -  Patients with unstable angina, a history of myocardial infarction within the previous\n             6 months, or current clinical evidence of congestive heart failure.
