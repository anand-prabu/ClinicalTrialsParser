  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether an intervention (CARE+ Corrections)
      delivered to HIV-infected detainees within the DC Department of Corrections (DOC) and
      recently -released ex-detainees in the community can improve linkage to community HIV care
      and adherence to HIV medications after release, and ultimately achieve or maintain HIV viral
      suppression following community re-entry.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The intervention is modeled after CARE, a technology based HIV-counseling tool used in other
      settings. The investigators have adapted CARE to create CARE+ Corrections, a tool designed
      specifically for incarcerated and recently-released populations. New and innovative
      information communication tools (ICT), including a cell phone/text messaging component
      delivered in the community after release from jail, will be included in the intervention.

      The study is a randomized controlled trial. One half of the participants will receive the
      intervention either inside the jail, in addition to standard discharge planning services, or
      in the community right after release. The other half of the participants will view an
      educational video related to the prevention of drug overdose following release, in addition
      to standard discharge planning services, or in the community right after release. The
      investigators will follow all participants for 6 months post release/study enrollment and
      determine if the linkage to community care and adherence to HIV medications was higher in
      the intervention arm.

    <description>Participants in the Control Arm will receive standard discharge services according to the standards of care for that facility. In addition, participants in this arm will view an educational video on opiate overdose prevention. Study participants in the Control Arm will be followed after release/study enrollment, just like participants in the Intervention Arm, and Plasma Viral Loads will be collected from them at baseline and follow-up.</description>

    <description>The Intervention Arm will complete the CARE tool device, a technology based HIV-counseling tool, and will receive text message reminders about HIV medical appointments and the importance of taking HIV medications. Study participants in this arm will be followed after release/study enrollment, just like participants in the Control Arm, and Plasma Viral Loads will be collected from them at baseline and follow-up.</description>

    <description>Study participants in the intervention arm will complete the computer-based CARE+ Corrections tool at baseline. The CARE tool provides tailored feedback based on the participants' responses to a series of questions included in the counseling session. Participants in this arm of the study recruited inside the DC DOC will receive typical discharge planning services as conducted by the correctional facility. Participants will be followed for six months after release/study enrollment. At the post-release baseline visit, participants in the intervention arm will receive a cell phone/SMS text messaging intervention consisting of using cell phone-delivered SMS text messages with the intent of improving linkage to community HIV care and adherence to ART (if prescribed.)</description>
