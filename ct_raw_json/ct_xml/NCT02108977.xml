  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Genetic counseling has benefits for individuals and their family members in their health
      care decision-making.  Provision of genetic counseling has been deemed standard of care by
      several medical organizations and incorporated into clinical guidelines, such as those of
      the US Preventive Services Task Force.  To better comply with these guidelines, Genomic
      Medicine Service (GMS) recently established at the Salt Lake City, Utah VA medical center to
      provide genomic services and counseling as a part of VA Patient Care Services.  For Veterans
      for whom in-person genetic counseling in not feasible, GMS conducts counseling either via
      telephone or videoconferencing.  Although both of these methods can be effective for
      delivering genetic counseling, each has its relative advantages and disadvantages.  The
      specific aim of this study is to gain a better understanding of the advantages and
      disadvantages of these two modalities.  This information will be useful not only for genetic
      counseling but also other interventions that use telephone or videoconferencing to access
      patients.

      Objectives: This is a Type 1 hybrid  pre-implementation study whose specific aims are to: 1)
      Compare retention of genetic counseling information provided to patients via telephone
      versus videoconferencing; 2) Use validated surveys to quantitatively assess satisfaction
      with genetic counseling conducted via telephone versus videoconferencing; 3) Conduct
      interviews with patients to qualitatively assess positive and negative aspects of their
      experience, barriers, and facilitators with genetic counseling via telephone or
      videoconferencing; 4) Conduct interviews with the genetic counselors at Genomic Medicine
      Service (GMS) to qualitatively assess barriers and facilitators to conducting genetic
      counseling via telephone and videoconferencing; and 5) Conduct a cost analysis of the
      telephone and videoconferencing genetic counseling modalities.

      Methods: We will undertake a randomized controlled trial of Veterans that are willing to
      have genetic counseling conducted either via telephone or videoconferencing. Veterans with
      multiple polyps referred to GMS for genetic counseling will undergo a screening interview by
      telephone to obtain information about personal and family history and study inclusion and
      exclusion criteria eligibility. If criteria are met, they will be given information about
      the study and asked to provide informed consent. If consent is provided, baseline questions
      will be asked to collect demographic information and assess genetic knowledge. Randomization
      via random number generation will be used to assign subjects to either the telephone or
      videoconferencing arms. Lastly, a genetic counseling session will be scheduled for each
      patient.

      Within one week of receiving genetic counseling, participants will be called to assess
      knowledge retention, conduct the satisfaction surveys and numeracy, and to schedule the
      qualitative interview for the subset of patients (10-12 per study arm) who agree to
      participate. We will use the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research to develop
      and conduct qualitative interviews with the GMS staff.

      Based on power calculation, we will need a sample size of 56 subjects.  To achieve this
      sample size we will need to recruit approximately two to three subjects per week over a
      seven month period.  This requires a reasonable participation rate between 32-40% of
      polyposis patients referred to GMS for genetic counseling.

      Data analysis will begin with descriptive statistics to describe our study sample. To assess
      differences in knowledge retention and satisfaction between the telephone and
      videoconferencing groups, we will use Chi-square test for categorical variables and the
      Wilcoxon-rank sum test for discrete ordinal and continuous variables.  We will also conduct
      multivariable ordinary least squares regression to assess whether knowledge retention or
      satisfaction differs according to patient characteristics, numeracy, or genetic counselor.
      The qualitative interviews will be digital audio recorded and transcribed for analysis. We
      will use a directed approach to content analysis. Analysis will be conducted with Atlas.ti
      qualitative analysis software that facilitates management of coding and analysis of patterns
      across transcripts. Cost analysis of the two counseling options will be assessed by direct
      measurement of equipment and labor input costs as well as travel reimbursement by the VA.
      From the patient's perspective, the costs associated with traveling to a VA clinic site with
      videoconferencing equipment will also be considered.
