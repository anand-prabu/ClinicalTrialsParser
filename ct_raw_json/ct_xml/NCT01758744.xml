      An Open Label, Pilot Study Testing the Safety and Efficacy of Inhaled Treprostinil (Tyvaso速)
      in the Treatment of Pulmonary Hypertension (PH) Associated with Chronic Obstructive
      Pulmonary Disease (COPD)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study of 10 patients that have COPD-PH. Primary outcome measure is to see if
      this drug is safe for this patient population and the secondary measure is to see if the
      drug improves patient functional capacity.
