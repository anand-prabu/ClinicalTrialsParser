The device behaves in a similar fashion to existing conventional NPWT devices, i.e. transmission of negative pressure levels at the wound bed, tissue contraction and establishing a characteristic pattern of peri-wound blood flow and that it reduces and normalises tissue stresses at the incision"

The study examines the effect on wound healing using incisional Negative\n      Pressure Wound Therapy (iNPWT) compared with standard postoperative dressings in women with\n      a BMI >= 30, who has a Caesarean Section (CS). We expect to find a lower frequency of wound\n      complications when using iNPWT directly on primary suturing compared to standard\n      postoperative dressings in this high-risk subpopulation.\n\n      Women, who have given informed consent, will be randomised to either intervention or control\n      group via a computer-generated randomisation program. Elective and emergency CS will be\n      stratified to ensure roughly equal numbers in each category of CS in each arm of the study\n      and permit valid separate and pooled analysis. The analysis will be carried out on an\n      intention to treat basis.\n\n      The iNPWT or standard postoperative dressings will be applied in theatre immediately\n      following the operation. In the intervention group the therapy will be left in situ for five\n      days corresponding to the date of removal of stitches. In the control group the dressing\n      will be left in situ for at least 24 hours as standard procedure.  Women, who do not wish to\n      participate, will be asked for permission to use their data in the analysis."
