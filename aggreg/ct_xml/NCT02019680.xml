      Background:

      - Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States. Eating fruits and
      vegetables with chemicals called flavonoids may protect against heart disease and improve
      blood flow to the heart. They are found in blackcurrant berries. Oils found in fish and
      mussels called omega-3 fats have also been shown to protect the heart. Researchers want to
      know if blackcurrant extract and omega-3 fats can improve blood flow, which may increase
      blood to the heart. They also want to learn about the health of blood vessels and how the
      heart works.

      Objective:

      - To learn if blackcurrant extract and omega-3 fats will improve blood flow and make the
      heart beat stronger.

      Eligibility:

      - Healthy adults 55 to 75 years old.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with medical history, physical exam, and blood tests.

        -  Visit 1 will take 6   7 hours.

        -  Participants will have physical exam and blood and urine tests.

        -  A small device like a microphone will be placed on their arm to take pictures of blood
           vessels. A blood pressure cuff will be tightened on their arm and more pictures will be
           taken.

        -  Blood pressure cuffs will be placed on their arms and legs. They will be tightened at
           the same time and blood pressure will be measured.

        -  Participants will answer questions about their eating and exercise.

        -  Every 8 weeks, participants switch from taking blackcurrant and/or omega-3 tablets to a
           placebo to no tablets. &lt; TAB&gt;

        -  Every 8 weeks, they will have another shorter clinic visit that will repeat most of
           visit 1.

    <textblock>
      Numerous studies have shown the beneficial effects of fruits, vegetables and omega-3 fatty
      acids in reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease. The cardioprotective properties may be
      attributed to the bioactive compounds found in fruits and vegetables called flavonoids. High
      concentrations of flavonoids with antioxidant activity are found in blackcurrant extract.
      Flavonoids like omega-3 fatty acids may improve vascular function by increasing the
      bioavailability of nitric oxide, a potent vasodilator. PCSO-524 (Pernacanaliculus
      supercritical oil) is of particular interest as a rich source of omega-3 fatty acids derived
      from the green-lipped mussel. The objectives of this study are to determine the effects of
      blackcurrant extract, PCSO-524 or the combination of blackcurrant extract &amp;  PCSO-524 on
      endothelial function (flow-mediated brachial artery dilation) and arterial stiffness
      (cardioankle vascular index) as indicators of cardiovascular risk and atherosclerosis. These
      indices also provide an assessment of structure and function of the artery. The effects of
      the supplements on biomarkers of vascular health (endothelial dysfunction, inflammation,
      injury, oxidative stress, nitric oxide status), lipids and fatty acid profile, and flavonoid
      profiles will also be determined. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial,
      102 healthy older adults (ages 55-75) will be given either blackcurrant extract (1000 mg),
      PCSO-524 (400 mg), or blackcurrant extract (1000 mg) &amp;  PCSO-524 (400 mg) daily for 8 weeks
      while consuming their usual diet. The study will include 4 visits at 8 week intervals
      consisting of treatment, washout and placebo phases.
