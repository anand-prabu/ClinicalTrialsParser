  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to look at how a reduction in oxygen levels (hypoxia)
      influences insulin sensitivity and carbohydrate metabolism.  It is expected that 10 nights
      of exposure to moderate hypoxia (~ 15% O2, similar to conditions at an altitude of ~7500
      feet) will improve glucose metabolism.
