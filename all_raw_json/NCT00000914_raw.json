In this study,\n      the anti-HIV drug efavirenz (EFV) will be tested with 1 or 2 other protease inhibitors (PIs)\n      to see which combination works best to treat HIV infection. EFV has been shown to limit the\n      amount of HIV virus produced by infected cells."

It has been shown that a combination of 2 nucleoside\n      reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and a PI is the most effective barriers to disease\n      progression. This study attempts to demonstrate these data.\n\n      Two options are available for patients whose initial PI-containing regimen has failed to\n      suppress viral replication.\n\n      Option 1 consists of immediate versus deferred use of a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase\n      inhibitor (NNRTI). Patients who choose Option 1 are randomized to 1 of 2 groups:\n\n        1. Ritonavir (RTV) plus soft gelatin capsule saquinavir (SQV-SGC) plus efavirenz (EFV).\n\n        2. RTV plus SQV-SGC.\n\n      Option 2 consists of treatment with a single PI versus double PI. Patients who choose Option\n      2 are randomized to 1 of 2 groups:\n\n        1. Nelfinavir (NFV) plus EFV.\n\n        2. RTV plus SQV-SGC plus EFV.\n\n      Patients failing NFV in Option 2 are randomized to one of two groups:\n\n        1. Indinavir (IDV) plus EFV.\n\n        2. RTV plus SQV-SGC plus EFV. Patients remain on study treatment regimens for 8 weeks.\n           Follow-up visits, including history and physical evaluations, take place at specified\n           intervals during the next 12 months."
