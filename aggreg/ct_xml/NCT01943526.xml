      This is a non-interventional observational study of patients receiving natalizumab
      (TYSABRI®) in Ireland.  Time perspective of this study is both prospective and
      retrospective.

      The primary objective of this study is to assess the long-term safety (incidence and pattern
      of SAEs including infections and discontinuations) in patients receiving natalizumab
      (TYSABRI®) in a clinical practice setting.

      The secondary objectives are to assess the long-term disease activity and progression of
      patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) who are receiving natalizumab
      (TYSABRI®) in a clinical practice setting.

        Patients with Relapsing Remitting Multiple Sclerosis (RRMS) who are being treated with
        natalizumab (TYSABRI®) and patients who meet the criteria defined in the indication
        statement for prescription in Ireland. Existing patients will be enrolled retrospectively.
        New patients will be enrolled after the decision to treat with natalizumab (TYSABRI®) has
