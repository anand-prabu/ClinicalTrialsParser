Hypertrophic scarring is\n      considered an adverse wound healing event that results in abnormal scar formation. This\n      scarring process is associated with pruritis and discomfort and can interfere with function\n      and aesthetics. Topical creams, massage, stretching and pressure are used as standard\n      treatments of burn scar formation.  With the child serving as their own control, we want to\n      objectively measure the impact of PDL on burn scars in children.  Variables of timing of\n      application, duration and number of sessions will all be collected."
