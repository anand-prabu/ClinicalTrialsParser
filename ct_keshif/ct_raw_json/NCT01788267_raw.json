Recent data from our center and\n      others have suggested that low BMD could be observed very early in life. However,\n      quantitative bone abnormalities found out by Dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) need to be\n      confronted to qualitative evaluation of bone microarchitecture (surrogate of bone strength).\n\n      High-Resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) is a recent technology\n      with very high spatial resolution. Images obtained with this technic are considered as\n      virtual bone biopsies. It enables an accurate bones' cortical and trabecular surfaces\n      exploration in a three-dimensional manner, and therefore provides informations on bone\n      microarchitecture as well as bone density.\n\n      The aim of this study is to evaluate bone microarchitecture of paediatric patients matched\n      to sex-age-pubertal status-healthy volunteers. In the meantime, biological markers will be\n      collected and DXA (Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry) will be performed in order to explore\n      potential correlations HR-pQCT parameters."
