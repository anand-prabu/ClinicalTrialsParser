Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor\n      cells. Combining more than one chemotherapy drug with radiation therapy may kill more tumor\n      cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy plus\n      radiation therapy in treating patients who have advanced mouth cancer."

            "textblock": "OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the feasibility of the administration of ethynyluracil concurrently\n      with fluorouracil and radiotherapy in patients with advanced oral cancer. II. Determine the\n      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicities of this regimen in this patient\n      population.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of fluorouracil and hydroxyurea. Patients receive\n      oral ethynyluracil every 12 hours on days 1-7 and oral fluorouracil every 12 hours on days\n      2-6. Radiotherapy to the head and neck is administered twice daily on days 2-6. Treatment\n      continues for 5-7 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients\n      receive escalating doses of fluorouracil until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is\n      determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 3 of 6 patients\n      experience dose limiting toxicities. Once the MTD of fluorouracil is determined, hydroxyurea\n      is added to the treatment regimen. Patients receive fluorouracil and ethynyluracil as per\n      the treatment schedule outlined above. Patients also receive oral hydroxyurea every 12 hours\n      for 11 doses on days 1-6. Radiotherapy is administered as above. Cohorts of 3-6 patients\n      receive escalating doses of hydroxyurea until the MTD is determined. Once the MTD of\n      fluorouracil and hydroxyurea are determined, an additional 10 patients receive Phase II\n      doses of ethynyluracil, fluorouracil and hydroxyurea as per the treatment schedule outlined\n      above. Treatment continues in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed at\n      4-6 weeks, then every 6 months until death.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 40 patients will be accrued for this study over 2 years."
