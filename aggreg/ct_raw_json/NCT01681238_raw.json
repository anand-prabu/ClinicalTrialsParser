This study is undertaken subsequently to test the hypothesis that the\n      intraoperative goal-directed strategy based on FloTrac/Vigileo, a minimally invasive\n      monitor, can partially prevented postoperative complications and shorten hospital stay in\n      the elderly high-risk patients undergoing total hip replacement with  continuous spinal\n      anaesthesia ."
