To assess nutritional problems including undernutrition, overnutrition and others such\n           as lipodystrophy, dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia, cardiovascular disease, etc. among na\u00efve\n           HIV-infected patients and HIV-infected patients undergoing HARRT by using ABCDEF\n           approach: Anthropometric, Biochemical, Clinical, Dietary, Exercise and Family\n           assessment.\n\n        2. To describe the relationship between the nutritional status and HIV disease staging and\n           other related factors among na\u00efve HIV-infected patients and HIV-infected patients\n           undergoing HARRT.\n\n        3. To describe the prevalence of CVD and its relationship to cardiac risk factors\n\n        4. To validate the community screening tool developed by the Thai Nutrition Taskforce in\n           HIV (TNT-HIV) by assessing the correlation of this tool and nutritional status."
