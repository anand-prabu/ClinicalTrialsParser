            "textblock": "Tinnitus is the phantom auditory perception of sound in the absence of an external or\n      internal acoustic stimulus. It is a frequent problem which can interfere significantly with\n      the ability to lead a normal life. One significant modulator of tinnitus is stress. Tinnitus\n      has been shown to be generated in the brain, as a result of functional reorganization of\n      auditory neural pathways and the central auditory system. Also non-auditory cortical areas\n      of attention allocation and emotional processing was shown to be involved. Treatment remains\n      difficult. The most effective treatment in chronic tinnitus is cognitive behavioral therapy\n      including elements of relaxation therapy. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation\n      (rTMS) is also effective in treatment of tinnitus with moderate effect size. Pilot data were\n      positive for low-frequency rTMS applied to the temporoparietal areas and high-frequency rTMS\n      applied to the left frontal cortex. Newer findings indicate that exercise-combined\n      non-invasive brain stimulation might show superior effects in contrast to rTMS or exercise\n      alone. Combination of relaxation and two-sided (frontal and temporo-parietal) rTMS will be\n      examined with regard to feasibility, safety and clinical efficacy in patients suffering from\n      chronic tinnitus in a pilot trial."
