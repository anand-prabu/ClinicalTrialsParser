  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Actinic keratoses (AK) are common cutaneous lesions associate with chronic ultraviolet
      radiation exposure. While most authorities consider AK as a pre-malignant lesion, some
      consider it as an incipient squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).  Among the current therapies for
      the treatment of AK are excisional surgery, cryosurgery, electrodesiccation and curettage,
      topical chemotherapy and light therapies.  Cryosurgery is considered the gold standard for
      therapy, however as with other lesion-directed therapies, cryosurgery does not treat
      subclinical lesions in the surrounding skin. Ingenol mebutate is the active compound in the
      sap from Euphorbia peplus L. (E. peplus). Topical ingenol mebutate treatment has been
      approved for the treatment of AKs. The goal of AK therapy for all physicians is to provide
      an effective, tissue-sparing treatment with good cosmetic results. Ingenol mebutate gel
      0.015% has shown to not only have a high clearance rate but also a transient localized
      inflammatory skin response that resolves quickly without sequelae. However, one common fear
      about ingenol mebutate is that it's mechanism of action is purely destructive to both AKs
      and healthy skin, and that retreatment would produce an equally, if not more, caustic result
      on the skin such as severe erosion, scaling, and erythema. It is our hope to debunk this
      misconception and demonstrate that reapplication of a second cycle of ingenol mebutate would
      result in lower LSR scores compared to the LSR in the first cycle of application. We plan to
      treat 20 subjects. Each qualifying subject will have at least 4-8 non-hypertrophic AKs in a
      25 cm2 treatment area on the face or scalp. All subjects will be treated with two cycles of
      ingenol mebutate 0.015%. The first cycle will be started on Day 1, and the second cycle will
      be started on Day 29 (four weeks apart). Subjects will utilize the once daily for three days
      regimen for both cycles.

      We plan to treat 20 subjects. Each qualifying subject will have at least 4-8
      non-hypertrophic AKs in a 25 cm2 treatment area on the face or scalp. All subjects will be
      treated with two cycles of ingenol mebutate 0.015%. The first cycle will be started on Day
      1, and the second cycle will be started on Day 29 (four weeks apart). Subjects will utilize
      the once daily for three days regimen for both cycles.  For the first cycle of study
      application, subjects will be followed on day 1, day 2, and day 4 during treatment; on day 1
      baseline photographs will be taken, on day 2 LSR will be assessed and visual analog scale
      (VAS) regarding perceived irritation will be conducted, and on day 4 LSR, VAS and
      photographs will be taken. Post-treatment follow-up will be conducted on day 8 and day 15,
      in which LSR will be assessed and photographs taken. Approximately four weeks later, a
      second cycle of once daily for three day regimen of ingenol mebutate 0.015% will be applied
      to the same treatment area on the face or scalp. Subjects will be followed during treatment
      on day 29, day 30 and day 32; on day 29 LSR and photographs will be taken, on day 30 LSR
      will be assessed and VAS conducted, and on day 32 LSR, VAS and photographs will be taken.
      Post-treatment follow-up for the second cycle of application will occur on day 36, day 43,
      and day 56. During these post-treatment follow-up visits LSR and photographs will be taken.
      LSR scores from day 4 and day 32 will be assessed by a blinded observer. Lastly, on day 29
      and day 56 the patient's treatment satisfaction will be evaluated on a 10 point visual
      analog scale (VAS). Consequently, there will be a total of 11 visits during a 56 day period.
