II. Determine the toxicity of this drug in this patient\n      population. III. Determine duration of survival in these patients. IV. Determine quality of\n      life of these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients receive 10-propargyl-10-deazaaminopterin IV on days 1 and 15. Treatment\n      repeats every 4 weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.\n      Quality of life is assessed at the beginning of each course. Patients are followed every 8\n      weeks for disease progression.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 19-39 patients will be accrued for this study within 12\n      months."
