At 6hrs after enrolled,collect another 5ml blood and 2 hrs urine.Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) describes the flow rate of filtered fluid through the kidney. eGFR is Creatinine-based approximations of GFR. We project to use the \"Urine Creatinine concentration\u00d7Urine Flow Rate/Plasma Creatinine Concentration\" formula to calculate the eGFR (collected two hours urine, and examine the plasma and urine creatinine in the middle of the two hours). The lowest plasma creatinine value in the 3 months preceding inclusion was taken as the baseline value, therefore use the value to calculate baseline eGFR by CKD-EPI formula.",
