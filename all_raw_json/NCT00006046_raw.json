Patients with stable or responding disease\n      at week 10 receive maintenance MAB Hu3S193 weekly. Courses repeat every 8 weeks in the\n      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of MAB Hu3S193 until the maximum tolerated\n      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 3 of 6\n      patients experience dose limiting toxicities.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-30 patients will be accrued for this study."
