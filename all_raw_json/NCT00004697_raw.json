The TPN is given intravenously over a 12 hour period beginning\n      at approximately 9 PM nightly.  Therapy continues for 24 weeks.  Adjustments in the daily\n      dose of choline provided may be required based on plasma free choline levels and patient\n      tolerance. Additionally, all patients record the type and amount of their food intake on a\n      daily basis.\n\n      Patients are followed every 2 weeks during the first 6 weeks, then every 4 weeks beginning\n      with week 12 for the remainder of the 24 weeks, and then again at week 34."
