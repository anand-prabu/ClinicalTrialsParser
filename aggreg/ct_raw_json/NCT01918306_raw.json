Patients will be randomized to\n      receive cisplatin alone or cisplatin with GDC-0941 in the phase II portion. Those receiving\n      cisplatin alone can receive GDC-0941 upon progression of their disease.  Cisplatin is a\n      chemotherapy which has been shown to be effective in treating triple negative breast cancer.\n       Preclinical studies show that adding a PI3K inhibitor such as GDC-0941 to cisplatin may be\n      a more effective treatment for breast cancer."
