  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypothesis: Fluorometholone (FML) 0.1% eyedrops topically applied 4 times a day for 22 days
      is more efficient than artificial tears (Liquifilm) in dry eye disease (DED) and ameliorates
      the worsening  of the disease after exposure to an adverse controlled environment.

      There will be 4 visits in 3 different days:

      Visit 1 (V1).  Inclusion in normalized controlled environment (NCE)

      Visit 2 (V2). 21 days post-treatment. Data collected in NCE

      Visit 3 (V3). 21 days post-treatment. Data collected in adverse controlled environment (ACE)

      Visit 4 (V4). 22 days post-treatment. Recovery visit in ACE. Data collected in NCE
