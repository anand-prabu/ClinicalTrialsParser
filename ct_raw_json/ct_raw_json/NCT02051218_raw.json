            "textblock": "Denosumab, a monoclonal antibody against RANK-Ligand has been shown superior to zoledronic\n      acid in delaying time to a first on-study skeletal related event (SRE) in patients with\n      solid tumors, with no effects on disease progression or survival. Many SREs were silent\n      compression fractures found only because of scheduled imaging. The approved dose of\n      denosumab is 120 mg s.c. every 4 weeks (q4w). Although generally well tolerated, there is a\n      time-dependent increase in osteonecrosis of the jaw in up to 8% of patients. Cases of fatal\n      hypocalcaemia were observed during post marketing surveillance.\n\n      The optimal dose and schedule for denosumab is unknown. Denosumab is associated with\n      considerable costs and may add toxicity; thus a study of de-escalation is warranted.\n\n      The aim of the trial is to test the hypothesis that the benefit of Denosumab is maintained\n      if administered 120 mg q12w as compared to 120 mg q4w. The primary endpoint of this\n      open-label randomized phase III non-inferiority trial is time to first on-trial symptomatic\n      skeletal event (SSE: i.e. clinically significant pathological fracture, radiation therapy to\n      bone, surgery to bone or spinal cord compression). With a non-inferiority margin of 1.2 for\n      the hazard ratio, a power 80% and a type I error 5%, the total sample size is 1380.\n      Secondary endpoints are safety, time to subsequent on-trial SSE, quality of life, health\n      economic outcomes, and change in bone turnover markers. This study is open for international\n      collaboration."

The lesions must\n             be documented by radiological evaluation within 12 weeks before randomization (by\n             X-Ray, CT scan, PET-CT, MRI scan or bone scintigraphy).\n\n          -  WHO performance status 0-2\n\n          -  Age \u2265 18 years.\n\n          -  Corrected serum calcium \u2265 2 mmol/l and \u2264 3 mmol/l (medical treatments to obtain serum\n             calcium levels in the normal range are allowed, as far as no bisphosphonates or\n             denosumab are used).\n\n          -  Liver transaminases within normal range or not more than 3 x ULN with liver\n             metastases.

Women with child-bearing potential are using effective\n             contraception, are not pregnant and agree not to become pregnant during participation\n             in the trial and during the 12 months thereafter. A negative pregnancy test before\n             inclusion (within 7 days) into the trial is required for all women with child-bearing\n             potential.\n\n          -  Men agree not to father a child during participation in the trial and during 12\n             months thereafter.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  Definite contraindication for denosumab (e.g. hypocalcaemia [Albumin-corrected serum\n             calcium < 2.0 mmol/l]).\n\n          -  History or current evidence of osteonecrosis of the jaw.\n\n          -  Non-healed mucosa in oral cavity (by surgery or as a side effect of any other\n             treatment).\n\n          -  Jaw or dental conditions that require oral surgery or if surgery or invasive dental\n             procedures are planned.\n\n          -  Prior use of denosumab for bone metastases (dose 120 mg every 4 weeks) or\n             bisphosphonates to treat bone metastases. Patients treated with denosumab or\n             bisphosphonates against osteopenia or osteoporosis are allowed to enter the trial if\n             the last dose was more than 28 days before randomization.\n\n          -  Patients with known osteoporosis (T-score \u2264 -2.5) at study entry (since fractures\n             from osteoporosis are difficult to be discriminated from fractures through bone\n             metastases).\n\n          -  Radiotherapy or surgery to the bone within the last two weeks before randomization or\n             planned within 6 weeks after randomization.\n\n          -  Presence or history of CNS metastases or leptomeningeal disease. A MRI evaluation\n             within 12 weeks before randomization must be performed in case of suspicious\n             symptoms.\n\n          -  Psychiatric disorder precluding understanding of information on trial related topics,\n             giving informed consent, filling out QoL forms.\n\n          -  Concurrent treatment in a clinical trial with SSE or SRE as primary endpoint.\n\n          -  Known hypersensitivity to trial drug or hypersensitivity to any other component of\n             the trial drug (e.g. fructose).\n\n          -  Any concomitant drugs contraindicated for use with the trial drugs according to the\n             approved product information.\n\n          -  Any psychological, familial, sociological or geographical condition potentially\n             hampering compliance with the trial protocol."
