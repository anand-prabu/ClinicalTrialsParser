    <textblock>
      The main objective of the study is to describe the french population of individuals with
      paraphilia who have committed a sexual offence in whom androgen antagonists was prescribed.
      The secondary objectives are the description of social demographic profiles, the personal
      and family histories,psychiatric co-morbidities, the side effects of androgen antagonists
      treatment. This study, the first of its kind in France, may allow to better understand the
      social demographic and clinical profile of sexual offenders with paraphilias treated with
      androgen antagonists.

      To be included, the subject must have committed a sexual offense and must present a
      diagnosis of paraphilia with an indication of treatment with androgen antagonists.
      Paraphilia is defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual as a sexual behavior disorder
      characterized by &quot;sexually arousing fantasies, needs or recurrent and intense sexual
      behaviors generally involving (1) of non-human objects, (2) the suffering or humiliation of
      oneself or partner, (3) children or other persons without their consent, occurring during a
      period of at least six months &quot;(Criterion A). This disorder is responsible for sexual
      behavior which is &quot;clinically significant disturbances in social, occupational or other
      important areas of functioning&quot; (Criterion B).

      The inclusion of approximately 200 subjects is expected in this study. The inclusion period
      will last for 12 months.

      Data will be codified and only a few investigators will have access to these data. The
      statistical analyse will use the usual descriptive parameters: mean, standard deviation,
      median, interquartile range and range for quantitative variables, frequencies and cumulative
      frequencies (if applicable) for qualitative variables.
