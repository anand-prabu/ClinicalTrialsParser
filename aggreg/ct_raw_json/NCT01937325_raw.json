We therefore\n      have an opportunity to examine correlates between improvements in lung function, exercise\n      capacity, inflammatory markers and indices of wellbeing in CF that may not be repeatable in\n      a single cohort.\n\n      We propose a double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over study of 20 patients currently\n      awaiting initiation of ivacaftor therapy. Patients enrolled in the study will be asked to\n      undergo screening (day -28), and baseline assessments (day 0) and re-assessment studies (day\n      28) after treatment period 1, followed by baseline assessment at the beginning of treatment\n      period 2 (day 56) and at the conclusion of treatment period 2 (day 84).\n\n      After satisfying eligibility criteria, subjects will be randomly assigned to initial active\n      treatment or placebo following a 4 week run-in period. After completion of period 1 and a 4\n      week washout period, subjects will cross-over to the alternative treatment. After 4 weeks of\n      period 2, subjects will undergo final assessment as shown in the diagram below. However\n      participants choosing not to continue taking ivacaftor in a Named Patient Program or another\n      similar program run by Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc., ('Vertex'), at the end of the study\n      period will be required to undergo a Safety Follow-Up visit 28 days after the final dose of\n      study drug. Safety Follow-Up assessments will not include the CPET."
