The treatment proposed can be incorporated into their daily rehabilitation routine. Early intervention (within 7-21 days of the infarct) raises the chance for neuroplasticity and improved recovery of their motor function in the short and long run. Levodopa has been proven to be safe to be used in stroke patients (Lancet. 2001 Sep 8;358(9284):787-90., Arch Phys Med Rehabil. 2008 Sep;89(9):1633-41.), however, the side effects of this medication may include nausea, unusual tiredness, dizziness, excessive watering of mouth.",
