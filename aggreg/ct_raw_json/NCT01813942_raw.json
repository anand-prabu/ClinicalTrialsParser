The purposes of\n      this project are to provide the data integration and extraction methods for handling the\n      structured and unstructured data sources in more efficient ways, to provide the validation\n      scheme for facilitating the data reviewing of extracted results produced by information\n      extraction modules, to increase the quality of clinical data by comparing the data from\n      different data sources and correcting data errors and inconsistent, to handle the clinical\n      data with the properties of time series and incompleteness, to increase accuracy of data\n      analysis and increase quality of health care by improving the completeness and correctness\n      of clinical data, to provide flexibility of methods in the platform. In the project, the\n      disease topic is focused on the liver cancer patients' clinical data and we hope the methods\n      in the projects can be extended to handle other diseases by replacing these knowledge models\n      in the future."
