        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or females patients &gt; 18 years of age who has a clinically driven, planned PCI
             of the target CTO, in a major epicardial coronary artery, without planned
             revascularization of other coronary stenosis/stenoses in major epicardial segments.

          -  Target CTO must be greater than or equal to 3 calendar months prior to Screening

          -  Target CTO must meet protocol defined criteria for entry

          -  Patient is receiving a course of optimal anti-ischemic medical therapy (at least 2
             anti-anginal agents or the maximum tolerated anti-anginal therapy)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Documented chest radiation exposure &gt; 4.0 Gray within 8 weeks of Day 0

          -  Target vessel is not an occluded stent, saphenous vein graft

          -  Patient had ACS &lt; 4 weeks from Screening, attributable to any coronary vessel

          -  Patient has non-healed dissection plane extending to a point adjacent to the coronary
             lumen distal to the target CTO

          -  Patient has a known or suspected target vessel perforation within 30 days of Day 0

          -  Angiographic exclusion criteria as defined in the protocol
