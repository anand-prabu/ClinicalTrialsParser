  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After surgical procedures, interventions to reduce postoperative pain and bleeding are of
      great importance. In this study, the effect will be investigated of smearing common drugs,
      which are designed for injection, directly onto the raw wound surface (topical application)
      created during surgery. Topical application allows a small amount of drug to reach a large
      wound area, higher drug concentration in the exposed wound surface but very low
      concentration in the body, and no risk of injury from needles. Although beneficial effects
      of such an easy and low-cost intervention would be expected, the investigators have found no
      previous reports on blinded and controlled studies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drugs to be studied on whether they reduce bleeding are adrenaline (constricts blood
      vessels) and tranexamic acid (TXA) (prevents bloodclots from dissolving). The drug studied
      to what extent it reduces pain will be bupivacaine, a common local anaesthetic. Patients
      undergoing bilateral symmetric breast surgery or single sided mastectomies are candidates
      for enrollment in the study. The bilateral patients will have two identical procedures and
      hence two identical wounds in the same patient. This enables the investigators to use one
      side as control and hence design our study arms as prospective and placebo-controlled. The
      patients undergoing a one-sided procedure will need to be compared to similar patients, but
      as wounds will be of different sizes and in different people, larger groups are needed to
      find significant differences between treatment and controls.
