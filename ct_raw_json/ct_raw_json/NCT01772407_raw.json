The average number of\n      patients/surgical center is approximately 27 in 14 surgical centers.\n\n      The proposed undertaking of every patient is fully identical to that which is usually\n      proposed by the surgical center in charge of the patient (i.d. 7 centers will perform\n      laparoscopic procedures and 7 centers open procedure according to their usual practice).\n\n      A complete information leaflet will be given to the patients during the first consultation\n      which will correspond to the enrollment day.\n\n      The preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative period will be in complete accordance\n      with the usual care of the center.\n\n      The baseline demographics and conditions as well as the perioperative items and the\n      postoperative occurrences will be recorded through a prior designed e-questionnaire.\n\n      The follow-up encompass 5 postoperative consultations:1 month, 6 ,12 ,18 and 24 months.\n\n      On every consultation the patient will fill a very simple validated quality of life\n      questionnaire (EORTC,QLQ.C30) an give back a weekly journal reporting the potentially\n      arising medical and surgical events.\n\n      Globally the comparative analysis of the costs ,the mortality ,the morbidity, the quality\n      of life ot the patients undergoing either a laparoscopic or a open right colectomy for\n      cancer will be performed controling for the carcinologic equivalence of the two surgical\n      strategies."
