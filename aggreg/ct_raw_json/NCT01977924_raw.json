Regular treatment of OSA by continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)\n      improves endothelial function and is associated with a reduction in cardiovascular risk.\n      Approximately 40% of patients with OSA are intolerant or insufficiently adherent to CPAP.\n      Alternative treatments or adjuvants to the CPAP are needed.\n\n      The polyphenols have demonstrated their effectiveness in improving endothelial function in\n      patients with CV disease. No randomized controlled studies have evaluated the impact of PPR\n      on the endothelial dysfunction associated with OSAHS."
