Blocking the\n      portal vein on one side of the liver may cause the opposite side of the liver to increase in\n      size and decrease the risk of liver failure following surgery.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of portal vein embolization in treating\n      patients who have liver metastases from primary colorectal cancer."

Approximately 3-6 weeks after embolization, patients\n      undergo an exploratory laparotomy followed by hepatic surgical resection.\n\n      Patients are followed for at least 6 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 25 patients will be accrued for this study."
