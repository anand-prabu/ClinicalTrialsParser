Anti-tumor necrosis\n      factor alpha (anti-TNF)-\u03b1 is effective and increasingly being used for the treatment of\n      patients with refractory disease and complicated disease behaviour. The reactivation of\n      latent tuberculosis (TB) is a well-recognised complication associated with the use of\n      anti-TNF therapy, and most cases occurred in endemic regions. Hong Kong is a region of\n      intermediate TB burden, and the reactivation of latent TB in IBD patients treated with\n      anti-TNF can be a serious problem. Screening has been shown to reduce the incidence of TB,\n      but it remains unclear whether monitoring during anti-TNF therapy is effective. Despite\n      reported efficacy with the current screening strategy, active TB developed in up to 11.4% of\n      patients receiving anti-TNF therapy. There is therefore an urgent need for better disease\n      monitoring and prevention, particularly in regions where TB is endemic. This study aims to\n      investigate the role of IGRA in screening for latent TB in IBD patients and control subjects"
