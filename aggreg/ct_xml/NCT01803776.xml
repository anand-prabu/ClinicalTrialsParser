  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Physical Activity and Nutrition in Children (PANIC) Study is a single-centre physical
      activity and diet intervention study that provides novel scientific information on physical
      activity, nutrition, overweight, obesity, physical fitness, cognition, oral health, sleep,
      pain and other aspects of quality of life as well as health care costs in a population
      sample of children and adolescents. The main hypothesis of the study is that regular
      physical activity and dietary changes improve health and quality of life among children and
      adolescents.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study population is a population sample of 512 children from the city of Kuopio,
      Finland. The children will be recruited at the age of 6-8 years and allocated into the
      intervention group and the control group. The intervention group will undergo intensive,
      individualized and family-based physical activity and diet intervention that also includes
      exercise and cooking clubs. All children will be examined after the 2-year follow-up. The
      intervention group will continues with a less intensive exercise and diet intervention until
      adulthood. All children will be re-examined in adolescence and in early adulthood.

      The results of the PANIC Study will help in improving children's health by increased
      physical activity and improved nutrition, in identifying high-risk children who would
      benefit most from exercise and diet intervention, and in targeting the high-risk children
      for more careful health examinations, exercise and diet intervention and health follow-up
      and in preventing chronic diseases and their societal consequences in adulthood.

    <description>Lifestyle intervention is based on Finnish exercise and nutrition recommendations. The children and their parents in the intervention group undergo intensive individual family-based exercise and diet intervention. They meet an exercise specialist and an authorized nutritionist, who give detailed and individualized instructions on health promoting physical activity and nutrition at months 0, 1.5, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 with a specific topic at each visit. After the 2-year intensive intervention period the intervention continues with yearly physical activity and dietary counseling sessions. Group-based exercise and cooking clubs are part of intervention.</description>
