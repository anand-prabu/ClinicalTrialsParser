  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess the safety and tolerability at increasing dose levels of PF-06664178 in patients
      with advanced solid tumors in order to determine the maximum tolerated dose and select the

    <description>Number of participants with objective response based on assessment of confirmed complete response (CR) or confirmed partial response (PR) according to RECIST. Confirmed CR defined as disappearance of all target lesions. Confirmed PR defined as ≥30% decrease in sum of the longest dimensions (LD) of the target lesions taking as a reference the baseline sum LD according to RECIST. Confirmed responses are those that persist on repeat imaging study ≥4 weeks after initial documentation of response.</description>
