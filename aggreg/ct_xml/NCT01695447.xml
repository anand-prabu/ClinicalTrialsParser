  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether duct-to-mucosa is better than invagination
      in pancreaticojejunostomy after pancreaticoduodenectomy. This single-centre, open,
      randomized controlled trail is conducted following ISGPF criteria for pancreatic fistula
      (PF). The duration of the study is supposed to start from Jan 5th 2012 and last to Dec 2014,
      until 100 or more cases are accessible. Patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer,
      peri-ampullar carcinoma or other benign or malignant diseases which need to operate
      pancreaticoduodenectomy will be included. Main outcomes are pancreatic fistula rate,
      mortality, morbidity, reoperation and hospital stay. The investigators assumption that
      duct-to-mucosa is better than invagination.
