Treatment was standardized at 100% magnetic field intensity relative to the participant's resting MT, at 10 pulses per second (10 Hz) for 5 seconds, with an intertrain interval of 10 seconds. Treatment session lasted for 15 minutes with 3000 pulses."

To test change of cortical excitability during nicotine craving in cigarette\n      smokers and explore the potential use of TMS  in cigarette smokers.\n\n      Aim # 2. Given the role of the prefrontal cortex (and connected regions) in craving, we will\n      examine whether modulating prefrontal activity through rTMS will impact measures of craving\n      and the reinforcing effects of nicotine.\n\n      Design:\n\n      The study was a randomized, blind, sham-controlled crossover study in which participants\n      will involve two study visits. Participants will have an initial assessment about tobacco\n      use habits and craving patterns. Participant will look at images related to and not related\n      to cigarette smoking.\n\n      Participants will receive two different types of brain stimulation with repetitive TMS (10\n      Hz): sham rTMS and active rTMS over prefrontal cortex. Craving assessments will be performed\n      before and after each stimulus experiment.\n\n      Participants will be measured cortical excitability with TMS before and after each stimulus\n      experiment."
