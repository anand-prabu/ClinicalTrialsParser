            "textblock": "Patients with primary aldosteronism, which is the most prevalent form of secondary\n      hypertension, have an increased rate of cardiovascular events, compared to patients with\n      essential hypertension, even with equal severity of hypertension. This might be partially\n      attributed to the association of increased aldosterone levels with insulin resistance. How\n      this relation can be explained from a pathophysiological point of view, is insufficiently\n      established.\n\n      Recently, microvascular dysfunction has been proposed as a link between insulin resistance\n      and hypertension. Loss of NO-mediated vasodilation is an important feature of microvascular\n      dysfunction; in addition, an impaired insulin-mediated microvascular NO production has been\n      suggested to underlie the reduction in insulin-stimulated glucose disposal that is\n      characteristic of insulin-resistant states.  Increased aldosterone levels are not only\n      associated with insulin resistance, but also with endothelial dysfunction. In addition, they\n      interfere with the vascular effects of insulin.\n\n      Therefore, the investigators hypothesize that in patients with primary aldosteronism,\n      increased aldosterone levels induce microvascular dysfunction through reduction of\n      NO-availability, which contributes to the development of insulin resistance, and of\n      hypertension, in addition to the sodium-retaining effects of aldosterone."
