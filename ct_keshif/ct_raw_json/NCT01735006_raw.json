The primary objective of this study is to\n      demonstrate the efficacy of the vaccine against relevant outcomes in healthy women above 18\n      years old at enrolment. The secondary objectives are to evaluate the safety, immunogenicity\n      and immuno-persistence of the vaccine. Meanwhile, this study tries to compare the difference\n      of safety and immunogenicity among different lots. Approximately 6000 study subjects will be\n      enrolled and randomly stratified into 2 groups and receive human papillomavirus (HPV)\n      vaccine(three different lots) or commercialized hepatitis E vaccine(Hecolin) according to a\n      0-1-6 month schedule."
