The study will be conducted in normal\n      weight and obese women of childbearing age, supplemented for 8 weeks with 800 mcg/day folic\n      acid.\n\n      It is hypothesized that (1) a change in folate status, induced by the supplementation, will\n      influence the DNA methylation of specific genes and (2) the DNA methylation response to\n      folic acid supplementation may differ between the normal weight and the obese women of\n      childbearing age."

Blood samples will be collected,\n      after an overnight fast, for determination of serum folate concentration and for MTHFR677\n      genotyping.  Body composition and 24-hr dietary recalls will also be conducted during the\n      screening visit.\n\n      The second phase is an eight week supplementation trial with 800 mcg/day folic acid.\n      Screened individuals determined to have a serum folate < 30 nmol/L (< 50th percentile of\n      NHANES 1999-2004) and of the CC or CT genotype (for MTHFR677) will be eligible for inclusion\n      in the supplementation trial.  Participants will be instructed to avoid dietary supplements,\n      fortified ready-to-eat cereals, and other high folate content foods during intervention.\n      Blood samples will be collected, after an overnight fast, at baseline and after 4 and 8\n      weeks of supplementation for determination of primary (DNA methylation profile) and\n      secondary (nutritional, metabolic and health status biomarkers) outcome measures."
