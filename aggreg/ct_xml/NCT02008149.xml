  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Following a complete spinal cord injury (SCI), individuals experience progressive bone loss,
      especially in the legs, with up to 70% of persons with SCI sustaining a fracture at some
      point during their lifetime. Fractures following SCI are costly to treat and more than half
      of patients experience a medical complication, requiring extended hospitalization, resulting
      in a substantial impact on their quality of life. To reduce the incidence of fractures, more
      effective rehabilitation strategies to prevent bone loss are needed. The goal of this
      research is to determine if bone health can be preserved using an indoor rowing exercise
      program in which the leg muscles are electrically stimulated using several, small surface
      electrode pads that are placed on the skin on the front and back thigh muscles. An
      encouraging case study has recently shown remarkable bone preservation in one individual
      with SCI who participated in an electrical stimulation rowing program, however, whether
      other individuals with SCI can achieve the same benefit is currently unknown.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study we expect to enroll a total of 10 participants with SCI. Five participants
      will be assigned to a Standard-of-Care (control) group and five participants will be
      assigned to an FES-rowing intervention group. Group assignment will be partly based on the
      preference of each potential participant and their willingness to make the necessary time
      commitment required for participation in a given group, with the added goal, to the extent
      possible, of matching the two groups for age, gender and time since injury. Only those
      individuals who have a strong desire to participate in a regular exercise program and who
      express a willingness to travel to VA Palo Alto the necessary number of times per week to
      perform FES-rowing will be potential candidates for inclusion in the rowing group.

      Bone density measurements for both the Standard-of-Care group and the FES-rowing group will
      be performed using Dual energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) and peripheral Quantitative
      Computed Tomography (pQCT). The Standard-of-Care group will undergo no other research
      procedures.

      The muscle conditioning program is accomplished through electrical stimulation of the
      quadriceps and hamstring muscles using a 4-channel electrical stimulator that applies
      stimulation using surface electrodes adhered using gel to the skin overlying the quadriceps
      and hamstrings muscles. The muscle strengthening initially takes place three times per week,
      sixty minutes per session, progressing up to five sessions per week, for approximately 8
      weeks. The muscle strengthening program ensures that subjects have sufficient muscle
      strength and endurance before they embark on the rowing program. Following the 8-week muscle
      strengthening program, subjects will begin FES-rowing, with three sessions per week, thirty
      minutes per session for the following 28 weeks. In the FES-rowing group, we will measure
      isometric knee extension strength at the start of week 0, and at the end of weeks 8, 22 and
      36.

      For the rowing group, we will capture 3D kinetics and kinematics in our motion capture
      laboratory during FES-rowing at the end of weeks 8, 22 and 36. Kinematics during rowing will
      be collected from fifty passive retro-reflective markers that will be placed on each
      participant to capture the position and orientation of the 12 interconnected body segments
      used to represent each subject.
