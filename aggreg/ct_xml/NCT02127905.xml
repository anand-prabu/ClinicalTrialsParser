      The protocol is designed for the compassionate treatment of patients with Fanconi Anemia who
      do not have an HLA-matched sibling donor. The purpose of this study is to determine the
      likelihood of engraftment in Fanconi Anemia patients using total body irradiation (TBI),
      cyclophosphamide (CY), fludarabine (FLU) and antithymocyte globulin (ATG) followed by an
      unrelated donor hematopoietic cell transplant with T-cell depletion using the CliniMACS
      device.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The major obstacle to successful alternate donor HCT for patients with Fanconi Anemia is
      graft failure. While T-cell depletion decreases the incidence of aGVHD, its effect on
      improving long term survival is unproven. To potentially improve engraftment rate, we have
      chosen a relatively new immunosuppressive agent, fludarabine (FLU), FLU is an antineoplastic
      agent that has been shown to be an effective immunosuppressive agen in BMT conditioning
      therapy. The addition of FLU to the commonly used preparative regimen of CY and TBU in
      Fanconi Anemia patients may improve engraftment rates.

      Based on all presented data and its outcome, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation with
      the use of total body irradiation (450 cGy), cyclophosphamide (10 mg/kg IV) and fludarabine
      (35 mg/m2 IV) as preparative cytoreductive therapy has become the standard treatment for the
      hematologic manifestations of Fanconi Anemia at CHLA. However, the use of Isolex 300i will
      be replaced by CliniMACS in processing T-cell depletion.

      The CliniMACS CD34 Reagent System is an investigational medical device that has not yet been
      approved by the FDA. This device is used in vitro to select and enrich specific cell
      populations. When using the CliniMACS CD34 Reagent, the system selects CD34+ cells from
      heterogenous hematological cell populations for transplantation in cases where this is
      clinically indicated. Based on the gathered data, CliniMACS has not been a contributing
      factor in the toxicity of patients, although may have a potential of eliciting &quot;antibody&quot;
      reactions in some patients, the process has been of significant life-saving benefit as
      compared to the potential risks.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must be &gt; 2 months and &lt; 21 years of age with a diagnosis of Fanconi anemia.

          -  Patients must have an HLA-A, B, DRB1 identical or 1 antigen mismatched related
             (non-sibling) or unrelated donor.  Patients and donors will be typed for HLA-A and B
             using serological or molecular techniques and for DRB1 using high resolution
             molecular typing. (Patients with a 2 antigen mismatched related donor will be
             eligible for the protocol but evaluated separately).

          -  Patients with FA must have high risk genotype or aplastic anemia (AA) or
             myelodysplastic syndrome without excess blasts.

          -  Aplastic anemia is defined as having at least one of the following:

               1. platelet count &lt;20 x 109/L

               2. ANC &lt;5 x 108/L

               3. Hgb &lt;8 g/dL with at least one of the following:
