For\n      this reason, patients will have two PSG sleep studies during their hospital stay, under 20\n      L/min and 35 L/min NHF therapy in randomized order.\n\n      Stage 3: Home Care monitoring Aim of this Stage is to compare long term influences of NHF\n      and LOT on PCO2 levels randomised crossover, 4 weeks each treatment.\n\n      Stage 4: Long Term Home Care monitoring Aim of this stage is the long term follow up (12\n      month) of patients to examine the compliance of a sufficient NHF therapy. Patients will\n      retain the NHF therapy if they are responders (PCO2 improvement in stage 3 of at least 2\n      mmHG with NHF versus LOT) and willing and able to use NHF and a patient log.\n\n      All patients will be monitored for the next 12 month.
