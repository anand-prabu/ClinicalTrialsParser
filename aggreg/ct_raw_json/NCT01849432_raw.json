For example, one model of PTSD posits exaggerated\n      amygdala responsivity to threat-related stimuli as well as deficient top-down modulation of\n      amygdala responses by specific cortical regions, including the pregenual anterior cingulate\n      cortex, subcallosal cortex, and hippocampus.\n\n      The investigators propose to investigate the pathophysiology of several specific anxiety\n      disorders, Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Panic Disorder (PD), and Specific\n      Phobia(SP), by using cognitive activation paradigms and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to\n      probe the function and structure of implicated amygdalo-cortical circuitry."
