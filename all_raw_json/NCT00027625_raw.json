Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to\n      stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining gefitinib with\n      chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combining gefitinib with temozolomide\n      in treating patients who have malignant primary glioma."

Patients are stratified\n      according to use of concurrent enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic drugs (yes vs no).\n\n      Patients receive oral gefitinib once daily on days 1-35 and oral temozolomide once daily on\n      days 8-12 for the first course only. For the second and subsequent courses, patients receive\n      oral gefitinib once daily on days 1-28 and oral temozolomide once daily on days 1-5. Courses\n      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of gefitinib until the maximum tolerated\n      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2\n      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed every 2 months for 1 year and then every 3-6 months thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 3-42 patients will be accrued for this study within 1-14\n      months."
