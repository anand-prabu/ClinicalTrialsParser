(closed to accrual 5/17/2000)\n\n        -  Group 3 (HLA-A24 positive): Patients receive tyrosinase:206-214.\n\n        -  Group 4 (HLA-A31 positive): Patients receive tyrosinase related protein-1. Each peptide\n           vaccine is separately emulsified in Montanide ISA-51 and administered subcutaneously\n           into the thigh. Patients are treated with peptide vaccine alone or combined with 1 of 3\n           possible adjuvants (interleukin-2 (IL-2) IV, IL-2 delayed IV, or sargramostim (GM-CSF)\n           SQ) depending on the time of entry into study and response to treatment.\n\n      At least 4 to 6 patients are accrued for the peptide alone cohort before beginning accrual\n      on the other cohorts. Any patient who experiences unacceptable toxicity due to adjuvant\n      therapy is taken off study. If a second patient develops unacceptable toxicity, that\n      schedule of peptide administration is discontinued.\n\n      Patients exhibiting stable, minor, mixed, or partial response may receive up to 12\n      additional courses.\n\n      Patients are followed for 4-6 weeks.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 457 patients will be accrued for this study over 3.5 years."
