            "textblock": "Headache disorders are prevalent, disabling, under recognized, under diagnosed and under\n      treated. Migraine has a prevalence of 10% in men and 25% in women in Canada. The treatment\n      of migraine is based on patient education (lifestyle habit modification, trigger avoidance),\n      and pharmacological acute treatment and prophylaxis. A multidisciplinary approach allows a\n      repartition of tasks between different health professionals.\n\n      In a 2010 meeting, the Canadian Headache Society members supported the concept of Headache\n      Centers, and a headache nurse was judged as an essential component of such centers.\n\n      Gaul has reviewed the structured multidisciplinary approach that could be used in a headache\n      centre and the existing studies using such structures. Five studies did include a headache\n      nurse. No study did observe the impact of a nurse only. Resources in medical care are\n      limited. One study did use a program of 96 hours, which does not seem realistic on the\n      long-term and for a large pool of patients in a public hospital. Patients are not always\n      able to pay for paramedical help such as physiotherapy and psychotherapy. Even if they do,\n      finding a specialized therapist for chronic headache is difficult. Defining the role of a\n      nurse and demonstrating the impact on patient care is therefore a first step in the concept\n      of a headache center. Possible roles of a headache nurse according to Gaul are patient\n      education, follow-up of the treatment plan, addressing patient queries, and monitoring of\n      patient progress. The headache nurse may also participate in research projects. In a\n      hospital Headache Clinic, the nurse may be involved in intra-venous treatments and blood\n      sampling for research.\n\n      In summary, evidence to demonstrate the impact of a nurse in a headache clinic is lacking.\n      We propose to study this aspect prospectively. A study with positive findings would\n      encourage health ministers to fund and support headache nurses for headache centers across\n      Canada for headache management. Chronic headache and therefore chronic migraine would be a\n      focus of such centers, since most patients seen in specialized centers are chronic.\n\n      HYPOTHESIS: The addition of a headache nurse to the headache team will help the CHUM\n      Migraine Clinic to improve treatment outcome, and reduce the burden of headache. This\n      multidisciplinary approach will also allow a higher efficiency of the team."

The first\n      approach will be based on the physician only and is limited to fixed appointments (control\n      group). The second approach will be based on a team involving a headache nurse (active\n      group) who will participate in patient education and follow-up. The goal is to improve\n      patient outcome but also physician productivity.\n\n      First 100 patients (control group, phase 1): patients with episodic and chronic migraine\n      will be screened, sign consent and be enrolled. They will be seen by the physician only,\n      without  the nurse's support. This situation will reproduce the actual conditions at the\n      clinic. During this phase, the nurse will be involved in the follow-up of known patients\n      (who will not be included in the protocol) and data collection. She will develop her\n      headache management abilities and help the physicians to develop some educational tools for\n      patients.\n\n      Following 100 patients (active group, phase 2) :  patients with episodic and chronic\n      migraine will be screened and enroled. They will be seen by the physician and nurse team,\n      with a treatment plan tailored to specific needs including regular scheduled visits,\n      follow-up of chronification factors and educational sessions. Phone call follow-ups will be\n      planned. Patients will have an easier and quicker contact with the team in an emergency\n      situation."
