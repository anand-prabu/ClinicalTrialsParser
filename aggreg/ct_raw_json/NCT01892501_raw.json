Group A biopsy is surgically feasible\n\n        2. Group B: biopsy by surgery can not be performed (against medical contraindications or\n           anesthetics) at that moment, definition of therapeutic strategy that was decided in the\n           absence of histological documentation:\n\n             -  Surgery outset\n\n             -  Chemotherapy or other oncological treatment\n\n             -  Supports non-oncological if benign disease suspected\n\n             -  No treatment.\n\n      EUS is performed by oesophageal for two patient groups for the two groups of patients\n      (within a maximum period of six weeks after the PET scan), under general anesthesia and\n      endoscopic control.\n\n      According the pathological findings, the therapeutic strategy is defined in a second PCR\n      (PCR # 2), to assess the impact of the puncture:\n\n        -  Surgery outset\n\n        -  Chemotherapy or other oncological treatment\n\n        -  Supports non-oncological when benign pathology documented\n\n        -  No treatment\n\n        -  Selecting another surgical diagnostic procedure (non-contributory income).\n\n      A patient monitoring will be conducted for 12 months. The clinical and radiological data\n      carried over the standard of care of the patient will be collected. Achieving a\n      thoracoabdominopelvien scanner (TAP) at 1 year to characterize the evolution of the disease\n      marks the end of the study for the patient.\n\n      For the patients who have had a negative biopsy, monitoring will involve a scanner TAP 6\n      month and 12 month then consultation with the oncologist."
