  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To demonstrate the effectiveness of an easily administered intervention (guided self help)
      aimed at reducing binge eating in patients undergoing bariatric surgery.

      The investigators hypothesize that patients who have guided self help pre-operatively will
      have reduced episodes of bingeing pre-operatively compared to those having treatment as
      usual (bariatric surgery), which will be maintained in the post-operative period, and will
      be associated with improved weight loss and psychological outcomes after surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Binge eating disorder (BED) is distressing and common in patients who present for treatment
      for obesity. Despite this, it is often undiagnosed. Patients who have bariatric surgery have
      improvements in their eating patterns, including binge eating. However there is variability
      in the degree of weight loss and post-operative complications following bariatric surgery,
      associated with disordered eating.

      Guided self help for BED (GSH) is a treatment which, like bariatric surgery, is effective in
      reducing the number of binge episodes in people who binge eat. It is not known whether GSH
      prior to surgery, in patients undergoing bariatric surgery has any additional benefit for
      reducing bingeing, or improving weight loss in these patients.
