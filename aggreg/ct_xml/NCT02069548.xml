  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study addresses postures and range of motion in cervical dystonia (Spasmodic
      Torticollis). It uses 3D miniature and wireless motion captures sensors, and aims to
      increase the understanding of the biomechanics of the movement disorders of the cervical
      column in this pathology. In addition, the clinical state of cervical dystonia of the
      patients will be assessed, using the Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Rating Scale
      (TWSTRS). The investigators will compare the results between control and study groups.

        Study-group: 30 patients meeting the criteria for cervical dystonia (Spasmodic
        Torticollis) and without botulinum toxin injections during the last 6 previous months
        before baseline. Patients will be selected consecutively among the outpatients with
        movement disorder of 3 study sites: Fondation OPH Rothschild, Salpetriere Hospital and
        Sainte-Anne Hospital (Paris)

        Control-group: 30 healthy volunteers matched in age (+/- 5 years) and gender with the 30
        CD subjects. They will be selected in Sainte-Anne Hospital (Paris)
