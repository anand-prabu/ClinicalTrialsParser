      During the first visit, the couple will be acquainted with their condition. This will
      include the epidemiology of their condition, some sex education tips, as well as the
      therapeutic modalities available. This is followed by short description of the protocol. In
      the procedure room, each patient will be examined to determine the degree of vaginismus and
      classify her condition according to Lemont's classification as modified by Pacik, from 1 to
      5. In the same or subsequent sessions, surface anesthesia of the area of injection followed
      by ice packs is used before the BOTOX is injected into the muscle.

      In the first session, proper history taking includes the difficulties they are facing, and
      the measures taken to solve it whether medical or folk treatment. Proper counseling of the
      couple to describe the new modality including the BOTOX injection and subsequent dilatation
      sessions. Proper informed consent forms will be signed. Therapy sessions will be carried out
      which starts with the gentle informed approach to the genital area to gain trust of the
      patient. This is followed by the digital vaginal examination of the patient to determine the
      degree of spasm and the muscle(s) involved.

      We started by sterilizing the perineal area and injection site in the vaginal introitus
      using povidone iodine solution. The patient is warned effectively before each step of the
      procedure and what to expect as regards pain. We used surface (Xylocaine gel) anesthesia
      both before the injection and during the dilatation sessions. We did not use local
      anesthetic injections at the site of BOTOX injection. In addition we used ice packs
      pre-prepared in a surgical latex glove, on the perineum and introitus both before and during
      the injection of BOTOX to act as a counter irritant. However in advanced cases of Vaginismus
      (V4-5), we used general intravenous anesthesia

      We made sure to check that the tip of the needle is not in a vessel by aspirating before
      proceeding with the injection of each bolus of BOTOX. We only did one puncture site, and
      used that to radially injecting the intended area by changing the direction of the tip of
      the needle. We found this much less painful to the patient. The injection site will be
      monitored by the other free hand index and thumb, in both sides of the muscle, right and
      left, as well as the origin of the muscle in the perineal body.  Following the withdrawal of
      the needle from the muscle, we distributed the bolus of BOTOX uniformly within the muscle
      digitally using an arc fashion massage of the introitus, as well as combined per-rectum
      index and perineal thumb massage.  We applied pressure, whenever needed to stop the bleeding
      from the injection site. Following the procedure, we instruct the patient to do Kegel
      exercises as much as 100 contractions or more over 48 hours. This will help in distributing
      the BOTOX within the muscles as well as recognition of the patient of the whereabouts of the
      muscles involved in vaginismus. During the first week, the patient will be instructed to
      attend dilatation sessions twice weekly in the clinic, in the presence of the husband, for 4
      weeks.  We use silicone dilators covered by lubricated condoms. We prepared the vaginal skin
      by Xylocaine gel as surface anaesthetic followed by the use K-Y jelly for lubrication of the
      dilators. The patient is introduced to the dilator and allowed to hold it in her hand, for
      size and feel, prior to its introduction into her vagina.  During each session the patient
      will be asked to lie down on the examination table, relax and feel comfortable. The husband
      may stand beside her and may hold her hand. After her approval, the husband will be allowed
      to follow the procedure visually to feel and understand what his wife will express of pain
      corresponding to each maneuver. This will be translated into understanding when they come to
      have real intercourse thereafter.  In the initial phase of the dilatation procedure we start
      with the appropriate size of the dilator according to the capacity of the introitus in each
      session, and increase the size gradually. We always start by the smaller size and move up
      size wise. At later sessions we allow the patient herself with its introduction into the
      vagina using only her tactile sense, with no visual aid or doctor instructions, covering her
      thighs with sheets to feel more private. She is asked to report the termination of the
      introduction or difficulties she is facing. In case of difficulty, the doctor does not offer
      to help and ask the patient to try on her own once more. This helps her to be proactive and
      gain control of the procedure. They usually succeed to carry on the procedure on their own.
      At home, the couple will be instructed not to shift to the larger size of the vaginal
      dilators except if she is comfortable with the smaller. The couple will be instructed not to
      have trials of intercourse before the patient uses dilator number 3 comfortably.
