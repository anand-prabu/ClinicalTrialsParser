      This pilot clinical trial studies how well computed tomography (CT) scans and biomarker
      analysis are able to diagnose coronary artery disease (CAD) in patients who have undergone a
      stem cell transplant but have no symptoms of CAD. Patients who have undergone a stem cell
      transplant are at an especially high risk for CAD, and current diagnostic tests are invasive
      and sometimes fail. A CT scan involves a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the
      body taken from different angles. The pictures are created by a computer linked to an x-ray
      machine. Studying samples of blood from patients who have undergone a stem cell transplant
      in the laboratory may help doctors identify and learn more about biomarkers related to CAD.
      Using a CT scan in combination with biomarker analysis may be a better and less-invasive way
      to diagnose CAD.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the feasibility of using CT-based imaging and blood biomarkers for assessment of
      asymptomatic coronary artery disease (CAD) in survivors of allogeneic hematopoietic stem
      cell transplant (HCT).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the prevalence and severity of asymptomatic CAD, as measured by CT angiography.

      II. Describe the association between patient demographics (age, sex, race/ethnicity),
      pre-HCT chest radiation, HCT-related exposures (total body irradiation [TBI], conditioning
      chemotherapy), graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) and its management and cardiovascular risk
      factors (CVRFs) on extent of CAD.

      III. Describe the association between asymptomatic CAD and candidate blood biomarkers of
      vessel injury and inflammation (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein [hs-CRP],
      lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 [Lp-PLA2]).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo cardiac CT and collection of blood samples for analysis of hs-CRP via
      quantitative immunoturbidimetry and Lp-PLA2 via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
