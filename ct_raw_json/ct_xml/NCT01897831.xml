  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the proposed study, the investigators plan to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      Piperacillin sodium and sulbactam sodium for injection (2:1) for the treatment of
      respiratory and urinary tract acute bacterial infection under the widely used in clinical
      conditions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Piperacillin sodium and sulbactam sodium for injection (2:1) plays a therapeutic role by the
      former inhibiting bacterial cell wall synthesis by irreversible competitive inhibition of
      β-lactamase. The antimicrobial effect of cefotaxime can be enhanced by the two combined. The
      compound specifically aims to the mechanism of bacterial resistance, extending the life of
      Piperacillin in the treatment-resistant pathogen infections.
