Whereas in pancreatitis various\n      vasoactive  and toxic for myocardium   substances  released, the cause of ST  segment\n      changes in cholecystitis  are discussed and includes tachycardia , vagal reflexes, changed\n      in plasma rennin activity resulted by distension of the gallbladder.\n\n      The  certain proportion of the patients with ECG changes actually didn't have coronary\n      artery disease(9,15) or other acute cardiac condition and therefore require treatment of the\n      underlie  illness only without spend the time for cardiac investigation or  special\n      treatment(1,3,4,7,8). Some kind of treatment may be even harmful for the patients with\n      abdominal illness such as thrombolytic, anticoagulant, aggressive antiaggregant therapy or\n      unnecessary cardiac catheterization.\n\n      In the medical literature the investigators found some case reports  and works about the ECG\n      changes in acute biliary disease in patient with knowing cardiac disease and without it, but\n      actually incidence of ECG changes that suggest but not represent an acute coronary illness\n      isn't knowing.\n\n      Therefore this is necessary to investigate actually incidence of ECG changes that mimic\n      acute coronary syndrome in acute cholecystitis and acute biliary disease and determined\n      clinical and laboratory characteristics that helps to differentiate this patients."
