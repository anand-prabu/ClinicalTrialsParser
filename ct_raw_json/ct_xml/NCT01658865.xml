      The purpose of this study is to assese esophageal motor function by simplified transnasal
      endoscopy compared with esophageal manometry.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Esophageal manometry is a gold standard for diagnosis of esophageal motility disorder.
      However, esophageal manometry can not detect non-occulsive contraction. Endoscopic
      evaulation of esophageal motility is difficult becausea swallowing is nearly impossible
      during endoscopy. Simplified trans nasal endoscopy (E.G. ScanTM, IntroMedic
      Co.,Ltd.)composed with dysplay system,controller,and disposable probe with compact size.

      The esophageal motor function will be assessed with both esophageal manometry and simplifed
      trnasnasal endoscopy in patients with esophageal motility disorder (such as achalasia) and
      healthy volunteer. The results of simplifed trnasnasal endoscopy is compared with the
      results of esophageal manometry.
