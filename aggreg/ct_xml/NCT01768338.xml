        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have undergone high-dose therapy and autologous PBSCT for treatment of
             CD20+ lymphoma.

          -  Patients must be between 2-6 months post-transplantation at the time of study
             registration.

          -  Patients must have at least stable disease (no overt progressive disease) at the time
             of study registration.

          -  Laboratory values must be within protocol specified ranges.

          -  Females of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test.

          -  Females of childbearing potential and males must use an effective method of
             contraception from the time of consent until at least 365 days following
             discontinuation of protocol therapy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient must not have obvious clinical progression of lymphoma after PBSCT as
             determined by the treating physician.

          -  Cannot be positive for hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis B core antibody or HIV
             antibody.

          -  No major or uncontrolled comorbid conditions as determined by the treating physician:
             history of ventricular arrhythmias requiring drug or device therapy; uncontrolled
             angina or symptomatic congestive heart failure; â€¢ severe or uncontrolled infection
             requiring systemic antibiotic or antifungal therapy or active hepatitis C infection;
             severe or uncontrolled psychiatric illness.

          -  No known leptomeningeal involvement by lymphoma or current metastatic brain disease.

          -  No Corrected QTc interval &gt; 480 msec.

          -  No known or suspected hypersensitivity to ofatumumab or SB-485232 that in the opinion
             of the investigator is a contraindication to their participation in the study.

          -  No systemic (oral or parenteral) corticosteroids within 14 days of study entry.

          -  Not receiving concurrent chemotherapy, biologic therapy, radiotherapy, or other
             investigational therapy.

          -  No previous treatment with SB-485232 or ofatumumab.

          -  No history of other malignancy except for adequately treated non-invasive cancers of
             the skin (basal or squamous cell) or carcinoma in situ of the uterine cervix.

          -  No diabetes mellitus with poor glycemic control (documented hemoglobin A1c &gt;7% within
             4 weeks prior to study entry).
