      This research is to determine the use of insulin pens compared to syringe and vial therapy
      in adults newly begun on insulin therapy during their hospital stay.  Patients will have no
      prior experience using insulin or other self-administered injectable medicine.  The study
      will examine which method of administering insulin reduces dosing errors, causes a lower
      incidence of low blood sugars, increases adherence to therapy and with which method patients
      are more satisfied.
