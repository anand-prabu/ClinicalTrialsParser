Participation included a\n      screening evaluation within 28 days before inpatient period, a 12 day inpatient period and\n      an end of study visit (ESV) 7 to 10 days after the discharge from the Unit.\n\n      The study design followed the recommendations of the CPMP/ICH/379/95 (ICH Topic E7) Note for\n      Guidance on Studies in Support of Special Populations: Geriatrics, namely in the inclusion\n      of subjects aged 65 years or older and contemplating single-dose and steady-state PK\n      profiles. As the primary endpoint of the study was to characterize the pharmacokinetic\n      profile of BIA 9-1067 and its metabolites in different parallel groups, there was no need to\n      implement blinding procedures or to include a control group. Consequently, the trial was an\n      open label study. Healthy subjects rather than patients with Parkinson's disease have been\n      chosen as the study population, due to the lack of over-toxicity of the drug and an\n      acceptable risk-benefit ratio. This allowed for a better interpretation of the study\n      results, as there were no confounding factors resulting from changes in disease state and or\n      concomitant medications.\n\n      The subjects were given a screening number after signing the informed consent by\n      chronological order of inclusion in each group (young/elderly)."
