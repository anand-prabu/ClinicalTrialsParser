            "textblock": "BACKGROUND: Articular cartilage repair in the knee is aimed at young patients with area(s)\n      of cartilage loss and no deformity of the knee. These patients aren't indicated for a knee\n      replacement. Articular cartilage repair leads to improvement of symptoms of pain, locking\n      and function. Traditionally, articular cartilage repair has always involved exposing the\n      entire knee joint with an arthrotomy. This, though effective, would lead to a large scar,\n      longer hospital stay, longer rehabilitation and its associated complications. Also, the use\n      of Bone Marrow Aspirate Cells (BMAC) for the purpose of cartilage repair has long been\n      debated with both sides having valid arguments and good surgical results.\n\n      RATIONALE: Both procedures in this study are performed in one stage, arthroscopically and as\n      day case procedures, which offers minimal scarring and quicker recovery. This automatically\n      confers a significant advantage over the traditional surgical techniques.\n\n      To correct the articular cartilage defect, the ACIC method requires autologous\n      Atellocollagen (a protein based structure), while the MCIC method uses concentrated BMAC\n      taken from the patient's iliac crest.\n\n      Both procedures have shown encouraging results in terms of pain relief, cartilage growth and\n      improved function. Since one technique utilises a protein based reagent and the other\n      involves mesenchymal cells, this study aims to ascertain if either technique is superior to\n      the other.\n\n      STUDY DESIGN: This study aims to compare two techniques of articular cartilage repair in the\n      knee, namely  Autologous Collagen Induced Chondrogenesis (ACIC) and Mesenchymal Cell Induced\n      Chondrogenesis (MCIC). The principal objective of  is to ascertain and assess the\n      superiority, if any, of either surgical technique over the other. The superiority will be\n      assessed with by the certain scoring systems (IKDC, KOOS, Lysholm and MOCART) measured pre-\n      and post-operatively.\n\n      Depending on which procedure the patient chooses to have, they will be allotted to either\n      the ACIC or the MCIC group. The patient is followed up in the clinic at the Spire Alexandra\n      Hospital at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year and 2 years following the surgery\n      and their progress is documented by questionnaires and clinical examination. MRI scans are\n      done at one and two years to assess the extent of cartilage growth.\n\n      SURGICAL TECHNIQUES\n\n      Autologous Collagen Induced Chondrogenesis (ACIC):\n\n      ACIC is a single stage arthroscopic procedure. It is done as a day case? procedure and the\n      patient is admitted a few hours before the procedure. The anaesthetic method depends is the\n      Anaesthesiologist's prerogative and depends on the patient's general health. Under sterile\n      conditions in an operating theatre, the arthroscopic instruments are introduced inside the\n      knee joint. As assessed previously by MRI scans, the area of cartilage defect is debrided by\n      curettage, shaving and burring and then microfractured. The ACIC method utilises autologous\n      Atellocollagen, a protein based structure, mixed with thrombin and fibrinogen to form a gel\n      which coats the area with a cartilage defect. The entry ports are then closed and the knee\n      is covered with a sterile dressing. The patient is  transferred to the surgical recovery\n      ward and, when medically stable, then transferred to their room on the ward.\n\n      After discharge from the hospital, the patient is advised partial weight bearing on the\n      operated leg for 6 weeks after the surgery. They also undergo 5 sessions of physiotherapy.\n      Surgical clips and sutures are removed at 2 weeks following the surgery.\n\n      Mesenchymal Cell Induced Chondrogenesis (MCIC):\n\n      MCIC is a single stage arthroscopic procedure. It is done as a day case? procedure and the\n      patient is admitted a few hours before the procedure. The anaesthetic method depends is the\n      Anaesthesiologist's prerogative and depends on the patient's general health. Under sterile\n      conditions in an operating theatre, the arthroscopic instruments are introduced inside the\n      knee joint. As assessed previously by MRI scans, the area of cartilage defect is debrided by\n      curettage, shaving and burring and then microfractured. The MCIC method involves aspiration\n      of Bone Marrow Aspirate Cells (BMAC) from the patient's iliac crest (hip bone) and\n      concentrating the cells by centrifugation in the operation theatre itself. The BMAC are then\n      mixed with thrombin and fibrinogen to form a gel which coats the area with a cartilage\n      defect.\n\n      After discharge from the hospital, the patient is advised partial weight bearing on the\n      operated leg for 6 weeks after the surgery. They also undergo 5 sessions of physiotherapy.\n      Surgical clips and sutures are removed at 2 weeks following the surgery."
