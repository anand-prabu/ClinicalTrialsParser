However, most research\n      focuses on the general elderly population and there is a serious lack of research into\n      elderly sufferers of Parkinson's disease (PD), who receive a substantial amount of attention\n      in medical circles. In the investigators previous study, the investigators have found that\n      patient with PD had decreased ability to cross the road as compared to age/gender matched\n      control subjects. Hence, this research proposed several training programs to enhance the\n      safety of crossing road, including safe place finding\uff0croadside search\uff0ctime gap and\n      perception of other's intentions. The investigators will compare the parameters of crossing\n      road ability before and after training programs in patients with PD and control subjects.\n\n      The results of this research will clarify the correlation between medical scale test\n      indicators and movement safety for patients with PD. The effects of training programs will\n      be provided for further safety management and design concepts to improve the lives of this\n      disease group."

Response time was measured in the simulated traffic situation and was defined as the time between starting the visual situation and the participant pressing the response button to decide to cross the road.
