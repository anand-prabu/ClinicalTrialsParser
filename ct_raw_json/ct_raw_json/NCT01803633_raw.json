Upon arrival participants will fill out a questionnaire about their\n      dietary and medication intakes and  physical activity for the past 72 hours to ensure\n      compliance. Compliant participants' weight and blood pressure will be measured and a fasting\n      blood draw will be taken before participants consume their test meal (cheese or non-dairy\n      cheese substitute). Participants will only consume this test meal and water freely for the\n      duration of the test day. Blood will be drawn serially at 1, 3 and 6 hours postprandially.\n      Participants will be tested on a second test day two weeks after the first test.\n\n      On the second test day, participants' body composition and bone mineral density will be\n      measured by dual x-ray absorptiometry."
