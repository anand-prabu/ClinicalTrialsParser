The three\n      delivery systems are: moistened tablet, suppository or cream.  Additionally the study will\n      compare the side effects and absorption of vaginal diazepam with oral diazepam.  Vaginal\n      diazepam is used off-label vaginally to relax pelvic floor muscles and reduce pelvic pain\n      caused from pelvic floor dysfunction."
