Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor\n      cells. Combining more than one chemotherapy drug with radiation therapy may kill more tumor\n      cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy, surgery, and\n      radiation therapy in treating children who have advanced soft tissue sarcoma."

Assess the response to vincristine/ifosfamide/doxorubicin (VID) with\n      granulocyte colony-stimulating factor support in children with newly diagnosed, inoperable\n      or metastatic non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcomas. II. Estimate the 2-year and\n      event-free survival rates in children treated with VID plus radiotherapy and/or surgery.\n      III. Establish a bank of frozen tumor and peripheral blood tissue for use in further\n      molecular studies.\n\n      OUTLINE: The following acronyms are used: DOX Doxorubicin, NSC-123127 G-CSF Granulocyte\n      Colony-Stimulating Factor (Amgen), NSC-614629 IFF Ifosfamide, NSC-109724 Mesna\n      Mercaptoethane sulfonate, NSC-113891 VCR Vincristine, NSC-67574 VID VCR/IFF/DOX Induction:\n      3-Drug Combination Chemotherapy. VID. Local Control: Surgery and/or Radiotherapy plus 3-Drug\n      Combination Chemotherapy. Excision of the primary tumor and pulmonary metastases; and/or\n      irradiation of the primary tumor and pulmonary metastases using x-rays or Co60 beam energies\n      of at least 4 MV (electrons or iridium-192 implant allowed for boost); plus VID.\n      Continuation: 3-Drug Combination Chemotherapy. VID.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be entered over 2.7 years if there are at\n      least 7 responses in the first 20 patients."
