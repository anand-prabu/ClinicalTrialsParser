      Objective: A traumatic brain injury (TBI) places individuals at high risk for developing
      posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). TBIs account for the onset of PTSD in approximately
      700,000 Americans each year. Depression and post-concussive syndrome (PCS) are also common
      and often comorbid with PTSD. However, even in this group, there is a high-level of
      inter-individual response to traumatic brain injuries, suggesting that a better
      understanding of the mechanisms underlying this risk would be of great value in directing
      preventive interventions. The reasons for this heterogeneity are undoubtedly
      multi-factorial, and involve a complex interplay between genetic and environmental factors,
      that we may be able to understand through peripheral biomarkers and central examination of
      neuronal functioning. We suggest that DNA methylation may be a putative biomarker of
      psychiatric risk, as it reflects long-term changes in the function of the gene and may shape
      the recovery ability of the TBI patient through changes in cell function. In addition,
      differential proteomic response, including the function of the neuroendocrine system, likely
      relates to changes from epigenetic modification in both neurons and immune cells, which may
      contribute to the risk for the onset of PTSD as well as depression and PCS. We have
      previously shown that both PTSD and depression are associated with endocrine alterations,
      leading us to question if this biological change may underlie vulnerability for the onset of
      PTSD as well as depression and PCS following a TBI. In support of the idea of shared
      vulnerability, patients with a TBI also often display endocrine function alterations. In
      addition, sleep disturbance is common following TBI and is a core symptom of PTSD depression
      and PCS, suggesting that sleep may contribute to psychiatric and neurological recovery from
      a TBI. This line of research is essential, as current treatments to prevent or treat
      psychiatric risk following TBI are often ineffective,  and even treatment of PCS is limited.
      This poor understanding results in our limited ability to reduce the risk for compromises in
      the health and well-being of patients who sustain a TBI.

      Study population: Participants with a moderate or mild TBI (n=100) will be followed for a
      period of one year.

      Design: This is a natural history study that will recruit patients within 30 days of a
      mild/moderate TBI, and will follow them over a one year period, with follow-up at 1, 3, 6
      and 12 months following the TBI.  Biological profiles including the concentration of
      inflammatory proteins and neuropeptides, and DNA methylation will be examined. An optional
      structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and a hydrocortisone
      stimulation test will be used to evaluate the role of neuronal and neuroendocrine
      functioning following TBI.

      Outcome measures: The primary outcomes of interest are the biological changes that occur
      following TBI which are associated with the onset of psychiatric disorders of PTSD, and
      depression, as well as the onset of PCS. The secondary aim is to examine neuronal mechanisms
      that underlie the risks for these disorders through the use of fMRI. Additional aims will
      determine the role of psychological resilience traits in recovery and also how sleep relates
      to recovery and psychiatric risk.
