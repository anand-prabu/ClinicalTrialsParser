            "textblock": "Uveal melanoma is the most common primary malignancy of the eye and is one of the few fatal\n      diseases that are detected initially through an eye examination. For many years, clinical\n      decision-making regarding which patient with uveal melanoma required treatment has been\n      based solely on clinical features observed at the time of diagnosis. These features include:\n      tumor size as measured by ultrasound, associated subretinal fluid, presence of orange\n      lipofuscin pigment, lack of drusen, posterior location, and ciliary body involvement. All of\n      these clinical features have been demonstrated to be associated with tumor growth which is\n      associated with the eventual development of metastases. However, these clinical features are\n      not adequately sensitive or specific enough to predict which patients will develop\n      metastases.\n\n      More recently, researchers studying the genomics of uveal melanoma have focused on\n      identifying genetic abnormalities present in tumor tissue in order to characterize these\n      lesions more fully. Several landmark papers over the past 15 years have reported cytogenic\n      and genomic abnormalities in uveal melanoma tumor tissue that are associated with a poorer\n      prognosis. Although rare, there have been at least five cases in which patients undergoing\n      biopsy of these lesions have developed extraocular spread of melanoma from the biopsy sites.\n      With this new technique, the possible rate of extraocular spread should be lower, making the\n      biopsy a safer technique than what is currently in practice."
