Combining more than one drug and giving them in different ways\n      may kill more tumor cells. It is not yet known which chemotherapy regimen is most effective\n      for colorectal cancer that has spread to the liver.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy\n      with or without isolated hepatic perfusion with melphalan in treating patients who have\n      colorectal cancer that has spread to the liver."

Patients are stratified according to prior chemotherapy\n      for liver metastasis (yes vs no) and percentage of hepatic replacement (less than 25% vs at\n      least 25%). All patients undergo laparotomy to determine final eligibility. Eligible\n      patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients undergo hyperthermic isolated hepatic perfusion with melphalan over 60\n           minutes. Patients then undergo placement of an intrahepatic pump or port. At 6 weeks\n           post hepatic perfusion, patients receive systemic chemotherapy comprising irinotecan IV\n           over 90 minutes on day 1 followed by fluorouracil IV over 15 minutes and leucovorin\n           calcium (CF) IV over 15 minutes on days 1-3. Patients receive local chemotherapy\n           comprising floxuridine (FUDR) and CF by hepatic arterial infusion (HAI) continuously on\n           days 14-28.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients undergo placement of an intrahepatic pump or port at laparotomy. At 7\n           days post laparotomy, patients receive FUDR and CF by HAI continuously for 14 days.\n           Beginning 2 weeks after completion of HAI, patients receive systemic and local\n           chemotherapy as in arm I.\n\n      Treatment with combined systemic and local chemotherapy repeats every 35 days for a maximum\n      of 6 courses. Treatment with local chemotherapy alone repeats every 28 days for a maximum of\n      6 additional courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, postoperatively, every third course of\n      chemotherapy, every 3 months for 2 years, and then every 6 months thereafter.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 168 patients (84 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this\n      study within 54 months."
