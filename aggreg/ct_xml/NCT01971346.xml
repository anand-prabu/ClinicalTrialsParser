      The purpose of this study is to determine the relationship between two types of cell signals
      (type I IFN and TNF) in psoriatic skin prior to and during treatment with etanercept and
      correlate that information with the degree of the improvement in the psoriasis.

      Hypothesis: The balance between type I IFN and TNF determines the response to anti-TNF
      treatment. The goal of the proposed study is to address this hypothesis and demonstrate that
      the strength of the type I IFN signature in psoriatic skin is the major determinant of the
      clinical response to anti-TNF treatment.

      Purpose: Determine the strength of the type I interferon and TNF signal in psoriatic skin
      prior to and during treatment with etanercept and correlate with degree of clinical
      improvement.

      Study Population: up to 50 subjects, men or women over the age of 18 with clinically stable
      plaque psoriasis, who meet the wash out requirements and other exclusion criteria

      Psoriatic patients will receive 100 mg etanercept per week (2 separate single-use pre-filled
      50 mg subcutaneous injections taken on two separate days) for 3 months.

      Procedures: Urine pregnancy test, TB test, photography, Physical Examinations, Skin
      Examinations, Study Drug, Peripheral blood and biopsies

      Anticipated Results: We expect that patients with strong IFN-α signature in psoriatic skin
      along with weak TNF-α signature will have minimal response to anti-TNF treatment, while
      patients with the opposite pattern, weak IFN and strong TNF signature, will have significant
      clinical improvement.

    <description>Change in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score from baseline to week 12 will be calculated. The PASI Score will range from 0-72 at each timepoint. A cumulative score reflecting change in PASI during the course of etanercept treatment will be calculated for each patient. This score will then be treated as a continuous response variable, and we will use robust linear modeling to test whether scores are significantly associated with baseline TNF-α signal, baseline IFN-α signal, and/or an interaction between these two signals.</description>

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Strength of TNF-alpha and IFN-alpha signatures will be measured in blood and skin of study subjects at initiation, during and after treatment.  The TNF and IFN signals scores are arbitrary parameters calculated from the proportion and fold changes of TNF and IFN specific genes that are differentially expressed in psoriatic skin.  These scores are represented as a ratio.  The values can range from 0 to infinite but most fall within a range of 0.25 and 10-fold.The strength of these signals in skin will be done using bioinformatic approach quantifying transcriptional signature of these cytokines whereas blood-derived values will be based on serum concentration of these two cytokines.  The strength of the cytokine signals in blood and skin will be treated as a response variable in a univariate repeated measure analysis of variance, with PASI response profile and time as covariates</description>
