The first part of the study (Part 1) is a dose\n      escalation study of a 21-day regimen of IV Oxaliplatin in combination with weekly IV\n      PEG-BCT-100 2.7 mg/kg and oral Capecitabine 1000 mg/m2 twice per day for 14 days. There are\n      3 successive treatment cohorts in dose level of 85 mg/m2, 100 mg/m2 and 130 mg/m2 for\n      Oxaliplatin. Subsequent treatment cohort is opened only after all patients in the previous\n      cohort have completed the first 3 cycles of PACOX. The first patient entered the study is\n      started at Cohort 1. At least three subjects will be treated at this cohort and observed for\n      dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). If one of the three treated patients develops DLT at any dose\n      level, three additional patients are to be entered at the same dose level. The dose of\n      Oxaliplatin will be escalated if no DLT for the first three patients or one of the six\n      treated patients develops a DLT. If two or more of the three/six patients at a given dose\n      level experienced a DLT, dose escalation is stopped and the previous dose level is declared\n      the MTD (recommended dose) of PACOX regimen for the second part of the study (Part 2). If\n      the first three patients in Cohort 3 do not develop a DLT, an additional three patients will\n      be enrolled in Cohort 3. If one or less than one patient in Cohort 3 has developed a DLT.\n      the dose level is declared as the MTD.\n\n      Toxicity will be assessed through physical examination and vital signs findings, safety\n      laboratory tests results, and graded by the NCI CTCAE (version 4.0).\n\n      Part 2: Patients receive the recommended dose of PACOX regimen as defined in Part 1. A\n      14-day screening period followed by a treatment period consisting of 3-week treatment\n      cycles. Patients will be treated until disease progression or intolerable toxicity. The\n      treatment period will end by a follow up visit at 30 days after the last dose of trial\n      treatment. After the study treatment, patients will be follow-up every 8 weeks for survival\n      status or until study termination.\n\n      Patients in both parts of the study will receive PACOX regimen until disease progression,\n      intolerable toxicity, death or patients withdraw consent. The clinical effects of PACOX\n      regimen on tumor response will be evaluated. Tumour assessment which is based on RECIST 1.1\n      criteria will be performed until disease progression."
