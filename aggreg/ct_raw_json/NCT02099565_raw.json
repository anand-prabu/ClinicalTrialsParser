In\n      addition, such project implementation will allow to clarify the treatment options used by\n      Russian patients with CAD (Coronary Artery Disease) after drug-eluting stent implantation.\n      The information received in this study will help to optimize management of Russian patients\n      with CAD after PCI in order to improve prognosis and quality of life of these patients."

This is an observational\n      retro-prospective study based on the data collected during one visit: 4-year after PCI\n      performed at the Russian Cardiological Research Center (\u0420\u041a\u041d\u041f\u041a). From the date of the study\n      start and until the end of the study investigators will enroll those patients participated\n      in OPTIMA study. Only patients, who consent to participate in the study and sign the\n      informed consent form after being informed by a physician on the objectives and methods of\n      the study, will be enrolled into this project.\n\n      This study is an observational one, and there is no intervention into routine clinical\n      practice either in terms of therapy, or special examinations. The main point of this project\n      is the data collection using the out-patient medical records or disease history of a\n      patient, as well as collection of data received during patient routine examination. Data\n      collection will be performed only once during single routine patient visit to treating\n      physician or hospitalized patient examination. Study participation will be finished after\n      this visit. Data collection will be performed at the visit 4 years after PCI and will\n      include medical history, current medications, physical examination, ECG (electrocardiogram)\n      and laboratory assessments.\n\n      The study will be conducted in Russian Federation. It is planned that 80-90% of patients\n      participated in OPTIMA study will be enrolled into current project. One clinical site -\n      Russian Cardiological Research Center (\u0420\u041a\u041d\u041f\u041a) - is supposed to participate in this study.\n\n      The total period of the study is anticipated to be about 18 months."
