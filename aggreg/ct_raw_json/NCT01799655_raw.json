Therefore,  there is an increasing interest to explore\n      the mechanism in which vitamin D deficiency affect the cardiovascular system.\n\n      The investigators want to examine the relationship between serum vitamin D levels and the\n      coagulation status in the subjects. The applied the calibrated automated thrombogram (CAT)\n      to assess thrombin generation in plasma as a measure of overall thrombotic activity, and\n      thus to suggest a mechanism that may explain the link between vitamin D deficiency and\n      cardiovascular disease.\n\n      Our study population are going to include 100 patients from the internal departments in Emek\n      hospital, who present with chest pain but without acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The\n      investigators will take blood samples from the subjects to measure the serum vitamin D\n      levels and the generation of thrombin. The patients will be divided into four groups\n      according to the level of vitamin D to evaluate the effect of vitamin D levels in the blood\n      on coagulability and thrombotic activity in these patients."
