  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to find out what eating meals in a short time period
      early in the day (time-restricted feeding) versus eating meals spread out during the day
      (grazing) does to the body's ability to control blood sugar and to the health of its blood
      vessels.

      The investigators hypothesize that time-restricted feeding will be more effective at
      improving glucose tolerance and vascular condition (inflammation and micro- and
      macro-vascular function) than grazing.

      Each participant will eat according to one of the two eating schedules (grazing or
      time-restricted feeding) for 5 weeks, have a 7-week washout period, and then eat according
      to the other eating schedule for 5 weeks.  Measurements of glucose homeostasis and vascular
      condition will be performed before and after a participant follows each eating schedule.
