The sample consisted of 66 patients in preoperative of cardiac surgery, who were\n      divided in three groups: empathic behaviour  by nurses, without specific empathic behaviour\n      and by family. Anxiety was assessed at two time points: before and after the intervention.\n      The instrument used was developed and validated, comprising 19 defining characteristics of\n      the nursing diagnosis anxiety. The hypothesis is that the group who received empathic\n      behaviour from nurse or family will reduce the anxiety."
