    <textblock>
      The purpose of this investigational study is to retrospectively collect respiratory viral
      clinical samples, conduct standard of care comparator testing and archive the collected
      residual samples for future testing in order to establish the clinical performance
      characteristics of the investigational instrument.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The specimen is a nasopharyngeal swab.

          -  The specimen is from a pediatric or adult male or female subject who is either
             hospitalized, admitted to a hospital emergency department, visiting an outpatient
             clinic or resident of a long term care facility.

          -  The specimen is from a patient exhibiting clinical signs and symptoms of respiratory
             tract infection such as fever, sore throat, shortness of breath, bronchitis,
             bronchiolitis, and pneumonia.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The specimen is not a nasopharyngeal swab.

          -  The specimen is from an individual who does not exhibit clinical signs and symptoms
