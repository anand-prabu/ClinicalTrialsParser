This latter will be performed in\n      accordance to current practice.\n\n      Tolerance data (pain and satisfaction) will be collected just after the infiltration and\n      eventual complications will be reported within 48 hours after infiltration.\n\n      Following treatment of lombosciatic will be realized through hospitalization, as usual.\n\n      Scan is a safe, non invasive, painless and non radiating exam. It is the extension of the\n      musculoskeletal clinical exam and it has already changed our rheumatology practices. The\n      investigators hope at the end of this study, that results would confirm that scan can be a\n      help in practice to perform epidural infiltrations."
