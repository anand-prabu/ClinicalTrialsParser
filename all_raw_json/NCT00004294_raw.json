Patients may receive up to 4\n      transplants if a deficient glucocerebrosidase level is found in peripheral leukocytes 1\n      month following transplantation.\n\n      The G-CSF-stimulated PBSC are enriched for CD34-positive stem cells and transduced with the\n      R-GC vector.  Stem cells with normal gene activity are selected for transplantation.\n\n      Patients are followed every month for 6 months, every 6 months for 18 months, and then\n      annually thereafter."
