LCT is radiation, surgery, or both.  If you are assigned to the LCT group,\n      the study doctor will decide if you will have radiation alone, surgery alone, or radiation\n      combined with surgery.\n\n      Group 2 will receive delayed or no LCT after induction chemotherapy.  The treatment you\n      receive will depend on what the study doctor thinks is in your best interest.\n\n      Group 1 - Immediate Local Consolidation Therapy (LCT):\n\n      Each study cycle is 6 weeks, but may vary if your doctor thinks it is in your best interest.\n\n      Surgery:\n\n      You will be given a separate consent form to sign that describes the surgical procedure and\n      its risks in more detail.  The type of surgery you will have will depend on the status of\n      the disease.\n\n      Radiation Therapy:\n\n      About 1-2 weeks before you begin radiation therapy, you will have a procedure called a\n      simulation.  During the simulation, the exact location for the radiation therapy will be\n      planned.  The simulation procedure takes about 1 hour.\n\n      You will receive radiation daily (Monday through Friday) for a period lasting from 1 day up\n      to 8 weeks, depending on the location and status of the disease.  The radiation only takes a\n      few minutes to administer each day.  However, you will be asked to allow about 1 hour each\n      day for the procedure.\n\n      You will be given a separate consent form to sign that describes the radiation therapy and\n      its risks in more detail.  The type of radiation therapy you will have will depend on the\n      status of the disease.\n\n      Group 2 - Delayed/No Local Consolidation Therapy (LCT):\n\n      If you are in Group 2, you will not be receiving surgery or radiation therapy right after\n      induction chemotherapy.  If you are randomized to this arm, you will receive either systemic\n      therapy (i.e. chemotherapy) or observation.  The care you receive will depend on what your\n      doctor thinks is in your best interest.\n\n      Chemotherapy:\n\n      Each study cycle is 6 weeks, but may vary if your doctor thinks it is in your best interest.\n\n      If you receive chemotherapy, either after your 4-6 cycles of induction chemotherapy is\n      complete or after receiving LCT, your treating physician will decide the type of\n      chemotherapy you will receive.\n\n      You will be given a separate consent form to sign that describes the chemotherapy and  its\n      risks in more detail.  The type of chemotherapy you will have will depend on the status of\n      the disease.\n\n      Study Visits:\n\n      If the study doctor thinks it is needed, the following tests and procedures may be performed\n      before and/or during chemotherapy and/or radiation:\n\n        -  A physical exam will be performed, including measurement of your vital signs.\n\n        -  Your performance status will be recorded.\n\n        -  Your medical history will be recorded.\n\n        -  You will be asked about any side effects you may be having.\n\n        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.\n\n      During chemotherapy, if the study doctor thinks it is needed, you may also have a computed\n      tomography (CT) scan, positron emission tomography (PET) scan, and/or magnetic resonance\n      imaging (MRI) scan to check the status of the disease.  These imaging scans will be done\n      about every 6-8 weeks during the first year of the study to check the status of the disease.\n\n      Length of Treatment:\n\n      You may continue receiving the study treatment for up to 2 years or as long as the doctor\n      thinks it is in your best interest.  You will no longer be able to receive the study\n      treatment if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable\n      to follow study directions.\n\n      Your participation on the study will be over after the follow-up visits.\n\n      Follow-Up Visits:\n\n      All study participants will have follow-up visits after the surgery is complete, or after\n      the last dose of radiation or chemotherapy, depending on which treatment you were assigned\n      to.  During each follow-up visit, you may have the following tests and procedures performed\n      if the study doctor thinks it is needed:\n\n        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs (blood\n           pressure, heart rate, temperature, and breathing rate).\n\n        -  Your performance status will be recorded.\n\n        -  Your medical history will be recorded.\n\n        -  You will be asked about any side effects you may be having.\n\n        -  You will have lung function tests to check the status of the disease.\n\n        -  You will have a CT scan to check the status of the disease.\n\n        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.\n\n        -  Your oxygen level will be measured using a small device that is placed on the tip of\n           your finger.\n\n      This is an investigational study.  The combination of LCT after chemotherapy for the\n      treatment of NSCLC is being used for research purposes only.\n\n      Up to 94 patients will take part in this study.  Up to 55 will be enrolled at MD Anderson."

Concurrent chemoradiation is permitted as consolidative therapy. The following\n             concurrent therapies are permitted: Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (i.e. erlotinib) - can\n             be delivered with both hypofractionated >/=3 Gy per fraction) and standard\n             fractionated radiation therapy (<3 Gy per fraction); platinum-based chemotherapy -\n             standard fractionated radiation therapy (<3 Gy per fraction)\n\n         13.

Up-front treatment to central nervous system lesions, such as the brain or spine\n             (prior to first line systemic therapy), or symptomatic lesions requiring urgent\n             palliative radiation, is permitted, in which case the patient would be randomized to\n             treatment of other metastatic sites or the primary sites (based on the disease\n             remaining after first-line treatment).
