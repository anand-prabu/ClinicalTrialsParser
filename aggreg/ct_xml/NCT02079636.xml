    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of the study drug known as
      LY2835219 in combination with another anti-cancer drug in participants with NSCLC that is
      advanced or has spread to other parts of the body (stage IV). The study will also
      investigate how the body processes the combination treatment and how the study drug affects
      the body. The study will also collect disease-related symptoms and participant-reported pain
      related to NSCLC.

             received more than three prior therapies for NSCLC. The participant must not have
             received prior treatment with a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK) inhibitor.
