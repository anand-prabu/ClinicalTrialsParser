Determine the response rate and duration of response to fludarabine combined\n      with octreotide and to octreotide alone in patients with relapsed indolent non-Hodgkin's\n      lymphoma. II. Determine serum insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and IGF-1 binding protein\n      levels before and after treatment in this patient population. III. Determine somatostatin\n      receptor subtypes in lymphoma biopsy samples from selected patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients receive fludarabine IV over 10-30 minutes on days 1-5. Patients not\n      currently receiving octreotide, receive a test dose of octreotide subcutaneously on day 1\n      during course 1 only and then receive octreotide intramuscularly monthly on day 1. Treatment\n      repeats every 28 days for 4-6 courses. Patients then receive octreotide alone for 6-8\n      courses. Some patients may then receive another 12 courses of octreotide alone, for a total\n      of 2 years of treatment. Patients are followed every 3 months for 5 years or until disease\n      progression.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 23-34 patients will be accrued for this study within 1.5\n      years."
