  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Main Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants from other BAX 855 studies can be provided with the continuation study
             informed consent form (ICF) prior to the end of study visit to review and consider
             participation in this continuation study. These participants will complete any
             additional screening assessments within 2 weeks of the previous study's end of study
             visit and will return to the study site within 6 weeks of the previous study end of
             study visit to confirm eligibility for this continuation study.

          -  BAX 855 naïve participants who are ≥ 12 years of age can only be enrolled in this
             continuation study after enrollment in the phase 2/3 pivotal study is closed. BAX 855
             naïve participants who are &lt; 12 years of age and in countries where the pediatric PTP
             study is being conducted can only be enrolled in this continuation study after
             enrollment in the pediatric PTP study is closed.

          -  Participants coming from other BAX 855 studies into the continuation study, will be
             considered enrolled only after they have completed all procedures and assessments at
             the End of Study Visit in the previous BAX 855 study

          -  Participant and/or legal representative has/have voluntarily provided signed informed
             consent

          -  Participant is from 0 to 75 years of age at screening

          -  Participant is male with severe hemophilia A (Factor VIII (FVIII) clotting activity &lt;
             1%) as confirmed by central laboratory at screening (after at least a 72-hour washout
             period) or a documented FVIII clotting activity &lt;1% (confirmation is only required
             for BAX 855 naïve participants)

          -  Participant has been previously treated with plasma-derived FVIII concentrates or
             recombinant FVIII for ≥150 documented exposure days (EDs)

          -  Participant is currently receiving prophylaxis or on-demand therapy with FVIII

          -  Participant has a Karnofsky or Lansky performance score of ≥ 60.

          -  Participant is human immunodeficiency virus negative (HIV-); or HIV+ with stable
             disease and CD4+ count ≥ 200 cells/mm^3, as confirmed by central laboratory at
             screening.

          -  Participant is hepatitis C virus negative (HCV-) by antibody or PCR testing (if
             positive, antibody titer will be confirmed by PCR), as confirmed by central
             laboratory at screening; or HCV+ with chronic stable hepatitis.

          -  Participant is willing and able to comply with the requirements of the protocol

        Main Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant has detectable FVIII inhibitory antibodies (≥ 0.4 Bethesda unit (BU)
             using the Nijmegen modification of the Bethesda assay) as confirmed by central
             laboratory at screening.

          -  Participant has history of FVIII inhibitory antibodies (≥ 0.4 BU using the Nijmegen
             modification of the Bethesda assay or ≥ 0.6 BU using the Bethesda assay) at any time
             prior to screening.

          -  Participant has been diagnosed with an inherited or acquired hemostatic defect other
             than hemophilia A (eg, qualitative platelet defect or von Willebrand's disease).

          -  Participant has known hypersensitivity towards mouse or hamster proteins,
             polyethylene glycol (PEG), or Tween 80.

          -  Participant has severe chronic hepatic dysfunction.

          -  Participant has severe renal impairment.

          -  Participant has current or recent (&lt;30 days) use of other PEGylated drugs prior to
             study participation or scheduled use of such drugs during study participation.

          -  Participant has participated in another clinical study involving an investigational
             product (IP) other than BAX 855 or device within 30 days prior to enrollment or is
             scheduled to participate in another clinical study involving an IP or investigational
             device during the course of this study.

          -  Participant has medical, psychiatric, or cognitive illness or recreational
             drug/alcohol use that, in the opinion of the investigator, would affect participant
             safety or compliance.

          -  Participant is a family member or employee of the investigator.
