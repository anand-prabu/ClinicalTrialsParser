  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, Phase 1/2 study.  The study will evaluate the tolerability, safety
      and activity of AMG 337 in Asian subjects who have advanced solid tumors (Phase 1) or
      subjects with MET amplified tumors with a focus on gastric/gastroesophageal
      junction/esophageal adenocarcinoma (Phase 2).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1/2, multicenter, single arm, open-label study to assess the safety,
      efficacy and pharmacokinetics of AMG 337 in solid tumors.  In the Phase 1, approximately 3
      to 27 subjects enrolled in a 3+3+3 dose escalation scheme evaluating two dose levels.  In
      the Phase 2, approximately 140 subjects will be enrolled to either Cohort 1 (subjects with
      MET amplified /gastroesophageal junction/esophageal (G/GEJ/E) adenocarcinoma with measurable
      tumor) or Cohort 2 (subjects with MET amplified solid tumors with measurable tumor and
      subjects with MET amplified G/GEJ/E adenocarcinoma with non-measurable tumor).  All subjects
      will sel-administer AMG 337 daily until disease progression or other protocol specified end
      of treatment criteria are met.  Tumor assessment by RECIST 1.1 will be followed during study
      treatment.

      Tumor tissue, biomarkers, pharmacokinetics and Patient Reported Outcomes will be assessed.

             which the subjects have received prior therapy for advanced disease, for which no
             standard therapy exists, or the subject refuses standard therapy.

          -  Phase 2: Subjects must have a pathologically confirmed, advanced G/GEJ/E
             adenocarcinoma (cohort 1) or other solid tumor (cohort 2) for which the subjects have

             or the subject refuses standard therapy.

          -  Tumor MET amplified by protocol-specified centralized testing (phase 2 only).

          -  Phase 1: Measurable or non-measurable disease per RECIST v1.1

          -  Phase 2: Measurable disease per RECIST v1.1 guidelines. Cohort 2 may include

             dependent upon jejunostomy for feeding. Significant gastrointestinal disorder(s) that
             in the opinion of the Investigator may influence drug absorption.

          -  Currently receiving any anti-tumor treatments, or less than 14 days prior to
