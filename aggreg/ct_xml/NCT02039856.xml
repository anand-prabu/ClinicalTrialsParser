  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      VA has undertaken a major initiative to transform care through implementation of Patient
      Aligned Care Teams (PACTs).  Based on the patient-centered medical home (PCMH) concept, PACT
      aims to improve access, continuity, coordination and comprehensiveness using team-based care
      that is patient-driven and patient-centered.  However, how VA should adapt PACT to meet the
      needs of special populations, such as women Veterans, is yet to be worked out.  The main
      goal of this study is to develop and test an evidence-based quality improvement (EBQI)
      approach to adapting and implementing PACT for women Veterans, incorporating comprehensive
      women's health care in gender-sensitive care environments, thereby accelerating achievement
      of PACT tenets for women Veterans and reducing persistent gender disparities in VA quality
      of care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Women Veterans' numerical minority in VA healthcare settings has created logistical
      challenges to delivering gender-sensitive comprehensive services.  These challenges have
      only grown as more women Veterans have enrolled in VA care. Access and quality have lagged
      behind that of male Veterans, while gender sensitivity, including adequate attention to
      privacy/safety and awareness of women's military roles and experiences, is often lacking.
      On-site availability of gender-specific services has also not kept pace, with women Veterans
      more likely to be outsourced for gender-specific care now than they were ten years ago.
      Further, while the proportion of VA facilities having women's health (WH) clinics has
      increased, prior research has demonstrated that as many as 40% of them were not delivering
      comprehensive primary care services, instead focusing only on gender-specific exams.  Lack
      of gender-sensitive, comprehensive care for women has also been associated with measurable
      decrements in women's ratings of VA access, continuity and coordination, as well as measures
      of technical quality.

      We aim to assess the effectiveness of evidence-based quality improvement (EBQI) methods for
      developing a WH PACT model using a cluster randomized trial design (Aim #1); examine impacts
      of receipt of WH-PACT concordant care on women Veterans' outcomes (Aim #2); evaluate
      processes of EBQI-supported WH-PACT implementation (Aim #3); and develop implementation and
      evaluation tools for use in EBQI-supported WH-PACT model adaptation, implementation,
      sustainability and spread to additional VA facilities (Aim #4).

      EBQI is a systematic approach to developing a multi-level research-clinical partnership
      approach to engaging local organizational senior leaders and quality improvement teams in
      adapting and implementing new care models in the context of prior evidence, local practice
      context, and provider behavior change methods, with researchers providing technical support
      and practice facilitation.  In a cluster randomized trials, we will evaluate WH-PACT model
      achievement using patient, provider and practice surveys.  We will examine intermediate
      changes in provider, staff and team knowledge and attitudes.  Using analyses of secondary
      administrative and performance data, we will also explore impacts of receipt of WH-PACT care
      on quality of chronic disease care and prevention, health status, utilization and costs.
      Using mixed methods, we will assess pre-post EBQI practice context; document WH-PACT
      implementation; and examine barriers/facilitators to EBQI-supported WH-PACT implementation
      through a combination of semi-structured interviews and monthly formative progress
      narratives and administrative data review.
