Recent national\n      goals have established that approximately 65% of all dialysis access points should be\n      arteriovenous fistulas due to higher patency rates and decreased rates of further surgeries.\n      Multiple studies have been done to assess optimal suture technique for arteriovenous\n      anastomoses. The use of clips versus a handsewn technique has been evaluated in\n      retrospective studies with some reports indicating a higher primary patency rate with a clip\n      technique.  Further study is needed to definitively determine the technique that results in\n      the highest patency rates and lowest rate of re-operation. The purpose of this study is to\n      determine whether hand-sewn anastomosis versus a clipped technique is associated with more\n      complications, failures, surgical cost and surgical time by randomizing patients to either a\n      clipped anastomosis group or a handsewn anastomosis group."
