      The potential participants will be informed of the study details, including the study
      objectives. Once they have read the study information sheet and have a good understanding of
      the study, those who intend to participate in the study will be asked to sign the consent
      form for this study. There are 2 groups of participants: MSM who seek HIV voluntary
      counseling and testing service (phase I) and MSM who meet nPEP criteria (phase II).

      Phase I. MSM who seek HIV voluntary counseling and testing

        1. All MSM clients will be interviewed to complete the questionnaires designed to collect
           information for this study before the pre-test counseling. The questions will collect
           demographic data and data regarding HIV risk behaviors, HIV knowledge, intention to
           take nPEP, factors affecting the intention to take nPEP, experience on nPEP use, and
           awareness of nPEP.

        2. After MSM clients receive the counseling. They will be interviewed to answer the
           questionnaires about HIV knowledge, intention to take nPEP, factor affecting to
           intention to take nPEP, nPEP knowledge.

        3. All MSM clients will receive pre-test counseling, HIV testing, and post-test counseling
           according to the standard of care at the Anonymous Clinic, TRC-ARC. Counselors will
           also assess clients for nPEP eligibility criteria according to the standard clinic
           guidelines.

      Phase II. MSM who receive nPEP

        1. Participant who describes a history of an HIV risk exposure within the preceding 72
           hours and meets nPEP eligibility criteria as assessed by the clinic counselor. After
           participants receive all information to know whether they receive antiretroviral
           medication, they can decide by themselves about taking medication. The participant who
           select to take nPEP will receive a 14-day supply of nPEP medication and will be
           scheduled back to receive the rest of their medication.

        2. Both participant who decide to take and not take nPEP will be asked to take part in the
           in-depth interviews to examine factors affecting the decision to use nPEP.

        3. At week 6, the participants who take nPEP will be evaluated for HIV infection,
           adherence to medication during the 28-day course of nPEP, side effects from nPEP and
           asked to be interviewed about risk behaviors and other HIV prevention methods since the
           start of nPEP.

      At each of these study visits, the participant will receive risk reduction counseling along
      with the provision of condoms and lubricant
