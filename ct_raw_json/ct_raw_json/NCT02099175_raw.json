            "textblock": "So far, surgery followed by radiotherapy (RT) has been the usual approach for advanced\n      disease. Technical improvements in surgical approaches have been reported, providing less\n      invasive surgery with lower morbidity. In this scenario, multimodality treatment seems the\n      best approach, even if there is lack of prospective data.\n\n      Some studies explored the role and feasibility of induction chemotherapy (CT) and the\n      prognostic value of response to CT. Histology and molecular pattern can guide the type of\n      administered CT. The first drives the choice of drug to be associated with Cisplatin, while\n      mutational status of p53 (wild type, WT vs mutated, MUT) is a predictive value for response\n      to CT with Cisplatin plus 5-Fluorouracil and Leucovorin in ITAC.\n\n      In addition, heavy ion therapy may produce less toxic side effects in a particularly\n      critical area exposed to late RT toxicities and potentially can help in organ preservation\n      strategies when exenteratio orbitae is requested."
