Determine the time to disease progression, time to\n      treatment failure, response duration, and survival in this patient population treated with\n      this regimen.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive vinorelbine IV on days 1 and 8, and\n      docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 1 only. Treatment continues every 21 days in the absence of\n      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed for 1 month, and then\n      every 1.5-3 months for 1 year.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 69 patients will be accrued for this study."
