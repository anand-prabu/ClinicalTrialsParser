Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. It is\n      not yet known which combination chemotherapy regimen is most effective in treating advanced\n      stomach cancer.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to compare the effectiveness of different regimens of\n      combination chemotherapy in treating patients who have advanced stomach cancer."

Patients are stratified according to\n      center, performance status (0 vs 1), and liver involvement (yes vs no). Patients are\n      randomized to one of three treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive epirubicin IV bolus and cisplatin IV over 4 hours on day 1 plus\n           fluorouracil IV continuously on days 1-21.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour and cisplatin IV over 4 hours on day\n           1.\n\n        -  Arm III: Patients receive docetaxel and cisplatin as in arm II and fluorouracil as in\n           arm I.\n\n      Treatment regimen is repeated every 3 weeks for up to 8 courses in the absence of disease\n      progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Quality of life is assessed before randomization; at day 1 of courses 2, 4, and 6; and one\n      month after treatment failure.\n\n      Patients with complete response or partial response are followed monthly for 3 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 111 patients will be accrued for this study."
