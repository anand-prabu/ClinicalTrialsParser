  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation study with an expansion phase will evaluate
      the safety, pharmacokinetics and therapeutic activity of RO6895882 in patients with advanced
      and/or metastatic solid tumors. Patients will be treated until disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity occurs, for up to a maximum of 24 months.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult patients, &gt;/= 18 years of age

          -  Confirmed advanced and/or metastatic solid tumor, with at least one tumor lesion of
             non-critical location accessible to biopsy, with confirmed progression at baseline,
             for whom no standard treatment is available

          -  Radiologically measurable and clinically evaluable disease

          -  Life expectancy of &gt;/= 12 weeks

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-1

          -  All acute toxic effects of any prior radiotherapy, chemotherapy or surgical procedure
             must have resolved to Grade &lt;/= 1, except alopecia (any grade) and Grade 2 peripheral
             neuropathy

          -  Adequate hematological, liver and renal function

          -  Patient must be willing to use effective methods of contraception as defined by
             protocol

          -  Locally confirmed CEA expression in tumor tissue (Parts I and II) or centrally
             confirmed CEA expression if no archival tumor tissue and fresh biopsy is collected

          -  For Part III, a minimum of 5 patients with CEA-negative tumors (non-small cell lung
             cancer, head and neck cancer or colorectal cancer) will be included

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History or clinical evidence of central nervous system (CNS) primary tumors or
             metastases including leptomeningeal metastases unless they have been previously

             anticonvulsants in the last 14 days before screening

          -  Active second malignancy in the last 5 years (with the exception of non-melanoma skin
             cancer, or cervical carcinoma in situ)

          -  Evidence of significant, uncontrolled concomitant diseases which could affect
             compliance with the protocol or interpretation of results, including diabetes
             mellitus, history of relevant pulmonary disorders and known autoimmune diseases

          -  Poorly controlled hypertension, unstable angina, congestive heart failure (CHF) of
             any New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification, serious cardiac arrhythmia

          -  Active or uncontrolled infections

          -  Known HIV or known active HBV or HCV infection

          -  Any other diseases, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding, or clinical
             laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that would
             contraindicate the use of an investigational drug

          -  Pregnant or breast-feeding women

          -  Known hypersensitivity to any of the components of RO6895882 and including
             premedication (corticosteroids, anti-histamine, paracetamol, hydroxytryptamine3
             [5-HT3] receptor antagonist)

          -  Concurrent therapy with any other investigational drug

          -  Regular immunosuppressive therapy (i.e., for organ transplantation, chronic
             rheumatologic disease)

          -  Chronic use of steroids (including inhaled) will not be allowed. Concurrent high
             doses of systemic corticosteroids. High dose is considered as &gt; 20 mg of
             dexamethasone a day (or equivalent) for &gt; 7 consecutive days.

          -  Radiotherapy within the last 4 weeks before start of study drug treatment with the
             exception of limited field palliative radiotherapy for bone pain relief
