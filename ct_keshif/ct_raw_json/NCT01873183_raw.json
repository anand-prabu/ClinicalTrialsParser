First, preoperative optimizing of\n      venous return will be performed 45 minutes before surgery in a preoperative room with TTE.\n      Second, after induction of anaesthesia perioperative fluid therapy will be guided by\n      utilizing the FloTrac-device.\n\n      Preoperative rehydration with 6 ml colloid fluids (Volulyte\u2122, Fresenius Kabi Ab, Sweden) /kg\n      estimated ideal body weight (IBW) will be administrated if low level of venous return is\n      detected by TTE. After a colloid bolus the second TTE is performed to check the level of\n      venous return. If remaining hypovolemia is found additional colloids 3ml/ kg IBW will be\n      given.\n\n      In OR, before pneumoperitoneum, prophylactic i.v. antibiotics will be administrated in total\n      550ml crystalloids (NaCl 0.9%, Fresenius Kabi Ab, Sweden) to all patients. Infusion of\n      buffered glucose solution (25mg/ml, Fresenius Kabi Ab, Sweden) at rate 1.5ml/kg IBW/h will\n      be initiated to all patients. Stroke volume variation \u2265 12 % is used as a threshold for\n      administration of additional colloids 3ml/kg/ IBW during surgery.\n\n      Postoperatively infusion of buffered glucose solution (50mg/ml) is administrated at fixed\n      rate 100ml/h to all patients. In addition, during the stay at the postoperative ward unit\n      850 ml crystalloids (antibiotics, paracetamol and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs) are\n      infused.\n\n      Perioperative ephedrine and/or phenylephrine is used as i.v. injection when necessary to\n      ensure adequate perfusion pressure (MAP \u2265 65 mmHg), cardiac index (\u2265 2.0) and heart rate (\u2265\n      50/min) in addition to i.v. fluids in both groups. In principle hemodynamic parameters will\n      be gathered always after five minutes minimum from possible administration of i.v. ephedrine\n      or phenylephrine. Moreover, if pre-existing systolic left ventricular failure is detected in\n      preoperative TTE, infusion of dobutamine 3 - 4ug/kg IBW will be started 10 minutes before\n      induction of anaesthesia.\n\n      In the control group perioperative cardiovascular monitoring will be conducted by ECG,\n      non-invasive blood pressure and Sp02 measurements."
