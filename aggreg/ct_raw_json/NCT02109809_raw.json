LD-TLI is a procedure in which all of the body's\n      major lymph nodes are treated with small doses of radiation in order to reset the\n      dysfunctional immune system. LD-TLI may work as a treatment for graft-versus-host disease\n      caused by a bone marrow or stem cell transplant."

To determine the safety of total lymphoid irradiation (TLI) in cohorts of a selected\n      population of steroid-resistant/dependent (SR/D)-chronic graft-versus-host disease (GvHD)\n      patients, given to cohorts with a total cumulative doses of TLI of 100, 150, 200, 250 or 300\n      centigray (cGy).\n\n      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. To evaluate the efficacy (failure free survival [FFS] at 6 months) of this therapy in the\n      study population.\n\n      II. Approximate the efficacy at different dose levels using the GvHD summary scores.\n\n      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. Determine the effect of this therapy on relevant subpopulations of immune cells in an\n      attempt to elucidate a mechanism of action.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.\n\n      Patients undergo LD-TLI daily for 1-2 days.\n\n      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up on day 45, at 3 and 6 months,\n      at 1 year, and then every 6 months thereafter."
