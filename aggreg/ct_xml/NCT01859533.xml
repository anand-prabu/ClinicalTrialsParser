  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Evaluating the effect of early application of Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) via
      Neopuff in cases of transient tachypnea of the newborn(TTN) and its role in decreasing the
      duration and complication of TTN.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to determine whether positive end expiratory  pressure therapy
      (PEEP) administered early via a T piece based infant resuscitator (Neopuff) would safely
      reduce the incidence of TTN and the need for neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission
      of near term and term infants with respiratory distress.
