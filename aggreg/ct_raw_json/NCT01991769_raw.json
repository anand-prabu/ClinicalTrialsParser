The two different exercise training modes used are\n      high intensity interval training (HIIT) and moderate intensity training (MIT) Hypothesis:\n      Exercise training in advance of an unhealthy meal will improve endothelial- and cardiac\n      function in healthy and type 2 diabetes individuals. HIIT will reduce the negative\n      postprandial effects on the endothelium more than MIT."
