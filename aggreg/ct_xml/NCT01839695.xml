  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Valiant Mona LSA thoracic stent graft system is for the endovascular repair of aneurysms
      of the descending thoracic aorta (DTA) in patients who require coverage of the left
      subclavian artery (LSA).The study is intended to assess safety and performance of the device
      acutely and at 30 days.

             provisions on a written informed consent form

          -  Subject must be considered a candidate for revascularization of the LSA.

          -  Subject has a DTA which will require coverage of the LSA

          -  Subject's anatomy must meet the anatomical criteria to receive that implanted device

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has had previous endovascular repair of the ascending and/or descending
             thoracic aorta.

          -  Subject is in acute renal failure or has renal insufficiency with a serum creatinine
             â‰¥ 2.0 mg/dL

          -  Subject is a pregnant female.

          -  Enrollment in another clinical study

          -  Subject has had a cerebral vascular accident (CVA)or myocardial infarction (MI)
             within 3 months.

          -  Subject has a history of bleeding diathesis, coagulopathy, or refuses blood
             transfusion.

          -  Subject has a known allergy or intolerance to the device components.

          -  Subject has a known hypersensitivity or contraindication to anticoagulants or
