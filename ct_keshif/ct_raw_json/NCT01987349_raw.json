In this context, immunization with FDA approved flu vaccines\n      represents a safe and accessible opportunity to gauge the immune response in a particular\n      individual as a function of age and genetics and then to try to find predictive biomarkers."

The investigators plan to compare various immunological responses, identify\n      age-specific biomarkers or clusters of markers, quantify the frequency of influenza-specific\n      T-cells pre- and post-vaccination, and determine the effective breadth of T-cell repertoire\n      to an influenza vaccine within an individual as a function of age and to what degree this is\n      genetically determined.
