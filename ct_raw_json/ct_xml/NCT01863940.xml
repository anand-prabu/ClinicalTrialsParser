  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ukraine is a newly sovereign country in Eastern Europe with a large burn population. With
      the collapse of the Soviet Union, burn programs have become decentralized and resources for
      maintaining facilities have dwindled. Patients frequently present with debilitating burn
      injuries and often do not receive necessary treatment secondary to limited resources and
      cost of treatment.

      The investigators have established an annual medical mission, outreach clinic and
      telemedicine relationship with hospitals and burn centers in Ukraine in an effort to improve
      burn care. One focus is post-operative pain control. The investigators have noticed a
      pattern of anxiety with children from the Ukraine surrounding dressing changes which they
      believe this is secondary to inadequate pain control in the immediate post-operative period
      including the initial dressing changes.

      The goal is to provide wound catheters with a continuous infusion of procaine in an attempt
      to reduce the pain experienced in the early post-operative period and specifically with
      dressing changes.

      There will be 200 participants, 12-65 years old who are receiving reconstructive plastic
      procedure with split-thickness skin grafts from lateral thigh in the study. 100 will receive
      the standard pain management Analgin/Metamizole 1 g IM; Ketorolac 3%- 30 mg IM regimen and
      100 will receive wound catheters with continuous procaine infusion for 48 hours with the
      standard Analgin/Metamizole 1 g IM; Ketorolac 3%- 30 mg IM  available for breakthrough pain.
      Pain scores will be assessed prior to dressing change, during dressing changes and at 30
      minutes and 1 hour after dressing change.

    <textblock>
      There will be 200 participants, ages 12-65 years old who are receiving reconstructive
      plastic surgery with split-thickness skin grafts from the lateral thigh at 1 hospital in
      Ukrain. The first 100 will receive the standard pain regimen Analgin/Metamizole 1 g IM;
      Ketorolac 3%- 30 mg IM and the following 100 will receive catheters with continuous procaine
      infusion for 48 hours with the standard pain regimen available for breakthrough pain. All
      participants must be expected to remain inpatient for 48 hours post-operatively.

      Participants receiving continuous infusion of local anesthetic via a wound catheter will
      have the ON-Q PainBuster Post-Op Pain Relief System (I-Flow Corporation) tunneled
      subcutaneously while the patient is intra-operative.  Catheter insertion sites will be
      covered with Steri-strips and covered with a transparent dressing to facilitate inspection
      of the insertion site for any erythema or discharge.   Catheters will have a 10mL procaine
      0.5% bolus intra-operative followed by an infusion delivered at 4-5mL/hr delivered by an
      elastomeric pump. Historically patients' pain complaints arise from skin graft donor sites
      rather then recipient sites.

      Patients will be assessed for pain scores on a scale of 0-10 (0= no pain and 10= worst
      possible pain) prior to dressing changes, during and 1 hour after dressing changes.
