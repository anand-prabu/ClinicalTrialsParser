            "textblock": "Despite adequate epidural analgesia, up to 97% of patients undergoing thoracotomy will\n      experience ipsilateral shoulder pain.  Although this pain is well recognized, its cause\n      remains unclear. Several mechanisms have been suggested to explain this pain, including\n      somatic and visceral as well as phrenic nerve nociception.  The phrenic nerve arises from\n      the third to the fifth cervical nerves and provides the sensory innervation for the\n      mediastinal and diaphragmatic pleura and pericardium.  Patients will complain of a constant,\n      moderate to severe aching pain, in the posterior deltoid and in the suprascapular region,\n      ipsilateral to the surgery.  Different treatments have been used to alleviate\n      post-thoracotomy shoulder pain, but few of these efforts have been proven effective and\n      safe.\n\n      A mixture of epidural bupivacaine and fentanyl is considered the standard of care for\n      post-thoracotomy analgesia in our center. The infusion is started after induction of\n      anesthesia with a bolus dose followed with a continuous infusion and bolus doses as needed\n      for the following days.  To optimize the use of epidural analgesia after thoracotomy, it\n      would seem well-advised to try to reach higher dermatomes.  This could possibly be achieved\n      by using a different opioid in combination with bupivacaine in the epidural infusion.\n      Morphine could be an interesting agent in order to reach cervical spinous dermatomes\n      probably involved in the genesis of post-thoracotomy shoulder pain.\n\n      Methods: The anesthetic technique and monitoring will be standardized. Prior to the\n      induction of general anesthesia, a thoracic epidural catheter will be inserted under local\n      anesthesia between the fourth and the eight spinous processes.  Correct placement of the\n      epidural will be assessed.  A bolus dose of fentanyl 100 mcg or morphine 3 mg will be given\n      by the epidural catheter as per randomization. The epidural infusion will be initiated at a\n      rate of 0.1 mL/kg/hr before surgery and continued postoperatively until the surgical drains\n      are removed or for a maximum of five days. To relieve thoracic pain, the epidural infusion\n      rate will be adjusted up to a maximum of 12 mL/hr, with boluses of 0.05 mL/kg as needed.\n      Hydromorphone will be used  postoperatively as rescue analgesia for shoulder pain. All\n      patients will receive standardised doses of acetaminophen for the first 48 hours following\n      surgery.\n\n      On arrival in the recovery room, correct placement of the epidural will be reassessed.\n      During the immediate postoperative period, the intensity of pain will be assessed using a\n      Verbal Numeric Pain Scale (0-10).  Pain will be assessed at 2,4,8,12 and 24 hours after\n      surgery and daily thereafter, for a total duration of 4 postoperative days. Interference of\n      pain with daily activities will be assessed using the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) at 24 hours\n      following surgery. Signs of neuropathic pain will be assessed using the Leeds Assessment of\n      Neuropathic Symptoms and Signs (LANSS) scale at 24 hours following surgery.\n\n      Side-effects attributable to analgesia will be recorded.  Arterial blood samples will be\n      collected every 8 hours for the first 24 hours postoperatively."
