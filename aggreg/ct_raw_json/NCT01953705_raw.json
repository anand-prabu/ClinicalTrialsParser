This trial is designed to collect preliminary data into the mechanism by\n      which PUFA therapy operates on the brain with special attention to the vascular components.\n\n      The randomized, double-blind and controlled trial will rigorously test PUFA effects versus a\n      placebo in non-demented elders over 3 years.  This biomarker based trial will enroll 150\n      elders.  Aim 1 will assess PUFA effects on neuroimaging parameter changes.  Aim 2 will\n      assess PUFA effects on blood-based biomarkers of endothelial health, and Aim 3 will collect\n      preliminary data on PUFA effects on neuropsychological and functional parameters with\n      special attention to the executive and speed of processing skills and gait speed."
