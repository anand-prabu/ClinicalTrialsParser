  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this phase 2 study is to evaluate the feasibility of an early palliative
      care intervention for metastatic cancer patients. Feasibility will be assessed in terms of
      percentage of patients that accept the proposal of the early palliative care intervention
      and that effectively start to be followed in the palliative care out-patient clinic. The
      study will be performed in a consecutive series of newly diagnosed patients affected by lung
      cancer (NSCLC or SCLC, stage IIIb, IV),  mesothelioma (stage II, IV), pancreas (stage IV),
      stomach (stage IIIb-IV).

    <description>The intervention consists of an early integration of a palliative care programme with the standard care performed by the oncologists-pneumologists that are following the cancer patients.
