      Observational multicentre cohort study. Children admitted to a Dutch PICU are studied for
      lactate levels and ScvO2.  Children instrumented with arterial and central venous catheters
      are included within the first 12 hours after admittance.

      Rationale: Hemodynamic therapy in children with circulatory insufficiency requires the use
      of hemodynamic monitoring parameters including parameters that reflect tissue/organ
      oxygenation and oxygen utilization. Two parameters are readily available at the bedside that
      may reflect this: arterial lactate level and central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2). To
      date is it unknown if these parameters are useful in guiding treatment of critically ill
      children. Also it is unknown how often lactate and ScvO2 are abnormal in children admitted
      to a Dutch PICU or if they are related to each.

      Objective: The objective of this study is to find the incidence of a raised lactate level
      and or a decreased ScvO2, to study their mutual relation and to study the relation between
      lactate, ScvO2 and outcome parameters in children admitted to a Dutch PICU.

      Study design: Observational cohort study

      Study population: children admitted to a PICU &lt;= 16 years

      Intervention (if applicable): No intervention

      Main study parameters/endpoints: Arterial lactate level, central venous oxygen saturation
      (ScvO2), arterial blood gas analysis and general hemodynamic variables in the first 24 hours
      after admission. Parameters for organ dysfunction, severity of illness and outcome
      parameters like length of PICU stay.

      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group
      relatedness: This is a strict observational design. No blood samples are taken for the
      purpose of this study. No intravascular catheters are inserted for the purpose of this
      study. No treatment strategy is associated with this study.
