Hispanics are affected by\n      arthritis at a slightly lower age-adjusted rate compared to non-Hispanic whites and African\n      Americans. However, compared to other groups, Hispanics have a higher prevalence of\n      arthritis-attributed activity limitations (primarily related to OA), are less likely to\n      receive hip replacement independent of health care access, and are less likely to receive\n      knee replacement. In addition, there have been very few interventions to improve either\n      medical or behavioral aspects of OA treatment recommendations among the Hispanic population.\n      The study will developed and test a culturally appropriate Spanish educational materials and\n      telephone scripts for the patient- and provider-based interventions and will test the\n      patient and provider intervention in a group of Adult Hispanics with OA."
