Patients are stratified by participating institution.\n\n      Patients are randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups.  One group is treated with\n      fractionated whole-brain irradiation using megavoltage equipment.\n\n      The second group receives stereotactic radiosurgery plus fractionated whole-brain\n      radiotherapy.  Stereotactic radiosurgery involves irradiation of all tumors to the margins\n      on stereotactic computerized tomography or magnetic resonance imaging.  Either treatment may\n      be administered first; the second treatment begins within 1 month of the first.\n\n      Concurrent anticonvulsants and steroids are allowed. Patients are followed for change in\n      size and number of tumors at 1, 3, and 6 months; follow-up clinical exams are performed at\n      least every 2 months."
