      The purpose of this study is to investigate the role of endothelial dysfunction in chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is one of the leading causes of death in
      developed countries. Acute exacerbations and cardiovascular diseases are the major causes of
      morbidity and mortality in COPD patients. According to the frequency of exacerbations,
      phenotype &quot;frequent exacerbator&quot; is defined and characterised with severe clinical course
      and was recognised as an increased risk for cardiovascular mortality. Recent studies
      considered that systemic inflammation plays a key role in the pathogenesis of COPD and
      endothelial dysfunction is a suspected link between increased  cardiovascular mortality and
      systemic inflammation in COPD patients. Endothelial dysfunction is assessed by determining
      flow mediated dilatation index (FMD index) or plasma markers. Previous studies have
      suggested the presence of endothelial dysfunction in COPD patients, as well as the
      deterioration of endothelial function during exacerbations of COPD. This study will, for the
      first time, systematically explore endothelial dysfunction in two phenotypically distinct
      groups of COPD patients with simultaneous assessment of endothelial function flow mediated
      dilatation index (FMD index) and plasma markers.
