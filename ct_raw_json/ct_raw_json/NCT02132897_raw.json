The CR formulation of CBZ  is slowly absorbed and the elimination half life varies\n      with time due to metabolism autoinduction.\n\n      The primary objective of this study is to estimate the bioequivalence of the new brand\n      generic product (Auration(R) CR) 400 mg manufactured in Uruguay vs. the innovative product\n      (Tegretol(R) CR) 400 mg manufactured in Brasil, under fed conditions. The secondary\n      objective will be evaluation of safety issues.\n\n      The study design will be randomized two sequences, two periods and crossover.  For a power\n      of not less than 80% sample size was estimated to be 20 healthy male subjects. Products will\n      be administered with food (high calories/high fat breakfast) after an overnight fast.\n\n      Time vs. concentration curves will be built for each subject and formulation and Area Under\n      Curve (AUC0240) will be estimated using the trapezoid rule, the AUC 0-inf. (from time 0 to\n      infinity) will be estimated using the formula Cz/Ke, Cmax will be taken from the individual\n      curves.\n\n      This parameters will be statistically processed with the WinNonlin 6.3\n      Pharmacokinetics/Statistic software in order to prove bioequivalence between the study\n      products."
