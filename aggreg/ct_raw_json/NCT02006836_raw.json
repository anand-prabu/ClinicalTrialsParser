Pomelo is one of the\n      most widely cultivated and consumed fruits in China. However, substantial scientific data on\n      their nutritional compositions of pomelo are not available. The investigators purpose in\n      this study is to identify the nutritional value of one type of pomelo named Majia pomelo and\n      obtain the information about whether this variety of pomelo is appropriate for diabetic\n      patients."
