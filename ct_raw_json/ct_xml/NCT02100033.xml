  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      De-qi as an important factor to therapeutic effect of acupuncture for years, It's a concrete
      pathway to approach Qi, an abstract concept in Chinese medicine. However, all previous
      physicians and medical scientists have different interpretation to De-qi, and no objective
      principles for clinical practice, teaching and studies.

      Qi propagated combined with acupuncture practice always be seen as De-qi , therefore, the
      study control &quot;transmission or not&quot; and &quot;direction of sensation propagated&quot; to compare
      what's different in human body. If the change happened as prediction based on acupuncture
      theories, it could define De-qi for operation.

      The study will collect 60 subjects, from age 20 to 40, the same numbers of male and female.
      They will accept different manipulation in left hand HeGu(LI4), and assessed the variations
      in microcirculation, temperature of left forearm, and waxing/waning of yin-yang , Qi and
      blood in related meridian. We hope to understand if sensation propagated is primary factor
      of De-Qi and acupuncture effect .
