At the time of the\n      analysis, mortality follow-up was complete for over 99 percent of subjects, and incident\n      morbidity information was available for myocardial infarction, coronary bypass surgery and\n      stroke. The database included measurements which allowed:  1) prospective analyses of the\n      effects of putative cardiovascular risk factors on disease incidence in the elderly, 2)\n      prospective analyses of the impact of change in risk factors on events in the elderly, 3)\n      exploration of risk factors not classically  associated with cardiovascular events in\n      younger populations but which may be important in the very old, and, 4) cross-sectional\n      description of putative risk factors in an aged population."
