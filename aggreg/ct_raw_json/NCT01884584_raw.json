This dose is approximately 40% of the standard human dose for determining cardiac output. ICG will be administered by intravenous infusion over a 20 second period in a 2-8 hour time window before the time of completion of the surgical procedure."

The surgical cavity will be examined by a special laser pen after\n      the tumor is removed, and if areas of fluorescence are seen, that may indicate tumor cells\n      where the ICG dye collected are still remaining and the surgeon would then remove those.\n      After the tumor and the tissue around it are removed and sent to the laboratory, the tissue\n      may be examined using that same laser pen to see where the cancer cells are and compare that\n      to what the laboratory sees when it looks at the tumor and tissue with a microscope.  It is\n      hoped that what the dye shows and what is seen with the microscope will be alike."
