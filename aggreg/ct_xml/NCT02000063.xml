  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A single long-term follow up assessment of an established multi-centre, prospective
      longitudinal cohort study of patients for clinical, psychosocial, immunovirological outcomes
      4 to 8 years after previous treatment for recently acquired hepatitis C virus infection.

      The study aims are:

        1. To evaluate the effect of successful prior treatment or spontaneous clearance of
           recently acquired HCV infection on long-term quality of life, social functioning,
           injecting behaviour, mental health and liver health.

        2. To assess the incidence of HCV re-infection following prior treatment induced clearance
           or spontaneous clearance of recently acquired chronic HCV infection.

        3. To determine predictors of HCV re-infection following recently acquired HCV infection
           treatment.

        4. To determine frequency and predictors of new mixed and superinfections in ATAHC
           subjects with persistent viraemia.

        5. To add to a tissue repository of serum and PBMCs from well-characterised patients
           treated for recently acquired HCV infection to allow future examination of the role of
           other variables that may potentially impact on the prognosis and outcomes of early HCV
           treatment.
