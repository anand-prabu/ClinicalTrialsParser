            "textblock": "The diagnosis of splenomegaly (abnormal enlargement of the spleen) is extremely important in\n      managing patients with many medical conditions. The ability to recognize an enlarged spleen\n      in a timely manner can impact patient outcomes. Although the physical exam can be used to\n      confidently diagnosis massive enlargement of the spleen, evaluating lesser degrees of\n      splenomegaly at the bedside proves more difficult. In current practice, the gold standard\n      for diagnosis of splenomegaly is the standard abdominal ultrasound. The prevalence of\n      splenomegaly in patients with several medical conditions such as blood disorders and\n      cirrhosis is relatively high. Therefore, the demand for abdominal ultrasound is evergrowing\n      and similarly the cost of caring for patients with these diseases increases.\n\n      Examination of the spleen is one of the core competencies that we expect our students and\n      residents to learn as part of their training. This physical diagnosis manoeuver is\n      frequently used to examine residents at the Royal College level and determine their fitness\n      to practice. Unfortunately, the sensitivity and specificity of examination of the spleen at\n      the bedside is not very good.\n\n      With the introduction of handheld ultrasound (HCU) devices, rapid bedside assessment of a\n      patient is now possible. The Pocket-sized Vscan Ultrasound device (Vscan) (GE Healthcare,\n      USA) allows for 2D imaging on a 3.5 inch display and has been shown to have comparable image\n      quality to standard ultrasound for some applications. The Vscan and other HCU devices have\n      been used at point of care to evaluate a number of conditions and can greatly impact\n      treatment decisions in medical patients at the bedside. The ability to recognize\n      splenomegaly in a timely manner can impact patient outcomes. In addition, the use of this\n      technology could significantly impact training standards for students and residents.\n\n      It remains unclear whether bedside evaluation with the Vscan is able to accurately measure\n      spleen size. Our study aims to determine the diagnostic accuracy of the Vscan when used by\n      trained ultrasonographers, in patients with varying degrees of splenomegaly. If we can\n      reliably show that a trained ultrasonographer can accurately characterize spleen size at the\n      bedside with a handheld device, the next stage of the study will involve training medical\n      residents in the use of handheld ultrasound to see if they can also reliably assess spleen\n      size."
