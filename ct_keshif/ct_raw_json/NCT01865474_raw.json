The investigational\n      product, DLBS1033 at a dose of 490 mg thrice daily or placebo, will be given for an 8-week\n      course of therapy.\n\n      DLBS1033 effectively demonstrated fibrinolytic, fibrinogenolytic as well as antithrombotic\n      activities. Hypercoagulation state with high fibrinogen level is usually found in diabetes\n      mellitus patients.\n\n      Therefore, the hypothesis of interest of this study is that DLBS1033 will reduce fibrinogen\n      level of diabetes mellitus patients better than that of the Control Group."
