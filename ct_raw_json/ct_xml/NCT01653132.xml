    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted this study to determine whether injections of Xeomin®, a type
      of botulinum toxin into the glands that produce saliva (one pair just below and in front of
      the ear and the other just under the jaw line) are safe and effective to treat excessive
      saliva, or drooling in patients with Parkinson's Disease (PD)/parkinsonism and Amyotrophic
      Lateral Sclerosis (ALS).

      Participants will be recruited if they have Parkinson's disease, Parkinsonism, or ALS.
      Inclusion and exclusion criteria are summarized below. Participants will be screened at the
      first visit to make sure they are eligible for the trial. They will then undergo baseline
      testing including neurologic evaluation, questions to assess their memory and cognitive
      status and evaluation of their disease status using parts of the Unified Parkinsons's
      Disease Ratings Scale (UPDRS) or the Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating
      Scale-revised (ALS-FRS-R) that are routinely used to follow disease progression. They will
      be given a questionnaire to evaluate the severity of their drooling. Their saliva production
      will be measured by having them spit into a cup for 5 minutes, twice.

      At the first visit, after making sure they are eligible for the study and performing the
      baseline testing and procedures, they will be given either Xeomin or placebo (saline
      injections without medication) injections in the 4 glands that produce saliva. They will not
      know which injection they received. This visit will take about 2 hours. They will be
      followed up every month and  asked about  side effects, have neurologic evaluation and
      UPDRS/ALS-FRS-R testing and fill-in the questionnaire for drooling severity. Saliva volume
      will be measured as done at the first visit.  At either Month 4 or 5, participants will
      receive the second injection. This will be a &quot;cross-over&quot; injection, i.e., if they received
      Xeomin at the first injection they will receive saline at the second and vice versa. Thus,
      all participants will receive the study medication Xeomin, either as the first injection or
      the second injection at 4 months or 5 months. The follow up after the second injection will
      be one monthly visit for 3 months, with similar evaluations as described above. The
      follow-up visit will take about 1 hour each.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  For PD/ Parkinsonism: 1. PD, Multiple Systems Atrophy (MSA), or Progressive
             Supranuclear Palsy (PSP) diagnosed by clinical criteria, ages 20-80 with troublesome
             sialorrhea as defined below**.

               -  Sialorrhea that patients or their families or treating physicians think is
                  troublesome

                    1. Swallowing function: Functional Oral Intake Scale (FOIS)* of 5 or greater

                    2. If patients have been treated with other medications for sialorrhea
                       earlier, they should be off the medications at least 4 weeks prior to the
                       baseline evaluation.

                    3. If they are on other medications for sialorrhea at the time of the baseline
                       evaluation, the doses will be held stable throughout the period of the
                       study.

                    4. Women of child bearing age will need to be on a reliable method of birth
                       control for the duration of the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  For both PD and ALS:

               1. Current use of Coumadin

               2. Concurrent significant medical illness

               3. History of myasthenia gravis or Lambert-Eaton Syndrome

               4. Ongoing substance abuse

               5. History of unreliable follow-up

               6. Past use of Xeomin® or other botulinum toxin preparations

               7. Cognitive impairment, defined as a score ≤ 23/30 on the Mini Mental Status Exam
