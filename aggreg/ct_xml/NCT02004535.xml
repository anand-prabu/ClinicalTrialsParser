  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to investigate benefits of binaural hearing for
      non-traditional cochlear implant candidates (with Asymmetric Hearing Loss). Asymmetric
      candidates are patients with severe to profound hearing loss in one ear and better hearing
      in the other ear.  (One ear is deaf and the other ear has better hearing and in most cases
      uses a hearing aid.) The investigators hypothesize that cochlear implantation of the poorer
      ear provides a functional increase in word and sentence understanding in quiet or noise,
      perceived benefit, localization ability, and other measures of auditory performance relative
      to use of the better hearing ear alone.

    <description>Speech, Spatial and Qualities of Hearing scale (SSQ; Gatehouse and Noble,2004) will be completed by participants.  The SSQ is a 49-item questionnaire that uses a 10-point rating scale (where a 0 rating reflects least ability and 10 reflects greatest ability) to evaluate the effects of hearing loss in terms of disability and function across three domains: Speech Hearing, Spatial Hearing, and Qualities of Hearing.</description>

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  18 years of age or older at time of surgery

          -  The poorer ear (implant ear) will have a severe-to-profound hearing loss and meet
             current cochlear implant candidacy criteria.

          -  The better ear (contralateral ear) will have hearing levels less than current
             cochlear implant candidacy criteria and stable/non-fluctuating hearing levels for at
             least the previous year

          -  Normal/patent cochlear anatomy

          -  Fluent in English

          -  Desire to have more functional binaural hearing and willingness to comply with all of
             the study requirements

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Medical or psychological conditions that contraindicate undergoing surgery

          -  Additional handicaps that would prevent or restrict participation in the audiological
             evaluations

          -  Ossification or any other cochlear anomaly that might prevent complete insertion of
             the electrode array

          -  Hearing loss of neural or central origin, including auditory neuropathy

          -  Chronic and severe tinnitus in the ear to be implanted

          -  Unwillingness or inability to comply with all investigational requirements
