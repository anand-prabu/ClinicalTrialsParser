            "textblock": "Nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP), widely used in neonatal intensive care is\n      also more and more used in infants with severe acute bronchiolitis. There is no evidence\n      that nCPAP improves outcome, but several studies showed that it reduces work of breathing\n      (WOB), improves gas exchange and decreases intubation rate. High flow nasal prong (HFNP)\n      therapy, also used in neonatal units, has recently been suggested for bronchiolitis\n      management. This technique allows warmed and moist gas administration protecting nasal\n      mucosa, and preventing variations of inspired gas FiO2. HFNP also creates a continuous\n      positive pressure, reducing WOB, and seems much more comfortable and better tolerated by\n      babies than nCPAP. There are no studies comparing both techniques for bronchiolitis\n      management. The main objective of this study is to compare WOB with nCPAP and HFNP therapy\n      in infants with severe bronchiolitis in pediatric intensive care unit. Secondary purpose is\n      to compare efficacy and tolerance of both techniques. We propose to lead an open, single\n      center, crossover randomized study. Each patient will receive the two treatments. Three\n      consecutive periods will be studied: first one (minimum 2 hours), with the first technique\n      CPAP or HFNP according to randomization (treatment 1); second period (2 hours) with the\n      second technique (treatment 2); Third period (6 hours) with the second technique. The\n      primary endpoint will be the comparison of WOB (estimated by the calculation of the\n      transdiaphragmatic pressure-time product) at the end of the two firsts periods. Efficacy and\n      tolerance of each technique will be evaluated and compared by compared measuring respiratory\n      rate, heart rate, FiO2, SpO2, transcutaneous PCO2, modified Wood score, and EDIN score\n      during the third period. Nine subjects by groups are required."
