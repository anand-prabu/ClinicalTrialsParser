      Background:

      - Roflumilast is a drug used to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It is
      designed to help reduce lung inflammation. However, during testing, roflumilast also
      appeared to reduce high blood sugar levels in people with COPD and type 2 diabetes. Other
      tests showed that roflumilast also improved blood sugar levels in people who only had type 2
      diabetes. Researchers want to see how roflumilast affects insulin and blood sugar levels in
      overweight or obese people who are not diabetic, but who have high blood sugar levels.

      Objectives:

      - To see how well roflumilast improves blood sugar and insulin levels in prediabetic
      overweight or obese individuals.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals between 30 to 65 years old who are overweight or obese (body mass index of
      24.9 to 39.9 kg/m2) and have elevated blood sugar levels.

      Design:

        -  This study will last 4 to 5 months. Participants will have 10 study visits over about
           14 weeks. Two of these visits will be overnight inpatient stays.

        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood and urine
           samples will be collected. They will also have a 3-day diet and exercise assessment
           with a dietitian.

        -  In Week 1, participants will have a special diet for 2 days to keep their regular
           weight. They will then have a 2-day inpatient stay. During their stay, they will have
           multiple tests, including blood sugar tests and full body scans. They may provide a fat
           and muscle tissue biopsy sample. They will then receive either the study drug or a
           placebo to take during the study.

        -  In Week 3, participants will repeat the diet and exercise study from the screening
           visit.

        -  In Week 4, participants will review their diet and exercise results and have blood and
           urine tests. They will receive a different dose of the study drug or a placebo.

        -  In Week 11, participants will repeat the diet and exercise study from the screening
           visit.

        -  In Week 12, participants will repeat the inpatient studies and tests from Week 1.

        -  In the last week, participants will have a final follow-up visit.

    <textblock>
      Resveratrol, a polyphenol most notably found in red wine has anti-aging properties in mice
      fed a high-fat diet; resveratrol protects against obesity and type 2 diabetes. Several
      clinical trials have been conducted to study the metabolic effects of resveratrol. Although
      these trials have used different subject groups (e.g. obese healthy, type 2 diabetics or
      older adults with glucose intolerance), they suggest that resveratrol may improve insulin
      sensitivity.  However, the therapeutic potential of resveratrol is diminished by the fact
      that it has a very promiscuous target profile. In order to translate resveratrol biology
      into clinical application, it is helpful to identify the cellular target(s) of resveratrol
      that mediate the desired effects and to develop therapies specific for that target(s).
      Recently, we discovered that the metabolic effects of resveratrol appear to result from
      competitive inhibition of cAMP-degrading phosphodiesterases (PDEs), which increases cAMP
      levels. The cAMP-dependent pathways activate AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which is
      essential for the metabolic effects of resveratrol. Inhibiting PDE4 with rolipram reproduces
      all of the metabolic benefits of resveratrol, including protection against diet-induced
      obesity and an increase in mitochondrial content, fat oxidation, physical stamina and
      glucose tolerance in mice.  Based on results from cellular and preclinical studies, we
      hypothesize that PDE4 inhibition will ameliorate insulin resistance and improve glucose
      tolerance in pre-diabetic individuals.  To test these hypotheses, we will conduct a
      randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study on the potential beneficial effects of
      roflumilast (Daxas  ), a PDE4 inhibitor, on insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance in
      pre-diabetic individuals.   Each study participant will receive either placebo or oral
      roflumilast (250 (micro)g, once a day for three weeks, followed by 500 (micro)g once a day
      for nine weeks).  At baseline and after the 12-week treatment period, we will assess insulin
      sensitivity. In addition, Beta-cell function, skeletal muscle mitochondrial function, body
      composition, and circulating adipocytokine profile will be measured at baseline and after
      treatment to evaluate potential changes that may be related to improvements in metabolic
      function.  This study will explore whether roflumilast is effective at improving insulin
      sensitivity in pre-diabetic individuals.  Results from this study may have important
      implications for the potential use of roflumilast in treating type 2 diabetes.
