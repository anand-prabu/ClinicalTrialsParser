The\n      availability of appropriately trained CBT therapist may be limited, especially in primary\n      care clinics. One way to increase the availability of CBT is to use computer-assisted CBT\n      (c-CBT). It can be effective in the treatment of adults, although the outcomes in\n      adolescents remain unclear.\n\n      Purpose: The purpose of this study is to determine whether a computer-assisted\n      cognitive-behavioral therapy is effective for the treatment of depression in adolescents\n      between 15 and 19 years of age in 4 primary care clinics in Santiago, Chile.\n\n      Study design: A two-arm single-blind (outcomes assessor) randomized controlled trial will be\n      carried out with 216 adolescents. The efficacy, the adherence, and acceptability of the\n      computerized-assisted cognitive behavioral therapy will be evaluated."
