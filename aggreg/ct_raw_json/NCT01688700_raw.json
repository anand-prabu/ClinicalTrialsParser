A higher percentage\n      of radical resection is reported in studies using neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by\n      surgery versus surgery alone.

The clinical phase I study of the combination of\n      Nimotuzumab administered concurrently with chemo-irradiation in patients with local advanced\n      esophageal squamous cell carcinoma has shown the safety and the potential efficacy of\n      Nimotuzumab.
