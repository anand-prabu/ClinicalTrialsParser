  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preclinical studies at our institution, based on a genetic mouse model of stomach cancer,
      strongly suggest that innervation of the stomach wall is deeply involved in tumorigenesis of
      stomach cancer. The data indicate that denervation of the stomach either by vagotomy or by
      injection of botulinum toxin (Botox®)in the stomach wall inhibits the development of cancer
      as well as reduces already established tumor volume in the stomach in this mouse model. Gene
      expression data indicate that vagotomy suppresses protein gene product 9.5 (PGP9.5). The
      expression of PGP9.5 is highly specific for the density of neurons and the diffuse
      neuroendocrine system. The investigators will take biopsies from tumors and adjacent normal
      mucosa either by means of endoscopy and/or from operative specimens from participants
      treated or evaluated for stomach cancer at the Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery, St
      Olavs Hospital, Trondheim University Hospital. The biopsies will be evaluated with
      immunohistochemistry and gene expression studies for the presence and density of PGP9.5.
      These data will be correlated to stage evaluation (TNM) and survival.
