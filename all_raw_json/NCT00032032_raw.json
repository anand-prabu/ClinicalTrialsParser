Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor\n      cells. Combining chemotherapy and radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of radiation\n      therapy when given with combination chemotherapy and to see how well they work in treating\n      patients with non-small cell lung cancer that cannot be surgically removed."

Patients concurrently receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours and carboplatin IV\n      over 30 minutes once weekly for 7 weeks. Treatment continutes in the absence of disease\n      progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      NOTE: *No prophylactic nodal radiotherapy is administered\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of radiotherapy until the maximum tolerated\n      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2\n      of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, 12\n      additional patients are treated at that dose level in the phase II portion of the study.\n\n      Beginning 3 weeks after completion of radiotherapy, patients receive paclitaxel and\n      carboplatin as above. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 3 courses in the absence of\n      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, once during the last week of radiotherapy, and then\n      every 3 months for 2 years.\n\n      Patients are followed at 3 weeks, every 3 months for 21 months, and then every 6 months for\n      3 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 90 patients will be accrued for this study."
