These\n      conditions are responsible for many heart related deaths and illnesses.\n\n      In this study researchers hope to determine the signs and symptoms (clinical correlation)\n      associated with specific genetic abnormalities causing inherited heart diseases.\n\n      In order to do this, researchers plan to evaluate patients and family members of patients\n      diagnosed with inherited heart disease.  Patients participating in the study will undergo\n      several tests including blood tests, electrocardiograms (EKG), and echocardiograms.\n      Patients may also be asked to undergo an MRI of the heart to provide a clearer picture of\n      it.\n\n      Patients participating in this study may not be directly benefited by it.  However,\n      information gathered from the study may contribute to the medical care, treatment, and\n      prevention of problems for others in the future."
