It was done by counting the number and amplitude of twitches evoked after electrical stimulus and the rate of infusion maintained itself at the low rate of 0.20\u00b5g/kg/min as long as the T1 response is less than 1%. When the T1 > 1%, the rate of infusion would automatically increase to 5.0 \u00b5g/kg/min until T1 < 1%, after which the infusion rate would fall back to 0.20\u00b5g/kg/min. The controlled infusion described above administered small doses of cisatracurium intra-operatively to maintain a muscle relaxation of more than 99%.
