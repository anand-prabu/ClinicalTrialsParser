  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of the study drug known as
      LY3090106 in healthy participants and in participants with RA who are having an inadequate
      response to methotrexate (MTX).  The study will investigate how the body processes the study
      drug and how the study drug affects the body.  The study will last about 3 months for each
      participant.
