This has the potential\n      contribute to increased child comfort as well as safer, more efficient, and less costly\n      treatment for a large population, as potentially more than one-fourth of all children may\n      benefit from a sensory adapted dental environment."

Commonly, such children exhibit anxiety and negative behavioral\n      reactions when confronted with experiential aspects of dental visits such as exposure to\n      bright fluorescent lighting, touch in or around the mouth, or the texture and smell of\n      various oral care products.   We pilot tested a sensory adapted dental environment (SADE) to\n      examine its effect on reducing anxiety and behavioral problems among the targeted groups of\n      children. The SADE intervention includes such adaptations as dimmed lighting, exposure to\n      soothing music, and application of a special vest which provides deep pressure sensations\n      that are calming. If our preliminary assessment produces promising results, we will later\n      more comprehensively test the intervention in a full-scale randomized clinical trial, which\n      will be supported by a U01 award.\n\n      The specific aims of the R34 grant are to promote the ability to conduct the future trial\n      by:\n\n        1. Developing a manual for the SADE intervention and assessing the intervention's\n           feasibility.\n\n        2. Collecting preliminary data on the intervention's effectiveness and potential\n           cost-savings.\n\n        3. Pilot testing the recruitment strategy and assessment battery that will be used in the\n           anticipated trial.\n\n        4. Developing the system of documents and data management for the future trial.\n\n        5. Generating the proposal for the U01 award to conduct the planned trial.\n\n      Research participants were 45 ethnically diverse children aged 6-12 years, 22 with ASD and\n      23 who are typically developing. Each child underwent two dental cleanings four months\n      apart: dental cleaning in a standard dental environment and dental cleaning in the sensory\n      adapted environment. For each group of children (i.e., ASD and typically developing), these\n      two conditions were compared in their effects on anxiety and negative behavioral reactions,\n      as measured by videotape coding, psychophysiological indices, and various rating scales."
