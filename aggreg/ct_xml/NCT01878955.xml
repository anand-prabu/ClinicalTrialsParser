  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      AMH is a member of the transforming growth factor family. It is produced by the granulosa
      cells from 36th weeks of pregnancy.Ovarian granulosa cells are the only source of the
      antimüllerian hormone. AMH production continues until response to exogenous FSH occurs and
      follicles reach 4-6 mm in diameter.The number of follicles in patients with polycystic
      ovaries are 2-6 times higher than normal women. Serum AMH levels are 2-3 times higher in
      patients with PCOS. The cause of elevated serum AMH levels in patients with PCOS is unknown.
      There are data showing elevated serum AMH level is due to the increase in the number of
      follicles 2-8 mm in diameter. Although there is no precise definition; multicystic ovarian
      is defined by the presence of more than six follicles 4-9 mm in diameter and mixed
      morphologically with PCO. PCO and multicystic ovaries are distinguished by the absence of
      the increase in stroma / volume.The aim of this study is to investigate whether there is a
      difference of serum AMH levels between patients with PCO or multicystic ovaries. A primary
      goal is to investigate the usability of AMH as a marker besides ultrasound for
      discrimination of nonhyperandrogenic patients with PCO or multicystic ovaries.

      It is planned to compare the values ​​of  FSH/LH, AMH, and 75 gr OGTT between 20 patients
      diagnosed as PCOS according to the AES-Rotterdam criteria and 20 patients with multicystic
      ovarian structure but do not provide the PCOS-D3 criteria. The second purpose of this study
      is to investigate the mechanism that leads to the elevation of AMH in patients with PCOS,
      and to reveal the effects of intraovarian paracrine factors,insulin resistance and FSH /LH.
