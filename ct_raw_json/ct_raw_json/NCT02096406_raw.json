            "textblock": "Coronary artery disease is a leading cause of death, hospitalization, and health care costs\n      in developed nations.  Coronary revascularization with coronary artery bypass graft (CABG)\n      surgery improves the long term survival in patients with diabetes and multi-vessel disease.\n      Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB)\n      reduce mortality and subsequent cardiac events in patients with coronary artery disease\n      undergoing CABG surgery when initiated at least 4 weeks pre-operatively.  Observational data\n      have suggested that pre-operative ACE administration is associated with an increased risk of\n      post-operative vasoplegic shock, acute kidney injury, and mortality; however, other studies\n      have failed to confirm these findings and further suggested ACE are associated with a\n      reduced risk of peri-operative myocardial infarction.  A single trial of 40 CABG patients\n      randomized to pre-operative ACE withdrawal or continuation reported that the withdrawal\n      group required significantly fewer vasopressors during cardiopulmonary bypass but more\n      intravenous vasodilators post-operatively to control hypertension.  Hence, it remains\n      unclear whether ACEs should be held or continued immediately prior to CABG surgery and a\n      survey of cardiac surgeons suggests that current clinical practice is divided. This pilot\n      study aims to establish the feasibility of the study design and to determine the frequency\n      of clinical endpoints among patients who continue and discontinue ACE prior to cardiac\n      surgery."
