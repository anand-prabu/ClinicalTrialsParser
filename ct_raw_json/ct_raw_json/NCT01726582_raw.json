The results of the test are used by the doctor to recommend therapy\n      (chemotherapy and radiation therapy) that the patient will receive before having surgery to\n      remove the adenocarcinoma. When the patient goes to surgery, the adenocarcinoma that is\n      removed is tested again. The results of that test are used to guide the choice of therapy\n      after surgery.\n\n      The chemotherapy drugs and the radiation therapy used in this clinical trial are already\n      approved for treatment of pancreas cancer. This trial is intended to establish which\n      treatment is best for a specific patient, based on test results from that patient's actual\n      adenocarcinoma.  In the past, the decision as to which treatment the patient will receive\n      was not based on testing of the actual adenocarcinoma.\n\n      Hypothesis:  Resectability rate, overall survival rate and progression-free survival will be\n      superior in patients with adenocarcinoma of the pancreas who receive targeted \"personalized\"\n      therapy,  as compared to historical data of patients who received standard therapy."
