            "textblock": "Background:\n\n        -  Multiple myeloma is rarely curable, but it is treatable. Initial treatment is directed\n           at controlling symptoms and reducing the number of myeloma cells. It continues until\n           the cancer stops responding to treatment. At that time, treatment may switch to\n           maintenance therapy, which is given to try to extend the response of the first therapy\n           for as long as possible. Research suggests that lenalidomide maintenance therapy may\n           delay the time for myeloma cells to start to grow and possibly improve survival.\n\n        -  Lenalidomide is a drug that may reduce or prevent the growth of cancer cells.\n           Researchers want to look at the long-term effect of lenalidomide on immune cells. It\n           will also look at the effects of extended treatment on the cancer and the immune\n           system.\n\n      Objectives:\n\n      - To test the long-term effectiveness of lenalidomide therapy for multiple myeloma.\n\n      Eligibility:\n\n      - Individuals at least 18 years of age with newly diagnosed or relapsed multiple myeloma.\n\n      Design:\n\n        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood and urine\n           sample will be collected. A bone scan and bone marrow biopsy will also be performed.\n\n        -  Participants will receive lenalidomide maintenance treatment. It will be given\n           according to the standard of care for multiple myeloma. Participants will take\n           lenalidomide every day for 21 days of repeated 28-day cycles.\n\n        -  Treatment will be monitored with frequent blood tests. Blood tests will look at the\n           effect of the treatment on the immune system.\n\n        -  Treatment will continue as long as the cancer does not worsen and the side effects are\n           not severe."
