    <textblock>
      This study is being done to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in
      participants with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tumors that are positive for
      programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1):  the hypothesis is that treatment with pembrolizumab
      will result in a clinically meaningful overall response rate (ORR).
