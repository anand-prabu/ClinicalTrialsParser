Compare\n      the postoperative complications occurring within 45 days after surgery unrelated to the\n      pancreas, days of hospitalization and survival at 45 days after surgery, number of\n      rehospitalizations, and number of postoperative blood units or packed red blood cells\n      administered in patients treated with these regimens.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. Patients\n      are randomized to one of two treatment arms. Arm I: Patients undergo surgical resection on\n      day 1 and receive vapreotide subcutaneously twice daily on days 1-7. Arm II: Patients\n      undergo surgical resection and receive a placebo as in arm I. Patients are followed at days\n      28 and 45.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 580 patients (290 per arm) will be accrued for this study."
