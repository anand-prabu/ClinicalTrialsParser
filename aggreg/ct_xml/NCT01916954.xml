  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malaria in pregnancy is a major cause of maternal and newborn morbidity and mortality in
      sub-Saharan Africa]. Effective antimalarial preventive and treatment regimens can
      significantly reduce malaria-related morbidity and mortality in the mother and baby.
      However, therapeutic choices are limited by concerns about possible toxicity to the fetus
      and because of these concerns pregnant women are normally excluded from clinical trials.
      This, combined with the lack of adverse events reporting system, results in a scarcity of
      data on drug safety and efficacy in pregnancy. Moreover, changes in the maternal physiology
      in pregnancy often alter the pharmacokinetic of drugs. Artemether-lumefantrine (ALN) is a
      highly efficacious artemisinin-based combination therapy approved by the World Health
      Organisation for use in the 2nd and 3rd trimesters, although it is still infrequently used
      in pregnancy and there is uncertainty as to the optimum dose. The pharmacokinetics of ALN
      are altered in pregnancy, resulting in reduced plasma concentrations and while the standard
      adult dose is still effective in high transmission settings, where pregnant women have
      higher levels of immunity, efficacy is reduced significantly in low transmission settings
      where women have lower levels of immunity. Inadequate antimalarial treatment dosing in
      pregnancy risks treatment failure or breakthrough infection and exposure of malaria
      parasites to sub-therapeutic drug concentrations thus selecting for drug resistance.

      The aim of the current trial is to compare the standard 3-day regimen of
      artemether-lumefantrine to a 5-day regimen of artemether-lumefantrine in a group of pregnant
      women and a control of non-pregnant women with uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria. The
      pharmacokinetics of lumefantrine is modified in pregnancy and the standard regimen used for
      treatment of adults might not be sufficient to cure malaria, therefore exposing pregnant
      women to sub-therapeutic drug levels and increased risk of clinical failure. Previous
      pharmacokinetic studies have shown that the standard 3-day treatment during pregnancy
      results in reduced plasma concentrations of artemether, dihydroartemisinin and lumefantrine
      and a faster elimination of lumefantrine. Low lumefantrine plasma concentrations at day 7
      are associated with therapeutic failure. Population-based simulations suggest that increased
      dose and treatment duration are needed for adequate drug exposure in these patients. We
      propose to assess the pharmacokinetics of a longer regimen of artemether-lumefantrine, (10
      doses of artemether-lumefantrine over five days) compared to the standard regimen, (6 doses
      of artemether-lumefantrine over three days) in a small group of pregnant African women with
      uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria. The longer regimen should ensure that curative plasma
      concentration of lumefantrine is reached, and is unlikely to result in any increased
      frequency of adverse events.
