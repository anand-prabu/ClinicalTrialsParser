Participants will be randomly\n      assigned to following one of two dietary approaches for weight loss: 1) a low-calorie\n      approach to weight loss (reducing caloric intake by approximately 500 calories per day) or\n      2) a low-fat, low-glycemic index vegan diet. A vegan diet is one that does not contain any\n      animal products (no meat, fish, poultry, eggs, or dairy) but emphasizes plant-based foods,\n      such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes/beans. In addition, this diet will be\n      low-glycemic index, which means the consumer will be asked to favor foods that don't cause a\n      quick rise in blood sugar (for example, favoring oatmeal over cornflakes for breakfast).\n      Participants will receive counseling and supporting materials on the dietary approach the\n      participants are assigned to follow. Both diets are safe and have shown to be effective ways\n      to assist with achieving a healthy weight. The investigators hypothesize that both groups\n      will see improvements in weight and fertility with possible greater improvements seen among\n      participants in the vegan group."

            "textblock": "This study involves two groups. You will be randomly assigned to one of these groups (i.e.\n      you do not have a choice for group assignment) which means your group will be assigned to\n      you by chance. Both groups will receive information on a dietary approach aimed at losing\n      weight.\n\n      One group will receive instruction on a low-calorie approach to weight loss (reducing\n      caloric intake by approximately 500 calories per day). The other group will be instructed to\n      follow a low-fat, low-glycemic index vegan diet. A vegan diet is one that does not contain\n      any animal products (no meat, fish, poultry, eggs, or dairy) but emphasizes plant-based\n      foods, such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes/beans. In addition, this  will\n      be a low-glycemic index diet, which means you will be asked to favor foods that don't cause\n      a quick rise in blood sugar (for example,  choosing oatmeal over cornflakes for breakfast).\n\n      Below are the steps in the study:\n\n      If you are accepted into the study, you will come to the study site (Fertility Center of the\n      Carolinas in Greenville) to learn more about the study and complete your consent form. If\n      you live outside the Columbia, SC area (more than a 60 mile drive), you may complete the\n      study orientation process over the phone and Web. You will be mailed a consent form to sign\n      and return to the study coordinator.  This study will involve 3-4 in-person visits to the\n      Fertility Center of the Carolinas office, each lasting approximately 1.5 to 2 hours.\n\n      You will complete some questionnaires that measure your diet and physical activity levels on\n      a computer at home or other location where you have computer/internet access.\n\n      You will come back for a meeting to have your weight measured. You will then be randomly\n      assigned to one of the two groups: calorie controlled group or vegan diet group. You will\n      receive a one-hour overview of the diet you have been assigned to and be provided with\n      materials on this diet.\n\n      During the study, we will ask you to complete a weekly questionnaire which will assess if\n      you are following the diet, your weight, and ask for information on your menstrual cycle.\n      This will take approximately 5 minutes to complete.\n\n      You will be provided individualized feedback each week via e-mail on your progress, along\n      with a weekly lesson on the topic for the week.\n\n      You will have access to a group website (a private Facebook group) that will provide group\n      support. Participation using this group is optional.\n\n      You will be provided with test strips to monitor ovulation each month and pregnancy tests (1\n      per month) to monitor pregnancy status.  You will report these results to us via online\n      survey.\n\n      Study personnel will host a weekly 30 minute webinar for your diet group online. This will\n      take place after work time on a weekday. Make-up sessions by phone during the work day will\n      be available.\n\n      At 3 months, you will be asked to complete another set of questionnaires from home and\n      return to our study site for your weight measurement.\n\n      You will continue the study for the next 3 months. At study completion (6 months), you will\n      complete the last set of questionnaires (online). Also, you will come to a follow-up\n      assessment to be weighed and to receive your incentive for participating ($10 +$5/month of\n      each menstrual cycle data submitted for a total of $25 possible).\n\n      Participants in both groups will be asked to take a daily prenatal vitamin (or other\n      reliable source of vitamin B-12) over the course of the study.\n\n      During the study, we will ask you to keep your physical activity levels constant (keep your\n      levels the same as what you were doing at study entry)."
