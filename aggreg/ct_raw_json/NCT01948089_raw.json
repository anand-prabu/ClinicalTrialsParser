Attention, memory and executive function impairments\n      can adversely affect the ability to relearn various skills.\n\n      Cognitive impairments and their impacts on other components of functioning not only impact\n      on the individual, but can also adversely affect the family via increases in caregiver\n      distress and burden. Thus, the presence of cognitive impairment has wide-reaching impact and\n      deserves effective and consistent intervention similar to the attention devoted to improving\n      function in physical domains.\n\n      Cognitive training can improve cognitive function, particularly in those areas known to\n      involved in vascular cognitive impairment, i.e., attentional and executive function.\n      Accumulating evidence indicates that computer-based training can improve cognitive skills in\n      healthy older adults as well as in clinical populations. Attention and working memory\n      training has also been shown to be effective in patients in the chronic phase post stroke.\n\n      The investigators propose that specific cognitive training to improve working memory could\n      provide direct benefit to chronic stroke patients.  Promising interventions focused on\n      intensive and direct working memory training are emerging and have been shown to generalize\n      to other cognitive domains, such as fluid intelligence."
