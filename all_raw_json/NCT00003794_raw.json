Compare quality of life in terms of health status, sexual functioning,\n      psychological/emotional well being, and social functioning in ovarian germ cell cancer\n      survivors vs a matched healthy control group. II. Predict quality of life in these patients\n      through the additive effects of cancer diagnosis and treatment, sociodemographic\n      characteristics, other stressors, and social network variables.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients identify up to 3 healthy acquaintance controls within 3 years of the same\n      age. Patients and controls complete a written questionnaire, which takes about 30 minutes,\n      and a telephone interview, which takes about 1 hour, to assess quality of life.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 190 patients and 190 healthy controls will be accrued for this\n      study within 2 years."
