One of the main chemicals felt to cause lung damage is Tumor Necrosis Factor\n      (TNF). Etanercept is an experimental drug that attempts to block TNF lung damage. Patients\n      will undergo blood tests, x-rays, and a bronchoscopy with broncho-alveolar lavage prior to\n      treatment with etanercept to check for infection. If no infection is evident after 24 hours,\n      the etanercept will be started and administered twice weekly for 4 weeks by subcutaneous\n      injection. There will be weekly blood tests and bronchoscopy after the last drug dose."
