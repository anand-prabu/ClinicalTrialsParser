    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to test the durability of response to Transcranial
      Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) for the symptoms of Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS). The
      investigators will test various methods of TMS for varying lengths of time in a  pilot study
      to investigate what the clinical impact.
