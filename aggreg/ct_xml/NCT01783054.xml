    <textblock>
      This study is for adult patients with adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. The purpose of this
      research study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the drugs Gemcitabine and
      Abraxane in the treatment of adenocarcinoma of the pancreas before surgery. Subjects will
      have screening tests to determine if he or she is eligible to participate in this study.

      If subjects are eligible and wish to enroll in the study, they will begin chemotherapy
      treatment with Gemcitabine and Abraxane. After subjects have received treatment with these
      drugs, they will have surgery. Subjects will also have post treatment and follow up
      evaluations. Subjects may have 2 cycles of treatment and each cycle is 28 days. All subjects
      will be followed every 3 months for 3 years after their initial registration.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has histologically or cytologically confirmed potentially resectable
             adenocarcinoma of the pancreas including tumors in the pancreatic head, uncinate
             process, neck and body that are potentially resectable by pancreatico-duodenectomy

          -  Definition of localized, potentially resectable disease:

             tomography (2.5 mm cuts or less) or MRI (for patients with an IV contrast allergy)
             using pancreatic protocol. Endoscopic ultrasound is required for tissue acquisition
             and staging confirmation.

             mesenteric vein/portal vein (SMV/PV) with &lt; 180-degree abutment and no evidence of
             invasion.

          -  Clear fat plane between the SMA and celiac axis.

          -  No extension to celiac axis and hepatic artery.

          -  Patent superior mesenteric vein and portal vein.

          -  No evidence of distant disease.

          -  Male or non-pregnant and non-lactating female, and ≥ 18 years of age.

          -  Patient has the following blood chemistry levels at baseline:

          -  AST (SGOT), ALT (SGPT) ≤ 2.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN);

          -  Alkaline phosphatase (AP) ≤ 2.5 X ULN;

          -  Total bilirubin ≤ 2.0mg/dL.

          -  Serum creatinine ≤1.5mg/dl or calculated clearance ≥ 50 mL/min/1.73 m² for patients
             with serum creatinine levels &gt;1.5 mg/dl.

          -  Patient has acceptable coagulation status. For patients not receiving
             anticoagulation: International Normalized Ratio of a measure of prothrombin time
             (INR) &lt; 1.3.

          -  Patient has an ECOG performance status PS 0-2.

          -  Patient has been informed about the nature of the study, and has agreed to
             participate in the study, and signed the Informed Consent Form prior to participation
             in any study-related activities.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has borderline resectable, locally advanced unresectable or advanced
             metastatic disease. Patients with adenocarcinoma of the distal pancreatic body or
             tail are ineligible. Patients with endocrine tumors, lymphoma of the pancreas, or
             ampullary cancer are also ineligible.

          -  Patient has active, uncontrolled bacterial, viral, or fungal infection(s) requiring
             systemic therapy.

          -  Patient has known infection with HIV.

          -  Patient has undergone major surgery, other than diagnostic surgery (i.e.surgery done
             to obtain a biopsy for diagnosis without removal of an organ), within 4 weeks prior
             to Day 1 of treatment in this study.

          -  Patient has a history of allergy or hypersensitivity to the study drugs.

          -  Patient has serious medical risk factors involving any of the major organ systems
             such that the Investigator considers it unsafe for the patient to receive
             chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy.

          -  Patients requires chronic use of immunosuppressive agents (e.g. methotrexate,
             cyclosporine).

          -  No other prior malignancy is allowed except for the following: adequately treated
             basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, in situ cervical cancer, adequately treated
             Stage I or II cancer from which the patient is currently in complete remission, or
             any other cancer from which the patient has been disease-free for five years.

          -  Patients must not have clinically significant cardiovascular disease (including
             myocardial infarction, unstable angina, symptomatic congestive heart failure, serious
             uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia) &lt; 1 year before randomization.

          -  Patient is unwilling or unable to comply with study procedures.

          -  Patient is enrolled in any other therapeutic clinical protocol or investigational
             trial.

          -  Patients aged ≥ 80 are not excluded. However, candidates in this age group should be
             thoroughly evaluated before enrollment in the study, to ensure they are fit to
             receive chemotherapy, and to potentially undergo pancreaticoduodenectomy. In addition
             to meeting all of the baseline patient selection criteria, clinical judgment on their
             susceptibility to infection and expected stability of their performance status and
             suitability to receive intensive chemotherapy cycles, should be paid special
             attention to. Patients should not be enrolled in the study should there be any
             hesitation on any of these considerations. Baseline criteria for all patients
             enrolled on the study must be carefully evaluated and all criteria followed
             appropriately.
