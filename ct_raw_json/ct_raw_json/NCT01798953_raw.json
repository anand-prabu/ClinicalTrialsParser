            "textblock": "Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is characterised by inflammation and fibrosis of the\n      biliary tree and the condition can lead to end-stage liver disease. PSC is strongly\n      associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), with a prevalence of IBD in PSC as high as\n      60-84 % in Northern Europe and North America. The majority of patients with IBD and PSC have\n      ulcerative colitis (UC).\n\n      Considering all patients with UC, around 30% will ultimately require surgery; the most\n      common indications are acute colitis, chronic refractory disease or colorectal dysplasia.\n      The standard procedure is proctocolectomy and ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA). However,\n      ileo-rectal anastomosis (IRA) or conventional ileostomy are options. The prognosis after\n      surgery is generally considered good.\n\n      Previous studies have shown that the course of colitis in patients with UC/PSC is different\n      from that of patients with UC-only.\n\n      In a patient with UC, several aspects have to be considered at counselling before surgery.\n      However, in many aspects, the literature is substantial for patients with UC-only (for\n      example function and quality of life after IPAA) and key information can be safely provided.\n      Conversely, patients with UC/PSC that require colectomy are rare and as a consequence, data\n      on most aspects is sparse (18-20).\n\n      The aim of the study was to assess outcome after surgery (IPAA or IRA) in patients with\n      UC/PSC.  Focus was on pouch/rectal function, pouchitis, surgical complications and failure.\n      Patients with UC-only were employed as controls."
