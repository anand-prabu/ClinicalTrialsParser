Infants were divided into two groups of 1200-1700 and 1701-2200g based on\n      the weight and the weight of each group were randomized into artificial night(dark period\n      was from 19 to 7 during incubator was covered with linen cloth & light period was from 7 to\n      19 removed the cover) and control groups(continuous lighting).   Mothers & infants through\n      questionnaires,interviews,observation & document completion, changes in physiologic & weight\n      befor entering the study & then physiologic changes twice a day,weight & feeding tolerance\n      were collected daily.Data were analyzed using spss v.16 software."

The vital signsand & arterial oxygen saturation of the infants in the intervention group were controlled before covering the incubator i.e. at 19. Also, the infant's vital signs were again monitored at 7 am.The infant weighed in every day at 7 am during the 10 days of study. Feeding tolerance was daily determined at 8 am,  using nasogastric tube or orogastric tube to control residue as well as to review the presence or absence of abdominal distention, vomiting.",
