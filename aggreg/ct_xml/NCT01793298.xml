  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the dry powder
      formulation of ASM-024 following single and multiple administration by inhalation of
      ascending doses in healthy subjects and subjects with stable moderate asthma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I/II, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of single ascending
      and multiple ascending doses of ASM-024 administered by dry powder inhalation to healthy
      subjects and subjects with stable moderate asthma. The goal of this study is to evaluate the
      safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic profile of a new, dry powder formulation of
      ASM-024.  The doses that will be tested in subjects with asthma will be determined based on
      the information collected first in healthy volunteers.  In addition to standard safety and
      tolerability evaluations, the acute effects of the study medication on the airways will be
      assessed.
