Symptomatic treatments such\n      as the placement of a feeding tube, can compensate for the inability to swallow. Riluzole,\n      the only approved treatment for ALS, may slow disease progression but no treatment is\n      curative and none have improved function.\n\n      Unexpectedly, Nuedexta\u00ae, approved for the treatment of labile emotionality that occurs in\n      association with ALS and other neurological disorders, has been observed to improve bulbar\n      function, primarily speech and swallowing, in a number of neurological disorders, including\n      ALS. The basis for this is conjectural but likely due to a direct effect of the drug on\n      motor neurons in the part of the brain that controls speech and swallowing. The same part of\n      the brain appears to modulate the expression of emotions and interestingly the site of\n      action of the drug is the same as a site that has been implicated in a juvenile form of ALS.\n\n      This is a multicenter, randomized double-blind, placebo controlled, cross over study\n      evaluating the palliative effect of Nuedexta\u00ae on bulbar dysfunction. It is expected that\n      approximately 60 ALS patients from 7 clinical centers in the US will be enrolled."
