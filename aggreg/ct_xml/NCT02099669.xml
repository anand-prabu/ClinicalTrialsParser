    <textblock>
      Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are bone marrow malignancies characterized by poor bone
      marrow function that may progress to acute myeloid leukemia. Many patients become red blood
      cell transfusion-dependent. Transfusion dependence is associated with inferior quality of
      life (QOL). However, the relationship between the degree of anemia and QOL is less clear. A
      commonly used transfusion strategy is to target the hemoglobin (Hb) in the range of 80-90
      g/L (normal hemoglobin &gt; 120-130g/L). The question is: would a higher hemoglobin target lead
      to improvement in QOL despite the negative impact transfusion dependence may have on QOL
      (due to associated time commitments, expense, transfusion reactions etc). Several groups
      have prospectively shown that targeting hemoglobin levels of greater than 120 g/L (with
      hematopoietic growth factors (HGFs) and/or blood transfusions) or incremental increases of
      15-20 g/L (with HGFs alone) were associated with improved QOL. The investigators MDS program
      has been conducting prospective assessments of QOL since 2007 in all registered and
      consented patients using a variety of validated questionnaires. Preliminary analysis (in 236
      patients) revealed that, compared with an age-matched healthy general population, MDS
      patients have inferior QOL. Transfusion dependence and anemia were independently predictive
      of poor functioning, fatigue and decreased health utility. Furthermore, a hemoglobin level
      of ≥100 g/L seemed to be the key threshold for improvement in function and symptom scores.
      The investigators hypothesize that the target hemoglobins in transfusion dependent MDS
      patients are too low and this may account for their inferior quality of life.  Our goal is
      to compare the effect on QOL of a restrictive strategy (which is the current standard of
      care), with a liberal transfusion strategy in a large randomized controlled trial of
      transfusion dependent MDS outpatients. Before embarking on such an endeavor, the
      investigators must first prove feasibility in a smaller pilot randomized controlled trial.

    <description>The percentage compliance of q2weekly hemoglobins being within or above the target range of the RBC transfusion threshold assigned (after the 4 week run-in at study start as defined above). We will consider this study feasible and worthy of future development into a larger randomized trial (powered for QOL difference) if compliance is ≥70%. A compliance rate of 50-70%, would not exclude going forward with such an RCT but only after careful discussion and statistical planning</description>
