Determine the antileukemic efficacy of arsenic trioxide in patients with\n      relapsed and/or refractory, chronic, accelerated, or blastic phase chronic myelogenous\n      leukemia. II. Determine the pattern of clinical adverse experience in this patient\n      population administered this drug.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to disease stage (chronic phase vs accelerated\n      phase or blastic phase). Patients receive arsenic trioxide IV over 1 hour on consecutive\n      days or weekdays only for a total of 25 days followed by 3-5 weeks of rest. Treatment\n      continues for a maximum of 6 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease\n      progression. Patients with responding disease are followed at least monthly.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10-27 patients will be accrued for the chronic phase stratum\n      of this study within 2 years. A total of 17-37 patients will be accrued for the accelerated\n      and blastic phases stratum of this study within 2 years."
