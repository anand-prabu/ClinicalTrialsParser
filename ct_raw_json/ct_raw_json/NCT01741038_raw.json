            "textblock": "Breast cancer is the most prevalent malignancy in women affecting more than 1 million women\n      a year and metastatic breast cancer (MBC) is a leading cause of mortality, accounting for\n      more than 400,000 deaths annually worldwide. Anthracycline- and taxane-containing regimens\n      have been established as the most effective chemotherapeutic agents for first- and\n      second-line therapies in MBC with respect to a prolongation of survival time.   Because of\n      this, more women are receiving anthracyclines and taxanes early in the treatment of the\n      disease. Even despite this recent trend toward aggressive treatment of early stage breast\n      cancer with anthracyclines and taxanes, nearly half of these women will have metastatic\n      recurrence. The prior exposure to anthracycline and taxane drugs leaves women facing\n      first-line therapy for metastatic recurrent disease resistant to anthracycline and taxane\n      drugs and, thus, with limited treatment options. US FDA currently approved ixabepilone\n      (Ixempra) and Havalan (Eribulin) in this setting, but these drugs have not been shown to\n      provide a survival advantage compared to capecitabine (Xeloda). However, only approximately\n      25% of MBC patients respond to capecitabine. In addition, these approved drugs and other\n      chemotherapy drug options have significant toxicity profiles. Accordingly, there is a need\n      for new effective treatments for women with MBC that have been previously pre-treated with\n      taxane, anthracycline and capecitabine. This study is designed to determine if AlloStim will\n      provide a survival benefit to these woman.\n\n      Resistance to anthracycline and taxane is defined clinically as disease recurrence within 6\n      months of completion of adjuvant or neoadjuvant treatment with these agents or tumor\n      progression that occurs during treatment or within 3 months of the last dose of treatment."
