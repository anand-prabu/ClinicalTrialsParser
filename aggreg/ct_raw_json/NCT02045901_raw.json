Participants will receive\n      telephone calls daily to assess whether the current dosing regimen is sufficient at\n      relieving NVP symptoms, to review study procedures, and to address her questions/concerns.\n      Participants will return to the clinic for evaluation on Day 4 (\u00b11 day) and Day 15 (\u00b11 day)\n      for an end of-study visit.\n\n      Eligible participants are those between 12 and 17 years of age, pregnant with a gestational\n      age of 7 to 14 weeks, suffering from NVP, with a PUQE score \u22656, and who have not responded\n      to conservative management consisting of dietary/lifestyle advice according to the 2004\n      American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG) Practice Bulletin."

            "criteria": {
                "textblock": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n          1. The participant is a pregnant female between the following ages: at least 12 years on\n             the day of recruitment (ie, Day 1) and not yet 18 years on the last day of the study\n             (ie, Day 15).\n\n          2. The participant must provide written informed consent to participate in the study,\n             and agrees that she will follow dosing instructions and complete all required study\n             visits.\n\n          3. The participant's entry ultrasound indicates a viable pregnancy and confirms\n             gestational age of the fetus is 7-14 weeks at the anticipated time of the first dose\n             of study drug. If an ultrasound was performed within 4 weeks of the study entry\n             visit, and results can be obtained, an additional ultrasound is not necessary.\n\n          4. The participant is suffering from NVP and has a PUQE score \u22656.\n\n          5. The participant has not responded to conservative management consisting of\n             dietary/lifestyle advice according to the 2004 ACOG Practice Bulletin.\n\n          6. The participant agrees, if on a multivitamin, to continue on her current dose of\n             multivitamin for the duration of the trial.\n\n          7. The participant does not plan termination of the pregnancy.\n\n          8. On the basis of medical history, physical examination and screening laboratory tests,\n             the participant is judged to be in good health.\n\n          9. The participant must be able to swallow the study drug whole (ie, without splitting,\n             crushing, or chewing the tablets).\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          1. The investigator confirms the participant's nausea and vomiting is of etiology other\n             than NVP.\n\n          2. The participant has gestational trophoblastic disease or multifetal gestation.\n\n          3. The participant has a condition for which antihistamines, in the opinion of the\n             investigator, are contraindicated (eg, epilepsy, alcoholism, glaucoma, chronic lung\n             disease, urinary retention, and heart block).\n\n          4. The participant has a known hypersensitivity to doxylamine succinate other\n             ethanolamine derivative antihistamines, pyridoxine hydrochloride, or any inactive\n             ingredient in the Diclegis or placebo formulation.\n\n          5. The participant is taking a monoamine oxidase inhibitor.\n\n          6. The participant has used antihistamines, anticholinergics, dopamine antagonists,\n             serotonin antagonists, ginger, or anti-emetic therapy (including acupressure,\n             acupuncture, homeopathic remedies, medical hypnosis, and relief bands) to treat NVP\n             in the previous 48 hours or plans to do so during the study.\n\n          7. The participant is using drugs that have anticholinergic activity (eg, tricyclic\n             antidepressants).\n\n          8. The participant is taking multivitamins containing more than 10 mg of vitamin B6 or\n             plans to do so during the study.\n\n          9. The participant is taking supplementary vitamin B6 in addition to any multivitamin\n             preparation or plans to do so during the study.\n\n         10. The participant is currently drinking any amount of alcohol.\n\n         11. The participant has any condition that might interfere with the conduct of the study,\n             in the opinion of the investigator. For example, Diclegis\u00ae should be used with\n             caution in females with asthma, increased intraocular pressure, narrow angle\n             glaucoma, stenosing peptic ulcer, pyloroduodenal obstruction and urinary bladder-neck\n             obstruction.\n\n         12. The participant is likely to be unable to comply with study procedures because of\n             inadequate cognitive or language skills.\n\n         13. The participant has received an investigational drug within 30 days before enrollment\n             in this study or is scheduled to receive an investigational drug during the course of\n             this study.\n\n         14. The participant is currently breastfeeding."
