In\n      essence, patients who consent to participate will be asked a series of questions pertaining\n      to the quality of their life and possible medical problems that they may be encountering.\n      In addition, they will receive a complete physical examination and undergo non-invasive\n      investigations designed to identify the presence of unsuspected late effects.  Investigators\n      in the Eye Clinic, Dental Clinic, Audiology, Cardiology and Endocrinology departments will\n      participate in the protocol.  As a part of the study, blood samples will be obtained to\n      investigate the possibility that predisposing genetic factors may be identifiable in the\n      patients normal cells (e.g., p53 mutations, evidence of DNA instability).  If such\n      abnormalities are detected, blood samples from family members will also be examined to\n      determine whether the defect was inherited."
