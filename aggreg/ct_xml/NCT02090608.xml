  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Proteinuria is the predominant risk factor for renal disease progression in Fabry disease
      (FD). When urine protein excretion is controlled to &lt;0.50 g/24 hr, the rate loss of
      glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is not significantly different from 0. However, enzyme
      replacement therapy (ERT) alone does not decrease proteinuria and it has been recommended
      that patients receiving ERT also receive anti  Renin-Angiotensin-System (RAS) therapy.
      Emerging evidences show that paricalcitol (PCT) reduces proteinuria in presence of
      intensified inhibition of RAS; however, there is no evidence in FD. The aim of this study is
      to evaluate the antiproteinuric effect of PCT in FD patients with proteinuria &gt;0.50 g/24 hr
      persisting despite the ERT and anti-RAS therapy titrated to maximum tolerated dosage.

    <description>Fourteen Fabry patients will be selected and studied in the first six months of add-on oral PCT (1 mcg/day) and, in order to verify the dependence of proteinuria reduction on PCT, three months after drug withdrawal.</description>

    <description>In patients identified by the inclusion criteria, data will be collected at baseline , during administration of oral Paricalcitol (PCT) (after 1, 3 and 6 months), and three months after PCT withdrawal. PCT will administered at dosage of 1 mcg/day; this dosage was chosen as it is not associated with excessive decline of parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels in most patients</description>
