    <textblock>
      In this double blind, placebo controlled, parallel group study, the relative uptake of 1g/d
      krill oil in comparison to 1g/d fish oil in healthy female and male adults will be assessed.

      Primary objective is to determine if a 12 week supplementation with krill oil increases
      tissue levels in erythrocytes (omega-3 index) significantly more than fish oil after dose
      adjustments to EPA and DHA levels.
