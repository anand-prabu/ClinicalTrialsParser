            "textblock": "Radiation therapy is one of the standard treatments for men with prostate cancer who have\n      detectable levels of prostate specific antigen (PSA, a prostate cancer specific marker)\n      after surgery. When radiation therapy is given to patients who have an increase in PSA after\n      surgery, it is called \"salvage radiation therapy\".  Currently the standard radiation therapy\n      course length for this type of cancer is around 7 \u00bd -8 weeks. Sometimes, radiation therapy\n      after prostate removal causes unpleasant side effects.  A shorter course of radiation\n      therapy, known as a \"hypofractionated\" course, gives fewer but higher doses of radiation\n      than standard radiation.\n\n      The purpose of this study is to test the safety of a shorter course of radiation therapy at\n      progressively lower dose levels and shorter lengths of treatment (hypofractionated) with\n      patients who have had their prostate removed.  The study will assess whether the\n      hypofractionated course works better without causing additional side effects to the\n      remaining cancer cells in the prostate bed."
