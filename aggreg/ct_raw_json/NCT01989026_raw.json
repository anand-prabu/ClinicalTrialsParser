            "textblock": "Observational studies in high-mortality areas have shown that the BCG vaccine is associated\n      with marked benefits in child survival. These results cannot be explained by prevention of\n      tuberculosis, which is rare during the firsts years of life. These observations have\n      recently been tested at the Bandim Health Project (BHP) in Guinea-Bissau in randomized\n      trials among low birth weight (LBW, <2500 g) children. According to local practice, BCG is\n      typically postponed in LBW infants until 4-6 weeks of age. Results showed that providing BCG\n      at the time of discharge from the hospital compared with BCG later reduced neonatal\n      mortality by more than 40%. The protective effect started already within the first three\n      days. Based on verbal autopsies, BCG protected the children against neonatal septicemia and\n      pneumonia. Recent immunological studies have indicated that BCG induces epigenetic changes\n      which reprogram the innate immune system to increased pro-inflammatory responses against\n      unrelated pathogens; hence, BCG may indeed have a non-specific beneficial effect protecting\n      against other infections.\n\n      BCG is recommended at birth by the World Health Organization (WHO), but is rarely given\n      immediately at birth. In Guinea-Bissau, at the National Hospital's maternity ward, children\n      are currently vaccinated at discharge. For children who are born healthy, this usually means\n      1-2 days after the delivery. However, very small children and ill children are admitted to\n      the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), and often stay there for days to weeks before they\n      are discharged - and only receive BCG at the time of discharge. The mortality among children\n      in the NICU is alarmingly high - it was 14% (254/1877) among children admitted to the NICU\n      from November 2007 to May 2013 (unpublished data). A substantial number of children that\n      died had normal birth weight and high Apgar scores. In most cases the underlying cause of\n      death was infectious diseases, which could potentially be affected by BCG vaccination.\n      Hence, the present aim is to conduct a randomized trial at the NICU to study the effect of\n      providing BCG immediately (intervention group) versus BCG at discharge (control group). The\n      primary outcome will be mortality during hospital stay, with cause of death, growth and\n      length of stay as secondary outcomes.\n\n      HYPOTHESIS\n\n      Providing BCG vaccination upon admission to newborn children in the NICU rather than at\n      discharge is associated with 40% reduction in mortality at the NICU.\n\n      METHODS\n\n      Setting\n\n      The randomized trial will be conducted by the Bandim Health Project in Guinea-Bissau, at the\n      NICU at the National Hospital Sim\u00e3o Mendes. The Bandim Health Project (BHP) maintains a\n      health and demographic surveillance system (HDSS) in six suburban districts of the capital\n      of Guinea-Bissau and covers approximately 102,000 inhabitants. All houses in the study area\n      are visited monthly to register new pregnancies and births. All children below 3 years of\n      age are followed through home visits every third month. The National Hospital where many\n      women from the study area give birth is a few kilometers away. The BHP has worked at the\n      hospital's maternity ward for many years, conducting trials of different health\n      interventions and other observational studies to reduce infant mortality.\n\n      Study design\n\n      Children will be randomly allocated (1:1) to BCG at admission or at discharge (as per\n      current standard of care).\n\n      Enrolment procedures\n\n      The BHP team is present at the maternity ward every day. The team will visit the NICU and\n      identify children admitted since their last visit. The mother will have the study explained\n      in the local language (Portuguese Creole), and also receive a written explanation in\n      Portuguese. She will be briefly interviewed about background factors (education, previous\n      deliveries, etc.). Anthropometric measures will be obtained and a Ballard score assessed by\n      a trained nurse.\n\n      Randomization\n\n      Provided consent, the mother will draw a lot which indicates if the child will receive BCG\n      immediately or BCG at discharge as usual. To ensure equal distribution of different\n      categories of children and calendar time, randomization will be done in blocks within three\n      groups of children; a) children at the NICU who are in an incubator (most severely ill); b)\n      children at the NICU who are not in incubator (less ill, including also children born by\n      caesarean section whose mother is indisposed); c) Newborn children transferred from the NICU\n      to the Pediatric ward for treatment.\n\n      Intervention\n\n      Immediately after randomization, children who were allocated to BCG vaccine will be\n      vaccinated intradermally with 0.05 ml BCG vaccine (Statens Serum Institute, Denmark). The\n      control group will receive BCG at discharge. All children will receive oral polio vaccine\n      (OPV) at the time of BCG vaccination.\n\n      The study is therefore testing BCG+OPV at admission to the NICU (intervention arm) vs.\n      BCG+OPV at discharge from NICU (control arm). Same-sex twin pairs will receive the same\n      treatment.\n\n      Blinding\n\n      The BHP team will be in charge of randomization and vaccination. These procedures will take\n      place without the participation of the NICU staff. BCG vaccination leaves a small mark on\n      the skin of the child, which vanishes quickly, leaving no sign until a papule is formed\n      several weeks later. To further ensure blinding of hospital staff, a small gauze patch will\n      be placed over the injection site in both groups, for the entire hospital stay.\n\n      Follow-up\n\n      -At the hospital\n\n      The BHP team will visit the NICU every day and ascertain the vital status of all enrolled\n      children and that the plasters have not been removed. All clinical and biological parameters\n      registered by the NICU staff, including weight, temperature and respiratory frequency will\n      also be recorded. The main outcome is survival during the stay at the NICU.\n\n      -After discharge\n\n      At the day of discharge, the BHP team will assure that all children randomised to the\n      control group receive BCG and OPV before leaving the hospital. The children being discharged\n      will be offered transport to their home. The subgroup of children stemming from the BHP\n      study area, approximately 20%, will also be followed routinely through the BHP's HDSS,\n      allowing explorative long-term follow-up for mortality and growth of this subgroup.\n\n      Statistical analysis\n\n      The mortality data will be analyzed in Cox proportional hazards models - both combined and\n      separately for children in incubators and those lying in normal beds. Due to the expected\n      high number of twins, all analyses will be adjusted for interdependency between twins. The\n      analyses will include the overall effect of BCG on survival, and by cause of death.\n\n      Length of stay and weight gain at discharge among surviving children will be analyzed using\n      linear regression. To prevent bias in these analyses which could arise if BCG was\n      particularly beneficial for survival among the smallest children, control and intervention\n      children will be matched by a computer program based on birth weight, and pairs of children\n      in which one child dies will be excluded from the analysis. All analyses will be adjusted\n      for time from birth to enrolment.\n\n      Sample size\n\n      The NICU admits around 340 children per year. The median length of stay is 6 days. With an\n      average mortality of 14% in 340 children per year, at least 45 deaths occur per year. With a\n      mortality of 14% it is necessary to enrol 1064 children to detect a 40% difference in\n      mortality between BCG-vaccinated and BCG-unvaccinated children with 80% power and a\n      significance level of 5%. This corresponds to 120 deaths. If mortality declines (as it has\n      done over the last years in the BHP study area), the event number would have to be slightly\n      higher; with a mortality of 12% it would be necessary to continue to 122 deaths to maintain\n      the same power; if it declines to 10% it would be 124 deaths. With 1064 children a\n      difference in the mean length of stay of one day with 80% power and a significance level of\n      5% can be detected.\n\n      Based on this data, the investigators expect to reach the needed number of events during a\n      period of 4 years, taking into account that some children will have died before they can be\n      enrolled and some children will be too ill to be enrolled.\n\n      ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS\n\n      The study protocol has been approved by The Danish Central Ethical Committee and the\n      National Ethical Committee in Guinea-Bissau. The trial will be registered at\n      clinicaltrials.gov. In previous studies BCG was safe for LBW children and even more\n      beneficial among the smallest children. A local clinical monitor and a Data Safety and\n      Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be appointed."
