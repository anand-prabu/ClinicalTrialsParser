The capillary to fiber interface is reduced\n      and impact the exercise capacity of the patients. While exercise training induce a\n      physiological angiogenesis, we have recently observed that there was a blunted muscle\n      angiogenesis after training in COPD patients. This could be the consequence a an inadequate\n      training duration or intensity. Aim of the study: Compare the muscle micro-vascular response\n      to training (capillary-to-fiber ratio) at 5 and 10 weeks, in sedentary healthy subject\n      trained at the intensity of the ventilatory threshold (60-65% of VO2max), versus :- COPD\n      patients trained at a similar intensity (60-65% of VO2max)- COPD patients trained at a\n      similar absolute intensity (90% of VO2max)."
