To determine the overall response rate (complete response [CR] and partial response [PR])\n      of hairy cell leukemia (HCL) at 32 weeks after beginning therapy with single-agent\n      ibrutinib.\n\n      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. To characterize the toxicity and tolerability of single-agent ibrutinib when administered\n      to patients with HCL.\n\n      II. To characterize the progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of single- agent\n      ibrutinib when administered to patients with HCL.\n\n      III. To determine the rate of molecular remission (minimal residual disease [MRD]-negative\n      CR) among all patients, defined as resolution of all detectable disease below the limits of\n      detection by immunohistochemistry and/or 4-color flow cytometry assay at 32 weeks after\n      beginning ibrutinib therapy.\n\n      IV. To characterize immunologic outcomes during single agent ibrutinib administration.\n\n      V. To explore the effect of PCI-32765 (ibrutinib) on traditional and new biomarkers in HCL\n      including: confirmation of expression v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B V600E\n      mutation (BRAFV600E) in leukemia cells; pharmacodynamic effects of Bruton agammaglobulinemia\n      tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibition on phospho extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)\n      regulation, as well as other potential protein kinase targets of ibrutinib (exploratory);\n      serum soluble interleukin (IL)-2 receptor correlation with response to ibrutinib therapy;\n      documentation of and quantification of minimal residual disease following maximal response,\n      with flow cytometric analysis and immunohistochemical stains of the bone marrow, as\n      predictors of remission duration after ibrutinib therapy.\n\n      OUTLINE:\n\n      Patients receive ibrutinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28\n      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months."
