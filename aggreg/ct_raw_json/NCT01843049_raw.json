The hypothesis is that selective\n      dose boost to the esophageal GTV could be safely delivered using a simultaneous integrated\n      boost (SIB) technique, and that boosting the high 18F-deoxyglucose (FDG) uptake areas of the\n      esophageal GTV defined prior to treatment may improve local tumor control."
