Medical literature (Cochrane review)\n      demonstrates there is little evidence for the  treatments used for IIH. Weight control\n      appears the most effective method of improving symptoms but weight loss is difficult to\n      maintain. 11\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11\u03b2-HSD1) is an enzyme which regulates\n      local steroid levels and our previous research suggests it may influence the production of\n      brain fluid(cerebrospinal fluid or CSF). 11\u03b2-HSD1 levels fall with weight loss and this is\n      associated with with decreased intracranial pressure.\n\n      Our primary outcome is to determine whether AZD4017, an inhibitor of 11\u03b2-HSD1, will reduce\n      the pressure in the brain and as a consequence improve IIH. Patients are eligible to enter\n      the study if they are between 18-55 years old with acute (<6 months) IIH, signs of active\n      disease (papilloedema and raised CSF  pressure (>25 cmH20)), no other major illnesses and\n      have no plans for pregnancy during the study period.\n\n      This is an MRC funded single centre, phase II, double-blinded, randomised control drug\n      trial. It will be conducted at the University Hospital Birmingham and the University of\n      Birmingham will act as Sponsor. Eligible participants will be randomly assigned to AZD4017\n      or a placebo ('dummy' with no active drug) for 3 months with a follow up a month later.\n      Investigations during the study will include bloods, urine samples, pregnancy tests, lumbar\n      punctures, DXA scans and small fat/skin biopsies. Participants will benefit from increased\n      monitoring and a potential improvement in their condition.\n\n      We hypothesise that specific inhibition of 11\u03b2-HSD1 will decrease intracranial pressure and\n      consequently treat patients with IIH, thus opening a new and entirely novel therapeutic\n      avenue."
