  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overarching goal of this study is to build the most cost-effective adaptive
      implementation intervention involving a site-level implementation intervention strategy:
      Replicating Effective Programs (REP), and the augmentation of REP using either External
      Facilitation or a combination of an External and Internal Facilitation to improve patient
      outcomes and the uptake of an evidence-based program for mood disorders (Life Goals-LG) in
      community settings.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite the availability of psychosocial evidence-based practices (EBPs), quality and
      outcomes for persons with mental disorders remain suboptimal because of organizational
      barriers to implementation. Replicating Effective Programs (REP), a site-level
      implementation strategy applied to promote the use of psychosocial treatments in
      community-based practices, still resulted in less than half of sites actually sustaining the
      use of these treatments. Based on input from community partners and previous research, the
      study team subsequently enhanced REP to include Facilitation, a novel implementation
      strategy which addresses site-level organizational barriers to EBP adoption beyond REP's
      emphasis on fidelity. Two Facilitation roles were developed: External and Internal
      Facilitators. External Facilitators (EFs) reside outside the clinic, are supported by the
      study, and provide technical expertise to providers in adapting and using EBPs in routine
      practice. Internal Facilitators (IFs) are employed by the sites, have a direct reporting
      relationship to site leadership, and have the local knowledge to help providers implement
      EBPs. IFs also address site-specific organizational barriers that may not be observable at
      baseline or by EFs. The overarching goal of this study is to build the most cost-effective
      adaptive implementation intervention involving REP and the augmentation of the EF and IF
      roles to improve patient outcomes and the uptake of an EBP for mood disorders (Life
      Goals-LG) in community settings. The primary aim of this clustered randomized trial is to
      determine, among sites not initially responding to REP (i.e., limited LG uptake), the effect
      of adaptive implementation interventions in sites receiving External and Internal
      Facilitator (REP+EF/IF) versus External Facilitator alone (REP+EF) on improved patient-level
      outcomes, including mental health quality of life and decreased symptoms, as well as
      increased LG use among patients with mood disorders after 12 months. Secondary aims are to
      determine, among sites that continue to exhibit non-response after 12 months, the effect of
      continuing Facilitation on patient-level outcomes at 24 months, describe the implementation
      of EF and IF, and to conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis of REP+EF/IF compared to REP+EF
      over the 24-month period. A representative cohort of 80 community-based outpatient clinics
      (total 1,600 patients) from different U.S. regions (Michigan, Colorado, and Arkansas) will
      be included in this study. We will use a Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial
      (SMART) design to build the best adaptive implementation intervention. This groundbreaking
      study design will address three crucial implementation issues: First, IFs are costly for
      sites since they require additional administrative effort. Second, the extent to which an
      off-site EF alone versus the addition of an on-site IF can improve patient outcomes in
      community settings is unclear. Finally, among sites that continue to exhibit non-response
      after 12 months of Facilitation, the value of continuing the implementation strategy (i.e.,
      delayed effect) has not been assessed, especially in smaller practices from more rural
      settings.
