            "textblock": "Multivessel coronary artery disease has been reported to occur in 40 to 67% of ST elevation\n      myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients. Multivessel coronary artery disease (MVCD) patients,\n      who have experienced STEMI, are at a high risk of major cardiovascular events (MACE) within\n      one year after primary PCI. While MACE incidence in patients with one-vessel coronary artery\n      disease is about 14.5%, patients with two- and three-vessel lesions experience MACE in 19.5%\n      and 23.6% of cases, respectively. The risk of death in a 5-year follow-up increases two-fold\n      in MVCD patients. This risk can be partly explained by slower recovery of left ventricular\n      function and progression of left ventricular pathological remodeling process after MI. In\n      addition, the mere presence of MVCD has been shown to be associated with MACE development in\n      the long-term period. There are several treatment strategies for ST-elevation myocardial\n      infarction (STEMI) patients with MVCD: infarct related artery (IRA)-only percutaneous\n      coronary intervention (PCI), multivessel stenting in the primary PCI setting and staged\n      revascularisation. The current guidelines for STEMI revascularisation give no definite\n      instructions on the need for concurrent non-IRA intervention in patients with stable\n      haemodynamics. At present, there are not clinical trials testing the current\n      Zotarolimus-eluting stents (ZES) in STEMI patients with MVCD undergoing primary PCI for\n      different strategies of revascularization."
