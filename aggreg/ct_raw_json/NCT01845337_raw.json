Unfortunately a side effect of this drug is that it causes heart problems\n      including heart attacks. An alternative drug, called teysuno is used extensively in other\n      countries instead of capecitabine and appears to have less of a bad effect on the heart\n      whilst still killing cancer cells. This study will investigate the effect of these two drugs\n      on the heart and blood vessels and will be the first of its kind in humans."
