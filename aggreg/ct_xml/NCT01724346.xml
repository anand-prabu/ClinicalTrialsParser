      An Open-label Extension Study in Patients 65 Years or Older with Chronic Lymphocytic
      Leukemia (CLL) or Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma (SLL) Who Participated in Study PCYC-1115-CA
      (PCI-32765 versus Chlorambucil)

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study PCYC-1116-CA is an open-label, multicenter extension of Study PCYC 1115-CA
      (RESONATE™-2, the parent study), and it will run concurrently with the parent study.  A
      patient will be transferred to PCYC-1116-CA after Independent Review Committee (IRC)
      confirmation of disease progression (PD) in the parent study or at closure of the parent
      study by the sponsor, whichever comes first.

      After PD, selection of second-line therapy, when clinically indicated, is at the discretion
      of the investigator and can include second-line PCI-32765 (for patients randomized to
      chlorambucil in the parent study who also meet the criteria for second-line PCI-32765
      therapy), second-line chlorambucil (for patients randomized to PCI-32765 in the parent
      study), or other therapies.

      Assessments in the extension study vary depending on the treatment to which the patient was
      randomized in the parent study, the disease-progression status at transfer to the extension
      study, and the planned treatment in the extension study.

    <description>Alternative anticancer treatment is selected at the investigator's discretion. For a patient randomized to chlorambucil in the parent study PCYC-1115-CA, PCI-32765 is an option for second-line therapy, provided the patient meets the criteria for second-line PCI-32765 therapy. For a patient randomized to PCI-32765 in the parent study PCYC-1115-CA, the patient will continue on PCI-32765 at the parent study.</description>
