Women will be selected when admitted for preterm labor with a gestational age\n      between 26 and 34 weeks.\n\n      The first group will receive Nifedipine for 48 hours, as described by the standard protocol\n      at the CHUS, in addition to 10 mg of Montelukast per day, until delivery or 35 weeks of\n      pregnancy.\n\n      The second group will receive Nifedipine for 48 hours, as described by the standard protocol\n      at the CHUS, in addition to a placebo per day, until delivery or 35 weeks of pregnancy.\n\n      Cervical secretions and urine will be sample at the admission, after one week and every two\n      weeks during treatment."
