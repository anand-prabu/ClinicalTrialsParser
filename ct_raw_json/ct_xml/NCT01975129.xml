      This study aims to evaluate the uptake of oxytocin following intravaginal administration of
      Vagitocin 400IU over a period of 15 days and also to compare oxytocin bioavailability after
      vaginal and intravenous administration. 12 healthy postmenopausal female volunteers, 40 to
      70 years old with vaginal atrophy will be included and will self-administer Vagitocin
      intravaginally on day 2-14 (day 1 and 15 Vagitocin is given in the clinic). On day 22 a
      single intravenous dose of oxytocin 10 IU SyntocinonÂ® will be given. Oxytocin plasma levels
      after intravaginal and intravenous administration  will be analysed day 1, 15 and 22 at
      timepoints: -1.0, -0.5, 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0 and 8.0 hours,
      relative to dosing.  Based on the obtained plasma levels for oxytocin, pharmakokinetic
      variables will be calculated. The % of oxytocin which was absorbed following vaginal
      administration (bioavailability)will also be calculated.
