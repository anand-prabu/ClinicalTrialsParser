In the absence of adequate sun exposure, acquiring the new RDA of\n      600-800 IU/d for vitamin D through diet alone is difficult. There is a need to increase\n      dietary sources of vitamin D for Canadians.\n\n      In a double blind, randomized trial, our objective was to assess the effect of high\n      temperature pizza baking on the bioavailability of vitamin D3 fortified Mozzarella cheese.\n      We tested the following hypotheses, set a priori: 1) vitamin D3 is bioavailable from pizza\n      baked with fortified Mozzarella cheese and heat does not significantly break down vitamin\n      D3; and 2) the change in serum 25(OH)D (from baseline to 10 wk) will be significantly\n      greater in the high-dose vitamin D treated group (28000 IU/wk) compared to the low dose\n      vitamin D-treated group (200 IU/wk)."
