Availability of tumor archival material or fresh biopsies is optional for\n             subjects in dose escalation\n\n          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 1 at trial entry\n             and an estimated life expectancy of at least 3 months\n\n          -  Disease must be measurable with at least 1 uni-dimensional measurable lesion by\n             RECIST 1.1, except for subjects with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer\n             (mCRPC) or metastatic breast cancer (MBC) who may be enrolled with objective evidence\n             of disease without a measureable lesion\n\n          -  Adequate hematological, hepatic and renal function as defined in the protocol\n\n          -  Effective contraception for both male and female subjects if the risk of conception\n             exists\n\n          -  Other protocol defined inclusion criteria could apply\n\n        Inclusion Criteria for expansion phase:\n\n        \u2022 Subjects must have relapsed, refractory, or progressive disease following last line of\n        treatment. Availability of tumor archival material or fresh biopsies is mandatory for\n        eligibility in the expansion cohorts. For subjects in the MBC cohort, the biopsy or\n        surgical specimen must have been collected within 90 days prior to the first\n        investigational medicinal product (IMP) administration. Specifically, the following will\n        be required:\n\n          -  NSCLC: Histologically or cytologically confirmed stage IIIB (malignant pleural\n             effusion) or stage IV NSCLC that has progressed after 1 line of platinum-containing\n             doublet chemotherapy. Subjects should have received only 1 line of\n             platinum-containing treatment for metastatic disease (i.e., adjuvant treatment with a\n             platinum-containing regimen is not sufficient for eligibility because not received in\n             the context of a metastatic disease). Subjects in the NSCLC cohort will not be\n             enrolled in countries in the European Union\n\n          -  Gastric and GEJ cancer: Histologically confirmed, unresectable locally advanced or\n             metastatic adenocarcinoma of the gastric and gastro-esophageal junction, treated with\n             first-line chemotherapy combination without disease progression. Subjects should not\n             have been treated with trastuzumab (but can be Human Epidermal growth factor Receptor\n             2 [HER2] positive). Patients who received any platinum containing doublet or triplet\n             as a neoadjuvant chemotherapy strategy, but are not ultimately candidates for surgery\n             will also be eligible, as long as they did not have progressive disease after\n             completion of the adjuvant chemotherapy. In addition, subjects with gastric cancer\n             can enter in the study if their white blood cell (WBC) and lymphocyte count is as\n             defined in the protocol\n\n          -  MBC: Subjects must have histologically confirmed locally advanced or MBC and have\n             tumor that is refractory to or progressive after standard of care therapy. Subjects\n             must have received no more than 3 prior lines of cytotoxic therapy for metastatic\n             disease. Subjects must have received a taxane and an anthracycline, unless\n             contra-indicated\n\n          -  Metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), Metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer\n             (mCRPC), melanoma and ovarian cancer as defined in the protocol\n\n        Exclusion Criteria for dose escalation and expansion phase:\n\n          -  Concurrent treatment with a non-permitted drug\n\n          -  Prior therapy with specific antibody/drug targeting T cell co-regulatory proteins\n             (immune checkpoints)\n\n          -  Concurrent anticancer treatment concurrent systemic therapy with steroids or other\n             immunosuppressive agents, or use of any investigational drug within 28 days before\n             the start of trial treatment. Short-term administration of steroids  (that is, for\n             allergic reactions or the management of immune-related adverse events [irAE]) is\n             allowed. Note: Subjects receiving bisphosphonate are eligible provided treatment was\n             initiated at least 14 days before the first dose of MSB0010718C\n\n          -  Previous malignant disease other than the target malignancy to be investigated in\n             this trial within the last 5 years with the exception of basal or squamous cell\n             carcinoma of the skin or cervical carcinoma in situ\n\n          -  Rapidly progressive disease (for example, tumor lysis syndrome)\n\n          -  Active or history of central nervous system metastases\n\n          -  Receipt of any organ transplantation including allogeneic stem-cell transplantation\n\n          -  Significant acute or chronic infections as defined in the protocol\n\n          -  Active or history of any autoimmune disease (except for subjects with vitiligo) or\n             immunodeficiencies\n\n          -  Known severe hypersensitivity reactions to monoclonal antibodies, any history of\n             anaphylaxis, or uncontrolled asthma\n\n          -  Persisting toxicity related to prior therapy greater than Grade 1 NCI-CTCAE v4.0,\n             however sensory neuropathy less than or equal to Grade 2 is acceptable\n\n          -  Pregnancy or lactation period\n\n          -  Known alcohol or drug abuse\n\n          -  Clinically significant (that is, active) cardiovascular disease\n\n          -  All other significant diseases (for example, inflammatory bowel disease), which, in\n             the opinion of the investigator, might impair the subject's tolerance of trial\n             treatment\n\n          -  Any psychiatric condition that would prohibit the understanding or rendering of\n             informed consent\n\n          -  Legal incapacity or limited legal capacity\n\n          -  Non-oncology vaccine therapies for prevention of infection disease (for example,\n             seasonal flu vaccine, human papilloma virus vaccine) within 4 weeks of study drug\n             administration.
