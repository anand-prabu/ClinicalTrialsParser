  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We aim to evaluate whether the addition of Omega-3 fatty acids to oxybutynin, a standard
      first-line treatment for overactive bladder syndrome, will improve symptoms and quality of
      life.  Secondarily, we will evaluate whether Omega-3 fatty acids help reduce the adverse
      effects of oxybutynin.

      Hypothesis

        -  Primary: Omega-3 will enhance the beneficial role of oxybutynin in the treatment of
           overactive bladder (OAB)

        -  Secondary: Omega-3 will reduce the side effects of dry eyes and constipation associated
           with oxybutynin

    <textblock>
      Overactive bladder (OAB) is a troubling condition affecting over 17 million people in the
      U.S. with an estimated prevalence of 16.9% among women. The cost of this burden nationally
      was estimated at $66 billion in 2007. The morbidity of the disease impacts quality of life
      scores and increases risks of falls and fractures.

      First-line therapeutic modalities for OAB focus on anticholinergic medications and
      behavioral modification. However, the indirect impact of these medications on the gut and
      salivary glands, have been troubling.  Resultant side effect profiles with anticholinergic
      medications have caused a high rate of cessation, with some studies showing as low as 14% of
      patients still taking their medication at a one-year follow up. Given the burden and
      morbidity associated with this highly prevalent condition among women, our aim is to improve
      our therapeutic options, while possibly reducing subsequent side effects. As such, there is
      potential to revolutionize treatment for this condition.

      Omega-3 fatty acids have been evaluated with success in treating many medical conditions.
      Specifically, diseases with an inflammatory component, such as Crohn's disease, ulcerative
      colitis, and rheumatoid arthritis have seen promising improvements with the addition of
      Omega-3 fatty acids. Other studies have shown a beneficial role in the treatment of dry
      eyes, depression, burn injuries, and even cancer. Although not previously explored in the
      setting of irritative bladder conditions, we believe that Omega-3 fatty acids may be helpful
      in interventions for OAB via several purported mechanisms.

      Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and inflammation have both been implicated in the biochemistry of
      overactive bladder. Reduction in PGE2 may be paramount in reducing the symptoms of
      overactive bladder. In fact, a proposed mechanism of action of the success of
      anticholinergic medications, commonly first line treatment for OAB,  is reduction of PGE2.
      Animal models have demonstrated that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can be
      used to decrease micturition frequency, which is thought to be a result of the
      anti-inflammatory process. In humans, anti-inflammatory medications have been shown to
      decrease nocturia and even cause urinary retention in high doses. Omega-3 fatty acids have
      been shown to have anti-inflammatory actions and the ability to reduce PGE2. We therefore,
      have reason to believe it may be an effective adjunct to current therapy to improve
      overactive bladder symptoms.

      Additionally, Omega-3 fatty acids have been implemented in the treatment of dry eyes and
      animal studies have shown their role in increasing intestinal motility.Hence, we propose
      that Omega-3 fatty acids may help alleviate the common side effects of dry eyes and
      constipation associated with common anticholinergic therapies.
