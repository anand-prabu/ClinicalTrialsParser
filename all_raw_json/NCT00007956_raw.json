Patients are stratified according to number of\n      circulating tumor cells in peripheral blood (more than 50/mm3 vs 50/mm3 or less).\n\n      Patients receive monoclonal antibody Mono-dgA-RFB4 IV over 4 hours on days 1, 3, and 5.\n      Patients achieving complete, partial, or minimal remission receive additional courses of\n      therapy every 4 weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of monoclonal antibody mono-dgA-RFB4 until\n      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which 2 of\n      3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n      Patients achieving complete remission or stable partial remission are followed every 3\n      months for 1 year, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-25 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-18\n      months."
