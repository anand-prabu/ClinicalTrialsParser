  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypertensive leg ulcers are very painful and difficult to treat ulcers. Their treatment is
      not well established.

      We want to study the efficacy of PRF applications on the pains related to those ulcers.

      PRF (Platelet-Rich Fibrin) is an autologous fibrin clot, obtained extemporaneously from
      patient's blood, without any additive nor complex manipulation. It contains blood platelets
      and white blood cells, trapped in fibrin during clot formation.

      PRF (Platelet-Rich Fibrin) is form immediately after blood punction in a dry tube, that does
      not contain any anticoagulant. Coagulation naturally occurs within few minutes, and tubes
      are placed in a centrifuge: red blood cells are separated from the fibrin clot thanks to
      difference of density, and blood platelets and white blood cells are trapped in the fibrin
      clot.

      The fibrin clot is then rapidly applicated on the ulcer surface for four days. Our
      hypothesis is that platelet growth factors and cytokines, liberated during platelet
      activation, could help to treat hypertensive leg ulcers, that are caused by a vascular
      spasm.

      2 to 8 PRF (depending on the ulcer surface), applied on painful hypertensive leg ulcer, and
      covered by a dressing for 4 days.

      Afterwards, dressings are made in a classical way. If needed (persistence of important
      pain), the PRF application can be repeated after 7 days.
