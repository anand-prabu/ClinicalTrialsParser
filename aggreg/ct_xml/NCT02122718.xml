  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recurrent stroke and cognitive decline are common after ischaemic stroke. Allopurinol, a
      drug usually used to treat gout, has been shown to reduce heart ischaemia, heart size, and
      arterial stiffness and to relax brain blood vessels and may reduce the blood pressure. All
      of these properties may be associated with a lower risk of second stroke and cognitive
      decline. We now aim to explore whether allopurinol will reduce further damage to the brain
      (called white matter hyper-intensities) after stroke and also whether it reduces heart size
      and blood pressure after stroke.

      We will conduct a multi-centre randomised, double-blind placebo controlled study to
      investigate whether two years allopurinol 300 mg twice per day (BD) improves these 3
      outcomes, which are inextricably linked to risk of recurrence and cognitive decline after
      ischaemic stroke.

          -  Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate &lt; 30 mls/min

          -  Contraindication to MRI scanning.

          -  Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding.

          -  Women of childbearing potential who are unable or unwilling to use contraception.
