This study will consist of\n      an enrollment phase (up to 28 days), a treatment phase (2 days), and a follow-up phase (up\n      to 12 days). A dose regimen of 1.25 mg/kg will be used for the first 24 hours of treatment\n      in this study in children aged 6 years to less than 18 years old. After 24 hours after the\n      start of study medication, and based on clinical judgment, the dose may either be continued\n      at 1.25 mg/kg or it may be decreased to 1.0 mg/kg. A decision to maintain or alter the dose\n      will depend on the effectiveness of the analgesia (pain killer) and the adverse event\n      profile observed in each child over the first 24 hour dosing period. The doses for\n      participants aged less than 6 years old will be defined based on the forthcoming\n      pharmacokinetic (what the body does to a medication) data. The rescue medication will be\n      available as patient or nurse controlled intravenous morphine or hydromorphone. This rescue\n      medication will be given to control pain, as needed, in both the treatment and placebo\n      groups. Safety evaluations will include assessment of adverse events, vital signs,\n      laboratory parameters, electrocardiogram, and specific scale to assess suicidal ideation.\n      The maximum study duration for each participant will be 42 days."
