The donated stem cells may also help destroy any remaining cancer cells\n      (graft-versus-tumor effect).\n\n      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well autologous peripheral stem cell transplant\n      followed by donor peripheral stem cell transplant works in treating patients with multiple\n      myeloma."

Patients then undergo autologous PBSC transplantation (PBSCT) on day 0.\n      Patients receive G-CSF SC beginning on day 5 and continuing until blood counts recover.\n\n      Approximately 2-4 months after autologous PBSCT, patients receive fludarabine IV over 30\n      minutes on days -7 to -3 and cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on days -4 to -3. Patients\n      undergo allogeneic PBSCT on day 0. Patients receive G-CSF SC beginning on day 7 and\n      continuing until blood counts recover.\n\n      Patients receive graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis comprising oral tacrolimus twice\n      daily on days -1 to 90 followed by a taper on days 91-150 and methotrexate IV on days 1, 3,\n      and 6.\n\n      After day 120, patients with stable or progressive disease and no evidence of active GVHD\n      may receive donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) over 2 hours. Patients may receive up to 3 DLIs\n      every 8 weeks.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 3 years, every 6 months for 5 years, and then\n      annually for 15 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 63 patients will be accrued for this study."
