  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since mid-2000, thoracoscopic lobectomy has been replaced with conventional open lobectomy
      and it has reduced the operative morbidities and mortalities. However, thoracoscopic
      lobectomy also results in operative acute pain and the incidence of chronic pain after
      thoracoscopic lobectomy has been reported as up to 50%. Penetration of chest wall by trocar,
      torque at trocar and working window by operator, and compression of intercostal nerves have
      been suggested as a cause of pain after thoracoscopic lobectomy. The intravenous
      patient-controlled analgesia (IV PCA) that usually have used to control the operative pain,
      sometimes cause the side effects such as sedation, nausea and vomiting due to its systemic
      delivery of analgesics. Because of these side effects, IV PCA has to be discontinues and the
      effective dose of analgesics could not deliver to patients. In contrast to IV PCA,
      continuous paravertebral infusion of local anesthetics thorough catheter below the parietal
      pleura might reduce the side effects of IV PCA and control the operative pain effectively.
      In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of continuous paravertebral infusion of
      local anesthetics thorough catheter below the parietal pleura for 60 hours after operation
      competed to IV PCA.
