            "textblock": "Food allergy affects 6-8 percent of children in the United States. In young children,\n      reactions to egg can range from hives to severe life threatening allergic reactions called\n      anaphylaxis. Current treatment for food allergy is complete avoidance of the food and to\n      carry antihistamines and self-injectable epinephrine if an accidental reaction occurs.\n      However, accidental exposure to allergens in processed foods may be difficult to avoid.\n      Currently, several therapeutic strategies are being investigated to prevent and treat food\n      allergies. Since immunotherapy injections for food allergy are associated with a high rate\n      of allergic reactions, alternate approaches to treatment are needed. Oral (by mouth)\n      immunotherapy (OIT) is one approach that has been tried in some studies in the treatment of\n      food allergies. The purpose of this study is to compare baked foods with egg versus (vs.)\n      egg OIT. The intent of the study is to investigate if participants will be able to consume\n      egg after taking baked foods with egg or egg OIT for a period of time and then stopping for\n      a certain period. This is referred to as tolerance or sustained unresponsiveness. This study\n      will evaluate the effectiveness of the egg OIT vs. baked egg by having each participant\n      ingest egg white solid or baked foods with egg. This will be done over 2 years.\n\n      This study will last 2 years. All eligible subjects will receive a baked egg oral food\n      challenge (OFC). Those who pass the baked egg OFC will then have a 2 gm egg OFC. Those who\n      react to the egg OFC will be randomized to Baked Egg or Egg OIT. Individuals who do not pass\n      the initial baked egg OFC will be assigned to Egg OIT. Those who pass the egg OFC will not\n      be eligible for the study and will be followed per site standard of care. All eligible and\n      enrolled subjects will have a 1-year and a 2-year OFC.\n\n      At selected visits, blood and urine collection, physical examination, prick skin tests, and\n      atopic dermatitis and asthma evaluations will occur."
