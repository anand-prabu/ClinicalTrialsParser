            "textblock": "The study is a RCT in which the ACT-intervention is being compared to treatment as usual.\n      The trial started in 2010, and randomisation of patients will continue until 2014, and\n      follow-ups will be completed in 2016.\n\n      According to analysis of power, a total of 120 patients needs to be included, 60 in each\n      arm. Patients eligible for the interventions are offered to participate after their\n      clinician has reported them to the head investigator. The head investigator sends a letter\n      to the patients with information on the study. The clinician then asks the patient if the\n      letter has been read. If the patient chooses to participate, he/she will be summoned to a\n      information and assessment meeting. The head investigator checks that the patient\n      understands the information, and what each study arm can mean for the patient when\n      participating. Consent to participate is collected both verbally and written. At this\n      meeting the patient receives an envelope which contains the randomization outcome. The\n      patient then receives information regarding the continued treatment according to which\n      research arm he/she is to participate in.\n\n      The treatment intervention is planned to start within 6 weeks from the first letter of\n      information has been sent. The goal is to start treatment four weeks after randomization, to\n      enable a positive termination of previous treatment. The participants randomized to\n      treatment as usual continues with the treatment as planned before enrollment. Thus, they\n      might end treatment during the study period, or continue treatment after study\n      participation, all according to the treatment plan with the clinician.\n\n      Participants in the intervention arm start the group intervention consisting of 12 session\n      over a period of three to four months, and an individual meeting with the group-leaders\n      before and after the intervention. The intervention is a manualized application of the book\n      \"Lev med din kropp\" [Live with your body]. Participants in need of further care after the\n      intervention are offered continued treatment accordingly at the clinic.\n\n      If a participant chooses to terminate the intervention, or deteriorate during the\n      intervention to the point that other treatment is needed, further treatment is agreed upon\n      in dialogue with the patient. If needed, further assessment and physical examination is\n      conducted in accordance to the clinics standard procedures.\n\n      Data is being collected at four times for all participants. At treatment start and end, and\n      follow-up at 12 and 24 months after inclusion. At each time, the participants are prompted\n      to fill in five different self-assessment forms, all well used and validated."
