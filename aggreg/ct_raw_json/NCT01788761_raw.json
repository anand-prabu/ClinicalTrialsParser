The nutritional supplements that will be\n      studied are Culturelle for Kids/Culturelle Kids and Align.  They are nutritional supplements\n      that each contain a different probiotic.  In this study the investigators will mainly be\n      looking at the effect that these supplements may have on how well babies tolerate their\n      feedings and how long they require supplemental intravenous fluids for nutritional support.\n      The investigators will also, however, look at many other factors such as rate of growth,\n      rates of infection, survival rate and the length of time the infant needs to be in the\n      hospital.  The investigators will also look at its effect on conditions/complications of\n      prematurity such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia and chronic lung disease (chronic diseases of\n      the lung associated with prematurity), necrotizing enterocolitis and intestinal perforations\n      (serious diseases of the infant's intestines), retinopathy of prematurity (eye disease\n      associated with prematurity), intracranial hemorrhage (bleeding into the brain) and patent\n      ductus arteriosus (a blood vessel connecting two main blood vessels coming out of the heart\n      that does not close spontaneously (by itself)."
