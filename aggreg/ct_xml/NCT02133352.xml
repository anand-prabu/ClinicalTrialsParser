  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, open-label trial designed to assess the safety and efficacy of
      ranolazine (Ranexa) in patients with pulmonary hypertension associated with left ventricular
      diastolic dysfunction.  All patients will receive active drug.  The study includes a
      screening period, 6 month treatment period and a follow up period.  Eligible patients who
      provide informed consent and who meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria will be enrolled in
      this study.

      There is neither proven therapy for patients with diastolic dysfunction-associated pulmonary
      hypertension nor for patients with diastolic dysfunction alone.   Ranolazine, an inhibitor
      of cardiac repolarization (sodium channels), could represent a new and effective treatment
      of this entity.
