  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke patients with dysphagia have restrictive lung dysfunction and impaired cough
      response. This pilot study was performed to determine if Mechanical Insufflation
      Exsufflation (MIE) therapy can help recover impaired cough function.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mechanical Insufflation- Exsufflation (MI-E) is an assisted coughing machine that has been
      proven to be very effective in preventing the deterioration of pulmonary function in
      patients with degenerative neuromuscular disorders. Impaired airway clearance in stroke
      patients is associated with increased incidence of aspiration pneumonia.

      In this pilot study the investigators attempt to assess the efficacy of MI-E as part of a
      protocol for patients with dysphagia with impaired cough response.
