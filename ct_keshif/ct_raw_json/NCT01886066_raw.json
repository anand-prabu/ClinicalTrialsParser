It is estimated that no more than 25% of all women with presumed early stage\n      high risk endometrial cancer will have positive lymph nodes however currently the majority\n      of women are subjected to extensive resection of all pelvic lymph and or para-aortic lymph\n      nodes and its associated morbidities. The objective of this study is to determine if the\n      combination of preoperative MR imaging with intraoperative sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping\n      will improve the assessment of regional lymph nodes and enhance the detection of lymph nodes\n      with metastatic disease in endometrial cancer. This would benefit the majority of women with\n      early stage high risk endometrial cancer and would prevent the associated complications of\n      pelvic lymph node dissection."

            "textblock": "If the SLN can be accurately identified and the detection of metastatic lymph nodes in women\n      with early stage high risk endometrial cancer can be improved then the majority of women\n      could avoid a complete systematic pelvic lymphadenectomy. Pelvic lymphadenectomy is\n      associated with many intraoperative and postoperative complications such as hemorrhage,\n      lymphocyst formation, nerve injury and chronic lower extremity lymphedema.  If less invasive\n      techniques to assess regional lymph node involvement, such as preoperative imaging\n      techniques and SLN mapping, replaced routine pelvic lymphadenectomy the complications\n      associated with more extensive pelvic surgery could be avoided.\n\n      This will be a prospective cohort study. The population to be studied will be patients with\n      newly diagnosed early stage high risk endometrial cancer who will undergo primary surgical\n      intervention that includes hysterectomy and bilateral pelvic and inframesenteric para-aortic\n      lymphadenectomy via laparotomy, laparoscopy or robotic-assisted. Patients will have a\n      preoperative Gadofoveset trisodium (Ablavar)-enhanced MRI within 4 weeks of their surgery.\n      On the morning of surgery, preoperative injection of a radiolabeled colloid will occur in\n      the Nuclear Medicine Dept. All patients will have preoperative SPECT/CT performed for\n      preoperative mapping.  Patients will be taken to the operating room for their planned\n      procedure.  After initiation of general anesthesia, blue dye will be injected into the\n      patient's cervix. The surgery will proceed and all lymph nodes that are \"blue\" and/or \"hot\"\n      will be removed surgically and their anatomic location and laterality documented. The\n      hysterectomy and lymphadenectomy will then be performed.  The SLN status will be compared to\n      the status of the other nodes removed at complete lymphadenectomy.  All data on these\n      patients will be prospectively collected."
