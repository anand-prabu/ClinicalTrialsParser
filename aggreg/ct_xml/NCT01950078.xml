      Objective: This study was conducted to explore the possible correlation between some gene
      related to pain sensation and individual basal pain perception and postoperative pain
      intensity in the general population. Methods: Patients receiving elective surgery under
      general anesthesia were recruited into this study. The investigators measured their
      preoperative pressure pain threshold (PPT) and pressure pain tolerance (PTO). The visual
      analog scale (VAS) was used for pain evaluation at rest and move after the operation. And
      the PCA press frequency and drug consumption were recorded. Also there were healthy college
      students volunteer be recruited into this study. The investigators measured their
      experimental pain sensitivity including pressure pain threshold (PPT) and pressure pain
      tolerance (PTO). Then genotyping was carried out by direct sequencing.

      Heparin anti-coagulated blood (5 ml) was collected from the periphery venous of subjects and
      all blood samples were stored at -80℃. Genomic DNA was extracted from the blood samples
      using a guanidinium isothiocyanate method.
