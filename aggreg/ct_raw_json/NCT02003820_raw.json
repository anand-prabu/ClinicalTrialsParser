            "textblock": "In this pilot study improvement of tooth brushing practices in children with Autism Spectrum\n      Disorder between the ages of  eight and twelve years old will be evaluated. Participants\n      placed in two randomized groups will watch a Youtube format instructional video twice each\n      day immediately before each brushing during the three-week intervention period.\n\n      The video intervention will teach participants to use the usual and customary hygiene\n      skills. Participants will view a child in their age range demonstrating proper brushing\n      using the Bass brushing technique. The video will also have written narration at the bottom\n      of the screen delivering printed information using Social Story style prompts. The Social\n      Story prompts will also be read aloud for auditory delivery of information. The video will\n      be two to three minutes long.\n\n      Success of intervention will be determined using data collected at multiple times during the\n      pilot. First, clinical exams will be completed before the intervention, half way through the\n      intervention, and at the end of three weeks to evaluate how clean the patients oral cavity\n      appears. Exams should take no more than twenty minutes in the dental chair. Second,\n      Qualtrics emails will be sent to the patient's caregiver at 5:30 AM and 4:30 PM each day\n      during intervention providing access to the instructional video. After opening the email and\n      watching the video, there will be a simple \"yes or no\" survey question asking the caregiver\n      if the video was watching before that brushing session. Finally, more in depth caregiver\n      surveys will be completed at the end of each week during the intervention consisting of no\n      more than fifteen questions. The surveys will evaluate the caregiver's perception of\n      intervention success. At completion of the intervention the video will be made available to\n      all participants via Youtube.com. One final survey will be sent to caregivers three weeks\n      post intervention to determine if the video is still being used for hygiene reinforcement.\n\n      Multiple efforts for study control will be implemented. To control for the impact the\n      initial exam may have on hygiene Group 2 will wait two weeks from the time of clinical exam\n      before starting video intervention. Group 1 will start the intervention immediately after\n      clinical exam. Clinical evaluators will also be blinded to prevent bias when evaluating the\n      two groups clinically. One examiner will conduct initial exams. A second examiner will\n      conduct all subsequent exams with no knowledge of what group each patient is assigned.\n      Evaluators will be calibrated pre-study evaluating hygiene patients at the dental clinic.\n\n      All participants in this study will also be enrolled at Yale Child Study Center to measure\n      the participants IQ using autism specific IQ testing methods."
