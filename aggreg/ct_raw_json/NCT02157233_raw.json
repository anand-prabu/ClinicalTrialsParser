There is\n      a potential influence of environmental heat in energetic balance regulation. However, the\n      existing knowledge is insufficient to optimize physical activity programs based on the\n      impact of exercise on energy intake regulation in hot climates. The aim of the present study\n      is to define the major physiological determinants of short-term food intake regulation in\n      young active and healthy men, when exposed to different levels of metabolic activity and\n      environmental temperatures. We will thus explore the biological mechanisms related to\n      post-exercise relative energy intake. Post-rest and post-exercise energetic compensation\n      will be analysed in these different environmental conditions, with a special focus on the\n      effect of the birth weight. This study should open interesting ways to define adequate\n      nutritional and exercising programs in hot environments."
