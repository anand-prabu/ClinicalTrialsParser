  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study will investigate the effects of intranasal oxytocin administration on
      neural activity associated with social and non-social motivation.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Oxytocin is a well-known social and reproductive hormone demonstrated to have a variety of
      prosocial effects in humans including enhancing trust and generosity, improving positive
      communication, increasing eye gaze, and reducing anxiety. Oxytocin is hypothesized to
      facilitate social behaviors via its modulation of motivational networks. With this study, we
      will characterize oxytocin's effects on the neural processing of salient stimuli. We will
      utilize a noninvasive brain imaging technique, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI),
      to assess brain activity while participants perform tests designed to engage neural circuits
      associated with the processing of social and non-social stimuli.

    <description>Drug effect will be assessed by ascertaining changes in hemodynamic response functions (i.e. vascular responses to neural events) between placebo and oxytocin sessions.

    <description>Trait (i.e. personality) measures will be analyzed to determine whether these traits play a mediating role in brain activity associated with the processing of motivational stimuli during placebo or oxytocin administration.
