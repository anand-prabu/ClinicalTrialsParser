Colony-stimulating factors such as filgrastim may increase the\n      number of immune cells found in bone marrow or peripheral blood and may help a person's\n      immune system recover from the side effects of chemotherapy.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to compare the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy with or\n      without filgrastim in treating patients who have extensive-stage small cell lung cancer that\n      has not been previously treated."

The first 12 patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment\n      regimens (6 per regimen). The next 33 patients receive treatment based on the toxicity\n      experienced by the first 12.\n\n      Regimen A:\n\n        -  Patients receive oral topotecan once daily on days 1-5, carboplatin IV over 30 minutes\n           on day 5, and filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously once daily beginning on day 6 or 7 and\n           continuing for up to 10 days or until blood counts recover.\n\n        -  Patients are evaluated after the first 3-week course of chemotherapy. If no patient\n           experiences unacceptable toxicity or febrile neutropenia, or no more than 1 patient\n           experiences an absolute neutrophil count of less than 500/mm3 for more than 5 days, the\n           next 6 patients begin treatment on regimen B. Otherwise, all patients receive treatment\n           as in regimen A.\n\n      Regimen B:\n\n        -  Patients receive topotecan and carboplatin as in regimen A.\n\n        -  Patients are evaluated after the first 3-week course of chemotherapy. If no patient\n           experiences unacceptable toxicity or febrile neutropenia, the next 33 patients receive\n           treatment as in regimen B; otherwise, patients receive treatment as in regimen A.\n\n      Treatment for all patients repeats every 3 weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence of\n      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with disease progression limited to\n      CNS only interrupt chemotherapy to have whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT). Once WBRT is\n      complete, chemotherapy resumes.\n\n      Quality of life is assessed at baseline and at the beginning of each course of chemotherapy.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 49 patients will be accrued for this study within 13.5 months."
