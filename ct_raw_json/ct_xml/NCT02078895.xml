  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Botulinum toxin type A (Botox A) has shown great success in treating certain urologic
      conditions. A recent study has documented that Botox injected around the ureteral orifice
      (or place where the tube that connects the kidney to the bladder enters the bladder), during
      placement of a ureteral stent (small rubber tube that facilitate drainage of urine from the
      kidney to the bladder), resulted in a marked decline in the amount of stent pain experienced
      by patients. This finding was quite remarkable as stents are commonly used in many Urologic
      conditions, and these stents produce a remarkable degree of patient discomfort. Despite the
      great improvement in pain reduction, the irritative voiding symptoms [frequent need to void,
      urgency, burning with urination (dysuria) or nighttime voiding (nocturia)] were not
      ameliorated by the Botox injections in the ureteral orifice. However, it has already been
      well documented that in other clinical settings, administrations of Botox into the bladder
      muscle, has been shown to reduce these irritative symptoms.

      The objective of the study is to determine if pain and irritative lower urinary tract
      symptoms related to ureteral stent placement will improve after the injection of Botox
      around the ureteral orifice and in the bladder itself.

    <description>Lower urinary tract symptoms (frequency, urgency, nocturia, dysuria) - Ureteral Stent Symptom Questionnaire (USSQ). The USSQ has different sections that pertain to different domains of a patient's life. Therefore, a total score from each section will be measured individually as described by Joshi et al (15). The different domains of the USSQ include urinary symptoms, body pain, general health, work performance, sexual matters. The total scores from each of these sections will be compared individually. In addition, the total score for the entire questionnaire will also be assessed.</description>
