Sickle cell disease is a recessive disorder caused\n      by a point mutation that results in the substitution of valine for glutamic acid at the\n      sixth position in the B-chain of hemoglobin. This leads to sickling of the red blood cells\n      under many conditions, such as hypoxia, dehydration, and hyperthermia. The sickling leads to\n      vaso-occlusion, which causes irreversible damage in almost all systems in the body,\n      including the central nervous system (CNS), lungs, heart, bones, eyes, liver, and kidneys."
