      The current endoscopic methods for diagnosing and monitoring treatment response in
      Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE) are costly, inconvenient, and risky. Novel diagnostic methods
      are needed, and the minimally-invasive Cytosponge holds great promise. It has been shown to
      be safe and accurate in Barrett's esophagus, it has the advantage (over the string test) of
      obtaining a true tissue sample, and our preliminary data supports its further study in EoE.
      The proposed prospective cohort study, conducted by experts in esophageal diseases and EoE,
      will assess the accuracy of Cytosponge compared to endoscopy and biopsy in EoE, and
      determine the safety and acceptability of this technique. Use of the Cytosponge would
      fundamentally change the paradigm for clinical management of EoE by allowing collection of
      non-endoscopic esophageal biopsies, thus minimizing the need for invasive testing. It would
      also facilitate future genetic, mechanistic, and pathogenesis research in EoE.

      Study design overview (all Aims) This will be a prospective cohort study, with patient
      enrollment conducted at UNC and Mayo Clinic with sample analysis performed by the University
      of Cambridge. In Aim 1, patients with EoE will be enrolled, tissue will be obtained from
      both the Cytosponge and endoscopy, and the methods will be compared for a single time point
      to determine accuracy of Cytosponge for quantifying esophageal eosinophil counts. In Aim 2,
      the patients who are being treated will be followed and tissue will be assessed over time
      with both Cytosponge and endoscopy to determine the utility of Cytosponge for monitoring
      treatment response in patients with EoE. For all patients, safety will be monitored and
      subjects will complete a survey about the acceptability of Cytosponge (Aim 3).

      Cytosponge protocol:

      After the study has been explained and a patient provides informed consent, the Cytosponge
      will be administered prior to endoscopy by the research coordinator under physician
      supervision. The string, attached to a 3-inch cardboard tab, will be held loosely at the
      mouth by the coordinator, and the subject will swallow the sponge capsule with an ounce of
      water. The string will be held without tension to allow the capsule to advance into the
      stomach. Five minutes after ingestion, the back of the throat will be sprayed with 1%
      lidocaine spray, and the expanded sponge withdrawn by gentle traction on the string. After
      retrieval, the string is cut and the sponge (which contains the tissue specimen) is placed
      in a container, immersed in fixative, and stored in a refrigerator at 4Â°C. The fixative is
      then spun in a centrifuge, and the pelleted cells are embedded in a paraffin block using
      standard techniques.

      Upper endoscopy and biopsy:

      After the Cytosponge has been removed, the patient will undergo standard of care (routine
      care) upper endoscopy and biopsy, as clinically indicated. During this exam, we will record
      all endoscopic features of EoE, including rings, furrows, white plaques, decreased
      vascularity, and strictures. The severity of the endoscopy findings will be measured using
      the recently validated EREFS scoring system.23 Four esophageal biopsies will be taken both
      from the distal (5 cm above the gastro-esophageal junction) and proximal (15 cm above the
      gastro-esophageal junction) esophagus. This number of biopsies has been shown to maximize
      the diagnostic sensitivity for EoE.24

      Histology and eosinophil counts:

      All tissue samples from the Cytosponge and endoscopy will be coded with a subject's ID
      number, but will otherwise be masked for all clinical data, including EoE activity,
      symptoms, patient characteristics, and treatments prescribed. Using the paraffin blocks,
      pathology slides will be cut and the tissue processed with routine H&amp;E staining. The slides
      will then be digitized, and using the Aperio ImageScope (Aperio Technologies, Vista, CA),
      the maximum eosinophil density (eosinophils/mm2 [eos/mm2]) will be determined using our
      previously validated protocol.25 For purposes of comparison to previous studies, eosinophil
      density will then be converted to eosinophil counts (eos/hpf) for an assumed hpf size of
      0.24 mm2, the size of an average field as reported in the literature.26 The study
      pathologists from UNC and Mayo Clinic will review the specimens from their sites, and the
      study pathology from Cambridge will provide a second review of all specimens to ensure the
      most accurate quantification of eosinophil counts possible.

      Safety and accessibility assessments:

      Patients will be assessed at multiple points to determine the safety of the Cytosponge in
      EoE. We will assess for any symptoms or events as soon as the sponge capsule is swallowed,
      as well as immediately after the expanded sponge is removed. We will also contact them 1 and
      7 days after the endoscopy to assess for adverse events. For Aim 3, we will administer the
      acceptability survey at the 7 day follow-up point, so patients have adequate time to reflect
      on their experiences with both tissue collection approaches. In particular this survey will
      record the patient's experience with swallowing the Cytosponge, whether they would do it
      again, and whether they prefer the Cytosponge or endoscopy for diagnosis and monitoring of
      EoE.

    <description>Acceptability will be measured the Impact of Events Scale. This widely used scale was developed to assess the distress associated with a specific life event. It includes measures of both the intrusiveness of the event, and any avoidance responses by the subject in response to the event. The scale will be administrated both shortly after, and 7 days after, the sampling. In order to allow the subjects to have time to reflect on the experience and to compare with the EGD, the 7 day measurements will represent the primary acceptability outcome of the study. Secondary acceptability outcomes will include a visual analogue scale of acceptability of the Cytosponge, performed after the Cytosponge is administered. Also, the subject will be asked whether he/she would be willing to repeat the assay, and, assuming similar accuracy between Cytosponge and upper endoscopy, whether he/she would rather undergo surveillance by Cytosponge or standard esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with biopsies.</description>

    <description>To determine the utility of Cytosponge for monitoring treatment response in patients with EoE, we will enroll patients with EoE who are undergoing either topical steroid or dietary treatment. For subjects undergoing topical steroid treatment, they will be followed after they have received a course of either fluticasone or budesonide. For subjects undergoing dietary elimination, they will be followed after the initial elimination diet, as well as during the trigger identification phase when food groups are added back. Patients will be followed and tissue will be assessed over time with both Cytosponge and endoscopy; samples will be taken at up to 6 time points.</description>
