      Building on the successes of a communal, relationship based approach to Aboriginal youth
      mentoring in an after school physical activity program (AYMP), the investigators are
      evaluating a peer-led approach for diabetes prevention. High school students volunteer as
      mentors, and develop an after-school program that they then deliver to children in grade 4.
      The mentors meet twice a week. The first day, they develop an activity plan and decide roles
      and responsibilities to ensure successful delivery of each activity. The second day, they
      deliver the program to the grade 4s, which incorporates a healthy snack, 45-minutes of
      physical activity, and educational games/activities. Our primary goal is to determine the
      health benefits of AYMP; guided by our youth mentors and community advisors, the
      investigators will also develop a number of research questions that will help us to better
      understand the social, emotional, physical and spiritual outcomes of the peer-led mentor
      program. To answer these questions, the investigators will train community members in both
      qualitative and quantitative methods. The quantitative outcomes of this study include
      physical activity, waist circumference, obesity rates, and self-esteem. Qualitative methods
      may include photovoice and focus group interviews. All of these will be used to assess the
      social determinants of health and contextual features of the program.

    <description>This scale is designed to measure youths' perceptions of their ability to be successful in social interactions. This includes their ability to be persuasive towards peers in positive ways. The questionnaire contains two subscales that measure social self-efficacy in conflict and non-conflict situations. The subscales can be used separately or combined into a total score.</description>

    <description>The investigators recognize that the structural social determinants of health including income inequality, local wealth, sex and ethnic inequalities are key aspects to adolescent health in Aboriginal adolescents. The investigators also recognize that these are unlikely to change with the AYMP. Therefore the investigators will focus on a series of proximal factors. Using Indigenous approaches (i.e. sharing circles, storytelling) the investigators will explore the influence of the AYMP on (1) respect (a major theme in pilot testing), (2) perceived changes in the school environment, (3) family connectedness, (4) peer influence and (5) health behaviours. If youth prefer to discuss issues in a private setting, opportunities will be provided.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Grade 4 students. We chose to intervene with youth in grade 4 for four primary
             reasons: (1) the large majority of youth in grade 4 are in tanner stage 1 and will
             not experience puberty-related weight gain during the school year; (2) previous
             experience by our group revealed that attendance throughout the school year is higher
             in students in grade 4 relative to students in grade 5 or 6; (3) students in grade 4
             are old enough to perform low organized games included in the intervention; and (4)
             retention rates in the intervention are greater than students in grades 5 and 6.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  While all students will be invited to participate in the intervention, for
             measurement purposes, we will exclude data from those students who may not respond to
             the intervention or would be unable to participate in the physical activity aspects
             of the component. This includes children with: (1) musculoskeletal injuries that
             limit physical activities; (2) treatment for chronic conditions that would elicit
             weight gain or limit participation in physical activity (insulin, corticosteroids,
             blood pressure medications); (3) poor attendance (&lt;60% of school days) in the first
             semester; (4) children whose parents are unwilling to provide consent. Note: the
             intervention will be offered to youth with chronic conditions, however their data
             will not be included in the final analysis, due to confounding effects of
             medications.
