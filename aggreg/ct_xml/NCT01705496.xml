    <description>Safety will be monitored throughout the study for all subjects.  safety will be assessed by monitoring of adverse events,vital signs,physical exams, and clinical laboratory tests including CBC, serum chemistry.</description>

    <time_frame>30 +/- 2 days</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>An independent adjudication committee will assess the totality of clinical information from each subject and assign them a status of infected or uninfected. The subject's infection status will be compared with either of the two proposed published standards to determine whether it corelates with any of the current consensus definitions or diagnostic algorithms.</description>

          4. Need for operative intervention in the opinion of the surgeon to correct the pain in
             the prosthetic joint

          5. Prosthetic joint implant that has been in site for more than 3 months prior to
             enrolment

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects who are unable to comply with study requirements

          2. Indication, in the opinion of the principal investigator, for urgent surgery that
             would preclude the time needed for PET-CT scanning
