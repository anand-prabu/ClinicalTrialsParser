    <textblock>
      This randomized, double-blind and open-label phase III study is aimed to determine the
      efficacy, tolerance and safety of eltrombopag in Chinese chronic primary immune
      thrombocytopenia (ITP) adult subjects. This study will be conducted in Chinese adult chronic
      ITP subjects who have not responded to or have relapsed after previous treatment for ITP,
      including first line therapy and /or splenectomy.

      The primary objective of this study is to determine the efficacy of oral eltrombopag as a
      thrombopoietic agent treating previously treated chronic Chinese ITP patients comparing with
      placebo. The secondary objective is to assess the safety and tolerability of eltrombopag
      when administered for 6 weeks to previously treated adult chronic ITP patients comparing
      with the placebo. In addition, the long-term efficacy and safety of eltrombopag treatment
      will be also evaluated in the 24-week extension open-label phase after the double-blind
      phase as one of other study objectives. If the subject benefits from the eltrombopag
      treatment based on investigator's discretion, the subject can continue eltrombopag treatment
      until the commercial launch of eltrombopag in China. Furthermore, to understand the
      pharmacokinetics (PK) profile of eltrombopag and to explore the relationship between the PK
      and pharmacodynamics (PD) (platelet response), a PK/PD analysis will be embedded in this
      phase III study and conducted in the same patient population participated this phase III
      study.

      This randomized, double-blind and open-label phase III study is aimed to determine the
      efficacy, tolerance and safety of eltrombopag in Chinese chronic primary immune
      thrombocytopenia (ITP) adult subjects. This study will be conducted in Chinese adult chronic
      ITP subjects who have not responded to or have relapsed after previous treatment for ITP,
      including first line therapy and /or splenectomy.

      The primary objective of this study is to determine the efficacy of oral eltrombopag as a
      thrombopoietic agent treating previously treated chronic Chinese ITP patients comparing with
      placebo. The secondary objective is to assess the safety and tolerability of eltrombopag
      when administered for 6 weeks to previously treated adult chronic ITP patients comparing
      with the placebo. In addition, the long-term efficacy and safety of eltrombopag treatment
      will be also evaluated in the 24-week extension open-label phase after the double-blind
      phase as one of other study objectives. If the subject benefits from the eltrombopag
      treatment based on investigator's discretion, the subject can continue eltrombopag treatment
      until the commercial launch of eltrombopag in China. Furthermore, to understand the
      pharmacokinetics (PK) profile of eltrombopag and to explore the relationship between the PK
      and pharmacodynamics (PD) (platelet response), a PK/PD analysis will be embedded in this
      phase III study and conducted in the same patient population participated this phase III
      study.

      Approximately 150 eligible subjects will be randomized to either eltrombopag or matching
      placebo treatment in 2:1 ratio in stage 1(the 8-week double blind stage). Randomization for
      stage 1 will be stratified by splenectomy status (Yes/No), use of concomitant maintenance
      ITP therapy (Yes/No) and, baseline platelet count ( no more than 15×109/L, or &gt;15×109/L).
      This study includes 3 stages. The stage 1 will be an 8-week double-blind, randomized,
      placebo-controlled treatment period. Following completion of Stage 1 and after completing
      the data clean for the initial 6 weeks, the investigator will be un-blinded to treatment
      assignment on an individual subject basis to enable appropriate starting dose selection for
      stage 2, a 24-week open-label treatment period. PK sampling and assessments will occur at
      the Week 2 visit during stage 2 of the study, when all subjects are receiving eltrombopag.
      After the completion of stage 2, subjects may continue the eltrombopag treatment in stage 3,
      if he/she can benefit from the continuous eltrombopag treatment based on investigator's
      judgement.

      The initial dose of eltrombopag administration is 25 mg orally once daily. During the 8
      weeks double-blind treatment, dose of investigational product will be adjusted according to
      the weekly subject platelet count.

      The eligible subjects who have completed stage 1 (8 weeks of double-blind treatment period:
      the first 6 weeks data will be used for primary endpoint analysis and the last 2 weeks will
      be data clean period during which period the blinded treatment is continued as to the first
      6 weeks) would enter a voluntary open-label stage 2 (24-week open-label extension phase) in
      which subjects from both eltrombopag group and placebo group will have the opportunity to
      receive eltrombopag treatment. Subjects unwilling or unqualified (such as the subjects who
      meet the stopping criteria) to participate in extension treatment will attend follow-up
      visits for 4 weeks after the completion of double-blind phase. During open-label stage 2
      during which period all eligible subjects will receive open label eltrombopag treatment. The
      dose of eltrombopag will be continuously adjusted according to the subject's platelet count.

      Following completion of Stage 2, if the subject benefits from the eltrombopag treatment
      based on investigator's discretion, the subject can voluntarily enter stage 3, during which
      the subject will continue eltrombopag treatment until the commercial launch of eltrombopag
      in China.
