  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study will aim to determine whether circulating tumor cells (CTCs) can be
      captured using the novel cMET based ferrofluid. The primary objective of this pilot study
      will be to describe the numbers of c-MET expressing cells that can be detected by the c-MET
      CTC capture technique. These data will be separated by disease site. The investigator will
      also describe the detection rates of both the c-MET CTC capture and the EpCAM CTC capture
      techniques in each patient, also separated by disease site.
