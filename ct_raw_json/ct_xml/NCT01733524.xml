  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators' long-term goal is to discover novel, inexpensive and feasible strategies
      to improve the management and well-being of youth with T1DM. The specific objective of this
      proposal is to quantify the impact of responsible pet ownership on the glycemic control and
      health related quality of life in youth with T1DM.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) affects 151,000 children and adolescents in the United
      States. Youth with T1DM are at a high risk for multiple psychosocial co-morbidities
      including poor health related quality of life (HRQoL) which is linked to medication
      non-compliance and increased risk for diabetes-related complications. Any reduction in the
      psychosocial adjustment difficulties related to T1DM could improve the medical outcome of
      children with T1DM.

      Current standards for diabetes management reflect the need to maintain glucose control
      within a normal range. However, numerous reports indicate that normalization of blood
      glucose levels is seldom attainable in children and adolescents. Family cohesion, positive
      coping strategies, younger age of onset, social support and adequate self-regulatory
      behavior are found to favorably influence glycemic control. One may conclude that the
      presence of a companion animal, capable of enhancing the positive factors named above, would
      augment the array of tools available for the successful management of chronic illnesses such
      as T1DM.

      There is a lack of studies assessing the impact of pet ownership on the health and
      well-being of adolescents. The process of caring for, loving and being loved by a companion
      animal could offer direct and/or indirect benefits to the HRQoL in children with T1DM. To
      the investigators' knowledge, there are no studies examining the impact of pet ownership on
      glycemic control and HRQoL in youth with T1DM.
