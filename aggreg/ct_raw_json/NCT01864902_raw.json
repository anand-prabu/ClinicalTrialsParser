Determine the safety and feasibility of the chimeric antigen receptor T cells transduced\n      with the anti-CD33 vector (referred to as CART-33 cells).\n\n      II. Determine duration of in vivo survival of CART-33 cells. RT-PCR (reverse transcription\n      polymerase chain reaction) analysis of whole blood will be used to detect and quantify\n      survival of CART-33 TCR zeta:CD137 and TCR (T-cell receptor) zeta cells over time.\n\n      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. For patients with detectable disease, measure anti-leukemia response due to CART-33 cell\n      infusions.\n\n      II. To determine if the CD137 transgene is superior to the TCR zeta only transgene as\n      measured by the relative engraftment levels of CART-33 TCR zeta:CD137 and TCR zeta cells\n      over time.\n\n      III. Estimate relative trafficking of CART-33 cells in bone marrow.\n\n      IV. For patients with stored or accessible leukemia blasts, determine leukemia cell killing\n      by CART-33 cells in vitro.\n\n      V. Determine if cellular or humoral host immunity develops against the murine anti-CD33, and\n      assess correlation with loss of detectable CART-33 (loss of engraftment).\n\n      VI. Determine the relative subsets of CART-33 T cells (Tcm, Tem, and Treg).\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 group according to order of enrollment.\n\n      Patients receive anti-CD33-CAR (coupled with CD137 and CD3 zeta signalling\n      domains)vector-transduced autologous T cells on days 0,1, and 2 in the absence of disease\n      progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed intensively for 6 months, every 3\n      months for 2 years, and annually thereafter for 13 years."
