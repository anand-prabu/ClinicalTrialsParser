Phase I: Patients receive arsenic trioxide IV over 2 hours\n      daily for 28 days. Treatment repeats every 42-59 days in the absence of disease progression\n      or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve complete remission (CR) or partial remission\n      (PR) receive up to 4 courses. Patients who fail to achieve CR or PR or who experience\n      disease progression may receive arsenic trioxide and tretinoin daily for 28 days every 42-59\n      days for up to 7 courses. Patients who fail to achieve CR or PR or experience disease\n      progression with arsenic trioxide and tretinoin are removed from study. Cohorts of 3-6\n      patients receive escalating doses of arsenic trioxide until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)\n      is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients\n      experience dose limiting toxicities. Phase II: Patients receive the MTD of arsenic trioxide\n      as in phase I for up to 7 courses. Patients who fail to achieve CR or PR after 3 courses or\n      experience disease progression are either taken off study or treated with arsenic trioxide\n      and tretinoin as in phase I. Patients are followed monthly for 6 months, and then every 3\n      months for 18 months."
