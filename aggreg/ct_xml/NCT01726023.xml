             evidence of systemic inflammatory indicators; physical findings consistent with

             hours; perforation of gastroduodenal ulcers undergoing surgery within 24 hours.
             Other intra-abdominal processes in which primary etiology is not likely to be
             infectious

          -  Patient has abdominal wall abscess or bowel obstruction without perforation or
             ischemic bowel without perforation

          -  Patients whose surgery will include staged abdominal repair, or &quot;open abdomen&quot;
