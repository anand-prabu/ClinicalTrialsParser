The hypotheses of the study are: 1.\n      Individuals who are fit with an AFO will demonstrate improvements in spatial and temporal\n      gait parameters 2. Individuals who are fit with an AFO will demonstrate improvements in\n      walking endurance.  3. Individuals who are fit with an AFO will demonstrate improvements in\n      muscle firing profiles/EMG measures. 4. Individuals who are fit with an AFO will demonstrate\n      improvements in quality of life."

Subjects will be closely\n      monitored throughout the 24 week study and will be un-enrolled by self-request or the\n      following medical reasons: 1. Acute exacerbation of MS symptoms, 2. New diagnosis with\n      direct consequences affecting gait training, 3. Inability to tolerate the AFO."
