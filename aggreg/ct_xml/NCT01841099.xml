  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Undernutrition is one of the most important health issues in Kenya. Children who are
      chronically undernourished do not reach their full potential and are at increased risk of
      infectious disease. Stunting occurs in a third of Kenyan children and has severe and
      long-term consequences in terms of health, development, and poverty. Several studies have
      shown that stunting is frequently associated with subclinical inflammation of the bowel, a
      condition referred to as Environmental Enteropathy (EE), previously known as 'tropical
      sprue' or 'tropical enteropathy'. EE is clinically similar to childhood inflammatory bowel
      diseases (IBD), including Crohn's disease. The treatment of IBD routinely involves provision
      of gut immunomodulatory agents, but this approach has never been tried in EE.

      This proposal outlines a pilot double-blind randomised placebo-controlled trial of
      mesalamine (also called mesalazine - the safest immunomodulator used in IBD with least
      systemic activity) in treatment of severely malnourished children with EE.
