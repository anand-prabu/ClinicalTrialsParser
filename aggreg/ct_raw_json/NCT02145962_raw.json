Treatment period for both groups will be 14.2 weeks or upon a\n      complete healing. In each treatment session, evolution of ulcer healing should be recorded\n      photographically.\n\n      Efficacy and adverse effects will be searched for during treatment, short-term (<1 year),\n      and long-term follow-up in both groups (up to 7 years)."
