These 6 week cycles\n      are then repeated.  However, side effects are often seen to increase and get worse during\n      the 4 weeks of treatment, especially during the last 2 weeks.  Researchers want to learn if\n      shortening the treatment cycles can help to decrease the frequency and severity of side\n      effects.\n\n      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn more about the safety of giving\n      sunitinib to patients with metastatic kidney cancer for 2 weeks followed by 1 week in which\n      they receive no drug.  The side effects from and effectiveness of this dosing schedule will\n      be studied and compared to those of the standard."

This will then be repeated every 3 weeks.\n\n      Every 6 weeks will be 1 study cycle.\n\n      If you have any side effects tell the study doctor right away.  The study doctor may change\n      your dose of the study drug.\n\n      Study Visits:\n\n      Every day during the first week, and then at least 1 time each week during the study, your\n      blood pressure will be checked (either at home, at the clinic, or by your local doctor).\n      You will need to write down your blood pressure in a blood pressure diary each time you\n      check it and bring the diary with you to each clinic visit.\n\n      On Day 1 of Cycle 1:\n\n        -  You will have a physical exam.\n\n        -  Blood (about 3-4 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine and biomarker testing.\n\n        -  You will fill out a questionnaire about the quality of your life and about how you are\n           feeling.  This should take about 5 minutes.\n\n      On Day 35 of every cycle:\n\n        -  You will have a physical exam.\n\n        -  Blood (about 3-4 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.\n\n      On Day 35 of every even-numbered cycle (Cycles 2, 4, 6, and so on):\n\n        -  You will have a CT scan of your chest, abdomen, and pelvis.\n\n        -  Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn to check your thyroid function.\n\n        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for biomarker testing. (Cycles 2 , 4, and 6\n           only)\n\n        -  You will fill out the questionnaire about the quality of your life and about how you\n           are feeling. (Cycles 2 , 4, and 6 only)\n\n      At any time that the doctor thinks it is needed, additional blood (about 1 tablespoon) may\n      be drawn to check your thyroid function, and you may need to have a bone scan and CT scan or\n      MRI of the brain to check the status of the disease.\n\n      Length of Study:\n\n      You may continue taking the study drug for as long as the study doctor thinks it is in your\n      best interest.  You will be taken off study if the disease gets worse, intolerable side\n      effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.\n\n      Your participation in this study will be over after the follow-up visit.\n\n      End-of-Treatment Visit:\n\n      After you are no longer receiving the study drug, you will have an end-of-treatment visit\n      and blood (about 3-4 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine and biomarker testing.\n\n      Follow-Up Visit:\n\n      About 30 days after your end-of-treatment visit you will have a follow-up visit and blood\n      (about 3-4 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.\n\n      This is an investigational study.  Sunitinib is FDA approved and commercially available to\n      treat advanced kidney cancer.  The dosing schedule being used on this study is\n      investigational.\n\n      Up to 60 participants will be enrolled in this study.  Up to 15 will take part at MD\n      Anderson."

Breastfeeding must be discontinued if the\n             mother is treated with sunitinib\n\n          9. Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome\n             (AIDS)-related illness\n\n         10.
