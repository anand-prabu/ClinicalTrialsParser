  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is intended to evaluate treatment effectiveness with budesonide/formoterol (BFC)
      and tiotropium tromide in patients new to ICS/LABA combination and LAMA therapies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Using US claims data from the HealthCore Integrated Research Environment, COPD patients â‰¥40
      years old initiating BFC or tiotropium between 3/1/2009-2/28/2012 and considered at risk for
      a future exacerbation were identified and followed for 12 months.

    <description>The time to first COPD exacerbation will be calculated as the date of first COPD exacerbation minus index date. A COPD exacerbation event is defined as any of three conditions: COPD related inpatient hospitalization, COPD related emergency department visit, or COPD outpatient/office visit with a pharmacy claim for OCS and/or antibiotics on the same day or within ten days.</description>

    <description>The rate of COPD exacerbation will be defined as the total number of COPD exacerbations during the post-index period for all patients in each treatment cohort divided by the total number of person years.</description>

    <description>Continuity of care during the 12 month post-index period will be measured with the Bice and Boxerman index.  Proportion of Days Covered (PDC) and Medication Possession Ration (MPR) will be used to measure the compliance of index medication (Symbicort or Spiriva) during the 12 month post-index period.</description>
