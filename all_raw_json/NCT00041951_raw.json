Several areas harboring potential absence epilepsy genes have been identified\n      in the genome.\n\n      This study will further narrow down those areas and identify gene(s) involved in the cause\n      of CAE by taking several approaches: 1. Comparing patients with CAE to healthy individuals\n      without epilepsy and 2. Investigating whole families with many members affected with\n      epilepsy).\n\n      Participation in this study requires an interview regarding medical and family history and\n      saliva (spit) collection from all available family members of families with many epilepsy\n      cases. For those families without a history of epilepsy, parents and children are asked to\n      provide a small amount of saliva only. Healthy volunteers without epilepsy or a family\n      history of seizures are asked to fill out an anonymous questionnaire and provide a small\n      amount of saliva as well.\n\n      Although the study is based at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York, all study\n      materials can be sent to your home at no cost to participants or their insurance. For the\n      collection of saliva, special containers are provided and they can be shipped back to Mount\n      Sinai in the pre-paid envelope provided. Study materials can be completed at your\n      convenience.\n\n      Results from this study may enable scientists to understand the cause of absence seizures\n      and, perhaps, other types of seizures as well and with this laying the foundation for better\n      diagnosis and treatment of epilepsy patients in the future."
