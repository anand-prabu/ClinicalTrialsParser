            "textblock": "RATIONALE: Biological therapies such as beta-glucan use different ways to stimulate the\n      immune system and stop cancer cells from growing. Monoclonal antibodies can locate tumor\n      cells and either kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming\n      normal cells. Combining beta-glucan and monoclonal antibody may kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combining beta-glucan and monoclonal\n      antibody in treating patients who have metastatic neuroblastoma."

Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of\n      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 6 patients receive escalating doses of beta-glucan and MOAB 3F8 until the maximum\n      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which\n      at least 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed monthly for 6 months, every 2 months for 6 months, and then every 3-6\n      months for 2 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 24 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years."
