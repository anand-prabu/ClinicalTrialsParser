Trained patients will be prepared for appointments and will engage their\n      primary care physicians in active dialogue regarding cancer prevention and screening.\n\n      Based on self-advocacy, these patients are expected to receive better  preventive care and\n      report greater satisfaction with care. Program participation can subsequently contribute to\n      general health improvements and minimize health disparities."

The investigators will implement \"Speak Up\" and \"Connect\" programs in two\n      unique study populations: 1) participants in the ongoing NCI study and 2) older adults\n      attending senior center programs sponsored by Area Agencies on Aging (AAAs). Participants\n      will be assessed prior to the intervention and 1 month, and 6 months post intervention. The\n      investigators will have an observation window of six months to determine whether and when\n      the older adult obtained screening. The selection of a shorter follow-up time frame will\n      help reduce attrition."
