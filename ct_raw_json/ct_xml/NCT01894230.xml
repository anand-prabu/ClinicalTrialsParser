      The purpose of this study is to examine if using genetics can improve statin adherence in
      patients who should be taking statins but are not because of prior side effects. This study
      will assist physicians/providers in making a personalized health care plan for prevention of
      cardiovascular disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HMG Co-A reductase inhibitors (&quot;statins&quot;) are commonly prescribed to lower low density
      lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLc) and to prevent cardiovascular disease (CVD), a leading cause
      of morbidity and mortality. Long-term adherence to statins in the primary care environment
      is challenging; consequences of statin non-adherence include higher LDLc levels,
      hospitalizations, costs, and death due to CVD.

      Medication non-adherence is complex and multifactorial and can be associated with a number
      of factors including medication cost, complexity of medication regimen, poor
      provider-patient relationship / communication, and adverse side effects.  For statins, side
      effects such as muscle aches, cramping, and pain (referred to broadly as statin-related
      myopathy) are a frequent cause of non-adherence. These symptoms are non-specific and are
      frequent reasons for stopping statin therapy, due to patient or provider concern about the
      possibility of statin-related myopathy. Many patients may be needlessly deprived of the
      cardiovascular benefits of long-term statin use.

      A genetic risk factor for statin myopathy and subsequent non-adherence has recently been
      identified. In a genome-wide association study, a genetic variant (named SLCO1B1*5) was a
      main contributor of statin myopathy. It was demonstrated that the SLCO1B1*5 variant is not
      only a predictor of myopathy, but also of premature statin discontinuation. The risk with
      the *5 allele is statin specific: greatest with simvastatin and atorvastatin use, the least
      with pravastatin or rosuvastatin. Therefore, the SLCO1B1*5 variant is common, can predict
      myopathy,  subsequent non-adherence, and due to its statin-specific effects creates a novel
      research paradigm for personalizing statins to an individual's genetic profile. Carriers of
      the SLCO1B1*5 variant may do best on rosuvastatin, pravastatin, or fluvastatin whereas
      non-carriers may be treated with any statin.

      The objective of this study is to  conduct a randomized trial comparing two strategies:

        1. genetically guided statin therapy  vs.

        2. usual care (i.e., a strategy without genetics) on the effects of statin adherence and
           LDLc lowering.

      The overall hypothesis is that genetically guided statin therapy will lead to greater statin
      adherence and lower LDLc when compared to a non-guided strategy. The design of this trial
      will randomize primary care patients within Duke University Health System (DUHS) and travis
      Air Force Base (TAFB) clinics that are nonadherent to statins due to prior side-effects in
      an unblinded, 1:1 fashion, stratified by SLCO1B1*5 genotype.

    <description>The primary outcome of this study is the Morisky Medication Adherence Survey (MMAS), a self-reported measure of adherence, collected at baseline and at  3 and 8 months of follow-up. The eight-item MMAS survey will be used. This is a modified version of the original four-item MMAS capturing further aspects of adherence behavior.  The survey includes  8  yes/no items that are  summed to create an overall adherence score ranging from of 0 to 8, with higher scores indicating better adherence.  The primary hypothesis is that the genetically guided statin therapy leads to greater adherence of statin therapy, corresponding to a higher MMAS score.</description>

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Medication possession ration will be calculated based on number of statin medication refills over time from randomization to end of follow up.
MPR is calculated as follows:
Sum of the days' supply of all statin medications is the sum of the number of pills dispensed for each statin prescription during follow up (taken from 3-month, 4-month and 8-month statin utilization review)
Sum of the days of follow up = date of 8-month follow up survey - date of randomization
MPR = #1/#2 MPR will be modeled as a linear regression with arm, genotype, and site as predictors.</description>

Activity levels are defined by a three-level ordinal variable. A proportional odds model will be used with arm, genotype, and site as predictors. The assumption of proportional odds will be checked, and if it is not met, a multinomial regression model will be used.
