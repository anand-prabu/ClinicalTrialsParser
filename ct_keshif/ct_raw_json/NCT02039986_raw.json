CFRD arises primarily from compromised insulin secretion - traditionally\n      considered a by-product of pancreatic exocrine tissue damage and fibrosis. Recent\n      developments in the field of diabetes are propelling a re-examination of this basic\n      explanation. The impact of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR)\n      potentiator, ivacaftor, upon insulin secretion and glucose regulation has not been examined,\n      but improved glucose tolerance has been appreciated anecdotally. This study aims to\n      understand the impact of ivacaftor therapy upon blood glucose and insulin and incretin\n      secretion."
