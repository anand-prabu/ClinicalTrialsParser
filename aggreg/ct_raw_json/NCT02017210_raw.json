However, research has shown that some overweight and/or obese\n      people remain insulin sensitive and healthy despite their weight.\n\n      The investigators hypothesise that insulin-sensitive overweight and/or obese people maintain\n      their insulin sensitivity and metabolic health over time.  The investigators also\n      hypothesise that the preservation of insulin sensitivity will be determined by key metabolic\n      factors.\n\n      STUDY PART 2 The cause of insulin resistance is potentially related to special fats\n      (sphingolipids) within the skeletal muscle.  Insulin resistance usually improves after\n      weight loss but it is not yet known how these sphingolipids behave.\n\n      The investigators hypothesise that improvement in insulin sensitivity with calorie\n      restriction and weight loss will be coupled with decreases in specific skeletal muscle\n      sphingolipids."
