The aim is to\n      reduce vital and functional risk of acute chorioamnionitis for the mother, the fetus or the\n      newborn,.\n\n      If the kinetics profile of one or several markers correlates strongly with the diagnosis of\n      chorioamnionitis, it could be used in clinical practice, possibly in the context of another\n      clinical study.\n\n      The results of the study presented here are destined to be published in obstetrics journals."
