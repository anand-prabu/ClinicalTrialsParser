The study also begins an\n      assessment of the effectiveness of d4T therapy on HIV replication, on plasma levels of p24\n      antigen, and clinical or immunologic parameters associated with AIDS.\n\n      Of the methods that are being evaluated to treat HIV-infected individuals, AZT has produced\n      the best results to date. Toxic effects in approximately 50 percent of patients receiving\n      AZT may limit its usefulness for prolonged treatment. Long-term treatment may be necessary\n      to prevent progression of early stage HIV infection to AIDS and to prevent secondary\n      transmission. Other drugs that may be equally or more effective than AZT and useful in the\n      long- term treatment of HIV infection must be developed and evaluated. Test-tube and animal\n      studies of d4T show that the drug can inhibit replication (reproduction) of HIV at\n      concentrations similar to concentrations of AZT that have anti-HIV activity. These studies\n      also indicate that the drug may stay in the bloodstream longer than AZT. Thus, it may be\n      possible for the drug to be as effective as AZT when taken less frequently than AZT. It also\n      may have a less disturbing effect on other body functions (such as thymidine metabolism)."
