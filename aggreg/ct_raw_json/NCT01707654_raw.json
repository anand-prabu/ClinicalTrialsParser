Reconstruction of these combined injuries is difficult. When the\n      neurocutaneous defect is associated with wound infection, reconstructive alternatives are\n      more limited. From July 2008 to May 2010, a retrospective study was conducted with 9\n      consecutive postinfection patients who had the neurocutaneous defect of the finger following\n      trauma. The purpose of this retrospective study is to report repair of the complicated\n      infected wound in the finger using the bipedicled nerve flap and to evaluate the efficacy of\n      this technique."
