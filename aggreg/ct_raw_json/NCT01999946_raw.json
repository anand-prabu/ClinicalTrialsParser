            "textblock": "This study is a randomized control trial of XR-NTX (n=100) vs. enhanced TAU (n=100) among\n      opioid dependent adults leaving NYC jails who explicitly reject agonist treatment.\n      Initiating treatment the week prior to release and continuing for 25 weeks post-release, we\n      hypothesize the XR-NTX arm will demonstrate significantly longer time-to-relapse vs. TAU. In\n      parallel, we propose to recruit a matched, quasi-experimental methadone cohort (n=100),\n      which will result in a naturalistic comparison of XR-NTX vs. an established jail-based MTP\n      standard-of-care.\n\n      Rationale: Immediate relapse to drug, alcohol, and tobacco use is a nearly universal and\n      expected near-term outcome among adults with addiction disorders leaving U.S. jails.  Yet\n      while opioid agonist therapies are proven and effective re-entry interventions, many US\n      correctional facilities, including almost all large U.S. municipal jails, do not offer these\n      treatments. However, in New York City (NYC), jail-to-community methadone treatment is, since\n      1986, a well-studied standard-of-care, yet many inmates eligible to initiate the methadone\n      treatment program (MTP) while incarcerated do not, possibly due to anti-methadone patient\n      preferences. Rather, the vast majority of these jail detainees undergo a brief 6-day\n      methadone taper following arrest, remain in jail for brief periods out-of-treatment while\n      'drug free' and undergoing a decline in physiologic opioid tolerance, nearly universally\n      relapse to heroin or other illicit opioid use following release,  and are re-arrested in the\n      next 12 months at rates of 50-75%. Extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX, Vivitrol), now\n      FDA-approved for opioid dependence, produces a 30-day mu opioid receptor antagonist\n      blockade, and offers an potentially promising modality for 'inoculating' persons leaving\n      jails against immediate opioid relapse.  Persons injected with 380mg of XR-NTX are unable to\n      effectively experience euphoria or respiratory depression when returning to average doses of\n      illicit opioids for the ensuing 4-5 weeks. An injection prior to release would possibly give\n      the individual a month or so to return home from jail, experience opioid abstinence, and\n      then either continue XR-NTX, initiate agonist or behavioral treatments, or, resume a\n      significantly postponed relapse to illicit use.  Our team recently established the\n      feasibility of administering XR-NTX to opioid dependent adults within a week of release in\n      NYC jails.  We now propose to conduct a large, definitive randomized controlled trial\n      estimating the effectiveness of XR-NTX as opioid treatment at release from jail vs. a\n      counseling- and referral-enhanced treatment-as-usual (TAU) condition.  We also propose to\n      recruit a non-randomized, quasi-experimental cohort of participants in a jail-based\n      methadone maintenance program (MTP), allowing an additional comparison of XR-NTX to a\n      methadone standard-of-care.\n\n      Specific Aim 1: Randomized Effectiveness Trial of XR-NTX vs. TAU for Jail-to-Community\n      Re-Entry Opioid Relapse Prevention.  Our primary aim is to compare time-to-relapse among\n      participants treated with XR-NTX vs. randomized TAU controls, following release from jail.\n\n      Specific Aim 2: Quasi-Experimental Comparison of XR-NTX vs. a Methadone Treatment Program\n      for Re-Entry Opioid Relapse Prevention. To compare time-to-relapse among the XR-NTX RCT arm\n      vs. jail-based MTP participants using a quasi-experimental design.\n\n      Specific Aim 3a-e: Related Opioid Treatment Outcomes.  To compare re-entry rates of 5\n      treatment outcomes across all arms: 3a) community treatment initiation and retention, 3b)\n      any opioid and other illicit drug or alcohol use, defined as continuous counts of both days,\n      amount/day, and urine toxicologies, 3c) injection drug use and HIV sexual risk factors, 3d)\n      accidental drug overdose and mortality, and, 3e) rates of re-incarceration and an\n      exploratory analysis of cost-effectiveness.\n\n      Implications: While there is growing interest in the newly approve use of XR-NTX for opioid\n      treatment, its effectiveness has not been evaluated in any correctional facilities,\n      including large municipal jails, vs. usual care, nor in the context of standard-of-care\n      methadone treatment.  This study will allow providers, correctional and public health\n      authorities, including our collaborators at the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene,\n      and payers and policy makers to assess the utility of XR-NTX as re-entry opioid treatment,\n      with important implications for limiting the great public safety and societal costs of\n      heroin and prescription opioid addictions.  Further, NYC jail inmates are predominantly\n      African American and Hispanic, and represent communities disproportionately affected by\n      unemployment, family poverty, HIV and hepatitis C, all downstream effects of opioid\n      dependence.  As the majority of opioid addicted persons leave jail return to their\n      neighborhoods untreated and prone to rapid relapse, we hypothesize adding XR-NTX to the\n      re-entry 'toolbox' will save both money and lives in these underserved communities."
