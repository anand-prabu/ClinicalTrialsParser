  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is designed to determine whether an intervention that provides
      information to primary care providers about gaps in care for their patients recently
      discharged from hospital for COPD can reduce hospital re-admissions and mortality and
      improve their patients' quality-of-life.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations are common among Veterans
      admitted to hospital, lead to worsening health-related quality of life, and are important
      drivers of health care expenditures. As many as half of patients discharged for COPD are
      readmitted within 6 months. An intervention to improve COPD care is needed, not only to
      treat patients for COPD and their accompanying comorbidities, but also to redesign the care
      delivery system. The goal of this clinical trial is to test an intervention to improve
      patient care during the transition from hospital to outpatient setting for patients
      discharged for COPD.  We will target the intervention to Patient Aligned Care Team (PACT)
      providers who will be randomized to receive the intervention or not receive the
      intervention.  For the intervention, study clinicians, consisting of experienced primary
      care providers and pulmonary specialists, will review the medical record for each patient
      discharged from hospital for COPD.  The team will look for gaps in care for COPD and key
      co-morbidities such as obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.  They
      will focus on immediate care processes associated with the hospital admission and comorbid
      disease treatment. For providers in the intervention group, the team will place any patient
      care recommendations into the medical record using a non-visit consult note and pre-filled
      order sets.  The patient's provider then may accept, modify, or decline any or all of the
      recommendations based on personal knowledge of the patient's history.  We hypothesize that
      the intervention will: 1) improve patient quality of life; and 2) decrease hospital
      readmission and mortality after hospital admission for COPD exacerbation.
