            "textblock": "Background: An accessory to the commercially available GALILEI Dual-Scheimpflug Corneal\n      Topographer/Keratometer with the name \"EBR Accessory\" was developed by the company Ziemer\n      Ophthalmic Systems AG for the measurement of intraocular distances. The combination is\n      called \"GALILEI Lens Professional\". The measurement principle is based on on short coherence\n      interferometry/-reflectometry, which has gained wide-spread application and has been applied\n      clinically, including one of the members of this study group, for the precise measurement of\n      axial, intraocular distances (12.1.). Such EBR Accessory measurements, in combination with\n      measurements by the GALILEI, may be applied to given intra-ocular lens (IOL) types and IOL\n      equations, an permit the calculation of suggested IOLs that are implanted during cataract\n      surgery, in order to achieve the desired vision correction. To register this accessory for\n      sale, the precision and agreement to existing devices with similar applications (\"predicate\n      devices\") must be demonstrated. One complete measurement consists of a\n      cornea-topography/keratometry scan, followed immediately by three consecutive, axial\n      biometry scans of the anterior segment (cornea and crystalline lens) and - after a short\n      re-alignment - three consecutive, axial biometry scans of the retina. The measurement\n      process is continuous, but divided in two steps. Blinking by the patient is possible in\n      between the two steps, which increases patient comfort and, in certain cases, measurement\n      success. Precision is evaluated by three repeated, complete measurements with the GALILEI\n      Lens Professional and each predicate device. Two standard devices with comparable optical\n      technology that are used in routine cataract surgery were declared as predicate devices.\n      These two devise are typically used in combination with standard keratometers, as which the\n      GALILEI Lens Professional may be employed as well.\n\n      Goal: The comparison of the GALILEI Lens Professional to predicate devices with respect to\n      precision in measuring postoperative, calculated target refractions in cataract patients,\n      and versatility of measurable quantities."
