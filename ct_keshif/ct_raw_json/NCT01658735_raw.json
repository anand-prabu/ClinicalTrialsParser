This study will provide a definable level of\n      evidence for treatment efficacy, and provide a basis for evidence-based recommendation for\n      or against utilization for these two modalities.  The results for H-Wave\u00ae device, if\n      positive, could significantly impact morbidity by providing a non-invasive,\n      non-pharmacologic treatment for symptomatic relief, and reduce overall disability and health\n      care costs associated with chronic low back pain."
