Nonetheless\n      this myocardial iron overload might have severe implications on cardiac function on a long\n      term basis.\n\n      A single trial was conducted on limited number of patients with 1.5 Tesla MRI, which showed\n      a myocardial iron overload (defined by a myocardium T2* value <20ms) in 19% of the subjects.\n\n      The main objective of this study is to precisely estimate cardiac iron overload in treatment\n      naive patients with newly diagnosed HFE hereditary haemochromatosis with a 3 Tesla MRI, more\n      sensitive than the 1.5 Tesla one, in order to later appreciate its correlation with cardiac\n      morbidity in HHC."
