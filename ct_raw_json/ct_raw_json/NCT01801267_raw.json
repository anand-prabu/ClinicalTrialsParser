            "textblock": "Ventriculoperitoneal shunts are the standard of care for patients with communicating\n      hydrocephalus, but they have a high failure rate - up to 40% fail within 1 year and 50% fail\n      within 2 years. It has long been assumed that endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) would\n      not work in this population and is better suited to patients with obstructive hydrocephalus\n      (such as from a tumor blocking cerebral-spinal fluid (CSF) pathways). However, as scientists\n      learn more about CSF and the way our brains absorb this fluid, they have learned that this\n      may not be so straight-forward. Recent small studies have shown that ETVs can work in a good\n      percentage of children with communicating hydrocephalus, too. But no randomized controlled\n      trials have been done to compare these two treatments directly to determine which will\n      provide children with a better prognosis, fewer surgeries over their lifetime, less time in\n      the hospital and the greatest chance at as normal a life as possible.\n\n      The investigators will conduct a trial to compare these two surgical treatments where\n      patients will be randomized to receive either a shunt or an ETV. Because ETV has been shown\n      to have a high failure rate in newborns, the investigators will not include these patients\n      and instead will study patients who come to Duke University with communicating hydrocephalus\n      between the ages of 1 year and 18 years. The study will include patients with ventricular\n      shunts who are in need of revision and patients who were just diagnosed and need their first\n      shunt.\n\n      All patients who agree to participate will be randomized to receive either an ETV or a\n      shunt. The study team will follow them for one year from the time of the surgery and will\n      determine what percentage of patients require further CSF-related surgeries, how long they\n      go after their surgery before they need another surgery, how much time they spend in the\n      hospital and what percentage of patients suffer CSF-infections or other problems related to\n      the surgery or their hydrocephalus. The study team will examine these results and determine\n      if ETV is a safer or more effective treatment for children with communicating hydrocephalus\n      than is a ventricular shunt."
