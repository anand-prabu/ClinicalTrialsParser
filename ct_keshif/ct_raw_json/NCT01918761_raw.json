One\n      cycle is defined as 21 days.\n\n      The first 3 subjects will be enrolled at a rate of \u2264 1 subject per week. If the target dose\n      regimen is safe based on the incidence of DLT another 3 subjects will be enrolled.\n\n      If the dose of 45 mg qd is not safe alternate lower doses will be explored (dose level -1,\n      dose level -2) to identify the MTD of dacomitinib in combination of pemetrexed.
