            "textblock": "New, \"intelligent\" ventilator modes with more complex closed loops have been developed, some\n      with a demonstrated clinical benefit. The modes of proportional assist ventilation (PAV) and\n      neurally-adjusted ventilatory assist (NAVA) are capable of delivering ventilation\n      proportional to patient effort and may be associated with improved patient-ventilator\n      synchrony when compared to pressure support ventilation (PSV), a classic simple closed-loop\n      assisted ventilation mode.\n\n      This study will study both modes of ventilation (PAV and NAVA) in each patient who is\n      recruited, and measures of patient-ventilator synchrony and work of breathing will be taken\n      during each mode.\n\n      Baseline data will be collected on a standardized volume-cycled control mode ventilator\n      setting for 5 minutes and on a standardized pressure support ventilator mode for 25 minutes.\n       Subjects will then be randomized to either PAV or NAVA ventilation and will be ventilated\n      on that mode for 30 minutes. Equivalence of support levels between PAV and NAVA trials will\n      be ensured by targeting the same peak (Ppeak) airway pressures.  Data collected will include\n      (but are not limited to) vital signs, sedation score, dyspnea assessment using visual analog\n      scale, respiratory rate, tidal volume (Vt), peak airway pressure (Ppeak), inspiratory time\n      and neural inspiratory time (Ti and Tni), total physiologic and neural respiratory cycle\n      time (Ttot and Tntot), end-tidal CO2, esophageal pressure waveforms, waveforms of all\n      ventilatory patterns, Edi waveforms, and peak Edi.  Subjects will then be switched to the\n      other mode of ventilation and undergo an identical 30-minute evaluation period with\n      identical data collection.  Arterial blood gas measurements will be done after any changes\n      in ventilator settings only in subjects who have had arterial lines inserted for\n      clinically-indicated reasons. This will be a replicate crossover study, meaning that all\n      subjects that are initially randomized to one sequence (PAV-NAVA or NAVA-PAV) will\n      afterwards be \"crossed-over\" to the other one. These two additional periods of measurements\n      will allow us to account for potential carry over effects of the different interventions."
