All\n      patients will then be evaluated by means of a second look laparoscopy (SLL) 6-12 weeks after\n      the initial surgery and reevaluated via modified American Fertility Society scoring\n      techniques. An independent reviewer will also score adhesions utilize a video recording made\n      from the second look  laparoscopic surgery. Patients will be contacted both 1 and 4 weeks\n      post -op and assessed for complications.  It is the expectation that patients will show no\n      greater post-operative adhesion formation and a <1% complication rate. Time and ease of\n      suturing will also be evaluated. It is expected that the V-Loc suturing technique will show\n      significantly reduced suturing time, be easier to use, and will be associated with minimal\n      adhesions."
