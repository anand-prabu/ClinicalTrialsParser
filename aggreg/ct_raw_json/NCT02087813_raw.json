Current NMO therapies are nonspecific and\n      have varying and often suboptimal benefit. The investigators will evaluate whether use of\n      alpha1-antitrypsin (A1AT, an FDA-approved medication for patients with congenital deficiency\n      of A1AT associated with emphysema) can benefit acute attacks of NMO, improving patient\n      disability and quality of life."
