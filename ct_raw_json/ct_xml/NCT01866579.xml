  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ethambutol is widely used as first-line drug, but has serious side effect of optic
      neuropathy. As previously reported, incidence of ethambutol optic neuropathy is about 1~2%,
      there was considerable screening efforts and medical cost is increasing. However, there is
      no effective treatment of ethambutol optic neuropathy or no definite preventable measure.
      Moreover, multi-drug resistance tuberculosis or extensively drug resistance tuberculosis is
      emerging, more toxic secondary drug is used in the long-term.

      It is known that retinal nerve fiber layer is increased early stage in ethambutol optic
      neuropathy. So we decide to evaluate the retinal nerve fiber layer thickness measured by
      optical coherence tomography in longitudinal manner.
