      Study Group Study group will be asked to test blood glucose at least 4 times a day Each time
      the study subject takes a meter reading the meter time-stamps the reading. All meter
      readings will upload to the cloud via&quot; Myglucohealth&quot; website, where they can be accessed by
      caregivers, including providers and parents. Device will be programmed to coax patients when
      readings are due. Parents will be notified by device about the blood glucose testing
      results. Provider will set device to alert patient or patient's family if patient has not
      yet tested or uploaded a test or send alerts to parent if uploaded numbers are outside an
      identified range (&lt;70 mg/dL &gt; 300 mg/dL). As per the standard of care, parents are trained
      to administer sugar containing liquids, or inject extra insulin for hyperglycemia
      correction. Parents will be encouraged to contact study personnel if they are concerned
      about the diabetes control. Study personnel will access home blood glucose monitor data, and
      provide insulin dosing advice. Parents will be asked to upload blood glucose readings prior
      to each visit.

      Control group Subjects will continue routine care which requires blood glucose testing at
      least 4 times a day. Parents will use customary ways to communicate (pager, email, fax or
      phone) with the Diabetes team, if they are concerned about glycemic control..

      Study group will have two virtual visits (months 3 and 6) Control group will have all
      quarterly visits in person. A laptop will be used for virtual visits and will be set up with
      the help of the TTUHSC Information Technology Security Officer.
