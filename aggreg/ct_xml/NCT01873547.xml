  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The morbidity of spinal cord injury (SCI) is increasing year by year significantly in China.
      The methods to treat SCI patients in sequela stage update are poor. Though traditional
      rehabilitation therapy is the routine method to treat SCI in sequela stage, aiming to
      improve the neurological disorders of these patients, such as sensory disturbance,
      dyskinesia, autologous adjustment of blood pressure, dysfunction of urination, defecation
      and perspiration , etc. What's a pity, the efficacy of the rehabilitation therapy is
      unsatisfactory. Rehabilitation Therapy can prevent the process of muscle atrophy and joint
      stiffness. However, it can not repair the damaged nerve function. Studies show that
      mesenchymal stem cell transplantation can remarkably improve the neurological function of
      SCI in animals without any severe side effect.

      In this study, 300 patients will be divided into three groups and the investigators will use
      mesenchymal stem cells derived from umbilical cord to treat 100 SCI patients. They will also
      follow up 100 patients who only receive rehabilitation and another 100 patients who accept
      neither stem cell therapy nor rehabilitation. On this basis, the investigators can compare
      the efficacy of these two treatments.
