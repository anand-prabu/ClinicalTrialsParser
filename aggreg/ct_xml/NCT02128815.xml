      Background: Health coaching is defined as health education, promotion and support by a
      professional to enhance the well-being of individuals and facilitate the achievement of
      their health-related goals.  However, health coaching has not been adequately assessed in
      the community health care setting in individuals with T2DM. The purpose of this study is to
      determine the effect of diabetes health coaching in adults with T2DM in the community health
      care setting on clinical outcomes, self-care behaviours and health care utilization.

      Evaluating the Effect of a Diabetes Health Coach in Individuals with Type 2 Diabetes.

      Background: Health coaching is defined as health education, promotion and support by a
      professional to enhance the well-being of individuals and facilitate the achievement of
      their health-related goals.  However, health coaching has not been adequately assessed in
      the community health care setting in individuals with T2DM. The purpose of this study is to
      determine the effect of diabetes health coaching in adults with T2DM in the community health
      care setting on clinical outcomes, self-care behaviours and health care utilization.

      Research Questions: In adults with T2DM who are referred to a community based diabetes
      program, does assignment to a diabetes health coach that provides remotely delivered
      frequent personalized education and support, behaviour modification counselling and
      reinforcement, and psychosocial support improve glycated hemoglobin (A1C) over diabetes
      education alone? Secondary Questions include: i) Does the assignment to a diabetes health
      coach improve: a) body mass index (BMI); b) diabetes self-care activities; and c) quality of
      life, more than standard diabetes self-management education alone after one year? ii) What
      is the incremental cost-effectiveness of the diabetes health coach relative to standard
      diabetes self-management education?

      Proposed Design and Intervention:

      The study design will be an open-label randomized controlled trial of adults with T2DM in a
      Community Health Centre (CHC) setting. Upon randomization to the intervention group, study
      participants will receive one-year access to diabetes health coaching, which comprises: a)
      weekly access to a coach, via secured messaging or telephone; b) diabetes case management;
      c) personalized diabetes education; d) behaviour modification, goal setting and
      reinforcement; and d) psychosocial support. All study participants will have access to their
      standard diabetes care and access to the Virtual Lifestyle Management program, an internet
      based deliverable program which comprises the National Institutes of Health's Diabetes
      Prevention Program (DPP) protocol and curriculum, proven to be effective for weight
      management. Education includes 24 modules with streaming audio narration; and b) tracking
      tools to record dietary and physical activity results. All participants will also receive an
      accelerometer to measure physical activity (steps).

      Outcome:

      The primary outcome is the difference the mean A1C in the diabetes health coaching program,
      compared to the mean A1C in the control group at 1 year. Secondary outcomes will include: a)
      BMI; b) diabetes self-care activities; c) quality of life; and d) cost-effectiveness.

      Implications:

      The findings from this trial may support a new strategy to complement and/or enhance
      diabetes self-management services in the community.  Coaching may be delivered remotely and
      may demonstrate to be a cost-effective or cost-neutral service to support those living with
      diabetes.
