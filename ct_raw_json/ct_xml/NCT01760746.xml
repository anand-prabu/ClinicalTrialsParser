  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PDR is a leading cause of irreversible vision loss in North America. This disease is caused
      by the growth of abnormal blood vessels in the retina. These abnormal blood vessels can
      bleed inside the eye, causing a vitreous hemorrhage (VH). Sometimes when patients have this
      bleeding, a surgery called vitrectomy is required to remove the blood from within the eye.
      In order to reduce complications during the surgery, most retina surgeons will inject
      Avastin into the eye a few days before the surgery.

      Avastin (bevacizumab) is currently not approved by Health Canada to treat any ocular
      disease. Lucentis (ranibizumab) is approved by Health Canada as a treatment for age-related
      macular degeneration, diabetic macular edema, and retinal venous occlusive disease. While
      Avastin is not approved by Health Canada for the treatment of these diseases, the majority
      of retina specialists around the world are now using Avastin &quot;off-label&quot; to treat these
      diseases. That is because Avastin and Lucentis both tend to work equally well in these
      disease, but Avastin is significantly cheaper. While Avastin and Lucentis are generally
      regarded to be equal, there may be some differences between these two drugs that have not
      been discovered. The aim of this study is to look for these differences.

      Previous research by the investigators in this study has shown that injecting Avastin into
      eyes causes increased inflammatory proteins to develop inside the eye.  This increase in
      these proteins was related to complications that developed after the vitrectomy surgery.
      Lucentis may be associated with less of an increase in inflammatory proteins (and less
      complications). The aim of this study will be to compare Avastin and Lucentis with respect
      to how they affect inflammatory proteins in the eye, as well as the rate of complications
      during surgery.

      Study participants will be divided into two arms (&quot;groups&quot;) of 30 subjects. Subjects will
      receive Avastin or Lucentis a few days before vitrectomy surgery. The assignment will be
      random and  the study is double-masked. Masking is done so that the investigators can
      clearly determine any differences between the 2 drugs.

    <description>No single inflammatory cytokine or any summary measure of the cytokines has been shown to characterize the effect of anti-VEGF (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor)treatment; therefore, we will employ a global test to compare the difference of all inflammatory cytokines between the two treatment groups.  For each cytokine the endpoint will be defined as percentage change from baseline. We will employ O'Brien's rank-sum global test to simultaneously evaluate all the inflammatory cytokine endpoints.  O'Brien's test is a nonparametric test procedure for testing whether multiple outcomes in one treatment group have consistently larger values than outcomes in the other treatment group.</description>

    <description>Study participants will be divided into two arms. Subjects will receive Avastin or Lucentis a few days before vitrectomy surgery. The assignment will be double-masked.The first sample of aqueous humor will be obtained immediately prior to the intravitreal injection.
On the same of the intravitreal injection, a blood sample will be taken for hemoglobin A1C measurement. Approximately 1 week later when patients are having their scheduled vitrectomy surgery, an additional sample of aqueous humour will be obtained .
Intraocular cytokines levels will be measured in aqueous humor samples using multiplex cytokine assays.</description>

        In order to assess changes in intraocular levels of cytokines following anti-VEGF
        treatment, the ideal time to measure these cytokines is at baseline and approximately 1
        week later. In patients with PDR who are scheduled for vitrectomy, many vitreoretinal
        surgeons now inject bevacizumab approximately 1 week prior to the surgery in order to
        decrease the risk of intra-operative complications. These patients are thus an excellent
        study group for studying intraocular cytokine changes in response to anti-VEGF therapy,
        since that are already scheduled to have 2 intraocular procedures performed approximately
        1 week apart, thereby minimizing the risk of obtaining aqueous humour.
