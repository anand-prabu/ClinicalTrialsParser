  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One of the challenges of stem cell therapy is to understand the fate of the injected stem
      cell. By labelling various stem cells with radioisotopes their fate (homing) can be
      demonstrated. In this study, we will develop and refine the existing techniques of stem cell
      labelling to various subtypes of stem cells namely- freshly aspirated bone marrow cells,
      cryopreserved bone marrow cells, g-csf mobilized peripheral blood stem cells and umbilical
      cord cells. After testing the labelling efficacy and viability, these cells will be injected
      in to the coronary arteries of patients with myocardial infarction who have undergone a
      successful revascularization either by angioplasty or thrombolysis.  Homing of stem cells
      will be demonstrated by nuclear scan after the procedure. We are adapting techniques used to
      label cells for detection of infection and bleeding using nuclear scans for in vivo
      scanning. Also we are using Technetium instead of FDG which has very little radioactivity
      allowing us to work with the current cardiac labs with out having to reconstruct the labs
      with special shielding for radioactive compounds. Real benefit of stem cells then can be
      explored after demonstrating the proper homing.

      Phase One: Four Different types of stem cells will be tested ( Freshly aspirated Bone marrow
      cells, cryopreserved cells, umbilical cord cells, Stem cells mobilised from bone marrow by
      g-csf,  mesenchymal cells), and the efficacy of labelling documented and effect on viability
      noted. 3 samples of each type will be tested and the results will be documented. Different
      cells are being tried to test the efficiency of the labelling technique in different types
      of cells. This will provide the protocols for all future labelling studies. This will be
      conducted in collaboration between the stem cell department, nuclear medicine department and
      nuclear cardiology department.

      Phase Two (Clinical Study):

      This will be the  pilot clinical  study  done alongside with the phase one study,  and will
      enrol 10 patients    with Recent Myocardial infarction ( within 3 months) .   A small
      fraction of patient's own bone marrow stem cells will be labelled with Technetium 99m HMPAO.
      The labelled cells will be administered via the intracoronary injection along with the
      unlabeled stem cells. The localization of the radio-labelled stem cells in the myocardium
      will then be detected using the conventional Gamma camera.
