            "textblock": "Family-centered mental health treatment of children values and supports the role of parents\n      in their child's recovery. However, medications are often the primary focus in community\n      treatment. Young children, even preschool-age youth, are increasingly being treated with\n      antipsychotic medication for serious mood and behavior problems. This medication may be\n      necessary to address safety issues (such as severe aggression), but it can cause serious\n      side effects, such as obesity. Also, medication-only treatment does not follow recommended\n      care for these types of problems. Psychosocial treatments (for example, programs that coach\n      and empower parents to manage their child's difficult behaviors) are highly recommended as\n      part of comprehensive (medication and psychosocial) child treatment. Parent involvement in\n      psychosocial treatment has clear benefits for their child's mental health and, unlike\n      medication, the effects can last long after treatment is completed. However, problems\n      related to access (for example, long waiting lists) and use (for example, parent mistrust of\n      mental health services) of services are common.  Maryland, like other states, has developed\n      a system to improve medication safety by reviewing health information about the child to\n      determine if the treatment is appropriate. This review reduces unnecessary medication\n      treatment and makes sure that children have adequate health screening before starting any\n      treatment. Children who are approved for medication treatment have moderate-to-severe mental\n      health problems, which supports their need for comprehensive (medication and\n      psychosocial)treatment, instead of medication-only treatment. In this study, investigators\n      are partnering with parents/family advocates, child-serving agencies, and health providers\n      to develop a Family Navigator Service to link with this medication program. Family\n      Navigators are individuals who have cared for their own child with mental illness. The\n      navigators will support parents, provide information on psychosocial treatment options, and\n      address barriers to using services. The goals of this program are to improve use of\n      psychosocial services, and to improve parent empowerment, support, and satisfaction with\n      their child's mental health treatment. The investigators also expect that the Navigator\n      Service will improve the child's overall mental health and reduce the likelihood that he/she\n      will need a medication dose increase or another medication added over the initial treatment\n      period. The Navigator Service will be provided for parents of public insured children who\n      are 10 years old and have just been approved for antipsychotic medication treatment. The\n      Navigator Services will be provided by phone, so this service can support families in both\n      rural and urban settings. The investigators' long term goal is to develop a Family Navigator\n      program that strongly supports Family-centered treatment of children and can be used to help\n      families in other underserved areas beyond Maryland."

            "textblock": "Background: Emerging data on serious antipsychotic medication side effects (e.g. new onset\n      diabetes)has heightened concerns about sharp increases in \"off label\" pediatric\n      antipsychotic treatment of mood/behavioral disorders, and led to increased scrutiny of\n      pediatric mental health treatment. Several states are developing antipsychotic medication\n      pre-authorization programs to reduce inappropriate or unsafe prescribing. This Healthcare\n      system change, however, fails to address a critical underlying problem that parents are not\n      effectively engaged to utilize non-medication treatments and serve an active role in their\n      child's mental health recovery. Psychosocial treatments (e.g. parenting skills training to\n      manage aggressive behaviors) are evidence-based interventions that are poorly utilized in\n      community care. The Maryland Medicaid program developed a pediatric Antipsychotic\n      Pre-Authorization Program that requires providers to make at least one psychosocial\n      treatment referral in order to obtain medication approval. This program was shaped by strong\n      input from parents, health experts, and child serving agency administrators to promote\n      psychosocial treatment referral, but it does not provide any Family-centered services to\n      improve treatment utilization. Objectives: We propose to link the Antipsychotic\n      Pre-Authorization Program with a Family Navigator Service. The investigators will examine if\n      Navigator Services improve parent empowerment, support, and satisfaction with child\n      services. The investigators will also assess if Navigator Services are associated with\n      improved psychosocial service utilization, improved child functioning, and lower likelihood\n      of medication increases (higher dose or addition of another medication). The investigators'\n      long term objective is to develop a Family Navigator model that is highly portable, amenable\n      for use in underserved areas, addresses the needs of low income families with young\n      children, and promotes evidence-based mental health care. Methods: The investigators will\n      conduct a randomized trial of a telephone Family Navigator Service versus usual care for 240\n      Medicaid insured youth 10 years old who are approved for antipsychotic medication treatment.\n       The Family Navigator is a parent who has experienced their own child's mental illness.\n      Navigators will provide support, information on psychosocial treatment options, and options\n      to address barriers to care. The investigators will assess family-centered outcomes at\n      baseline and 90 days (medication re-authorization). The investigators will use generalized\n      linear mixed effects models with the appropriate link functions to assess whether there is a\n      significant difference in improvement from baseline to the post-treatment assessment on the\n      outcome variables between the Family Navigator condition and treatment as usual condition. A\n      significant interaction between time and study condition would support the hypothesis that a\n      Family Navigator will improve parent and child outcomes."
