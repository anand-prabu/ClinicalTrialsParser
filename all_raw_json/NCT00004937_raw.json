Determine the\n      toxicities of this treatment regimen in this patient population.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive acridine carboxamide IV continuously\n      over days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for at least 2 courses and up to a maximum of\n      6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are\n      followed every 6 weeks until disease progression.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-25 patients will be accrued for this study."
