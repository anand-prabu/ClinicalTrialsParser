  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multicentre, prospective, observational post-market registry. To monitor and collect data on
      the post-market clinical safety and performance of the Vascutek Rapidax II Vascular Access
      Graft.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At least 10 patients who have been implanted with a Rapidax II Vascular Access Graft for
      haemodialysis applications in patients with End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD), who are
      undergoing or are scheduled to begin haemodialysis and require implant of a prosthetic
      graft.

      Primary End Points:Safety and Performance

        -  Secondary patency at 6 months post implant (Performance).(access survival until
           abandonment). The interval from time of implant  to abandonment or time of measurement
           of patency, including intervention to re-establish the functionality of the thrombosed
           access

        -  Secondary patency at 12 months post implant (Performance.(access survival until
           abandonment). The interval from time of implant  to abandonment or time of measurement
           of patency, including intervention to re-establish the functionality of the thrombosed
           access

        -  Freedom from device related Serious Adverse Events at 6 and 12 months (Safety)

      Secondary End Points: Safety and performance

        -  Primary patency at 6 months post implant (Performance. (intervention free access
           survival). The interval from time of implant to any intervention designed to maintain
           or re-establish patency or to access thrombosis

        -  Primary patency at 12 months post implant (Performance).(intervention free access
           survival). The interval from time of implant to any intervention designed to maintain
           or re-establish patency or to access thrombosis

        -  Assisted primary patency at 6 months (Performance. (thrombosis free access survival).
           The interval from time of implant to intervention to maintain patency prior to the
           occurrence of thrombosis

        -  Freedom from device related Serious Adverse Events at 6 and 12 months
