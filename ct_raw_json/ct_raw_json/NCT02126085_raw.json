This is the reason why patients with\n      extended stroke are increasingly subjected to an endovascular stroke therapy (EST).\n\n      Matter of ongoing debate is how to sedate these patients during intervention. Some\n      clinicians prefer an intubation due to a reduction of patients\u00b4movements and therefore\n      potentially lowering complication rates (injury by catheter, aspiration e.g.).\n\n      On the other hand retrospective investigations hypothesize that general anaesthesia is\n      associated with peri-interventional hypotension followed by poorer clinical outcome.\n\n      The best anaesthaesiologic management in endovascular stroke therapy to this point of time\n      is not known. The investigators therefore designed this study comparing intubated state with\n      general anaesthesia vs. non-intubated state with conscious sedation during EST, focusing on\n      patients\u00b4 outcome."
