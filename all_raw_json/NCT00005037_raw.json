Determine the freedom from progression median, and 1-year and 2-year survival\n      rates in these patients on this regimen.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified by prior chemotherapy (yes (closed to accrual 8/01) vs no).\n      Patients receive oral temozolomide daily for 42 days. Treatment repeats every 8 weeks for up\n      to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are\n      followed every 2 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Up to 66 patients (33 per stratum (previously treated stratum closed to\n      accrual 8/01)) will be accrued for this study within 2 years."
