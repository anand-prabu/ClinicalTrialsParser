Peripheral blood mononucleated cells will be cultured with irradiated K562-mb15-41BBL cells and low dose (10 IU/mL) IL-2 for 10 days. After T-cell depletion, expanded activated NK cells will be infused. Before infusion, patients will receive immunosuppressive therapy to promote temporary engraftment of NK cells. After infusion, they will receive IL-2 to support NK cell viability and expansion in vivo. The effects of NK cell infusion will be determine by comparing MRD levels before and after treatment."

            "textblock": "A novel method has been developed to expand natural (NK) cells and enhance their\n      cytotoxicity against cancer cells while maintaining low killing capacity against\n      non-transformed cells. In this method, donor NK cells are expanded by co-culture with the\n      irradiated K562 cell line modified to express membrane bound IL-15 and 41BB ligand\n      (K562-mb15-41BBL). Expression of these proteins in conjunction with unknown stimuli provided\n      by K562 cells promotes selective growth of NK cells. Then, the expanded NK cell population\n      is depleted of T cells to prevent graft versus host disease (GVHD). Expanded and activated\n      NK cells showed powerful anti-leukemic activity against acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells\n      in vitro and in animal models of leukemia.Unpublished laboratory results also demonstrated\n      that T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL) is extremely sensitive to the cytotoxicity\n      exerted by the expanded and activated NK cells.\n\n      The present study represents the translation of the laboratory findings into clinical\n      application. The study proposes to determine the feasibility, safety and efficacy of\n      infusing expanded NK cells into patients who have AML or T-lineage ALL which is resistant to\n      standard therapy as demonstrated by persistent minimal residual disease (MRD). Patients with\n      myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), who are at high risk to develop AML will also be eligible\n      for the study. In this patient cohort, the study will also investigate the in vivo lifespan\n      and phenotype of the expanded NK cells.\n\n      The main hypothesis to be tested in this study is that infusion of expanded activated NK\n      cells can produce measurable clinical responses in patients with AML or T-ALL."

On day\n      -10, eligible donors (adult family member of recipient) will undergo apheresis once. A\n      second apheresis procedure may be needed to obtain the required cell count from the donor.\n      NK cells will be expanded in co-culture with irradiated (100 Gy) K562-mb15-41BBL cells in\n      closed culture containers for 10 days. Prior to NK cell infusion on Day 0, recipients will\n      undergo screening evaluations and will receive cyclophosphamide, Fludarabine, IL-2, and\n      supportive medications (e.g. mesna). Cytokine regimen of IL-2 will be initiated on the\n      evening of day -1 (dose 1 of 6). IL-2 will be continued at a dose of 1 million units/m2\n      subcutaneously 3 times per week for 2 weeks (6 doses total). Post-infusion follow-up\n      procedures for up to 1 year from the day of NK cell infusion include physical examination,\n      Complete Blood Count, and metabolic/chemistry studies. The effects of NK cell infusion will\n      also be determined by comparing MRD levels before and after treatment. MRD blood and bone\n      marrow levels will be collected at baseline and at specified time points (until 1 year from\n      the day of NK cell infusion). NK cell donors will be recruited from the family members of\n      the patient recipient. Potential donors aged 21 years old will be consented and will undergo\n      the required screening tests and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing. Since 20 eligible\n      subjects will be enrolled as NK cell recipients, 20 donors will also be recruited for this\n      study. Ineligible NK cell donors will have to be replaced."
