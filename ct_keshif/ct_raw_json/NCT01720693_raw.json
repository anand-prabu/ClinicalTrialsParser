In many recent\n      studies, partial nephrectomy provides equivalent oncologic, and superior functional,\n      outcomes compared with the standard radical nephrectomy over the short and long term (2, 3).\n      Partial nephrectomy techniques, whether open, laparoscopic or robotic, typically involve\n      hilar clamping, which creates the desired bloodless operative field, allowing for more\n      precise tumor excision and renal reconstruction. This hilar clamping eventually may lead to\n      ischemic kidney injury which can compromise the functional outcomes of the remaining\n      kidney.We are working now to develop a novel technique of Hypo-Perfusion by achieving\n      partial renal arterial clamping, with the goal of completely eliminating surgical ischemia\n      to the renal remnant."
