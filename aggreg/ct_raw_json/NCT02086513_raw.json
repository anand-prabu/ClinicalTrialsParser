Participants will be followed on trial for 12 months after\n      starting therapy and the trial will be completed when all participants have reached 12\n      months of follow-up or have withdrawn from the trial.\n\n      The initial dose escalation phase of 4 cohorts of participants (each cohort 3-6\n      participants) will have a primary endpoint of safety and toxicity of administering LDE225 in\n      this setting."

Note that the dose of systemic steroids can certainly\n             be lower than 0.25 mg/kg/day at enrollment.\n\n          -  Stable dose of corticosteroids for 4 weeks prior to enrollment\n\n          -  No addition or subtraction of other immunosuppressive medications (e.g., calcineurin\n             inhibitors, sirolimus, mycophenolate mofetil) for 4 weeks prior to enrollment.

Medications that are strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors should be discontinued at\n             least 7 days and strong CYP3A/5 inducers for at least 2 weeks prior to starting\n             treatment with LDE225.  Note that patients who require antifungal prophylaxis are\n             preferred to be on fluconazole, and, patients taking voriconazole or posaconazole who\n             must continue are excluded from the dose escalation phase of the study.

Highly effective\n                  contraception is defined as either:\n\n               -  Total abstinence: When this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of\n                  the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,\n                  post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of\n                  contraception.\n\n               -  Sterilization: Patient has had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without\n                  hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking study\n                  treatment.

Patients\n                       are able to continue taking oral contraceptives if desired.\n\n                    -  Note: Woman are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing\n                       potential if they have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea\n                       with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate, history of\n                       vasomotor symptoms) or six months of spontaneous amenorrhea with serum FSH\n                       levels > 40 mIU/mL and estradiol < 20 pg/mL or have had surgical bilateral\n                       oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) at least six weeks ago. In the\n                       case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman\n                       has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she considered\n                       not of child bearing potential\n\n               -  Male patient must use highly effective (double barrier) methods of contraception\n                  (e.g., spermicidal gel plus condom) for the entire duration of the study, and\n                  continue using contraception and refrain from fathering a child for 6 months\n                  following the study drug. A condom is required to be used also by vasectomized\n                  men as well as during intercourse with a male partner in order to prevent\n                  delivery of the study treatment via seminal fluid\n\n               -  Sexually active males who are unwilling to use a condom during intercourse while\n                  taking the study drug and for 6 months after stopping investigational\n                  medications and agree not to father a child in this period.\n\n          -  Patients unwilling or unable to comply with the protocol."
