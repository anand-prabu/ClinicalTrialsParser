Combining trastuzumab\n      with celecoxib may kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining celecoxib and trastuzumab in\n      treating women who have metastatic breast cancer that has not responded to previous\n      trastuzumab."

Patients continue or restart trastuzumab (Herceptin) IV over 30-90\n      minutes weekly or every 3 weeks. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression\n      or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-37 patients will be accrued for this study within\n      approximately 9 months."
