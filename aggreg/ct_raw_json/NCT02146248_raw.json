            "textblock": "The investigators' research group is working to develop a highly effective, low cost\n      non-surgical method of permanent contraception for women. To support this goal, we need to\n      know more about the normal fallopian tube (tube that passes the egg from the ovary into the\n      womb).   The purpose of this study is to learn about how menstrual cycles and hormonal\n      contraceptives affect tubal patency. Normally there is an opening between the tube and\n      uterus to permit the flow of fluid and cells.  If this opening is blocked, this can result\n      in infertility. Tubal patency is when a woman's fallopian tubes are not blocked. Tubal\n      patency is determined by an x-ray test called a hystero-(uterus)salpingo-(fallopian\n      tube)graphy (HSG). HSG is a standard radiological imaging study that is used to determine if\n      the fallopian tubes are open and free of disease. It is commonly done in women with an\n      infertility diagnosis.  The investigators usually do this test in the first 10 days of the\n      menstrual cycle.   Sometimes the tubes will appear to be blocked on the HSG when they are\n      actually open.  The timing of the HSG study during the menstrual cycle, or the use of\n      hormonal contraception may make a difference in whether the tubes appear blocked on the HSG\n      when they are actually patent.\n\n      The results of the HSG test provide a good model for how our nonsurgical permanent\n      contraception method might work.  The investigators think that if the tubes are not patent,\n      that our treatment will not work as well.  Therefore, in this study we want to learn if\n      menstrual cycle timing or current hormonal contraception use will affect the patency of the\n      tubes as assessed by the HSG.  The investigators want to examine the same women to see if\n      tubal patency is changes during the menstrual cycle and during the use of a birth control\n      pill and the birth control shot."

NOTE: Discontinuation of\n             hormonal contraception or removal of implanted hormonal contraceptives must have been\n             for personal reasons unrelated to the purpose of enrollment in this study.\n\n        vi. Undiagnosed abnormal genital bleeding vii. Known hypersensitivity to radio-opaque\n        contrast, doxycycline, levonorgestrel, ethinyl estradiol or depo-medroxyprogesterone\n        acetate.

Current use of a non-hormone containing\n        (copper) intrauterine device (IUD). NOTE: Removal of an IUD must have been for personal\n        reasons unrelated to the purpose of enrollment in this study.\n\n        xv. Smoking if > age 35. xvi. Personal history of venous or arterial thrombosis or\n        embolism, or family history in a first-degree relative <55 years of age suggesting\n        familial defect in blood coagulation system, which in the opinion of the principal\n        investigator, suggests use of a hormonal contraceptive could pose a significant risk.\n\n        xvii. Cerebrovascular or cardiovascular disease. xviii. History of retinal vascular\n        lesions, unexplained partial or complete loss of vision.\n\n        xix. Headaches with focal neurological symptoms. xx. History of cholestatic jaundice of\n        pregnancy or jaundice with prior steroid use.\n\n        xxi. Use of liver enzyme inducers on a regular basis. xxii. History of involuntary\n        infertility, pelvic inflammatory disease (not followed by a normal pregnancy), or known\n        gynecologic conditions or surgery that could affect tubal patency (e.g. tubal adhesions,\n        endometriosis, hydrosalpinx, salpingectomy, hysterectomy, oophorectomy).\n\n        xxiii. History of a prior HSG showing tubal occlusion on one or both sides."
