  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia and is associated
      with reductions in quality of life, functional status, cardiac performance, and overall
      survival.1 Catheter ablation, which is centered on electrical isolation of triggering foci
      within the pulmonary veins (PVI) through circumferential lesions around PV ostia, has been
      shown to result in sustained improvements in quality of life, decreased hospitalizations
      and, potentially, improved survival.2-4 PVI can be accomplished by percutaneous
      catheter-based thermo-coagulation (burning) with radiofrequency (RF) energy delivery or
      alternatively by thermo-cooling (freezing) with a cryoballoon catheter.5 Cryothermal
      ablation with a cryoballoon catheter offers an efficacious means to achieve PVI that is
      safer than the established technique. Although cryoballoon ablation has been used in
      clinical practice for sometime, the optimal duration of cryoballoon ablation has not been
      determined. Moreover, the biophysics of cryo-lesion formation suggests that repeated short
      freezes (&quot;freeze-thaw-freeze&quot; cycles) may be more efficacious in achieving deep homogenous
      lesion when compared to prolonged freezing durations. This grant proposal is to verify if
      repeated short freezing cycles are more efficacious (i.e., fewer recurrence of AF), and
      safer, than the established standard of long, single freeze cycles.
