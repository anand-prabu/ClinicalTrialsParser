Multidetector row\n      computed tomography angiography (CTA) allows direct and rapid non-invasive visualization of\n      coronary artery disease.\n\n      The investigator's aim is to assess the diagnostic accuracy and safety of a novel diagnostic\n      strategy based on MDCT as compared to a strategy using stress echocardiography in the workup\n      of patient with chest pain, normal electrocardiogram, normal troponins and suspected\n      coronary artery disease. Additionally, the cost associated with both strategies will be\n      compared.\n\n      Methods. A total of 150 patients with acute chest pain coming to the emergency room with\n      intermediate probability of significant coronary artery disease, normal ECG and troponins\n      will be prospectively randomized to MDCT or stress echocardiography with exercise. Patients\n      showing coronary stenosis >50% at MDCT or abnormal stress echocardiography or inconclusive\n      results will be admitted for further study. The primary endpoint of the study is the\n      detection of an acute coronary syndrome, defined as typical or atypical angina with\n      documented significant coronary artery disease (>50% stenosis) on invasive coronariography,\n      a positive stress test or the occurrence of cardiac death, myocardial infarction or need for\n      revascularization during 6 month follow-up. All MDCT angiograms and echocardiograms will be\n      evaluated by an experienced radiologist and cardiologist."
