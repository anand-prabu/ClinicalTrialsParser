The\n      duration of participation in the study for an individual participant will be up to 5.5 weeks\n      (including Screening). Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the 2 treatment\n      sequence groups.  Participants assigned to the first treatment sequence will receive\n      tapentadol TRF 50 milligram (mg) tablet, and after a washout period, participants will\n      receive tapentadol PR2 50-mg tablet.
