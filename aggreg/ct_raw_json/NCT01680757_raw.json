This\n      study will enroll 100 participant, who will receive the LAA ligation study treatment.  The\n      objective of this registry is to assess the effectiveness of permanent exclusion of the LAA\n      using the LARIAT Suture Delivery Device and Accessories in patients unable to be treated\n      with standard anticoagulation therapy. The results of the study will be used to assess\n      outcomes within the first year, post\u2010treatment."
