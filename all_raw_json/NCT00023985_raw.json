Two\n      months after surgery (or 4 months if chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy are required),\n      patients undergo leukapheresis. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells are isolated and cultured\n      with interleukin-4 and sargramostim (GM-CSF) to generate dendritic cells (DC). DC are then\n      pulsed with tumor lysate prepared from previously removed tumor. Patients receive autologous\n      tumor lysate-pulsed DC vaccine subcutaneously twice, 4 weeks apart.\n\n      Patients are followed every 4 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 1 year, and then\n      annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years."
