  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) appear to be especially vulnerable to
      medications that suppress pharyngeal muscle activity such as general anesthetics and
      opioids. Opioids can depress the ventilator response to airway obstruction and inhibit the
      awakening response to hypoxia and hypercarbia, resulting in central respiratory depression.
      OSA is therefore an important risk factor for serious postoperative complications, including
      perioperative death. While OSA is increasingly recognized as a serious perioperative
      concern, current clinical practices are highly inconsistent with regard to the management of
      surgical patients with OSA. Additionally, the relative safety of intrathecal opioids in this
      patient population remains unknown.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Total hip arthroplasty (THA) is one of the most common orthopedic procedures performed
      worldwide1. It has been shown to reduce chronic pain, increase the ability to function
      independently, and improve quality of life. With an aging and increasingly obese North
      American population, the use of THA is increasing and is estimated to reach 600,000
      procedures annually by the year. One of the main challenges associated with THA continues to
      be the perioperative management of patients who are elderly or obese, and their associated
      co-morbidities. THA is commonly performed under neuraxial anesthesia. Neuraxial anesthesia
      has been reported to provide multiple benefits when compared to general anesthesia and/or
      systemic analgesia including superior post-operative analgesia, reduced opioid consumption6,
      improved rehabilitation, and reduced morbidity and mortality. The addition of opioids to the
      neuraxial local anesthetic solution has been common practice since 1979, when morphine was
      first shown to provide effective and prolonged analgesia after intrathecal administration.
      For THA surgery, intrathecal morphine provides effective analgesia allowing for a reduction
      of the dose of intrathecal local anesthetic (thus minimizing side effects), and has a marked
      postoperative opioid-sparing effect. However, these benefits of intrathecal morphine must be
      weighed against its risks of pruritis, nausea/vomiting, urinary retention, and, of most
      concern, respiratory depression18.
