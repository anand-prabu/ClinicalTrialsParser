Newborn screening and early treatment with restricted protein diet\n      supplemented by a formula of amino-acids will preserve intelligence. In those with the\n      severe form treated from birth, some deficits that affect higher functions of the brain are\n      seen. Given this, there is disagreement about how milder forms of this disease should be\n      managed and what level of Phe is safe to be left untreated.  We seek to assess whether\n      higher levels, between 360 and 600\u00b5mol/L, are safe with respect to preservation of\n      intelligence and higher cognitive functions."
