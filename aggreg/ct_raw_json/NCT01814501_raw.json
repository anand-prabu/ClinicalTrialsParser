Monoclonal antibodies, such as panitumumab, can block tumor\n      growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others\n      find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Drugs used in\n      chemotherapy, such as leucovorin calcium, fluorouracil, and irinotecan hydrochloride, work\n      in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by\n      stopping them from dividing. Giving panitumumab and combination chemotherapy together may\n      kill more tumor cells"

To determine the median overall survival and the overall\n      survival rate at 1 year.\n\n      OUTLINE:\n\n      Patients receive panitumumab intravenously (IV) over 60-90 minutes, leucovorin calcium IV\n      over 90 minutes, fluorouracil IV continuously over 46 hours, and irinotecan hydrochloride IV\n      over 90 minutes on days 1 and 15.
