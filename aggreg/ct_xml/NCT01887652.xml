  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose oh the study is to determine the usefulness of anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) to
      identify women at risk of excessive and poor response in controlled ovarian stimulation
      (COS) for in vitro fertilization (IVF), and the clinical impact of applying individualized
      COS strategies in these subsets of patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A group of 130 women undergoing conventional COS after pituitary down-regulation for IVF
      will be  studied to determine the best cut-off points of AMH, using receiver operating
      characteristic (ROC) analysis, to discriminate excessive (≥20 oocytes retrieved) and poor
      response (≤4 oocytes retrieved). The inclusion criteria is any patient with indication of
      IVF treatment. Subsequently, a different group of 120 women (with the same criteria) will be
      assessed using AMH before starting COS, and treatment strategy will be individualized
      according to AMH results (iCOS). Mild stimulation using daily doses (112.5 to 150 IU) of
      recombinant follicle stimulation hormone (rec-hFSH) or rec-hFSH combined with recombinant
      luteinizing hormone (LH) supplementation (375 IU total daily dose) will be given to patients
      identified as at risk of excessive and poor response, respectively. It will evaluated:
      number of oocytes, clinical pregnancy rates (defined as fetal heartbeat on ultrasound
      performed 4 weeks after the transfer of embryos) and occurrence of Ovarian hyperstimulation
      syndrome). Outcomes will be compared between the groups who received conventional and iCOS
      using chi-square and Fisher exact tests.
