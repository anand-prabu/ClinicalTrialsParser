Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the\n      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months until disease progression and then every 6 months\n      thereafter or for up to 2 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-140 patients will be accrued for this study."
