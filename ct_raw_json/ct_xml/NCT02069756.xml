  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      DuchenneConnect is an online, patient-report registry for individuals with Duchenne and
      Becker muscular dystrophy and carrier females. The purpose of DuchenneConnect is to connect
      Duchenne and Becker patients with actively recruiting clinical trials and research studies,
      and to educate patients and families about Duchenne and Becker care and research.  At the
      same time, DuchenneConnect is a valuable resource for clinicians and researchers in academia
      and industry, allowing access to a de-identified, aggregate dataset provided by patients and
      their familiesâ€”information that is vital to advances in the care and treatment of Duchenne.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      DuchenneConnect was created in 2007 by Parent Project Muscular Dystrophy (PPMD), with
      assistance from the NIH, the CDC, and Emory Genetics. In early 2011, PPMD alone began
      financing the registry's operation and maintenance, and is the sole guardian of
      DuchenneConnect and its material.

      Questions may be addressed to the DuchenneConnect Coordinator at telephone 201.937.1408 or
      coordinator@duchenneconnect.org.  The DuchenneConnect Coordinator is a certified genetic
      counselor who is available to answer questions regarding the registration process, genetic
      testing and counseling, and clinical trials and research studies.
