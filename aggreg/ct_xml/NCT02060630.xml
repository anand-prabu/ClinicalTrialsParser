  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare the effectiveness of best available surgical treatment with best
      available endovascular treatment in adults with critical limb ischemia (CLI) who are
      eligible for either treatment option.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Male and female subjects aged 35 years or older will be randomized to receive either open
      surgical treatment or endovascular treatment.  They will be followed for at least 2 years
      and up to 4 years after treatment to primarily assess survival and major adverse limb events
      in the index or treated limb, and secondarily, to determine clinical and cost effectiveness
      outcomes after treatment.  These outcomes (survival-free of major limb events and clinical,
      functional and cost effectiveness) will be compared within two cohorts of subjects: those
      with an available single-segment great saphenous vein, and those with an alternative
      conduit.  The null hypotheses for both cohorts is that there will be no difference between
      the best endovascular therapy and the best surgical therapy regarding MALE - free survival.

          -  Atherosclerotic, infrainguinal PAD (occlusive disease of the arteries below the
             inguinal ligament caused by atherosclerosis).

          -  Adequate aortoiliac inflow

          -  Adequate popliteal, tibial or pedal revascularization target defined as an
             infrainguinal arterial segment distal to the area of stenosis/occlusion which can
             support a distal anastomosis of a surgical bypass.

          -  Willing to comply with protocol, attend follow-up appointments, complete all study
             assessments, and provide written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Disease limited to the femoropopliteal segment with TASC II A pattern (single
             stenosis &lt;10 cm in length or single occlusion &lt;5 cm in length).

          -  Presence of a femoral, popliteal or tibial aneurysm in the index limb.

          -  Life expectancy of less than 2 years.

          -  Deemed excessive risk for surgical bypass (defined as excessive operative risk by
             pre-procedural cardiac risk assessment according to established AHA/ACCF criteria).

          -  Planned above ankle amputation on ipsilateral limb within 4 weeks of index procedure,
             regardless of whether revascularization is performed.

          -  Renal dysfunction (defined as MDRD eGFR â‰¤ 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 at the time of
             screening).

          -  Currently on dialysis.

          -  History of renal transplantation.

          -  Presence of a documented hypercoagulable state (defined as a known blood disorder

          -  Non-atherosclerotic occlusive disease (embolic disease, trauma, vasculitis, Buerger's
             disease) or acute limb-threatening ischemia (defined as tissue loss or ischemic rest
             pain of less than 14 days duration).

          -  Any prior infrainguinal stenting or stent grafting (with or without atherectomy
             and/or balloon angioplasty) of the ipsilateral superficial femoral artery and/or
             above knee popliteal artery.

          -  Any prior percutaneous or surgical intervention involving arteries below the knee
             joint.

          -  Any of the following procedures performed within 6 months prior to screening:

               -  Percutaneous balloon angioplasty or atherectomy of the superficial femoral
                  artery and/or above knee popliteal artery;

               -  Femoral to above knew bypass with either venous or prosthetic conduit;

               -  Open surgical inflow procedure (aortofemoral, axillofemoral, iliofemoral or

          -  Current immune-suppressive medication, chemotherapy or radiation therapy.

          -  Absolute contraindication to iodinated contrast due to prior near-fatal anaphylactoid
             reaction (laryngospasm, bronchospasm, cardiorespiratory collapse, or equivalent) and
             which would preclude patient participation in angiographic procedures.

          -  Known allergy to stainless steel or nitinol.

          -  Pregnancy or lactation.

          -  Administration of an investigational drug for peripheral arterial disease within 30
