            "textblock": "Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) affects millions of women during their reproductive years. The\n      disorder presents with emotional, cognitive, behavioural, and somatic symptoms during the\n      final premenstrual phase and subsiding a few days after menses begins. About 75% of women of\n      reproductive age experience a mild form of PMS (Campbell, Peterkin, O'Grady, &\n      Sanson-Fisher, 1997). The more severe form of PMS, premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD;\n      American Psychiatric Association (APA), 1994) is considered to affect up to 8% of women of\n      reproductive age. This severe form is associated with severe disruptions in normal\n      functioning in work, family, or social relationships (Halbreich, Borenstein, Pearlstein, &\n      Kahn, 2003). The defining characteristics of both\u2014PMS and PMDD\u2014 are the cyclic pattern of\n      symptoms, which must be confirmed by prospective daily self ratings of symptoms (PMS-Diary)\n      over two consecutive menstrual cycles (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists\n      (ACOG), 2000). PMS and PMDD differ according to the number, severity, duration, and quality\n      of symptoms.\n\n      As a first-line intervention, the ACOG suggests pharmacotherapy, in particular selective\n      serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs; ACOG, 2000). However, the side effects of SSRIs are\n      intolerable to many women, leading to high rates of withdrawal from treatment (Busse et al.,\n      2009; Dimmock, Wyatt, Jones, & O'Brien, 2000). Thus, cognitive behavioural treatments (CBT)\n      have been suggested as an additional treatment approach (Busse et al., 2009). First studies\n      showed promising results for CBT interventions for PMS (Busse et al., 2009; Hunter et al.,\n      2002). However, too few randomized controlled trials have carefully investigated the\n      efficacy of CBT for PMS.\n\n      The aim of the current study is thus to develop a CBT-oriented self-help treatment programme\n      for women suffering from PMS or PMDD. The treatment programme consists of psychoeducation\n      (e.g., information about PMS/PMDD and its aetiology), cognitive strategies (e.g., assessing\n      and restructuring dysfunctional cognitions), and suggestions for lifestyle changes (e.g.,\n      sports, balanced diet, relaxation). The programme is internet-delivered (iCBT) and\n      participants work on different chapters for eight weeks in a row. In addition to written\n      information, participants receive e-mail feedback from a psychologist on a weekly basis.\n      Participants are required to have sufficient knowledge of German in order to be able to read\n      the treatment materials. After a careful diagnostic assessment (including two months symptom\n      diary), eligible patients are randomly assigned either to the treatment group or a waitlist\n      control group. Participants assigned to the waitlist receive the treatment after the end of\n      the waiting period (eight weeks). Follow-up assessments take place six months after the end\n      of the treatment."
