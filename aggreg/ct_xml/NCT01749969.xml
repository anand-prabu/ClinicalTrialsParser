      Primary Objective:

      To determine the maximum tolerated dose of SAR650984 with lenalidomide and dexamethasone in
      patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.

      Secondary Objectives:

      To evaluate the safety, including immunogenicity, of SAR650984 in combination with
      lenalidomide in relapse or refractory multple myeloma.  The severity, frequency and
      incidence of all toxicities will be assessed.

      To evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of SAR650984 when administered in combination with
      lenalidomide and the PK of lenalidomide in combination with SAR650984 and dexamethasone.

      To assess the relationship between clinical (adverse event and/or tumor response) effects
      and pharmacologic parameters (PK/pharmacodynamics), and/or biologic (correlative laboratory)
      results.

      Estimate the activity (response rate) using International Myeloma Working Group defined
      response criteria of SAR650984 plus lenalidomide and low dose dexamethasone.

      To describe overall survival, progression free survival (PFS) and time to disease
      progression in patients treated with this combination.

      The study duration for an individual patient will include a screening period for inclusion
      of up to 21 days, and at least 4 weeks of treatment in the absence of severe adverse
      reaction, dose limiting toxicity or disease progression plus up to 60 days post-treatment
      follow up.
