            "textblock": "Justification and background Ventilator-associated complications (VACs) are those\n      complications that develop during a period of intubation of a patient . Pneumonia is the\n      second most frequent infectious complication in the hospital, and ranks first in ICU, whose\n      risk is increased more than 20 times by the presence of invasive mechanical ventilation and\n      is called ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) . Whereas the information published\n      regarding VAP in terms of diagnosis, treatment and impact on the outcome of critically ill\n      patients is enormous.Ventilator-associated tracheobronchitis (VAT) incidence is lacking and\n      complicated in part, since the definition remains controversial. In addition, the\n      significance of tracheobronchial colonization as a risk factor for subsequent lower\n      respiratory tract infection remains unclear . The upper and lower airways can become\n      colonized . Several factors have been taken into account and do not differ from those\n      involved in VAT and VAP development in patients under mechanical ventilation.\n\n      Definition VAT diagnosis is controversial and represents an actual problem in order to\n      define the real incidence of VAT ,  There is currently no valid, reliable definition for\n      VAT, and even the most widely-used VAT criteria and definitions are neither sensitive nor\n      specific. The diagnosis of VAT is considered when a patient under invasive mechanical\n      ventilation starts with fever, leukocytosis and new or increased purulent secretions by the\n      endotracheal tube. A particular difficulty with much commonly used VAT definition (in order\n      to distinguish from VAP) is the key point of the absence of pulmonary consolidation.\n      Evidence suggests that chest radiograph findings do not accurately role out VAP. A taskforce\n      on hospital-acquired pneumonia, and VAP has been recently published (European Respiratory\n      Society (ERS), European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID)\n      and European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM)). Nosocomial tracheobronchitis\n      definition includes occurrence of purulent tracheal secretion after \u226548 h of hospitalisation\n      or mechanical ventilation plus \u22652 of the following: fever (\u226538.5\u00b0C) or hypothermia (<36\u00b0C),\n      leukocytosis (\u226512 \u00d7 109/L), significant bacteriologic counts in respiratory secretions (\u2265103\n      cfu/mL for protected brush specimen (PBS) and \u2265105 cfu/mL for endotracheal aspirates);\n      absence of new pulmonary infiltrates compatible with pneumonia and absence of other causes\n      of fever are mandatory. This definition needs to be further validated and can overdiagnose\n      the incidence of VAT (and overuse of antibiotics) because the positive culture of\n      respiratory secretions is not a mandatory item RATIONALE Given the possible high incidence\n      of VAT, and its importance as a risk factor for VAP, and a potential target to treat in\n      order to reduce VAP incidence, a large multicentre"
