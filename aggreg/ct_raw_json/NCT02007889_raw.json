Oxidative stress in renal cells may be a critical\n      factor in the pathogenesis of pyelonephritis whereas pharmacological management of the\n      oxidative stress response may provide a therapeutic effect in preventing renal pathologies.\n      Animal model show that L-carnitine alleviated oxidative stress, and acute renal inflammatory\n      injury can be prevented much more effectively by carnitine in addition to conventional\n      antibiotic treatment in pyelonephritis.This study is a simple randomized clinical trial\n      (RCT) evaluating the effect of L-carnitine in addition to antibiotic on preventing renal\n      scaring after acute pyelonephritis in children. Simple non- blind randomized clinical trial\n      on 78 patients in 2 groups (intervention & control) is conducted.Children  aged 1 month to\n      10 years with positive urine culture, clinical findings, and 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid\n      (DMSA) scintigraphy-based evidence in favor of acute pyelonephritis were enrolled into a\n      clinical trial. Patients were excluded if they had neurogenic bladder, systemic\n      hypertension, obstructive uropathy. Patients in Intervention group are  administered  50\n      mg/kg/day  carnitine in divided 2-3 times/day (maximum 3 g/day) in addition to antibiotic\n      regimens  and patients in control group received antibiotic regimens. Primary outcome is\n      the development of renal scar by doing DMSA renal scan on the 7th day of admission and six\n      months after the intervention and compared between groups  and secondary outcome is the\n      incidence and severity of pyelonephritis and response to treatment."
