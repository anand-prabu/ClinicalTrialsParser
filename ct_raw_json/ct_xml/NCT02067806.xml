    <textblock>
      The present study aims to evaluate the relationship between spinal block with 1% solution of
      2-chloroprocaine hydrochloride and the onset of all possible neurological adverse events,
      with particular attention to Transient Neurological Symptoms (TNS) and Cauda Equina Syndrome
      (CES).

      Primary endpoint :Incidence of neurological complications (Transient and Permanent
      complications; e.g. transient neurological symptoms, arachnoiditis, cauda equina
      syndrome).Two follow-up questionnaires are foreseen, at 24 h and 7 days after time of spinal
      injection (Tsp), to gather all possible neurological complications, with particular
      attention to Transient Neurological Symptoms (TNS) and Cauda Equina Syndrome (CES).Patients
      scheduled for elective surgery will be informed about the aims, procedures and possible
      risks of the study and will be asked to sign the informed consent form for the inclusion in
      the trial, from day -14 to day of surgery (visit 1, Day 0).This observational study is
      planned to collect data on patients undergoing surgery under intrathecal anesthesia with
      chloroprocaine hydrochloride, primarily to assess the occurrence of all possible
      neurological adverse events (with particular attention to TNS and CES). The mandatory
      follow-ups of the study are at 24 h and 7 days (-1/+2) after anaesthesia. In case of signs
      of neurological complications, the patient has to undergo to a medical visit at the hospital
      by the relevant specialists (anaesthetist, surgeon, neurologist). In order to characterise
      the occurred adverse event, a complete analysis evaluation has to be conducted, as CT, MRI,
      Electromyography, etc. following the indication of the specialists. In case of persistent
      neuropathy the patient needs to be accurately followed according to the internal hospital
      procedure. In the meantime, a full screening of the patient's clinical history together with
      a detailed analysis of the relevant variables, potentially related to the adverse event,
      have to be carried out.

      Therefore, the physician will take all appropriate measures to ensure the safety of the
      patients, notably he/she should follow up the outcome of any Adverse Events (clinical signs,
      laboratory values or other, etc.) until the return to normal or consolidation of the
      patient's condition. In case of any Serious Adverse Event, the patient has to be followed up
      until clinical recovery is complete and laboratory results have returned to normal, or until
      progression has been stabilized. The follow-up will continue after the patient has left the
      study.

    <description>The present study aims to evaluated in 380 patients the relationship between spinal block with 1% solution of 2-chloroprocaine hydrochloride and the onset of all possible neurological adverse events, with particular attention to Transient Neurological Symptoms (TNS) and Cauda Equina Syndrome(CES).
Two follow-up questionnaires are foreseen, at 24 h and 7 days after time of spinal injection (Tsp),to gather all possible neurological complications,with particular attention to TNS and CES.About 24 h after surgery (indicated as Tsp),Investigator or a deputy will question patients about neurological symptoms, in particular TNS/CES, and pain not associated to the operation area on the basis of the two follow-up questionnaires and giving a score between 0 to 10 to the pain intensity.All other AEs will also be assessed.</description>

             (para-aminobenzoic acid) ester group, other ester-type local anaesthetics or to any
             of the excipients (Hydrochloric acid 1N for pH adjustment, Sodium chloride, Water for
             injection)

          -  General and specific contra-indications to spinal anaesthesia regardless of the local
             anaesthetic used, should be taken into account (e.g. decompensated cardiac
             insufficiency, hypovolemic shock….)

          -  Intravenous regional anaesthesia (the anesthetic agent is introduced into the limb
             and allowed to set in while tourniquets retain the agent within the desired area)
