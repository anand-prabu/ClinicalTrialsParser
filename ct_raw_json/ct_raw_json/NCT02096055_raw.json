You will have an equal chance of being\n      assigned to each of the groups.  Neither you nor the study staff can choose to which group\n      you are assigned:\n\n        -  If you are in Group A, you will receive SGI-110 alone for 5 days.\n\n        -  If you are in Group B, you will receive SGI-110 alone for 10 days.\n\n        -  If you are in Group C, you will receive SGI-110 for 5 days and idarubicin for 2 days.\n\n        -  If you are in Group D, you will receive SGI-110 for 5 days and cladribine for 5 days.\n\n      SGI-110 will be given 1 time each day through a needle under the skin.  Idarubicin or\n      cladribine will be given 1 time each day by vein over up to an hour.\n\n      If you respond to the study drug(s) you can continue on the same schedule every 4 to 8\n      weeks, depending on how you react to the study drug(s).  These 4-8 week periods will be\n      called study cycles.  The first few (up to 3) cycles will be called Induction Cycles.  All\n      cycles after this will be called Maintenance Cycles.  The doses of the drugs, or number of\n      times you receive them, may be reduced in the Maintenance Cycles.\n\n      Study Visits:\n\n      On Day 1 of every cycle, you will have a physical exam.\n\n      Every week, blood (about 1-2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests until any point that\n      the disease appears to have gone away.  After that, this blood draw will be every 2-8 weeks.\n       The study staff will let you know when you will need these blood draws.\n\n      On Day 15 (+/- 2 days) of Cycle 1, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn to check the\n      status of the disease.\n\n      On Day 28 (+/-7 days) of Cycle 1, you will have a bone marrow aspirate to check the status\n      of the disease.  After that, you will have a bone marrow aspirate every 2 weeks (+/- 7 days)\n      until any point that the disease appears to not be responding.  If the routine blood tests\n      show that there is still leukemia, you may not need to have the bone marrow samples\n      collected.  If the disease has not appeared to have gone away after Cycle 2, the timing of\n      your next bone marrow aspirate will depend on the results of your blood tests.\n\n      Every 3-4 cycles (or whenever the doctor thinks it is needed), you will have either an ECHO\n      or a MUGA to check your heart function.\n\n      You will need to stay in Houston when you are receiving the study drug(s).  When you have\n      study visits in which you are not receiving study drug(s), these tests can be performed by\n      your local doctor.\n\n      Length of Study:\n\n      You will receive the study drug(s) for up to 24 months.  You will be taken off study if the\n      doctor thinks it is in your best interest, if the disease gets worse, if you experience any\n      intolerable side effects, or if you are unable to follow study directions.\n\n      Your participation in this study will be over after the follow-up visits.\n\n      Follow-up Visits:\n\n      After your last dose of study drug, you will have follow-up visits.  You will only have\n      these visits if the disease has responded to the study drug(s).\n\n        -  Every month, blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests.  These tests\n           can be performed by your local doctor.\n\n        -  Every 6 months, you will return to Houston for a physical exam and blood (about 1\n           tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests.\n\n      This is an investigational study.  Cladribine and idarubicin are FDA approved and\n      commercially available for the treatment of several types of cancers affecting the blood,\n      including different types of leukemia.  SGI-110 is not FDA approved or commercially\n      available.  It is currently being used for research purposes only.\n\n      Up to 120 patients will take part in this study.  All will be enrolled at M.D. Anderson."
