In the first part of\n      the study, 14 subjects will be recruited for the Clinically Stable Cohort.  Subjects will be\n      asked to provide 1 gm of expectorated sputum and 40-ml of blood.  A cell count and\n      differential will be performed on the sputum followed by analysis for IL-17 PMNs by\n      fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS).  IL-17 PMNs also will be isolated by running the\n      remainder of the cell pellet through a column of magnetic beads designed for this purpose.\n      These neutrophils will be lysed and intracellular cytokines determined.  Sputum supernatants\n      will be stored frozen until analyzed for the presence of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-17A, TGF-\u03b2,\n      TNF-\u03b1, and neutrophil elastase.  Clinical data will be captured from the subject's clinical\n      outpatient visit including lung function measures and clinical culture results.  IL-17 PMNs\n      will be correlated with lung function measures and inflammatory mediators at baseline.\n\n      In the second part of this study, 10 subjects will be recruited for the Exacerbation Cohort.\n       Subjects will provide at least 1 gram of expectorated sputum and 40-ml of blood within 72\n      hours of hospital admission.  Sputum and blood will be processed and analyzed as described\n      above.  Sputum and blood also will be obtained at the end of treatment (within 72 hours of\n      completion of IV antibiotics) when the subject is at his or her baseline as determined by\n      the managing physician.  Clinical data will be captured from the subject's hospitalization\n      records including lung function measures and clinical culture results."
