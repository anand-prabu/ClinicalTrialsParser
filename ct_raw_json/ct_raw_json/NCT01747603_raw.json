Until recently, the incorrect assumption has been\n      that these infants are healthy and have limited risks compared to term infants.\n\n      The study's main question, in addition to assessing the feasibility of this pilot, is: \"Do\n      differences exist in short-tem clinical and developmental outcomes among LPTB infants\n      enrolled in an RCT who are randomized to a specialized LPTB follow-up programme when\n      compared to infants randomized to current pragmatic management?\"  A RCT will provide\n      evidence for the development of guidelines for the follow-up of LPTB infants in the first 6\n      months of life to reduce complications, readmissions and developmental problems.\n\n      The results of this study can be generalized to tertiary care and community hospitals and\n      the general population."

Development of a sustainable long-term follow-up programme supported by evidence,\n\n        3. Development of a database to track long-term complications, with the goal of\n           identifying potential risk factors earlier in late preterm infants,\n\n        4.
