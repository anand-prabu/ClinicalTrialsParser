Any combination with investigational or non\n             investigational agent is prohibited\n\n          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1\n\n          -  Docetaxel-related adverse effects must have been resolved to NCI-CTCAE v4.03 (Common\n             Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Effects) Grade \u22641. Chemotherapy-induced alopecia and\n             Grade 2 peripheral neuropathy are allowed\n\n          -  No progressive disease at the end of docetaxel treatment defined according to RECIST\n             criteria, no new lesion(s) assessed by bone scan and no elevated prostate specific\n             antigen (PSA) for the three last tests with PSA3\u2264PSA2\u2264PSA1. The time between each PSA\n             test should be preferably at least 14 days, however, a minimum of 7 days is\n             acceptable.\n\n        Note: PSA value can be rounded to the nearest whole number if PSA>10 ng/mL. If the PSA3\n        value is above the PSA2, a fourth PSA test will be performed. The PSA4 value should be\n        below or equal to PSA2\n\n          -  Last dose of docetaxel administered between 21 and 42 days before randomisation\n\n          -  Chemical or surgical castration verified by levels of serum testosterone \u226450 ng/dL\n             (1.75 nmol/L)\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  Has concurrent use of other anticancer agents or treatments, with the following\n             exceptions: ongoing treatment with luteinising hormone-releasing hormone agonists or\n             antagonists, denosumab or bisphosphonate (e.g., zoledronic acid) is permitted if\n             started \u22654 weeks prior to Screening.

Patients with previous medullary cord\n             compression without any neurological deficit could be included\n\n          -  Has a history of other malignancies, except adequately treated non-melanoma skin\n             cancer or other solid tumours curatively treated, without evidence of disease for >5\n             years"
