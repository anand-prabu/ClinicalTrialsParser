Standard treatment for asthma attack includes oxygen therapy,\n      \u03b22-agonists (e.g. albuterol) and inhaled anticholinergics and corticosteroids. Although\n      inhaled short-acting \u03b22-agonists (SAB) is the initial choice to control acute asthma\n      exacerbation, there are still some asthmatic children unresponsive to this management. The\n      Global Initiative in National Asthma (GINA) does not recommend intravenous magnesium sulfate\n      (MgSO4) for routine use in asthma exacerbation especially in young children. But intravenous\n      MgSO4 can reduce hospital admission rates in certain patients due to several effects e.g\n      relaxation of smooth muscle,blocking acetylcholine. In addition,adding MgSO4 to nebulized\n      SAB provides greater benefit in severe asthma exacerbation."
