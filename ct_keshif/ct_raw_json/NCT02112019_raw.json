            "textblock": "Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome (SS) is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder of the exocrine glands. It\n      particularly affects the lacrimal and salivary glands. Severe dry mouth and eyes are\n      frequently reported as presenting symptoms. These symptoms are in many cases accompanied by\n      nonspecific symptoms, such as malaise and fatigue. In addition, extraglandular\n      manifestations, like purpura, polyneuropathy, and arthritis, can be present. SS affects\n      mainly women with a female/male ratio of 9:1 and can occur at all ages. Due to the\n      irreversible damage to the saliva producing cells, the quantity and quality of saliva\n      reduces. The progressive nature of the syndrome results in a further reduction of salivary\n      flow. Due to hyposalivation the patients suffer from progressive dental decay, dental\n      erosion, severe dry mouth complaints (i.e. eating and swallowing problems, lack of taste),\n      inflammation of the oral mucosa and lack of retention of removable dentures. Overall, this\n      can be qualified as a reduction in the quality of life. Until now no effective (palliative)\n      therapy to relieve dry mouth complaints is available. A recent case series study suggests\n      that an endoscopic technique (sialoendoscopy) is able to alleviate the symptoms of patients\n      suffering from SS. In this technique the ducts of the salivary glands are rinsed with saline\n      and cortisone and possible strictures are dilated. It is hypothesised that performing a\n      sialoendoscopic treatment will raise or restore (un)stimulated salivary flow levels and\n      improve the reported mouthfeel score."
