  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We will study the efficacy of FDA approved intravenous (IV) acetaminophen (&quot;Ofirmev&quot;, Â© 2011
      Cadence Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) in reducing opioid consumption after minimally invasive
      thoracic surgery in a double blind randomized trial.  This drug has been shown in Europe to
      reduce the need for patient controlled analgesia and the total dose of opioids, which have
      serious side effects in thoracic surgery patients.  We will compare the use of IV
      patient-controlled morphine (PCA) in two groups of subjects in treating postoperative pain.
      One group of subjects will receive IV acetaminophen every six hours beginning within 30
      minutes before surgical end time and continuing for 24 hours plus IV morphine PCA, and the
      other group will receive IV placebo every six hours plus IV morphine PCA, a standard
      treatment for postoperative pain. We will determine if IV acetaminophen reduces
      post-operative morphine requirements (primary end point). We will also assess subject pain
      scores and post-operative complications associated with pain management as secondary end
      points.  Our hypothesis is that the study arm receiving intravenous acetaminophen will have
      lower total morphine consumptions compared to the placebo group.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Elective VATS patients for wedge resection with low probability of conversion to
             thoracotomy as determined by surgery.

          -  Ages 18-99

          -  American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status I-III, hemodynamically stable

          -  Male or female

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Age less than 18.

          -  Patient refusal

          -  high probability of conversion to thoracotomy as determined by surgeon

          -  conversion of procedure to thoracotomy (subjects will be withdrawn if VATS procedure
             is converted to thoracotomy, as thoracotomy is more invasive and will likely require
             additional analgesia such as neuraxial and regional anesthesia.

          -  emergency case

          -  patients on preoperative analgesic therapy within one week of surgery

          -  contraindication to self administered morphine (unable to understand PCA)

          -  need for postoperative mechanical ventilation

          -  necessary major deviation for intraoperative study protocol as per the discretion of
             the intraoperative attending anesthesiologist
