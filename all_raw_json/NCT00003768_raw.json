            "textblock": "OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of combretastatin A4 phosphate when\n      administered at single doses every 21 days in patients with advanced solid tumors. II.\n      Determine both the toxicity and dose limiting toxicity of this regimen in these patients.\n      III. Determine the plasma and urine pharmacokinetics of combretastatin A4 and combretastatin\n      A4 phosphate. IV. Gather preliminary data regarding possible antitumor effects in those\n      patients with measurable disease.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is an open label, dose escalation study. Patients receive combretastatin A4\n      phosphate IV over 10-60 minutes. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks in the absence of\n      unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating\n      doses of combretastatin A4 phosphate until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined.\n      The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience\n      dose limiting toxicity. Patients are followed at 3 weeks.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 21 patients will be accrued for this study."
