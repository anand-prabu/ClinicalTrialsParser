The study will be a randomized, double-blinded controlled safety study.

This will lead to rapid\n      production and delivery of an autologous therapy that should minimize additional morbidity\n      to the patient."

The care is specific to\n      excision and split thickness skin grafting in the context of this burn study. The study will\n      enroll 42 patients receiving surgical management of acute 2nd and 3rd degree burns requiring\n      excision and skin grafting. The patient's total body surface area burn injury should not\n      exceed 20%. The study will be conducted for 12 months. This study will provide further\n      information for the development of enhanced treatment of wound-deployable cellular therapy\n      for advanced trauma care of burned warriors."
