Each treatment\n      cycle is 4 weeks. Responses are evaluated after each cycle (for a minimum of 2 induction\n      cycles). Patients with a grade 0 toxicity in the first course receive a 25% increase in dose\n      during the second course. Patients with grade 1 or 2 toxicity receive no dose change.\n      Patients with grade 3 toxicity receive a 25% reduction in dose or treatment is stopped. All\n      patients demonstrating response are eligible for maintenance therapy. Treatment is continued\n      for up to 12 months or a total of 13 cycles.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-30 patients will be accrued."
