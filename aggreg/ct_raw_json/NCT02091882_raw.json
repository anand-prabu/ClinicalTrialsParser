Following placement of the\n      Patch by clinic staff, subjects will ingest one tablet approximately every 2 hours, for a\n      total of 4 ingestions. Aripiprazole-embedded IEM tablets are being tested along with the\n      placebo-embedded IEM tablets to assess any difference in accuracy of IEM detection and\n      latency. Approximately 32 healthy volunteer subjects will be enrolled in the substudy. The\n      duration of this substudy for each subject is estimated to be 1 day of active participation\n      plus a 2-week safety follow up (phone call) period."
