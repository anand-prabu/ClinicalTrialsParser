      The main objective of this study is to determine the preliminary efficacy of
      Paranoia-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (PFCBT) relative to standard care in the
      treatment of persecutory delusions in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia or
      schizoaffective Disorder.

    <textblock>
      Paranoia-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (PFCBT) is a manualized intervention that
      combines group and individual modalities to reduce paranoia-biased information-processing
      and social avoidance, and to increase insight and reality testing capacity.

      This is a randomized controlled clinical trial. Twenty four adults ages 18-65 with the
      primary DSM-IV Schizophrenia and Schizoaffective disorder and drug-refractory persecutory
      delusions will be recruited from outpatient clinics in New York City Metropolitan area.
      Participants will be randomly assigned to either experimental or control group. The
      experimental group will receive PFCBT in addition to standard care and the control group
      will receive standard care alone. PFCBT will include participation in one group session and
      one individual therapy session weekly over the 15 weeks. The preliminary efficacy of the
      intervention will be  evaluated using standardized measures by blind evaluators conducted at
      baseline, post-treatment, and at 6-months post-termination follow-up.
