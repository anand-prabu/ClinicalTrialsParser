            "textblock": "People with a schizophrenia spectrum diagnosis often experience distressing worries or\n      beliefs about other people intending to cause them harm (also known as paranoia). Paranoid\n      beliefs are associated with significant distress and disruption to the person's life. This\n      results in high use of services and costs to mental health providers.\n\n      The National Institute of Clinical Excellence recommends that cognitive behavioural therapy\n      for psychosis (CBTp) is offered to everybody with a schizophrenia spectrum psychosis. The\n      latest meta analyses report improved outcomes, and reduced inpatient stays following CBTp,\n      making it a cost effective intervention.\n\n      Although improved outcomes have been obtained by therapies, CBTp has only small to moderate\n      effects on paranoid beliefs. Further, training therapists to competently deliver CBTp is\n      intensive, expensive and takes up to a year. CBTp is therefore not widely available to\n      service users, resulting in inequalities in access to care.\n\n      The investigators are seeking to improve outcomes and accessibility of CBTp for people with\n      distressing, paranoid beliefs. The proposed research programme aims to conduct a feasibility\n      study of two brief therapeutic interventions, aimed at targeting and improving two key\n      processes which are causally implicated in paranoia: a) reasoning styles and b) anxiety\n      processes.\n\n      The investigators have preliminary evidence indicating that these pilot interventions, with\n      interactive multimedia content, reduced distressing beliefs and improved coping.\n      Participants also reported they found the interventions acceptable, enjoyable and useful to\n      participants. Based on these results, the investigators have further modified the\n      interventions, and want to determine their feasibility and efficacy in a larger sample with\n      a control group."
