Screening assessments will be performed between 42 to 2 days before\n      study drug administration. Observation Phase assessments will be performed a day before or\n      on a day of the initial administration to confirm the eligibility of subjects. The eligible\n      subjects will receive the repeated intravenous administration of E6011.  E6011 will be\n      dissolved in physiological saline (nearly 100 mL) for approximately 30-minute infusion. A\n      total of 7 intravenous infusions will be implemented from Weeks 0, 1, 2 and every 2 weeks up\n      to Week 10 in the Treatment Phase. Under no safety concerns, a decline from the Observation\n      Phase in Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) is greater than or equal to 70 and a subject\n      intends to continue administrations, the subject will receive a total of 20 subsequent\n      biweekly administrations (40 weeks) at stable dose (Extension Phase).  Subjects will be\n      hospitalized for 24 hours after the initial and second administrations for postdose\n      monitoring and will have out-patient monitoring until 12 weeks after the initial\n      administration. Subjects who roll over onto the Extension Phase will have continued\n      monitoring until 52 weeks after the initial administration. When the subjects complete (Week\n      12 or Week 52) or discontinue the study, they will undergo an on-site follow-up 28 days\n      after the study completion or discontinuation and an off-site follow-up or telephone\n      interview 70 days after the final administration.   The investigator will conduct full\n      assessments of subjects' safety next day of the second administration (24 hours after the\n      second administration) to confirm presence of absence of study-related manifestations which\n      may affect the study drug administration of next cohort. When the sponsor is informed of\n      investigator's judgment on the sixth subject in each cohort, the appropriateness of next\n      cohort will be judged based on the safety data available including the judgment of\n      individual investigator on the next day of the second administration."
