            "textblock": "Various medical therapies have been proposed to prevent abdominal aortic aneurysm expansion.\n      However, there have been very few randomized clinical trials to support use of any of these\n      treatments. Several animal studies and observational reports suggest that ARBs can be useful\n      in reducing abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) growth. However, so far, ARBs have not been\n      evaluated in a randomized clinical trial. Therefore, the purpose of the study is to evaluate\n      the effect of valsartan, an ARB, on annual growth rate in comparison with atenolol, a\n      beta-blocker.  Our hypothesis is that valsartan is superior to atenolol in the suppression\n      of the aneurysm growth at 12 months.  The BASE trial is designed as a\n      investigator-initiated, multi-center, randomized controlled open-label trial. Patients with\n      small AAA (aorta diameter <5cm) will be randomized 1:1 either to valsartan or to atenolol\n      group. Randomization will be stratified by the AAA size (max. diameter >4 cm or \u22644 cm).\n      Patients will receive either valsartan (daily dose 80 mg or more) or atenolol (daily dose 50\n      mg or more) for 12 months. A CT scan will measure the maximal diameter of AAA at baseline\n      and 12 months. The annual growth of AAA will be compared between the valsartan and the\n      atenolol group."
