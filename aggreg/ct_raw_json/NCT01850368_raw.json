            "textblock": "Recently, several studies reported promising outcomes of patients after external beam\n      radiotherapy (EBRT) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with portal vein tumor thrombosis.\n      However, conventional EBRT is composed of many fractions (20-35 fractions). On the other\n      hand, stereotactic ablative radiotherapy is a newly emerging treatment method to deliver a\n      high dose of radiation to the target using a few fractions with a high precision within\n      body. SABR increases radiation biologic effect for tumor, makes patients more comfortable\n      due to reduction of the number of hospital visit, and enables patients to receive another\n      treatment more quickly. This study will evaluate SABR effect with 40 Gy in 4 fractions for\n      HCC with major portal vein tumor thrombosis."
