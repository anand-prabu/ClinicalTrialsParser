  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent evidence demonstrates that perioperative pain continues to be poorly managed among
      ambulatory surgical patients. More importantly, few interventions that minimize
      postoperative pain have also shown to improve patient overall quality of post-surgical
      recovery. Ketorolac has been used to minimize perioperative pain despite the lack of
      evidence for its use when administered  as a single dose preventive strategy.Ketorolac has
      also been associated with a higher incidence of perioperative hematomas and the need for
      surgical re-exploration after breast surgery.

      Systemic acetaminophen has become recently available in The United States. In contrast to
      ketorolac, systemic acetaminophen has not been reported to have adverse side effects on
      patients undergoing breast surgery. Although evidence suggests that a single dose
      perioperative acetaminophen reduces postoperative pain, it remains unknown if a single dose
      intravenous acetaminophen improves postoperative quality of recovery after ambulatory
      surgery.

      The main objective of the current investigation is to evaluate the effect of a single dose
      systemic acetaminophen on postoperative quality of recovery after ambulatory breast surgery.
      We also seek to determine if systemic acetaminophen would decrease postoperative pain and
      the time to hospital discharge in the same population.

      Significance: The current project evaluates a potential intervention to improve
      perioperative pain and recovery after ambulatory breast surgery. Postoperative pain in the
      ambulatory surgical patients has been shown consistently to be poorly managed.
