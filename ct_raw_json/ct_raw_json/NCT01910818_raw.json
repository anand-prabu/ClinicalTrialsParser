            "textblock": "Radiotherapy, an essential modality in cancer treatment, frequently induces a fibrotic\n      process in the skin which can lead to increased risk of malignancy, poor wound healing, pain\n      and limitation of movement, and permanent loss of skin appendages with\n      hyper/hypopigmentation, decreased sweating and xerosis, posing significant cosmetic and\n      quality of life issues.  Advances in laser therapy has led to the use of fractional laser\n      treatment (FLT) to treat fibrosis associated with in hypertrophic scars and morphea, leading\n      to tissue repair, scar remodeling. The investigators propose a pilot clinical study to test\n      the hypothesis that FLT can normalize the fibrotic process and induce normal scar remodeling\n      in patients affected by chronic radiation injury.   Understanding and correcting this\n      underlying fibrotic process can help restore normal skin functions in patients affected with\n      chronic radiation dermatitis (RD) and other debilitating fibrotic diseases in dermatology\n      such as scleroderma, morphea, or nephrogenic systemic fibrosis."

The scars must be deemed stable for a period of 3 months or\n             have a suitable contralateral control before initiation of treatment.

Able to understand and provide written informed consent;\n\n          6. Pregnant woman can be included because study involves local intervention, no new\n             drugs.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          1. Active tanning, including the use of tanning booths, during the course of the study;\n\n          2.

Adverse reactions to compounds of any external agent (e.g., gels, lotions or\n             anesthetic creams) required for use in the study, if no alternative to the said agent\n             exists;\n\n          4. History of collagen vascular disease;\n\n          5. Active Herpes Simplex or Zoster at the time of treatment or having experienced more\n             than three episodes of Herpes Simplex / Zoster eruption within a year of study\n             enrollment;\n\n          6. History of immunosuppression/immune deficiency disorders (including human\n             immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)\n             or use of immunosuppressive medications;\n\n          7. Having any form of active cancer at the time of enrollment and during the course of\n             the study;\n\n          8.

Any condition which, in the Investigator's opinion, would make it unsafe (for the\n             subject or study personnel) to treat the subject as part of this research study;\n\n         10. If it is determined that the contracture is due to a deeper process involving the\n             muscles, ligaments or bones.\n\n         11. Patient on chemotherapy (but not tamoxifen or other things that affect wound healing)\n             and also active XRT\n\n         12.
