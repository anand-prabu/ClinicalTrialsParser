However morbidity and mortality after lung transplantation are still significant.\n\n      Primary graft dysfunction (PGD) is the main cause of early death. PGD is similar to acute\n      lung injury (ALI)/ acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): oxygenation is compromised,\n      pulmonary compliance is decreased, chest Rx shows several infiltrates, and alveolar damage\n      is present.\n\n      25% of patients develops PGD within 72 hours from transplantation and 30 days mortality is\n      eight times higher in patients who develop PGD.\n\n      72 hours after lung transplantation, patients, whose clinical condition allow to bring them\n      to nuclear medicine department, will undergo pulmonary computed tomography (CT) to study\n      lung morphology and measure lung recruitability and positron emission tomography (PET) to\n      study lung functionality and estimate lung inflammation.\n\n      Aim of this study is to investigate the onset of PGD and other complications and to\n      determine 72 hours and 90 days mortality after lung transplantation."
