The secondary aim is to assess the efficacy potential of SPEEDI to impact motor\n      and cognitive development as assessed using commonly used clinical outcome measures. The\n      exploratory aims are to assess the impact of SPEEDI on parent child interactions and feeding\n      skills. The findings will provide crucial initial efficacy estimates to be used in a larger\n      definitive clinical trial of SPEEDI."
