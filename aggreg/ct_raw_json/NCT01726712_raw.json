The intervention has been developed with input from clients and\n      their support network members, case managers, social workers, HIV primary care providers and\n      pastoral care at a Federally Qualified Health Center. The goal of the intervention is to\n      improve retention in care for newly diagnosed YBMSM who present for their first HIV primary\n      care clinic appointment."
