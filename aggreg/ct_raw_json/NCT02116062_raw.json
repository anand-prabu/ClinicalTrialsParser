            "textblock": "The introduction of surgical robots in the OR revolutionized a number of specialties (i. e.\n      urology, gynecology, digestive surgery). Robots are currently used in many situations and\n      the list of appropriate indications is growing rapidly. There are many potential advantages\n      of robotics in eye surgery such as increased precision and maneuverability, better\n      ergonomics, improved patient access to surgeons and surgical training. As a result, robotics\n      might improve patient care. The Da Vinci\u00a9 robot has been used for 10 years in experimental\n      conditions to suture corneal lacerations, to perform corneal grafts, to remove ocular\n      foreign bodies, lens capsules and vitreous.\n      \n                 The authors reported a lack of precision resulting from poor visualization and\n      the absence of microsurgical instruments. These elements were considered to be hurdles to\n      further clinical investigation. The new Da Vinci Si HD\u00a9 robot has been available since 2009\n      at the IRCAD center and more recently in Strasbourg University Hospital. It provides greater\n      magnification and better resolution of the operative field than the previous model. We\n      performed since 2012 various ocular surface surgeries on porcine eyes at the IRCAD center.\n      The aim of the present trial is to perform the same procedures (amniotic membrane\n      transplantations, pterygium surgeries, corneal grafts) in a clinical setting with the Da\n      Vinci Si HD\u00a9 system."
