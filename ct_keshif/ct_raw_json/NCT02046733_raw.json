Several studies in\n      patients with lung cancer suggested a possible favourable association between the increased\n      presence of immunological active cells in the tumor and the survival. Ipilimumab is a\n      protein which helps your immune system to attack and destroy cancer cells by your immune\n      cells. Early clinical trials with ipilimumab have shown activity in a broad range of\n      cancers, inclusive SCLC.\n\n      The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy (how well the treatment works) and\n      tolerability (how severe the side effects are) of the standard treatment (chemotherapy and\n      radiotherapy) alone compared with the standard treatment followed by ipilimumab in patients\n      with limited SCLC."

            "textblock": "At the time of diagnosis, 30% of patients with small cell carcinoma (SCLC) will have limited\n      stage disease, now called stage I-IIIB (IASLC). The outcome of limited disease SCLC is still\n      poor, with a median survival of 16 to 24 months with current forms of treatment and only\n      15-25% long term survivors.\n\n      Combining chemotherapy and thoracic radiotherapy is the standard treatment approach in\n      limited-stage SCLC with etoposide and cisplatin (PE) as the backbone regimen. Concurrent\n      chemo-radiotherapy is superior to sequential treatment and early thoracic irradiation\n      starting with first or second cycle of chemotherapy appears beneficial. Hyperfractionated\n      accelerated radiotherapy has been shown to be more efficacious than radiotherapy given in a\n      long overall treatment time. However, availability and routine-use of hyperfractionated\n      radiotherapy remains a matter of debate. Therefore, in this trial, both radiotherapy\n      schedules of accelerated twice-daily administration or once-daily radiotherapy are accepted.\n      The choice of schedule is a stratification factor for randomisation.\n\n      Several studies in patients with NSCLC suggested an association of increased tumour\n      infiltration of immune cells with improved survival. In recent years, a continuously\n      improved identification of antigenic targets, the addition of immunoadjuvants, and the\n      production of more efficient delivery systems have resulted in more efficient vaccines, able\n      to elicit a potent immune response, leading to the development of immunotherapy as a\n      fundamentally new treatment of NSCLC.\n\n      One anticancer target of current interest is cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4),\n      which is a negative regulator of T-cell activation. Ipilimumab, which is a fully human\n      monoclonal antibody, specifically blocks the binding of CTLA-4 to its ligands (CD80/CD86).\n      This blockade augments T-cell activation and proliferation, which leads to tumour\n      infiltration by T cells and tumour regression. Early clinical trials with ipilimumab have\n      shown activity in a broad range of cancers. In recent phase 3 trials, ipilimumab was the\n      first agent to demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in overall survival in\n      patients with metastatic melanoma. A randomised phase II study compared ipilimumab plus\n      paclitaxel and carboplatin followed by ipilimumab maintenance with paclitaxel and\n      carboplatin alone in NSCLC and extensive SCLC, with a design allowing separate analysis of\n      patient populations. The rationale for the combination of ipilimumab with paclitaxel and\n      carboplatin was based on preclinical models where chemotherapeutics that included taxanes\n      and platinum-based compounds induced the release of tumour-specific antigens from dying\n      tumour cells, which initiated T-cell activation. Of importance, certain chemotherapy agents\n      might also enhance the antitumour activity of the anti-CTLA-4 antibody, as suggested in\n      preclinical tumour models.\n\n      Because the sequence of the administration of chemotherapy and immunotherapy has been shown\n      to affect outcome, two alternate regimens of drug administration were used in the randomised\n      phase II trial, one with ipilimumab (10 mg/kg, q3wks, 4 cycles with a maintenance treatment\n      every 12 wks until PD) concurrent starting with first cycle paclitaxel and carboplatin, and\n      the second where 2 cycles of paclitaxel and carboplatin was given before ipilimumab start\n      (\"phased\"). In NSCLC, ipilimumab improved irPFS (PFS by Synopsis ETOP/IFCT 4-12 STIMULI V\n      1.3 02Dec2013 3/5 immune-related response criteria (irRC)), median PFS according to WHO\n      criteria, and showed a trend towards improved OS for the phased-ipilimumab regimen (HR,\n      0.72; P .05) but not for the concurrent ipilimumab regimen.\n\n      One-hundred thirty patients were enrolled in the randomised phase II study comparing\n      concurrent or phased ipilimumab plus paclitaxel and carboplatin, in the ED-SCLC cohort. The\n      results suggest phased-ipilimumab plus chemotherapy improved outcome in first-line ED-SCLC,\n      as shown by a improvement in irPFS (6.4 vs 5.3 mos, p=.03), a numerically higher best\n      overall response rate by irRC (71% vs 53%) and a trend for improved OS (12.9 vs 9.9 mos,\n      p=0.13).\n\n      Ipilimumab did not appear to exacerbate toxicities observed with chemotherapy alone, and\n      adverse events were generally manageable using protocol-defined treatment guidelines.\n\n      Results of this study were considered worth supporting further investigation of the phased\n      ipilimumab regimen in previously untreated stage IV SCLC in an ongoing phase III trial. The\n      present protocol proposes to evaluate a similar ipilimumab regimen in limited-disease SCLC\n      in an open-label randomised trial design.\n\n      Ipilimumab will be delivered sequentially after a standard schedule including\n      chemoradiotherapy and prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) as a consolidation treatment.\n      Importantly, in CA184042, the first study to evaluate ipilimumab monotherapy among subjects\n      with advanced Stage IV melanoma and active brain metastases, the safety profile observed in\n      the subset of 31 patients having received prior radiation therapy for CNS metastases was not\n      different from the one regarding the whole 72 subjects study population.\n\n      The primary objective of this trial is to evaluate if patients treated with\n      chemo-radiotherapy and prophylactic cranial irradiation followed by ipilimumab consolidation\n      have a better overall survival compared to patients treated with chemo-radiotherapy and\n      prophylactic cranial irradiation without ipilimumab consolidation."
