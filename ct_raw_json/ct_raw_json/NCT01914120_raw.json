The method is to use the Functional Assessment of Cancer\n      Therapy-Lung (FACT-L) scales, assess the quality of life before the chemotherapy, after 1st\n      cycle of chemotherapy and after 2nd cycle. After 3 time-points, investigators analyze all\n      the subscales and constructs of FACT-L. The assumption is the quality of life will be better\n      after 2 cycle of chemotherapy."
