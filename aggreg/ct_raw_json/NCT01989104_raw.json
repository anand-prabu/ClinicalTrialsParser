All of the\n      study procedures involving the participant will be completed in a single testing session\n      (one-day - approximately 3 hours) at the Pennington Biomedical Research Center. If\n      preferred, two visits on separate days can be scheduled to complete the protocol.\n\n        -  Screening questions (approximately 3-5 minutes)\n\n           o Participants (or their legal guardian) will be asked to answer several screening\n           questions to determine their eligibility for participating in CADENCE-KIDS.\n\n        -  Height and weight measures data collection (approximately 10 minutes)\n\n             -  Height will be measured.\n\n             -  Body weight and body fat percentage will be measured using a specialized scale.\n\n             -  Waist circumference will then be measured using a measuring tape.\n\n        -  Instrument attachment, treadmill walking, free-living activities (approximately 140\n           minutes)\n\n             -  Participants will be fitted with 10 devices (Digi-Walker Pedometer, NL-1000\n                Pedometer, StepWatch Activity Monitor, SenseWear Armband, GT3X+ accelerometer,\n                GENEActiv Accelerometer, Actical Accelerometer, ActivPal Accelerometer, Polar\n                Heart Rate Monitor, K4b2 Portable Metabolic Unit) to measure/monitor physical\n                activity throughout the testing session.\n\n             -  Participants will then complete several low intensity free-living activities while\n                their physical activity and oxygen uptake are concurrently assessed. Specifically,\n                participants will rest in a chair, watch a portion of a child-friendly movie while\n                seated in a chair, and color in a coloring book while seated in a chair. Each\n                activity will last for 5 minutes and a 2 minute rest will occur between each\n                activity.\n\n             -  Participants will then complete a series of walking bouts on a treadmill while\n                their physical activity and oxygen uptake are concurrently assessed. The walking\n                bouts start at 0.5 miles per hour and end at 5 miles per hour (0.5 miles per hour\n                increments). Treadmill testing stops when the participant finishes the bout where\n                they naturally select to jog/run, or following the completion of the last bout at\n                5.0 miles per hour, whichever occurs first. A 2 minute rest will occur between\n                each treadmill bout.\n\n             -  Participants will then complete three additional free-living activities where\n                physical activity and oxygen uptake continue to be concurrently measured.\n                Specifically, participants will step up and down on an aerobic step at 88 beats\n                per minute, dribble a basketball, and perform jumping jacks at 126 beats per\n                minute (63 jumping jacks per minute). Each activity will last for 5 minutes and a\n                2 minute rest will occur between each activity."
