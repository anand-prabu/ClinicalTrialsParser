In addition, the blood levels of methadone both before and during AZT treatment\n      will be studied, and patients receiving daily oral methadone treatment will be evaluated for\n      signs of narcotic withdrawal during treatment with AZT.\n\n      The number of deaths due to AIDS in high-risk populations continues to increase. Nationwide\n      approximately 25 percent of AIDS patients are intravenous (IV) drug abusers, and it is very\n      likely that an increasingly larger number of AIDS patients receiving AZT therapy will have\n      had a history of IV drug abuse. The major chemical treatment for IV drug abuse is daily\n      methadone maintenance therapy, and IV drug abusers who are HIV positive represent a large\n      number of patients who will undergo long-term treatment with both methadone and AZT.\n      Therefore, the study of potential drug interactions is essential."
