This is known as exacerbation and it is the most\n      frequent cause of hospital stay, urgences services and death in COPD. A physiotherapy\n      program is carrying out in patients attending to the Hospital because of an exacerbation.\n\n      The hypothesis of this study is that a physiotherapy program added to a medical treatment\n      increase the ventilatory function, the physiques variables, decrease depression and anxiety\n      and improve the quality of life. Additionally, it is going to be assessed the effect of\n      physiotherapy in time using phone calls and visits to the patient's home."
