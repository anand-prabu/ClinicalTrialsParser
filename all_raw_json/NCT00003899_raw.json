Combining chemotherapy with bone marrow or peripheral stem cell\n      transplantation may allow the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill\n      more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of melphalan and thiotepa plus bone marrow\n      or peripheral stem cell transplantation in treating patients who have recurrent or\n      refractory solid tumors."

            "textblock": "OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of melphalan and thiopeta in patients\n      with recurrent or refractory solid tumors. II. Evaluate the overall survival and response\n      rate in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour\n      on day 1 and paclitaxel IV over 4 or 24 hours on day 2, followed by daily filgrastim (G-CSF)\n      subcutaneously beginning on day 3 and continuing through day 7 or until WBCs are greater\n      than 100,000 cells/mm3. Peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) or autologous bone marrow is\n      collected on days 5-7. At 30-50 days following mobilization, patients receive melphalan IV\n      over 15-60 minutes on days -5 and -4 and thiotepa IV over 2 hours on days -3 and -2,\n      followed by autologous bone marrow transplantation or PBSC infusion on day 0. Sequential\n      dose escalation of melphalan is followed by sequential dose escalation of thiotepa. Dose\n      escalation in cohorts of 5 patients each continues until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is\n      determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 4, 3 of 7, 4 of 11,\n      or 5 of 15 patients experience dose limiting toxicity. Patients are followed at 60 days and\n      at 12 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study within 4 years."
