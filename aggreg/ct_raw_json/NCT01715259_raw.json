There will be approximately 8 participants\n      in each cohort (group). The total study duration for each participant will be 36 days.\n      Abiraterone acetate 1000 mg will be administered orally (by mouth) as a single dose in the\n      fasted state on Day 1. No food will be ingested for 4 hours post-dose. Participants will be\n      confined to the clinical research center from the day prior to dosing (Day -1) to Day 5 and\n      will return to the clinic on Days 8, 15, and 22 for follow up. Serial pharmacokinetic\n      samples will be collected and safety will be monitored throughout the study."
