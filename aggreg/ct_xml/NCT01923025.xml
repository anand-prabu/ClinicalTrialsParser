        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy male subjects,  25 to 50 years of age, inclusive; healthy status is defined
             by absence of evidence of any active or chronic disease

          -  Body mass index (BMI) 18 to 30 kg/m2 inclusive

          -  Male subjects with female partners of child-bearing potential must use two methods of
             contraception, one of which must be a barrier method (i.e. condom), for the duration
             of the study and for 30 days after the last dose

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of any clinically significant gastrointestinal, renal, hepatic,
             broncho-pulmonary, neurological, psychiatric, cardio-vascular, endocrinological,
             haematological or allergic disease, metabolic disorder, cancer or cirrhosis

          -  History of clinically significant hypersensitivity or allergic drug reactions

          -  Any suspicion or history of alcohol abuse and/or consumption of other drugs of abuse

          -  Regular smoker (&gt; 5 cigarettes, &gt; 1 pipeful or &gt; 1 cigar per day)

          -  Positive for hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or HIV infection

          -  Evidence of significant cardiovascular disease or disorder

          -  Participation in an investigational drug or device study within 3 months prior to
             first administration of the study drug or within 6 times the elimination half-life,
             whichever is longer

          -  Previous inclusion in a research and/or medical protocol or any clinical procedures
             involving nuclear medicine, PET, occupational exposure to ionizing radiation or
             radiological investigations with significant exposure to radiation, excluding dental
             X-ray and common X-rays of chest or extremities

          -  Subject has any condition that would prevent an MRI from accurately or safely being
             performed [eg, claustrophobia, cardiac pacemaker, metallic implants or clips]

          -  Subject unable to lie on his back in the PET or MRI scanner for a period of 90
             minutes

          -  Contraindication for arterial cannulation

          -  Unsuitable veins for repeated venipuncture
