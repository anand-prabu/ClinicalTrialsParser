However, the relationship\n      between SNP polymorphism c.2518A/G in the MCP-1 gene with diabetic retinopathy remains\n      controversial. In the present study, we evaluated the association of a single nucleotide\n      polymorphism (SNP) in the MCP-1 gene with diabetic retinopathy (DR) and diabetic macular\n      edema (DME) in Chinese population from Southern China with type 2 diabetes."

However there is no report in China so far.\n      This study was designed to clarify the relationship of polymorphism of MCP-1 c.2518A/G with\n      type 2 diabetes with or without DR. The relationship between MCP-1 c.2518A/G and different\n      stage of DR has also been studied.This article proved that the MCP-1 c.2518G/G genotype is a\n      susceptibility gene for DR in Chinese type 2 diabetic patients, especially the High-risk\n      PDR. There is no association with DME and c.2518G/G."
