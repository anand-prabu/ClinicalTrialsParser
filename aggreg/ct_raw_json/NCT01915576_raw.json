The relative\n      bioavailability of liquid service formulation and tablets will be determined.\n\n      After the MTD is defined breast cancer patients with and without AKT1 mutation will be\n      treated.\n\n      The study will also assess the pharmacokinetics, biomarker status, pharmacodynamic\n      parameters and tumor response of BAY1125976.\n\n      BAY1125976 will be given daily as single oral application. Treatment will be stopped if the\n      tumor continues to grow, if side effects, which the patient cannot tolerate, occur or if the\n      patient decides to exit treatment."
