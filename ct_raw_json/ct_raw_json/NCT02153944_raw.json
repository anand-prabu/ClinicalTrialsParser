            "textblock": "Background:\n\n      Stress and anxiety can interfere with how well people perform tasks. But performing a task\n      can sometimes lessen anxiety by distracting people from the stress. Researchers want to\n      examine the interaction between attention and stress. They will use two drugs with different\n      effects on stress and concentration.\n\n      Objective:\n\n      - To better understand how thinking and emotion affect anxiety and performance. Also, to\n      study the effects of methylphenidate and propranolol on performance.\n\n      Eligibility:\n\n      - Adults age 18   50.\n\n      Design:\n\n        -  First, participants will be screened with a test in which they hear loud, sudden noises\n           through headphones. Sticky pad electrodes will be placed on the skin under one eye.\n           These electrodes will tell us how sensitive participants are to the noises.\n\n        -  Second, participants will complete questionnaires about their mood, thinking, and\n           anxiety. They will give a saliva sample. For this, a cotton swab will be placed in\n           their mouth for 2 minutes.\n\n        -  Third, participants will take a single dose of one of the study pills or a placebo.\n           They will then look at words, shapes, and letters on a computer monitor. They will\n           answer questions about what they remember. They may receive a shock or hear loud noises\n           during the tests.\n\n        -  For the shocks, small metal disk or sticky pad electrodes will be taped to a wrist or\n           finger. For recording bodily responses, additional electrodes will be placed on the\n           arms, body, and under each eye.\n\n        -  Blood pressure and pulse will be measured during the tests. More saliva samples will be\n           taken.\n\n        -  At the end of the study, participants will answer questions about their reaction to the\n           study testing and about any effects they noticed from the study pill.\n\n        -  After the experiment, participants will be evaluated for effects of the study pill."

            "textblock": "Objective:\n\n      The overall aim of this protocol is to examine the effect of pharmacological manipulations\n      of affective and cognitive processes on anxiety and task performance. Ultimately, the goal\n      is 1) to provide insight into the relative influence of cognitive and affective states on\n      anxiety, 2) generate theoretical models that can be applied to a better understanding of the\n      interaction between cognition and emotion, 3) develop a better screening approach to\n      candidate anxiolytics, and 4) help formulate novel therapeutic interventions for clinical\n      anxiety.\n\n      Excessive or inappropriately sustained anxiety and fear lead to the most common group of\n      psychiatric disorders. A number of theoretical models have been proposed to understand the\n      mechanisms engaged in these maladaptive behaviors. Most recent emphasis has focused on the\n      synergistic contribution of cognitive and emotional processes. Our laboratory has been\n      instrumental in delineating aspects of behavioral and neural processes that are associated\n      with fear and anxiety, using psychophysiological and neuroimaging measures of fear and\n      anxiety. Evidence shows that levels of anxiety modulate cognitive performance, such as\n      working memory or perceptual discrimination, and that, conversely, cognitive engagement\n      influences severity of experimentally induced anxiety. The exact contribution of emotional\n      processes vs. cognitive processes to the experience of anxiety is not clear, similarly to\n      the neural mechanisms underlying these interactions.\n\n      In this protocol, we propose to manipulate pharmacologically separately cognitive and\n      emotional processes to dissociate their contribution to fear/anxiety, while using\n      state-of-the-art measures of anxiety derived from translational work. Indeed, we already\n      developed integrative experimental models of fear and anxiety via the manipulation of\n      predictable and unpredictable shock, respectively. We already employed successfully these\n      models to measure anxiolytic and anxiogenic effects of various compounds such as alprazolam,\n      citalopram, hydrocortisone, and oxytocin in healthy participants.\n\n      We propose to start with a simple proof-of-concept study, using two pharmacological\n      compounds in a double-blind randomized parallel design, each preferentially acting\n      respectively on the cognitive (methylphenidate) or affective (propranolol) domain, and using\n      a single cognitive process (working memory). Future work will expand to other compounds and\n      cognitive processes, as well as vary the strategy to induce anxiety. Presently, anxiety will\n      be induced using the threat of shock, while participants perform the task. We will examine\n      whether 1) the reduction of induced-anxiety with propranolol improves cognitive performance,\n      and 2) the facilitation of cognitive performance with methylphenidate reduces\n      induced-anxiety. If these manipulations are successful, we will assess in a second step\n      their neural correlates using functional neuroimaging.\n\n      At this time, only the first behavioral/psychophysiological step of this proposal will be\n      addressed.\n\n      Study population:\n\n      Medically and psychiatrically healthy adult males and females, aged 18 to 50 years.\n\n      Design:\n\n      The study is a double-blind cross-over design. Three groups of healthy participants will\n      come for one experimental session. During this session, they will be asked to perform a\n      working memory task under the threat of shock, i.e., while anticipating unpleasant electric\n      shocks. Each group will receive one drug challenge, either placebo, propranolol (40 g) or\n      methylphenidate (20 mg).\n\n      Outcome measures:\n\n      The primary outcome measures are the startle reflex and performance on the working memory\n      task. Secondary measures include skin conductance, heart rate, and subjective measures of\n      anxiety, as well as salivary measures of alpha-amylase, and cortisol."
