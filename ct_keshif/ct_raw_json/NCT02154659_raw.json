One of the causes of reflux symptoms is the relaxation of the lower\n      sphincter of the esophagus. But, the sphincter relaxation also occur in normal people. But,\n      there is a difference in postprandial reflux pattens between the patients and the normal\n      people. So, in this study, we want to compare the difference of reflux pattern between the\n      patients who have postprandial reflux symptoms and normal people though the 24hr pH\n      monitoring."
