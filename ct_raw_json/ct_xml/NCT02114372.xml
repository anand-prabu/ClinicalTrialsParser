  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the natural history of cognitive and functional
      changes in participants at risk for developing mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) (MCI-AD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective single center study that will enroll participants without dementia who
      are considered at high, medium and low risk for developing mild cognitive impairment (MCI)
      due to Alzheimer's disease (AD) from a community-based register (referred to as the CHARIOT
      registry) in the United Kingdom. No interventions (ie, study drugs) will be administered to
      participants in the study. The planned duration of the study is approximately 4 years with
      up to 2 years for participant recruitment. Data collection to assess outcome measures
      associated with disease progression will occur at baseline and every 6 months thereafter at
      the clinic during the follow-up period of 48 months. Blood, urine, and saliva samples will
      be collected from participants during the study for biomarker analyses to assess risk
      factors for dementia, Alzheimer's disease or confounding factors of dementia risk. Adverse
      events experienced by the participants during their participation in the study will be
      monitored.
