      Indication:

      Treatment of subjects with advanced (FIGO stage IVB) or recurrent cervical cancer, prior
      radiochemotherapy or neo-adjuvant chemotherapy is allowed.

      Study design:

      This is a phase II randomized, double blind and placebo controlled trial evaluating the
      efficacy of Nintedanib/placebo in combination with the standard of 6 cycles 3 weekly
      carboplatin and paclitaxel followed by Nintedanib/placebo maintenance in the treatment of
      patients with advanced or recurrent cervical cancer.

      A total of 120 patients will be randomized between the experimental and control arm in a 1:1
      ratio. Randomization will be stratified for 1previous therapy (chemo-radiotherapy or
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy: no, &gt;6 months since last platin course) and 2disease status (Stage
      IVB primary versus recurrent disease).

      Experimental arm: Subjects will receive 6 cycles of 3-weekly carboplatin (AUC 5 or 6) +
      paclitaxel (175 mg/m2) and Nintedanib 200 mg BID followed by Nintedanib maintenance until
      progression or for a total maximum duration of 120 weeks.

      Control arm: Subjects will receive 6 cycles of 3-weekly carboplatin (AUC 5 or 6) +
      paclitaxel (175 mg/m2) and placebo 200 mg BID followed by placebo maintenance until
      progression or for a total maximum duration of 120 weeks.

      Subjects without evidence of disease progression after completion or discontinuation of the
      study treatment will be followed until radiographic disease progression, withdrawal of
      consent or death.
