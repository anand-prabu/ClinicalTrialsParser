Total protein amount,\n      divided to animal and plant sources in 50%-50% and animal sources distributed (half/half)\n      between meats and dairy products. Fasting blood samples, hs-CRP, lipid profile, systolic and\n      diastolic blood pressure and anthropometric measurements were measured based on the standard\n      guidelines."
