      The purpose of this study is to learn how blood flows to tumors in patients treated with
      I-125 plaque brachytherapy for uveal melanoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite having excellent local tumor control rates, uveal melanoma remains a
      life-threatening cancer, and even eye-sparing therapy with radiation treatment often leads
      to significant loss of vision. Major challenges to providing care to patients with uveal
      melanoma include the inability to accurately predict long-term vision in an eye treated with
      radiation, due to a poor understanding of the nature of radiation retinopathy and optic
      neuropathy. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a commonly used ophthalmic imaging
      modality that provides precise, real-time data in vivo in a non-invasive manner. Our
      research group has recently developed two novel functional OCT technologies: (1) Doppler OCT
      to quantitatively measure total retinal flow and (2) OCT angiography technology to map optic
      nerve head, retinal, and choroidal blood flow with unprecedented accuracy. The investigators
      believe this technology can be utilized to improve understanding of radiation-induced
      vascular changes in the optic nerve and retina that cause vision loss in patients treated
      with radiation, as well as provide a tool to monitor tumor response to treatment.

      In this study, the investigators intend to utilize these novel functional OCT technologies
      to describe the changes over time in optic nerve head and retinal blood flow after I-125
      radiation therapy, and to evaluate the relationship between changes in flow and decreased
      vision. The investigators will also study the association between changes in flow and the
      total radiation doses received by the optic nerve head and macula, which varies based upon
      tumor location and size.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adults age 18 and older with uveal melanomas involving the ciliary body and/or the
             choroid undergoing I-125 plaque brachytherapy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Inability to give informed consent.

          -  Inability to maintain stable fixation for OCT imaging

          -  Significant renal disease, defined as a history of chronic renal failure requiring
             dialysis or kidney transplant

          -  A condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude participation in
             the study (e.g., unstable medical status including blood pressure, cardiovascular
             disease, and glycemic control).

          -  Blood pressure &gt; 180/110 (systolic above 180 OR diastolic above 110). If blood
             pressure is brought below 180/110 by anti-hypertensive treatment, subject can become
             eligible.

          -  Women who are pregnant or lactating at the time of enrollment due to unknown safety
             of fluorescein angiography.  Women that become pregnant during the course of the
             study may remain enrolled; however, flurorescein and ICG angiography will not be
             performed until they are no longer pregnant or nursing an infant.
