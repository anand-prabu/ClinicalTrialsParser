In the U.S. and the U.K. this occurs primarily in persons of\n      African origin. There is only one drug (hydroxyurea) approved to manage SCD, but it is not\n      fully efficacious and can produce medically significant side effects. Aes-103 is being\n      evaluated as a novel agent for the long term management of SCD. By directly reducing the\n      sickling process, Aes-103 has a different mechanism of action than hydoxyurea. The active\n      ingredient in Aes-103 is 5-hydroxymethyl furfural, a naturally occurring small molecule that\n      is chemically related to glucose.\n\n      This study will evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetic profile of two dosing regimens of\n      Aes-103 for up to 28 days in up to 50 adult subjects with stable SCD compared with subjects\n      receiving placebo."
