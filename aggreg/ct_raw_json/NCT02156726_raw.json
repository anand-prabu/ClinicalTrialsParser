These excellent results,\n      however, cannot be generally applied to the whole CLL population. This is because the median\n      age at diagnosis of CLL lies between 65 and 72 years and patients older than 65 years in\n      fact account up to 50%-75 %  of the CLL population. Nevertheless, such population is\n      considerably underrepresented in most of the large clinical trials in CLL/SLL. Therefore, it\n      is not clear whether elderly/comorbid patients could profit from newer treatment approaches\n      such as purine analog combinations or chemoimmunotherapy. Several publications demonstrated\n      unacceptable toxicity of full-dose FC/FCR in elderly CLL patients. However, regimens using\n      attenuated doses of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide showed promising efficacy and low\n      toxicity."
