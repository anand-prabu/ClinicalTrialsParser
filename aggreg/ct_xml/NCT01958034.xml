      In a double blinded, randomized, clinical trial of patients suffering from STEMI (ST-segment
      elevation myocardial infarction) or non-STEMI (non-ST-segment elevation myocardial
      infarction)compare the effect of 3 months of dietary supplement with bilberry extract on a
      range of parameters with prognostic importance in cardiovascular disease: lipids,
      inflammation, oxidative stress and heart function.

      Following inclusion of 8 individuals and as of February 12, 2014: Due to intolerance to
      &quot;bilberry placebo powder&quot; we have amended to the protocoll that the trial design is changed
      from blinded to open and that the bilberry arm of the trial carries on in an open design and
      that the control group will receive no dietary supplement.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a diagnosis of STEMI as defined by chest pain suggestive for myocardial
             ischemia for at least 30 minutes before hospital admission, time from onset of
             symptoms of less than 24 hours, and an ECG with new ST-segment elevation in two or
             more contiguous leads of ≥0.2 mV in leads V2-V3 and/or ≥0.1 mV in other leads or a
             probable new-onset left bundle branch block.

          -  Patients with a diagnosis of non-STEMI as defined by a combination of; onset of
             symptoms such as central chest pain or an aggravated angina pectoris, with or without
             an ECG change with ST-segment lowering or an inverted T-wave, and at least two values
             with levels of troponin-T or troponin-I above the established margin of an MI.
