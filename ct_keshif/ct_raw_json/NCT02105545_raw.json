This can help guide cancer care decisions that may be more effective for patients.\n      These will be called clinically actionable findings, or CAF.\n\n      Additional health related findings may be made, not related to cancer but to other\n      conditions, diseases or syndromes. These are called secondary findings (SF). In this study\n      the investigators will also measure how often they find SF and will discuss their possible\n      impact on other aspects of patients' health. If patients want to know about these findings,\n      they will be discussed with a panel of experts including genetic counselors.\n\n      Finally, the investigators will compare how often CAF and SF differ from those identified in\n      nationwide samples."

Equally critical are the ethical, legal, and social issues\n      surrounding the introduction of WGS testing and its clinical application in multiethnic,\n      multicultural populations, particularly those who have historically experienced\n      discrimination or even unethical research practices.
