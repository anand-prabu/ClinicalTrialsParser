After\n      thyroidectomy, 80 percent of patients experience posterior neck pain as well as the incision\n      site pain. The posterior neck pain is thought to be due to hyperextension is continued\n      during an average of 90 minutes of surgery. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents or\n      opioids are administrated to reduce the pain, but the pain still remained.\n\n      TENS is simple, non-invasive analgesic technique that is used extensively to reduce acute\n      and chronic pain. TENS has  beneficial effect for the reduction of postoperative pain. The\n      conventional way of administering TENS is to use electric characteristics that selectively\n      activate large diameter A\u03b2 fiber mediating touch perception without activating smaller\n      diameter A\u03b4 and C fiber.\n\n      In this study, TENS during thyroidectomy in posterior neck pain will be evaluated."
