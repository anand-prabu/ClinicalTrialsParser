In this interventional, open-label study, infants 2 through 5 weeks of\n      age (14 to 41 days) will be enrolled and vaccinated with RV5 according to a 2-5 week, 2 and\n      4 month schedule and infants 2 months of age (56 to 83 days) will be vaccinated according to\n      the standard recommended schedule (2, 4, and 6 months of age).  Sera will be obtained from\n      subjects one month following the final dose of vaccine and will be assayed for\n      anti-rotavirus IgA and rotavirus neutralizing antibody responses against the G1, G2, G3, G4\n      and P[8] serotypes. Post dose 3 G1 serum-neutralizing antibody (SNA) geometric mean titers\n      (GMTs) will be compared between children receiving pentavalent rotavirus vaccine (RV5)\n      according to the alternate dosing schedule versus the standard recommended schedule.\n      Likewise, post dose 3 G2, G3, G4 and P[8] SNA  and serum rotavirus IgA GMTs will be compared\n      between children receiving RV5 according to the alternate dosing schedule and the standard\n      recommended schedule. The safety and tolerability of RV5 in children receiving vaccine\n      according to the alternate dosing schedule will be described."
