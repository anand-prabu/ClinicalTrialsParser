Allergic\n      rhinitis currently affects 10-30% of the world population  with prevalence and impact\n      continuing to increase. This leads to substantial economic costs both of prescription\n      medication and time taken off work by both patients and carers due to the disease.  In view\n      of this, there may be a substantial need for improved therapy or management to ensure that\n      patients with allergic rhinitis can carry out a normal lifestyle.\n\n      The proposed study will evaluate the unmet therapy need in seasonal rhinitis by examining\n      the current medication requirements of patients who suffer from seasonal grass-pollen hay\n      fever and determining whether current therapies are sufficient for managing rhinitis.\n\n      This study aims to evaluate the unmet therapy need in seasonal rhinitis by -\n\n        1. Examining and describing current medication requirements\n\n        2. Quantifying the extent of co-prescribing of multiple agents\n\n        3. Comparing the effectiveness of current prescription drugs for managing and controlling\n           patient's seasonal rhinitis and using changes in treatment during the hay fever season\n           to determine the effectiveness of current therapy options.\n\n      for managing and controlling seasonal rhinitis in primary care patients who suffer from\n      seasonal grass-pollen hay fever."
