    <measure>Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The percentage change from Baseline in the EASI score at week 12. The EASI is a composite scoring system assessed by the investigator based on the the four body regions (head and neck, upper limbs, lower limbs, and trunk) affected with Atopic Dermatitis (AD) and the intensities of key signs of AD (erythema, induration/papulation,excoriation, and lichenification). The total EASI score ranges from 0 to 72.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>EASI Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The proportion of subjects who achieve at least a 50% reduction from Baseline in the EASI score at Week 12. The EASI is a composite scoring system assessed by the investigator based on the the four body regions (head and neck, upper limbs, lower limbs, and trunk) affected with AD and the intensities of key signs of AD (erythema, induration/papulation,excoriation, and lichenification). The total EASI score ranges from 0 to 72.</description>

    <measure>Pruritus Numeric Rating Scale (NRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 4</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The percentage change from Baseline in the average weekly pruritus NRS score at Week 4. Pruritus is the cardinal symptom of Atopic Dermatits. Pruritus at night may result in sleep disturbance. The severity of pruritus and sleep quality will be assessed by subjects via a diary using a numeric rating scale ranging from 0 to 10.</description>
