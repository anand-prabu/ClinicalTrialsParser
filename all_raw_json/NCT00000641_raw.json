The\n      prognosis of patients with disseminated M. avium is extremely poor, particularly when it\n      follows other opportunistic infections or is associated with anemia. Test tube studies and\n      clinical data indicate that the best treatment program may include clofazimine, ethambutol,\n      a rifamycin derivative, and ciprofloxacin.

Eligible\n      patients are randomized on day 15 to one of two treatment programs: (1) ciprofloxacin,\n      clofazimine, ethambutol, and rifampin (all taken orally), or (2) the same four drugs plus\n      amikacin.

Patients who\n      do not demonstrate a response at study week 10 are discontinued from all study therapy.\n      Patients enrolled on earlier versions of the protocol who have surpassed study week 16 (14\n      weeks of drug therapy) continue treatment with their originally assigned regimen through\n      study week 26; those who have not surpassed study week 16 are considered for inclusion in\n      the maintenance phase of the study."
