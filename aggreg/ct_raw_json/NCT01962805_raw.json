Each formulation will be designated as either\n      Treatment A or Treatment B.  A total of 8 subjects who meet the eligibility criteria will be\n      randomized to receive either Treatment A or Treatment B as their first assigned treatment.\n      Subjects will receive a single dose of Treatment A or daily dosing with Treatment B for 6\n      days.  After a 7-day washout period subjects will receive the alternative treatment.  On the\n      day of treatment with Treatment A and on the first and last days of treatment with Treatment\n      B subjects will remain in the clinic overnight and undergo 32-hour pharmacokinetic\n      assessment at the following time points: 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28 and 32 hours\n      after administration of study drug.  For Treatment B study drug will be administered in the\n      clinic each day after a trough blood sample has been drawn."
