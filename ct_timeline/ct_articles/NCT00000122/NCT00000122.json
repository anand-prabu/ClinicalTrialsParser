The use of 5-FU, an antimetabolite, has been shown to inhibit the proliferation of fibroblasts in tissue culture, and in preliminary studies it has increased the success of filtering surgery in a nonhuman primate model.<br/><br/>The Fluorouracil Filtering Surgery Study (FFSS) was a randomized, controlled clinical trial comparing the success rate of standard glaucoma filtering surgery to the success rate of standard surgery with adjunctive 5-FU treatment.<br/><br/>Another element of this study was to evaluate the frequency and severity of possible adverse effects related to 5-FU injections. \u00a0Detailed preoperative and postoperative examinations of the cornea, lens, and retina were performed. \u00a0Systemic toxicity was assessed by preoperative and postoperative hematologic studies.<br/><br/>After the investigators performed the filtering surgery and determined that the new outlet channel was working, patients were randomized to receive either 5-FU injections or standard postsurgical care without 5-FU. The patients treated with 5-FU received subconjunctival injections of 5 mg of 5-FU twice daily on postoperative days 1 through 7 and once daily on postoperative days 8 through 14. \u00a0There were 213 patients recruited into the study, 162 with previous cataract extraction and 51 with previous filtering surgery.<br/><br/>All patients were examined at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, 18 months, and 2 years postoperatively and at yearly intervals thereafter until 5 years postoperatively. \u00a0Possible concomitant risks of 5-FU treatment, such as toxic effects to the cornea, lens, or retina, were monitored.</p></td></tr><tr><th>Phase</th><td>Phase 3</td></tr><tr><th>Study type</th><td>Interventional</td></tr><tr><th>Study design</th><td>Treatment</td></tr><tr><th>Study design</th><td>Randomized</td></tr><tr><th>Study design</th><td>Double Blind</td></tr><tr><th>Condition</th><td>         Glaucoma      </td></tr><tr><th>Intervention</th><td><div>Drug: 5-Fluorouracil</div><p></p></td></tr><tr><th>Reference</th><td><div>Citation: The Fluorouracil Filtering Surgery Study Group; Fluorouracil Filtering Surgery Study one-year follow-up., Am J Ophthalmol 1989;108:625-635</div><div>MEDLINE: <del style=\"background:#ffe6e6;\">90086934</del><ins style=\"background:#e6ffe6;\">2688428</ins><span></span></div></td></tr><tr><th>Reference</th><td><div>Citation: The Fluorouracil Filtering Surgery Study Group; Risk factors for suprachoroidal hemorrhage after filtering surgery., Am J Ophthalmol 1992;113:501-507</div><div>MEDLINE: <del style=\"background:#ffe6e6;\">92246174</del><ins style=\"background:#e6ffe6;\">1575223</ins><span></span></div></td></tr><tr><th>Reference</th><td><div>Citation: The Fluorouracil Filtering Surgery Study Group; Three-year follow-up of the Fluorouracil Filtering Surgery Study., Am J Ophthalmol 1993;115:82-92</div><div>MEDLINE: <del style=\"background:#ffe6e6;\">93128447</del><ins style=\"background:#e6ffe6;\">8420383</ins><span></span></div></td></tr><tr><th>Reference</th><td><div>Citation: The Fluorouracil Filtering Surgery Study Group; Five-year follow-up of the Fluorouracil Filtering Surgery Study., Am J Ophthalmol 1996;121:349-366</div><div>MEDLINE: <del style=\"background:#ffe6e6;\">96179405</del><ins style=\"background:#e6ffe6;\">8604728</ins><span></span></div></td></tr><tr><th>URL</th><td>http://www.nei.nih.gov/news/pressreleases/ffsspressrelease.asp</td></tr><tr><th>See also</th><td><p>NEI Press Release-Fluorouracil Improves Glaucoma Surgery Outcome</p></td></tr><tr><th class=\"section\" colspan=\"2\"><h2>Recruitment Information</h2></th></tr><tr><th>Status</th><td>Completed</td></tr><tr><th>Start date</th><td>         1985-09      </td></tr><tr><th>Last follow-up date</th><td>         1988-06            (Actual)  </td></tr><tr><th>Criteria</th></tr><tr><td class=\"bigdent\" colspan=\"2\"><p>Men and women with uncontrolled intraocular pressure greater than 21 mm Hg in one or both eyes despite maximal tolerated therapy and who were aphakic or had undergone previous filtering surgery were eligible to participate.</p></td></tr><tr><th>Gender</th><td>            Both         </td></tr><tr><th>Healthy volunteers</th><td>No</td></tr><tr><th class=\"section\" colspan=\"2\"><h2>Administrative Data</h2></th></tr><tr><th>Organization name</th><td>National Eye Institute (NEI)</td></tr><tr><th>Organization study ID</th><td>NEI-21</td></tr><tr><th>Sponsor</th><td>               National Eye Institute (NEI)            </td></tr><tr><th>Health Authority</th><td>               United States: Federal Government         </td></tr></table></span></body></html></div></body>","asset":{"media":"","credit":"clinicaltrials.gov","caption":""}}]}}
