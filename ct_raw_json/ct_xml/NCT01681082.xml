  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The general purpose of this study is to examine the effect of tai chi training on cognitive
      function in young adults. The investigators will test subjects enrolled in a semester-long
      tai chi course along with control subjects. The specific aims are to measure duration of
      practice, cognitive function, physical balance, and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder
      (ADHD) indicators. The investigators primary hypotheses are that, compared to controls,
      subjects in the tai chi course will show improvements in (1a) spatial working memory and
      (1b) response inhibition. The investigators secondary hypotheses are that, among the
      subjects participating in the tai chi course, these cognitive improvements will correlate
      with (2a) improvements in balance and (2b) duration of tai chi practice, and that, among all
      participants, (2c) ADHD indications will correlate with cognitive measures.
