However, mild to\n      moderate disease still accounts for important disability. Electrodiagnostic studies (EDS)\n      have not been shown to accurately predict outcomes for patients with CTS. Recent advances in\n      MR permit high-resolution neurographic imaging of the median nerve, and pilot data suggest\n      that wrist MRI might be a better predictor of outcome than EDS. Thus, wrist MRI has the\n      potential for playing a major role in the treatment of patients with CTS. We will test two\n      main hypotheses: 1) that select patients with early, mild or moderate CTS benefit more from\n      early surgery than with conservative therapy; and, 2) that wrist MRI accurately identifies\n      those patients more likely to benefit from surgery. We will perform a randomized, controlled\n      treatment trial nested within a prospective cohort as our study design."
