            "textblock": "TTM is a persistent impulse control disorder in which the individual acts on urges to pull\n      out his or her own hair. Onset typically occurs by adolescence, and TTM is often associated\n      with significant functional impairment and distress. CBT is a type of psychotherapy designed\n      to change problematic behaviors and thinking. It includes self-monitoring of hair-pulling\n      urges and homework assignments to practice the use of cognitive and behavioral strategies.\n\n      Participants are assigned randomly to receive either CBT or AC for 8 weeks.  Participants\n      assigned to CBT receive weekly 1-hour sessions of CBT for 8 weeks; participants assigned to\n      AC receive 6 telephone contacts and 2 in-person sessions for 8 weeks.  After 8 weeks, CBT\n      participants who respond to treatment enter Phase II, which lasts an additional 8 weeks and\n      includes 4 in-person maintenance sessions.  AC participants who are still symptomatic after\n      8 weeks are offered CBT."
