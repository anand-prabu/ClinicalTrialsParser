Patients\n      are stratified according to race (Caucasian vs African American). After 2 weeks of daily\n      oral placebo, patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral soy protein supplement daily for 12 months.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo daily for 12 months. Quality of life is assessed\n           at baseline and at 6 and 12 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 160 patients (80 per arm) will be accrued for this study\n      within 12 months."
