    <textblock>
      To characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of the injectable intramuscular (IM) long-acting
      formulation (in situ microparticle, ISM) of risperidone over four IM injections in the
      gluteal and deltoid muscle at 28-day intervals and at one dose strength (75 mg) in patients
      with schizophrenia.
