The\n      enrolled patients will be exposed, in a cross-over design, to n = 2 aqueous suppressants and\n      n= 3 uveoscleral outflow enhancers, and 24 hr IOP will be measured.

(c) study drugs: Timolol and dorzolamide will\n      be chosen as inflow drugs. The three prostaglandin analogues (PGA) Latanoprost, travoprost\n      and bimatoprost will be chosen as outflow drugs. (d) study flow-chart: upon enrollment,\n      patients will be initiated to the following schedule: 60 days timolol 0.5% bid, 60 days\n      washout, 60 days timolol 0.5%-dorzolamide 2% fixed combination bid, 60 days washout, 60 days\n       PGA1, 60 days washout, 60 days PGA2, 60 days washout, 60 days PGA3. Patients were assigned\n      to the PGAs according to a sequence (L-T-B) randomly generated. Data will be collected at\n      baseline and at the and of each study phase (i.e. active treatment and washout)(e) main\n      efficacy outcome: change in the mean IOP (with respect to baseline) at the end of each study\n      phase and change of IOP (with respect to baseline) at the different time points of the\n      24-hour phasing. IOP will be measured at 8 a.m., 11 a.m., 3 p.m., 6 p.m. and 9 p.m. by means\n      of Goldmann applanation tonometry at the  slit lamp. At midnight, 2 a.m. and 6 a.m. the\n      Tonopen in supine position will be used. (f) statistics: the analysis of co-variance\n      (ANCOVA) for paired samples with Bonferroni correction will be adopted. A minimum sample\n      size of 51 patients is needed for a minimal expected difference in mean IOP between inflow\n      and outflow drugs = 2.5 mmHg, with an estimated pooled variance = 4 , a power = 90% and an\n      alpha probability = 5%."
