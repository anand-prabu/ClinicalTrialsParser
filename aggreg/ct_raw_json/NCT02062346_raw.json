It is thus important to lower blood\n      pressure in those with hypertension. However, hypertension in vasculitis is inadequately\n      controlled with many currently available blood pressure lowering agents.\n\n      Endothelin is a chemical produced by blood vessels that contributes to the development of\n      hypertension. Higher than normal levels of endothelin are seen in patients with vasculitis.\n      By using drugs that block the effects of endothelin ('endothelin receptor antagonists') the\n      investigators can hopefully treat hypertension in patients with vasculitis. The purpose of\n      the study is to ascertain whether endothelin receptor antagonists lower blood pressure and\n      improve blood vessel function more effectively in patients with vasculitis than those\n      without it."
