    <textblock>
      To assess and evaluate the safety of octaplas™ in comparison to standard plasma product
      (e.g., fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and other approved plasma products used within 24 hours of
      thawing) used in the treatment of TTP, in patients undergoing Therapeutic Plasma Exchange,
      with a special emphasis on the occurrence of thromboembolic events (TEEs).

             or to FFP.

          2. Patient has an already known IgA deficiency with documented antibodies against IgA.

          3. Patient is currently participating in an interventional clinical study or has
             participated during the past 1 month prior to study inclusion.

          4. Patient has severe deficiencies of Protein S.

          5. Patient has a history of TTP relapse.

          6. Patient received more than 1 treatment of plasma exchange or plasma infusion for
             current episode of TTP prior to randomization.
