A 12-month follow-up is planned with outcome measures assessed\n      at three time points: baseline (before intervention initiation), 6-month (intervention\n      mid-point), and 12-month (intervention termination). Outcomes of interest include physical\n      and cognitive performances, and falls. In addition, the investigators specifically address\n      brain circuits in an exploratory sub-study. Volunteer trial participants from both study\n      arms are invited to undergo functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at baseline and\n      12-month."
