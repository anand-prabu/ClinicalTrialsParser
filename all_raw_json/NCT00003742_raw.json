            "textblock": "OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of paclitaxel when combined with\n      cisplatin and irinotecan in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors. II.\n      Determine the dose limiting toxicity of paclitaxel when combined with cisplatin and\n      irinotecan in this patient population. III. Establish the recommended phase II dose for this\n      regimen in this patient population. IV. Assess the antitumor activity of this regimen in\n      selected solid tumor malignancies.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of paclitaxel. All patients receive paclitaxel IV\n      over 1 hour, then cisplatin IV over 30 minutes, followed by irinotecan IV over 30 minutes\n      weekly for 4 weeks on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Treatment is repeated every six weeks for at\n      least 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of\n      3-6 patients receive escalating doses of paclitaxel. If 2 or more patients experience dose\n      limiting toxicity (DLT) at a particular dose level, escalation ceases and the maximum\n      tolerated dose (MTD) is defined as the previous dose level. Patients are followed until\n      death.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 12-27 patients will be accrued for this study within 6-9\n      months."
