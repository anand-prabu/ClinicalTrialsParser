            "textblock": "The reason for doing this study is to see if cancer will respond to immune therapy after\n      transplantation of blood stem cells (from the bone marrow) using a new kind of treatment\n      regimen that is less toxic than that previously used for blood stem cell transplants. This\n      type of transplant uses much less chemotherapy and radiation than standard bone marrow\n      transplants. The treatment consists of medications that weaken the immune system so it\n      doesn't reject the donor's marrow cells. Researchers hope that the immune cells from the\n      donor will attack the tumor. This is called a \"graft versus tumor\" effect and has been seen\n      in other types of cancer. In addition, 65 days or more after the transplant the patient may\n      be eligible for an immune treatment that uses additional immune cells from the donor to\n      increase the effect of the stem cells against the cancer"
