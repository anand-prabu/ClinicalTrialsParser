Determine the survival rate at 6 months of patients with stage III or IV\n      unresectable adenocarcinoma of the pancreas treated with 6-hydroxymethylacylfulvene (MGI\n      114). II. Determine the objective tumor response rate, time to objective tumor response, and\n      duration of response in these patients (if retrospective data is available, time to tumor\n      progression while on prior gemcitabine is determined). III. Determine the clinical benefit\n      of MGI 114 as measured by pain improvement, performance status, and weight. IV. Determine\n      the survival rate at 3, 9, and 12 months in these patients. V. Gain additional information\n      on the toxic effects and safety profile of this regimen.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is an open label, multicenter study. Patients receive\n      6-hydroxymethylacylfulvene (MGI 114) IV over 5 minutes on days 1-5. Treatment is repeated\n      every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are\n      followed monthly for up to 1 year after therapy initiation.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-18\n      months."
