Approximately 126 evaluable subjects meeting the\n      eligibility requirements of the study will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive\n      either standard of care treatment, as defined in the protocol (SOC) for FHF plus treatment\n      with the ELAD system (ELAD group), or SOC for FHF alone (Control group).\n\n      Central randomization will be performed to ensure that neither site nor study personnel will\n      have any foreknowledge of subject treatment assignment, and to ensure treatment group\n      balance for the following pre-specified stratification factors that may define patient\n      subgroups with a potential for different outcomes:\n\n        1. FHF following acetaminophen overdose,\n\n        2. Subjects with non-acetaminophen or an unknown cause of FHF.\n\n      Screening evaluations and assessments will be completed for both ELAD and Control subjects\n      and reviewed against inclusion/exclusion criteria.  Confirmation of the subject's\n      eligibility will be determined in the same manner for both ELAD and Control subjects.\n\n      For both study groups, the time of randomization will define the time of study entry (Hour\n      0, Study Day 1, study baseline) and inclusion in the ITT population.\n\n      Subjects in both groups will be evaluated throughout the 28-day study period.\n\n      If standard of care therapy as defined by the institution and this protocol is consistent\n      with discharging the subject home, then the subject should be discharged.  Prior to\n      discharge, the subject will be advised to attend all follow-up visits.\n\n      Following ELAD treatment, subjects treated with ELAD will receive standard medical therapy\n      and be followed through Study Day 28.\n\n      An extension of this study, VTI-212E, will provide extended follow up of subjects enrolled\n      in VTI-212 over a period of 5 years to determine incidence of survival, cancer, liver\n      transplant, ans assess quality of life.  Data obtained from the extension study will be\n      assessed separately from the data obtained in the 28-Day VTI-212 trial.  The database for\n      VTI-212E will be a separate database with a separate analysis."
