    <textblock>
      This is an open label, controlled study.

      The investigators are studying if the FDA approved diabetes medicine liraglutide (Victoza®)
      can improve sleep apnea in adults. This study is testing liraglutide in 10 adults without
      diabetes that are newly diagnosed with sleep apnea and will be starting continuous positive
      airway pressure (CPAP). The treatment group will be compared to a control group of 10 adults
      without diabetes who have sleep apnea and use CPAP but will not use liraglutide.

      Everyone in the study will have two study visits and one overnight sleep study for research.
      The study visits include fasting blood samples and breathing tests (pulmonary function test
      and hypercapnic challenge). There will be weekly phone visits that include a questionnaire
      on sleepiness. The group that takes liraglutide will check their blood sugar two times a day
      while on the medicine.

      This is a pilot study aiming at measuring the change in obstructive apnea/hypopnea index in
      non-diabetic patients being treated for the first time with the glucagon-like peptide-1
      (GLP-1) agonist, Liraglutide. Sleep disordered breathing (SDB) consists of nocturnal
      alveolar hypoventilation and / or obstructive sleep apnea which result from abnormalities in
      upper airway tone and ventilation during sleep. The development of a new pharmacological
      treatment for sleep disordered breathing (SDB) could bring a breakthrough discovery that
      will impact a rapidly growing population of children and adults with this disorder. The
      investigators hypothesize that GLP-1 plays a central role in the improvement of SDB and that
      the administration of GLP-1 receptor agonist to patients with OSA will correct or improve
      SDB.

        -  Hypothesis 1: Administration of Liraglutide to patients with severe OSA defined as
           apnea hypopnea index ≥ 25 /hr. will result in a mean reduction in the index by a
           minimum of 10 events /hr. after 4 weeks.

        -  Hypothesis 2: Administration of Liraglutide will result in significant increase in
           Orexin level, decrease in leptin, decrease in Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) score and
           increase in carbon dioxide (CO2) chemosensitivity.

      This is an open label, non-randomized, controlled pilot study. Subjects are heavy to obese
      non-diabetic adults that are newly diagnosed with severe sleep apnea and will be starting
      CPAP. 10 subjects will be treated with liraglutide for 4 weeks and compared to 10 untreated
      controls.

      Study time points are baseline and 4 weeks post treatment. Study procedures include pre and
      post treatment: fasting blood for glucose, hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C), Orexin and leptin; ESS
      questionnaire; pulmonary function test and hypercapnic challenge. The procedures also
      include a post treatment overnight research sleep study to measure change in apnea index
      from diagnostic sleep study done previous to study enrollment.
