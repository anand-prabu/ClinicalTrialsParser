There have been few studies trying to\n      improve asthma outcomes in patients with known depression.  One method to improve outcomes\n      is to instruct patients in ways to better self manage asthma.  The goal of this study is to\n      test a comprehensive intervention to improve asthma self-management by increasing knowledge\n      and self-efficacy in patients with a known history of a positive screen for depression.\n      Patients will be randomized to two groups - a control group and an intervention group.\n      Patients in the control group will receive an asthma workbook, will make a contract to adopt\n      behaviors they think will improve asthma, and will receive telephone follow-ups\n      approximately every week for 8 weeks and then approximately every 2 months.  Patients in the\n      intervention group will receive these components plus they will be taught how to use a peak\n      flow meter and specific chapters of the workbook will be used as templates for focused\n      instruction during telephone follow-ups.  The primary outcome will be a comparison of\n      within-patient change in asthma-related quality of life between groups."
