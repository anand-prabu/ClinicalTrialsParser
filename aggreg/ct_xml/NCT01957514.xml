    <textblock>
      This pilot research trial studies collecting, analyzing, and storing samples from patients
      with metastatic, triple negative breast cancer receiving cisplatin. Studying samples of
      tissue, blood, buccal swab, saliva, and urine in the laboratory from patients receiving
      cisplatin may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify
      biomarkers related to cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To establish the safety and feasibility of collecting, analyzing and storing panomic and
      other data from serially monitored patients with cancer in a manner that is scientifically
      useful.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether genetic changes associated with cisplatin resistance can be
      identified, to explore patient perceptions regarding panomic data and its application to
      cancer treatment, and to apply other technologies to the characterization of patient tumors
      as they become available.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo collection of tissue biopsy, blood, buccal mucosa, saliva, and urine at
      baseline.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients will have metastatic triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and are about to
             receive treatment with single agent cisplatin

          -  Measurable disease including bone disease as determined by physical exam or imaging

          -  Patients must have tumor suitable for biopsy (as assessed by trained specialists in
             radiology); patients must be medically fit and willing to undergo repeated tissue
             biopsies or surgical procedures to get tumor tissue

          -  Written informed consent obtained from subject and ability for subject to comply with
             the requirements of the study

             performance status of &gt;= 50%)

          -  Agree to allow their de-identified clinical and laboratory data to be posted to

             fit enough to undergo tissue biopsy; presence of a condition or abnormality that in

             quality of the data

          -  Significant bleeding disorder

          -  Pregnant, breastfeeding, or unwilling to practice birth control during participation

          -  Bevacizumab treatment within 4 weeks prior to biopsy
