The presence of occult\n      metastases in bone marrow and lymph nodes is assessed using immunohistochemistry or reverse\n      transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction.\n\n      Patients are followed every 6 months for 5 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 500 patients will be accrued for this study within 3-3.5\n      years."
