Treatment continues every 2 weeks for\n      at least 1 course in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients\n      who previously received paclitaxel receive no more than 1 course during this study.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 33 patients will be accrued for this study."
