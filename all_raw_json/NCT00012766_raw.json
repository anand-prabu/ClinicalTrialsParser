A collaborative care model derived from chronic illness\n      management theory has been successful in improving care in other managed care settings.\n\n      Objectives:\n\n      This effectiveness study adapted collaborative care to the VA primary care setting\n      (\"collaborative care\") and compared it with consult-liaison care (\"CL care\").\n\n      Methods:\n\n      Patients within a VA primary care clinic were randomly assigned by firm to the two\n      interventions.\n\n      In collaborative care, existing staff resources were reorganized to form a multidisciplinary\n      mental health specialist team.  The team developed a treatment plan based on an initial\n      assessment and suggested the plan to the primary care provider. Primary care providers'\n      treatment efforts were then supported by brief Social Work telephone calls designed to\n      support adherence and monitor symptomatology. Treatment results were systematically reviewed\n      and suggestions for treatment modification were fed back to the primary providers. In CL\n      care, the primary care providers were informed of the diagnosis and study clinicians\n      facilitated referrals to Psychiatry residents in-clinic as requested. Mailed and in-clinic\n      surveys and provider referral were used to recruit 168 collaborative care and 186 CL care\n      patients who met criteria for major depression and/or dysthymia based on structured\n      interview.  Patients were excluded only if they required immediate inpatient care, had a\n      pending mental health specialty clinic appointment, or had primary alcohol abuse.  Outcome\n      data on the SCL-20 depression symptomatology measure, Veterans SF-36, and Sheehan Disability\n      Scale were collected at baseline, 3 and 9 months.  VA utilization and costs of care were\n      analyzed.\n\n      Status:\n\n      Complete.  Final Report submitted June 30, 2001."
