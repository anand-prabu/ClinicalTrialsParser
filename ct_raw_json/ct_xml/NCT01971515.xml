          -  Confirmed diagnosis of advanced solid tumor that may be controlled with p70S6K or Akt
             inhibition based on the presence of already identified or potentially present
             molecular alteration known or likely to affect the phosphoinositide 3-Kinase (PI3K)
             pathway, such as: phosphate and tensin homolog (PTEN), phosphoinositide 3-Kinase
             catalytic subunit alpha isoform (PI3KCA), protein kinase B (Akt), mammalian target of
             rapamycin (mTOR), tumor sclerosis complex 1 (TSC1), tumor sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2),
             epidermal growth factor receptor (ErbB1) (EGFR), human epidermal growth factor
             receptor 2 (ErbB2), and liver kinase B1 (LKB1), and for which the subject had
             previously been offered an approved therapy no standard curative or palliative
             measures exist, or such available measures are not acceptable to the subject. In
             particular:

                  must have progressed on or have been intolerant to at least 2 lines of
                  HER2-directed therapy, and

               2. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutation positive lung cancer subjects
                  must have progressed on or have been intolerant to an EGFR inhibitor

             RECIST version 1.1 for solid tumors and Cheson 2007 for lymphoma

          -  A tumor accessible for biopsies and consent to undergo tumor biopsies before and
             during MSC2363318A treatment

          -  Ability to read and understand the informed consent form and willingness and ability
             to give informed consent and demonstrate comprehension of the trial before undergoing

          -  Ongoing toxicity (except alopecia) due to a prior therapy, unless returned to
             baseline or Grade 1 or less

          -  Major surgical intervention or participation in a therapeutic clinical trial within
             28 days from Day 1 of the first dose of MSC2363318A

          -  Bone marrow impairment, renal impairment, liver function abnormality and impaired
             cardiac function as defined in the protocol

          -  History of cerebral vascular accident or stroke within the previous 2 years
