Ex vivo fluorescence reflectance imaging (FRI) and immunohistochemistry will be\n      performed.\n\n      The investigators hypothesize that compared to controls, ICG-injected patients will\n      demonstrate increased ex vivo and microscopic ICG fluorescence signal within areas of\n      plaque."
