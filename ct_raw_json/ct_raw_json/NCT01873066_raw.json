            "textblock": "Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is one of the most common chronic childhood diseases requiring\n      lifelong insulin therapy. Children and adolescents with T1D need regular insulin injections\n      or the continuous insulin delivery using an insulin pump in order to keep blood glucose\n      levels normal. We know that keeping blood sugars in the normal range will help prevent\n      long-term diabetes-related complications involving the eyes, kidneys and heart. However,\n      achieving treatment goals can be very difficult particularly due to the risk of low glucose\n      levels (hypoglycaemia). One solution is to use a system where the amount of insulin injected\n      closely matches the blood sugar levels on a continuous basis. This can be achieved by what\n      is known as a \"closed-loop system\" where a small glucose sensor placed under the skin\n      communicates with a computer containing an algorithm that drives a subcutaneous insulin\n      pump.  We have been testing such a system in Cambridge over the last five years in children\n      and have found that this system is effective, and superior to usual insulin pump therapy, at\n      maintaining tight glucose control. More recently the system has been tested overnight, in\n      the home setting, for three weeks in adolescents during a pilot single-centre study.\n\n      The next step is to evaluate use of the closed loop system day and night over a period of 7\n      days in adolescents with type 1 diabetes. In the present study we are planning to study 12\n      young people aged 10-18 years on insulin pump therapy. This study will involve two 7 day\n      home study periods, during which glucose levels will be controlled either by an automated\n      closed-loop system or by subjects usual insulin pump therapy combined with continuous\n      glucose monitoring alone in random order. Prior to the closed-loop study period, there will\n      be a training period in the clinical research facility, which will allow participants to\n      familiarise themselves with the closed-loop system before going home.\n\n      We aim to to determine the effect of the closed-loop computer algorithm in keeping glucose\n      levels between 3.9 and 10.0 mmol/L during the daytime and overnight."

            "textblock": "The main objective of this study is to determine the efficacy, safety and utility of\n      automated closed-loop glucose control in the home setting over a short term period,\n      including the daytime and during the activities of normal daily living.  This study builds\n      on previous and on-going studies of closed-loop systems that have been performed in\n      Cambridge in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes in the clinical research facility\n      and in the home setting.  The data and experienced gained from this study will be utilised\n      in planning future home studies.\n\n      This is an open-label, single-centre, randomised, crossover study, involving two,  7 day\n      home study periods during which glucose levels will be controlled either by an automated\n      closed-loop system or by subjects' usual insulin pump therapy combined with continuous\n      glucose monitoring in random order.  A total of up to 18 children and adolescents aged 10 to\n      18 years with T1D on insulin pump therapy will be recruited through diabetes clinics, to\n      allow for 12 completed subjects available for assessment.\n\n      Subjects will receive appropriate training by the research team on the safe use of the\n      closed-loop insulin delivery system.  During the training visit in a clinical research\n      centre, subjects will be encouraged to mimic their usual daily activities and will be\n      allowed to walk inside hospital premises.  Subjects will be advised to discontinue automated\n      closed-loop insulin delivery and follow their usual insulin pump therapy for certain\n      activities such as periods of strenuous exercise during the 7 day home study phase.\n\n      The primary outcome is time spent in target range between 3.9 and 10.0 mmol/L as recorded by\n      CGM (conservatively adjusted for potential over-estimation).  Secondary outcomes are the\n      time spent with glucose levels above and below target, as recorded by CGM, and other\n      CGM-based metrics.  Safety evaluation comprises the tabulation of severe hypoglycaemic\n      episodes."
