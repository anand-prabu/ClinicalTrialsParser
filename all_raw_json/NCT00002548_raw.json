Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage cancer\n      cells. Combining chemotherapy and radiation therapy with peripheral stem cell\n      transplantation may allow the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy and radiation\n      therapy and kill more cancer cells. It is not yet known which treatment regimen is more\n      effective for multiple myeloma.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of melphalan, total-body\n      irradiation, and peripheral stem cell transplantation with that of combination chemotherapy\n      in treating patients who have previously untreated multiple myeloma."

Patients are registered at 5 different points, with\n      stratification occurring at some of these registrations.\n\n        -  Registration I: Induction I\n\n        -  Registration II: Induction II. Patients are stratified according to stage of disease\n           (I/II vs IIIA vs IIIB), beta-2 microglobulin at diagnosis (less than 6 micrograms/mL vs\n           at least 6 micrograms/mL), and response to Induction I (75-100% regression vs 50-74%\n           regression vs less than 50% regression vs not applicable).\n\n        -  Registration III: Patients are randomized to allogeneic bone marrow transplant (BMT)\n           (this arm closed as of 8/1/97) or autologous BMT. Patients are stratified according to\n           treatment received (high dose cyclophosphamide (CTX) and peripheral blood stem cells\n           (PBSC) prior to autologous BMT vs prior to chemotherapy) and beta-2 microglobulin at\n           this registration (less than 2 micrograms/mL vs no greater than 3 micrograms/mL vs\n           unknown).\n\n        -  Registration IV: Patients are randomized to maintenance therapy or no further therapy.\n           Those patients who are randomized to maintenance therapy are stratified according to\n           treatment (autologous BMT vs chemotherapy vs chemotherapy followed by autologous BMT)\n           and response to treatment (75-99% regression vs complete response).\n\n        -  Registration V: Patients receive autologous BMT as in registration III. Patients are\n           stratified according to prior best response (50% or better vs less than 50% vs not\n           applicable), duration of chemotherapy (at least 6 months vs less than 6 months), and\n           progression after therapy (chemotherapy vs interferon alfa vs observation).\n\n        -  Induction I: Patients receive vincristine IV and doxorubicin IV by continuous infusion\n           on days 1-4 and dexamethasone IV or orally on days 1-4, 9-12, and 17-20. Treatment\n           repeats every 5 weeks for up to 4 courses. Patients with progressive disease after 2\n           courses proceed to PBSC stimulation/harvest.\n\n      Allogeneic BMT arm is permanently closed as of 8/1/97.\n\n        -  Autologous BMT: Therapy begins 4-8 weeks following high dose cyclophosphamide. Patients\n           receive melphalan IV over 1 hour on day -5 and total body irradiation twice a day on\n           days -4 to -1. PBSC are reinfused on day 0. G-CSF SQ is administered beginning on day 1\n           until blood counts recover.\n\n        -  Chemotherapy: Patients receive vincristine IV, carmustine IV, and cyclophosphamide IV\n           on day 1, oral melphalan on days 1-4, and oral prednisone on days 1-7. Treatment\n           repeats every 5 weeks for at least 12 months.\n\n      Patients who have at least a 75% response to autologous BMT or chemotherapy are randomized\n      to maintenance vs no further therapy. Patients who progress on chemotherapy proceed to\n      autologous BMT (registration V).\n\n        -  Maintenance therapy: Therapy begins between 5 and 12 weeks after PBSC rescue. Patients\n           receive interferon alfa SQ three times a week. Treatment continues for 4 years in the\n           absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Patients who progress on chemotherapy undergo an autologous BMT within 8 weeks after the\n      last course of chemotherapy.\n\n      Patients who are randomized to receive no further therapy are observed for 1 year.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 500 patients will be randomized over about 4 years to\n      autologous transplantation vs chemotherapy as follows: about 250 patients/year will be\n      accrued for induction of whom 200 will achieve at least stable disease, 125 will be\n      randomized, and 15 will have a suitable donor for allogeneic transplant (as of 8/1/97,\n      allogeneic arm of study is closed). Approximately 300 patients are expected to be randomized\n      to maintenance vs no further therapy."
