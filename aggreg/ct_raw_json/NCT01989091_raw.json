IMD or ACH will be instilled into the\n      catheter lumens (dual lumen catheters) at the end of each dialysis session and removed prior\n      to the initiation of the next dialysis session.\n\n      The primary objectives of this study are:\n\n        -  To demonstrate the safety of B-Lock in dialysis patients\n\n        -  To demonstrate the non-inferiority or, if proven to be non-inferior, superiority of\n           B-Lock relative to ACH with respect to maintaining catheter patency as defined by the\n           use of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator for maintaining adequate blood flow\n           through the dialysis catheter\n\n        -  To demonstrate the superiority of B-Lock relative to ACH with respect to the incidence\n           of CLABSI"
