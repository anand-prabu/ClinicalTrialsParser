Specific Aims:\n\n      The specific aims of this study are:\n\n        1. Determine patients physical profiles prior WBRT and at regular intervals afterwards up\n           to 24 months after radiotherapy.\n\n        2. Record the status of patient metastases (i.e. number, location, size)\n\n        3. Determine patients' KPS values.\n\n        4. Record the incidence and causes of mortality of patients.\n\n        5. Determine the genotype of IDO2 for each patient.\n\n        6. Following data analysis, test the validity of the two hypotheses."
