            "textblock": "CRVO occurs when the vessels in the back of the eye become blocked. This creates a dangerous\n      condition because the vessels are weak and prone to leakage. This results in the development\n      of macular edema.\n\n      Previous studies have shown that inflammatory mediators and growth factors, such as vascular\n      endothelial growth factor (VEGF), are elevated in patients with macular edema associated\n      with CRVO.\n\n      Ozurdex\u00ae is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and is available by\n      prescription for macular edema following CRVO and branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO). It\n      is also indicated for the treatment of non-infectious uveitis affecting the posterior\n      segment of the eye. The approved dosage is 0.7 mg.\n\n      Ranibizumab (Lucentis\u00ae) is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and is\n      available by prescription for other eye disorders, such as wet age-related macular\n      degeneration (AMD), macular edema following CRVO or BRVO, and diabetic macular edema (DME).\n      The approved dosage for wet AMD and macular edema following CRVO/BROV is 0.5 mg given\n      monthly. The approved dosage for DME is 0.3 mg given monthly.\n\n      Dr. Gonzalez is conducting an investigational study on the safety and effectiveness of\n      treating CRVO-associated Macular Edema with a combination of 0.7 mg of Ozurdex\u00ae and 0.5 mg\n      Lucentis\u00ae, given as separate injections into the eye."
