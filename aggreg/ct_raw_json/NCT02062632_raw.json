Part of doxepin\n      hydrochloride's drug action takes place at the surface of the esophagus, which may be\n      helpful in reducing the pain caused by radiation therapy."

To assess the adverse event profile of doxepin swish and swallow using a patient-reported\n      questionnaire at 5 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour and then at 2 and 4 hours using\n      Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) and Radiation Therapy Oncology Group\n      (RTOG) acute toxicity criteria, and also for domains of unpleasant taste, burning/stinging\n      discomfort, and drowsiness.\n\n      II.
