Therefore, the need for\n      effective and desirable treatment options is vitally necessary. The purpose of the current\n      investigation is to determine the efficacy of a new therapeutic strategy: flaxseed. The aim\n      is to determine the efficacy of consuming milled flaxseed every day for 6 months on the\n      reduction of blood pressure in individuals newly diagnosed with high blood pressure yet to\n      receive any blood pressure lowering medications. Secondary objectives are to understand how\n      flaxseed at the molecular level can reduce blood pressure. The study hypothesis is that the\n      flaxseed group will exhibit significant reductions in blood pressure and therefore not\n      require any blood pressure lowering medication. The aim is to provide knowledge on a new\n      therapeutic strategy to help manage high blood pressure."
