  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Escalating violence is omnipresent in South African townships and can be traced back to two
      core mechanisms: a trauma-related hyper-arousal and a positive rewarding perception of
      violence. In the past, there was no therapeutic intervention available addressing both,
      trauma and the so-called appetitive aggression. The University of Konstanz has developed a
      culturally sensitive and scientifically based short-term intervention for the treatment of
      traumatized patients, the Narrative Exposure Therapy (NET), that has proven its
      effectiveness in various randomized clinical studies in different war-affected populations.
      Recently, the NET has been adapted for the forensic offender rehabilitation (FORNET) by also
      addressing the perpetration of violence related to a self-rewarding perception of the
      exposure with violence. It has shown to be effective in reducing the number of committed
      offenses in two perpetrator samples in Burundi and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. In
      this study, we will investigate the therapeutic efficiency of FORNET in a randomized
      clinical control trial with a sample of former offenders of the townships of Cape Town. In
      addition to the previous studies, we will specifically address the context of ongoing stress
      and link our findings to epigenetic markers of stress and violence. Participants will be
      followed over a period of one year post-treatment. The FORNET will also be disseminated to
      local staff of our collaboration partners from the South African Universities and an
      organization working in the townships to warrant sustainability of the therapeutic
      intervention.

      A group of 160 former young male offenders (age 10-30) from Cape Town, integrated in a
      community based skill-training program will be screened in a first step. A sample of 80
      non-violent controls will be screened as well. Participants with neurological or psychiatric
      disorders other than those resulting from exposure to traumatic stress, like chronic
      psychosis or acute substance use will be excluded from participation in the study but might
      receive referrals in the professional health care system. Participants with a life event
      during the last four weeks will be interviewed later to disentangle symptoms of traumatic
      stress from an acute stress disorder.

      We will apply standardised clinical questionnaires in a semi-structured interview for the
      assessment of exposure to traumatic stress (Children Exposed to Community Violence (CECV),
      Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale (PDS), adapted version), trauma symptomatology (PSS-I for
      diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder), aggression (Appetitive Aggression Scale (AAS),
      Buss Perry Aggression Questionnaire), psychosocial functioning (Work and Social Adjustment
      Scale, WSAS) and suicidality (M.I.N.I. 6.0.0., shortened version). Additionally, we will use
      an implicit measure of appetitive aggression via rating of violent pictures and a
      questionnaire about social acknowledgement (Social Acknowledgement Questionnaire).

      We will set up a FOR-NET (Narrative Exposure Therapy for offender rehabilitation) randomized
      clinical intervention trial for the treatment of former offenders that covers violence
      perpetration on the one hand and traumatization on the other. 81 participants will be chosen
      by the highest aggression scale scores and a certain threshold of trauma symptoms. 27 of the
      young offenders will receive FOR-NET, while 27 matched young offenders will receive CBT and
      another 27 matched young offenders treatment as usual (TAU). Matching will take place
      according to the number of traumatic events and types of offenses, the severity of trauma
      symptomatology, aggressive behavior and age. In order to compare the treatment effect with
      the two control groups and follow the long-term effects, post-treatment assessments with the
      initial survey will be performed 6 and 12 month post-treatment. Afterwards, the 20 subjects
      of the control group will receive FOR-NET by trained ZA staff for ethical reasons and to
      examine whether it is possible to effectively disseminate FOR-NET.

      In addition to the subjective data, we will corroborate the results with the assessment of
      epigenetic consequences of appetitive aggression and trauma and investigate its significance
      and persistence in the long-term course of the study. We propose that specific DNA
      methylation patterns are important markers of environmentally driven mental health
      pathologies, such as chronic aggression/violence and traumatic stress in such a sample of
      perpetrators. Further, we will test the stability of DNA methylation and its potential
      modification over a period of 12 months by behavioural intervention (FOR-NET).

      Saliva samples (2ml) will be collected through a non-invasive method using Oragene-Discover
      (OGR- 500) Collection Kit (DNA genotek, Ontario, Canada). We will collect two DNA saliva
      samples and one RNA saliva sample. Methylation patterns will be assessed at the University
      of Stellenbosch (Soraya Seedat), focussing on markers of trauma and violence.
