    <textblock>
      This study is comprised of two portions: a Phase 1 portion and a Phase 2 portion.  The Phase
      1 portion is a single-country, non-randomized, open label, clinical trial which will
      evaluate the safety, tolerability, preliminary efficacy, and PK profile of PD-0332991 as a
      single agent in Japanese patients with advanced solid tumors, and PD-0332991 in combination
      with letrozole in the first-line treatment of Japanese patients with ER(+) HER2(-) ABC. The
      Phase 2 portion is a single-country, non-randomized, open-label, single-cohort, multi-center
      clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of PD-0332991 in combination with
      letrozole for the first-line treatment of postmenopausal Japanese patients with ER(+)
      HER2(-) ABC.

        Phase 2

          -  HER2 positive tumor based on local laboratory results utilizing one of the sponsor
             approved assays.

          -  Known active uncontrolled or symptomatic CNS metastases, carcinomatous meningitis, or
             leptomeningeal disease.

          -  Prior neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment with a non steroidal aromatase inhibitor (ie,
             anastrozole or letrozole) with disease recurrence while on or within 12 months of
