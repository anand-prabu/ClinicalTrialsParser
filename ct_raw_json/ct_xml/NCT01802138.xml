  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Activated T cell were manufactured through in vitro T cell expansion of autologous T cell.
      We designed this study to determine the feasibility and safety of Activated T-lymphocyte
      cell therapy for refractory/relapsed neuroblastoma patients.

    <description>This was designed as a single-center, single group clinical trial, and subjects include patients with refractory refractory/relapsed  neuroblastoma.
If subjects agree to participate in the clinical trial by signing a written consent, only appropriate subjects, who meet the criteria on the examinations and tests, will undergo this clinical trial. To participate in the clinical trial, subject's blood of more than 60 ml should be withdrawn to make a study drug at least 3 weeks before administration. Subjects should visit to hospital according to the protocol and receive a study drug. Therapeutic response rate, overall survival rate, time to progression should be investigated.</description>
