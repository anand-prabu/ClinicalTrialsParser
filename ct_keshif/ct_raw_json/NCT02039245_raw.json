The total duration of the study will be about 42\n      days for each participant. During the Open-Label Treatment Phase, approximately 12 healthy\n      adult participants will receive a single oral dose of 2 CANA/MET XR tablets once daily for 7\n      days after a provided dinner. Participants will be required to fast from the end of lunch\n      until the dinner (a period of at least 6.5 hours) on Days 1 and 7 only."
