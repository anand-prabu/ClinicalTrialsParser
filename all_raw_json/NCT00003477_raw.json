Treatment continues for at least\n      12 months in the absence of disease progression and unacceptable toxicity. After 12 months,\n      patients with responding or stable disease may continue treatment.\n\n      Tumors are measured every 8 weeks during the first 2 years, every 3 months during the third\n      and fourth years, every 6 months during the fifth and sixth years, and yearly thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study."
