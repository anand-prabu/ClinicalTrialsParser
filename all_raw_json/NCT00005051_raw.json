Oral topotecan is\n           administered twice daily on days 1-14 for courses 2, 3, and 4. Treatment repeats every\n           28 days for 4 courses.\n\n        -  Regimen B: After completion of regimen A, patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours\n           followed by carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days\n           for 4 courses.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients (15 per arm) will be accrued for this study."
