            "textblock": "-  Although many different oral antidiabetic agents are currently available, approximately\n           50% of treated Type 2 diabetic subjects do not reach currently accepted goals for\n           HbA1c(Oral communication, American Diabetic Association, 2008)\n\n        -  Subjects are frequently prescribed agents which can cause hypoglycemia, and/or weight\n           gain. Metformin does not usually have these unwanted effects, and it is the standard\n           first line therapy in treating type 2 diabetic mellitus in European union.\n\n        -  Nonclinical pharmacodynamic studies revealed that MP-513 effectively improves glucose\n           tolerance in animal models of type 2 diabetes, whilst the compound has very little\n           potential to cause hypoglycaemia, the most commonly reported adverse event with many\n           currently marketed products.\n\n        -  The nonclinical studies also suggested that the inhibitory effect of MP-513 on DPP-\u2163 is\n           more potent and durable than other DPP-\u2163 inhibitors in development. The result in\n           safety pharmacology and toxicology also revealed that MP-513 has a relatively wide\n           margin for safety.\n\n        -  Thus, MP-513 is expected to have good efficacy and tolerability in subjects with type 2\n           diabetes mellitus by once-daily administration."

The subject is suffering from any disease, including Type 2 diabetes or its\n             complications that, in the opinion of the Investigator, is sufficiently severe to\n             render the subject unfit, or affect the subject's ability, to participate in the\n             study, for example:\n\n               -  Macroangiopathy with symptoms of coronary heart disease or peripheral arterial\n                  obstructive disease.\n\n               -  Microangiopathy with symptoms of (autonomous) neuropathy with any one or more of\n                  the following: gastroparesis\n\n               -  Symptoms of poor blood glucose control (polyuria, polydipsia or weight loss)\n\n          2.

The subject has participated in any other clinical study involving blood draws or\n             administration of an unlicensed medicinal product within 12 weeks prior to the\n             screening visit (This does not preclude a subject from being re-screened for this\n             study at a later date within the 12 week period, provided they were not randomised )\n\n          8. The subject has received insulin within 12 months prior to the screening visit, with\n             the exception of insulin therapy during hospitalization, insulin therapy for medical\n             conditions not requiring hospitalization (<2 weeks duration) or use in gestational\n             diabetes\n\n          9.

Oral contraception is permitted but must not be used as the sole method of\n             contraception)\n\n         11. Female subjects whose pregnancy test is negative or who are pregnant, lactating, or\n             are planning to become pregnant during the study\n\n         12.

The subject has a clinically significant liver disease with\n             aspartate-amino-transferase (AST) and alanine-amino-transferase (ALT) >2.5 times the\n             upper limit of normal (ULN) at the screening visit\n\n         14. The subject has diastolic blood pressure >100 mmHg and/or systolic blood pressure\n             >180 mmHg at the screening visit\n\n         15.
