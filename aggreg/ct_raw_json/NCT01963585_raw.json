Laboratory\n      measures that predict the results of MCT are expected to reduce the number of procedures.\n      The possible capacity of High sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), a marker of systemic\n      inflammation, to predict negative or positive MCT in children has not been evaluated.\n\n      Aim: to evaluate the capacity of hs-CRP to predict positive or negative MCT in school aged\n      children and to compare it with markers of airway inflammation: Fractional exhaled Nitric\n      Oxide (FeNO) and markers of allergic sensitization (IgE and peripheral blood eosinophils).\n\n      Design: Prospective study evaluating these parameters in patients with positive and negative\n      MCT.\n\n      Participant selection:  The study population included subjects (age range 6 to 18 years)\n      referred for Methacholine Challenge Test (MCT)\n\n      Sample size: 130 participants in the two groups. Intervention: Each subject will undergo\n      evaluation including a respiratory questionnaire, methacholine challenge test with\n      determination of PC20(the provocative concentration that reduced FEV1 by 20% from baseline),\n      exhaled nitric oxide (eNO). Venous blood will be analyzed for complete blood count +\n      eosinophils, IGE levels, hs-CRP. All measurements will be evaluated in a single 3 hour\n      visit, with no follow up study visits.\n\n      Primary end point: hs-CRP levels as add on tool to predict negative or positive MCT in\n      children Secondary outcome parameters: All other parameters are the secondary end points."
