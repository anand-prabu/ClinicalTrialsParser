  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With the aging of the American population, the numbers of adults with peripheral arterial
      disease (PAD) will increase significantly over the next several decades.  Patients with PAD
      are at increased risk for morbidity and mortality including both cardiovascular and
      all-cause mortality.  While regular physical activity reduces risk for vascular events and
      is recommended for treatment of PAD patients, few patients meet recommended goals.  Exercise
      programs which increase long-term adherence to walking can be an important contribution to
      PAD treatment. Our Internet-based intervention, with an online community builds on a walking
      enhancement program developed by members of our team and is shown to improve adherence among
      patients with vascular disease such as coronary artery disease (CAD). Using a randomized,
      controlled trial study design, we propose to test an automated Internet-based walking
      program with a social media component, to improve long-term adherence to walking while
      increasing walking distance, and health-related quality of life, among patients with PAD.
      Participants will be randomized to supervised PAD rehabilitation, or an Internet-based
      walking program or a combination of supervised PAD rehabilitation and Internet-based walking
      program. The Internet-based walking program with a social media component has been shown to
      increase both adherence to walking and overall walking duration in populations with chronic
      complex conditions such as CAD and diabetes. There is a strong need to develop
      interventions, easily generalizable to a real-world population, to improve the reach of
      lifestyle interventions which result in improved physical function and adherence to regular
      exercise among complex medical patients. High risk patients such as those with PAD (a CAD
      risk equivalent) stand to benefit the most from such programs.
