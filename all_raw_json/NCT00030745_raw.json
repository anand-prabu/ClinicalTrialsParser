Giving chemotherapy drugs before surgery may shrink the tumor\n      so that it can be removed during surgery.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy in treating\n      patients who have mesothelioma of the lung."

Within 6 weeks after completion of\n      chemotherapy, patients undergo restaging by CT scan followed by surgical resection.\n\n      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, day 1 of course 3, within 4 weeks after surgery,\n      and then at 3 and 6 months.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 61 patients will be accrued for this study."
