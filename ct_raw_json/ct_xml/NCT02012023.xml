  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most surgeons suggest the use of fecal diverting to address the high morbidity and mortality
      associated with anastomotic leakage (AL) in patients with high risk factors on AL who are
      undergoing low anterior resections(LAR). This exploratory study was conducted to evaluate
      the efficacy and safety of one kind of controllable tube ileostomy(CTI), which was designed
      to protect rectal anastomosis in patients with high risk factors on AL. Results of SCCI were
      compared to those of the loop ileostomy (LI) method.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After low anterior resection(LAR), in the LI group, the operation method was done as
      surgeons all known. In the CTI group, a double row of concentric purse-string sutures were
      placed in the ileum wall using 3-0 absorbable suture. The diameters of the purse-string
      rings were about 10 mm and 20 mm, respectively. The investigators then made a small incision
      within the inner purse-string and inserted the trachea cannula into the proximal end of the
      ileum. The inner purse-string suture then was tied, followed by the outer purse-string
      suture. The outer purse string should capsulate the inner purse string to prevent leakage.
      Normal saline was injected into the air bag until the ileum wall. The investigators will
      test the pressure of airbag, and control the pressure of airbag from 30-40cmHg. The
      investigators then pulled the cannula out through the abdominal wall. The incision site in
      the ileum was approximated to the inner abdominal wall and extraperitonized by fixing the
      mobilized ileum wall around the cannula to the inner abdominal wall. This was accomplished
      using 3-4 interrupted sutures.

      In the LI group, patients accepted reversal operation at least 3 months after operation if
      operation condition permission.

      In the CTI group, the tube will be removed after 3-4 weeks. If anastomotic leakage occurred,
      the investigators will test the airbag pressure and keep the pressure during 30-40cmHg.
      Because with time went on, the ileum will dilated , the airbag pressure will go down, then
      the feces may go through the airbag plane and flow into colon and the tube ileostomy will
      lose its defunctioning effect.When the investigators control the airbag pressure, we can
      control the defunctioning effect of tube stomy. So it is called controllable tube ileostomy.
      The investigators will keep the tube until the anastomotic leakage was cured.

    <description>Anastomotic leakage(AL) is the main complication after LAR.AL is defined as a defect of intestinal wall integrity at the colorectal or coloanal anastomotic site (including suture and staple lines of the neorectal reservoirs) leading to communication between intra- and extraluminal compartments.</description>

    <description>When AL occurred, whether this patient need reoperation is determined by the clinical manifestation. Reoperation rate and mortality are two key index to evaluate the effect and safety of cannula ileostomy.</description>

    <description>Another main operation complication was intestinal obstruction. Ileus conclude two types: temporally ileus and intractable ileus. Temporally ileus can be treated by conservative treatment and intractable ileus need reoperation.Ileus usually is caused by intestinal adhesion. But in CTI group, ileus maybe caused by the cannula obstruction.</description>
