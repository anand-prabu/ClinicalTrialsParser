It is a noninvasive treatment\n      modality based on the photochemical effect of light on tissues, which modulates various\n      metabolic processes.\n\n      LLLT has been used for a wide range of conditions, in particular in dermatology, to promote\n      wound healing, reduce inflammation and oedema, and relieve pain. In this study, we intend to\n      assess the efficacy of LLLT to manage radiotherapy-induced skin reactions (or radiation\n      dermatitis), a very common and distressing side effect of cancer treatment."
