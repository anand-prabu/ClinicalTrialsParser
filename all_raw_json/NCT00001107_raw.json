AmBisome, a new\n      treatment, will be compared to fluconazole, the traditional treatment for fungal infections\n      caused by the yeast Candida. Treatment will only be given to liver transplant patients who\n      are found to be at high risk for IFI. Liver transplant patients who are at low risk for IFI\n      will be monitored but will receive no study medication.\n\n      IFIs are found mainly in a high risk group of liver transplant patients, and are not common\n      in those with low risk. If IFI preventive therapy is focused on the high risk group, there\n      may be a lesser chance of Candida becoming resistant (able to grow despite the presence of\n      drugs used to kill it). Treating only the high risk group will also save money."
