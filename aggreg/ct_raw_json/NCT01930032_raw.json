C. difficile is a common bacterium (a germ that may cause disease)\n      that can live in the human gut. Some people have it without having any symptoms. In other\n      people it can cause illness ranging from mild diarrhea to severe colitis (infection of the\n      colon).\n\n      C. difficile makes toxins that damage the cells that line the colon.  The study doctors want\n      to find out how these toxins cause damage to the cells in the colon."
