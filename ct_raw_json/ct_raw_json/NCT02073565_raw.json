At 12 months a clinical evaluation will be completed before cardiac\n      catheterization and angiographic assessment.\n\n      Rationale: This study is intended to demonstrate that the Combo stent platform shows\n      superiority to an imputed BMS performance goal, noninferior effectiveness and safety vs\n      best-in-class second-generation everolimus-eluting stent (EES) (Xience V, Xience Prime,\n      Xience Xpedition stents; [Abbott Vascular/Abbott Vascular Japan]), and evidence of\n      mechanistic activity of the anti-CD34-Ab EPC capture technology with healthy level of\n      intimal tissue coverage superior to that of the best-in-class EES.\n\n      To ensure the robustness and interpretability of results, the current proposal includes a\n      number of unique design features:\n\n        -  Largest randomized DES study ever performed in Japan\n\n        -  Enriched population, including stabilized non-STEMI (NSTEMI) subjects with greater\n           likelihood of plaque rupture associated with their clinical syndromes\n\n        -  Collaboration between with Japan and the United States as a \"Proof of Concept\" program\n           under the auspices of the Harmonization by Doing Initiative, WG 1, including\n           concomitant enrollment in U.S.A. sites as an FDA-approved IDE study\n\n        -  Head-to-head randomization against state-of-the-art EES platform control, analyzed for\n           clinical noninferiority\n\n        -  Statistical analysis vs imputed BMS analyzed for clinical superiority\n\n        -  Fractional flow reserve (FFR) follow-up of 100% of subjects enrolled, providing\n           clinically relevant physiologic assessment of all subjects for 1 year ischemia-driven\n           TVR analysis\n\n        -  Mechanistic OCT imaging observations in 140 subjects using 6 French catheters as\n           follows:\n\n             -  Cohort A (30 subjects, 1:1 Combo and EES): Mechanistic imaging observations to\n                provide serial 6 month and 1 year OCT evaluation of healthy intimal tissue\n                coverage, intracoronary thrombosis, and stent malapposition and quantitative\n                coronary angiographic (QCA) analysis to assess 1 year late loss.\n\n             -  Cohort B (110 subjects, 1:1 Combo and EES): Mechanistic imaging observations to\n                assess 1 year OCT evaluation of healthy intimal tissue coverage, intracoronary\n                thrombosis, and stent malapposition, and QCA analysis to assess 1 year late loss.\n                Combined with the 12 month imaging of Cohort A, this study will provide OCT and\n                QCA observations at 1 year in 140 patients, half with Combo and half with EES.\n\n             -  Cohort C: 432 subjects (216 subjects per arm) will undergo all clinical follow-up\n                assessments with FFR and angiographic assessments at 12 months. Cohort C will be\n                the last cohort to enroll.\n\n        -  In the 110 subjects in Cohort B, 30 day and 1 year human antimurine antibody (HAMA)\n           titers will also be collected."
