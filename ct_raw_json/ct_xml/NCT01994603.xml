  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial will pilot test intervention strategies to increase utilization of HIV testing
      and gain knowledge for designing a clinical trial to evaluate prevention strategies to
      reduce HIV sexual transmission in the general population in Russia. The study will assess
      whether external (cost, convenience) or internal factors (low perception of own risk,
      reluctance to identify a partner as at-risk, fear of stigma) drive Russian women's
      reluctance to be tested and if peer support impacts their decision. A randomized
      experimental manipulation, comparing opt-in vs. bundled opt-out testing approaches, followed
      by focus group discussions, followed by a second-chance testing offer will be used to inform
      these questions. The answers will enable the international research team to engineer and
      then test an HIV testing promotion strategy in Russia. The project will collect preliminary
      data for a larger study to develop an evidence-based program to reduce the HIV transmission
      in this high risk population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A mixed methods research design combining qualitative and quantitative data collection
      methods will be used to increase the understanding of barriers to HIV testing, identify
      promising strategies to increase testing, generate research hypotheses, and design a future
      randomized clinical trial to evaluate HIV prevention targeted to at-risk women in the
      general population in Russia. The qualitative methods include structured interviews and a
      focus group participation to assess women's reasons for being the tested and possible
      prevention strategies. The quantitative methods include observation/recording of women's
      testing behaviors.

    <description>Women's decision to take/not take a health screening test/HIV test is recorded. If a woman chooses to be tested, she will be asked a few questions to assess her reasons for being tested. She will be provided with the results of the testing. If a woman's test is positive for HIV (or other health risks in the bundled opt-out condition), counseling with a trained study nurse, physician or psychologist will be available on-site and a referral for additional testing, counseling, and appropriate medical care will be provided.</description>
