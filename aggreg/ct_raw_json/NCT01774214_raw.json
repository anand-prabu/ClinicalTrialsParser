A second of the 3 ports of the triple stopcock will be connected to an IV tubing set connected to a 1 L bag of NS.  A 60 mL syringe will be connected to the third port of the triple stopcock.  On verbal prompt, participants will \"pull\" fluid from the bag of NS by withdrawing the plunger of the 60 mL syringe, filling it with saline.  They will then toggle the switch of the triple stopcock, so that it is \"off\" to the bag of NS and \"open\" to IV catheter extension tubing leading to the model.  They will then depress the syringe plunger, administering the fluid to the model.  These steps will be repeated until each participant believes that they have administered the requested volume of fluid to the model.",
