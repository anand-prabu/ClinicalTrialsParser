This is to lay the\n      groundwork for a larger RCT on the same topic.  Twenty patients greater than 6 months\n      post-stroke will be randomly assigned into one of four following treatment groups: (i)\n      aerobic training (AEROBIC group), (ii) cognitive training (COGNITIVE group), (iii) aerobic\n      exercise plus cognitive training (AEROBIC+COGNITIVE group); and (iv) non-aerobic range of\n      motion (ROM) and unstructured mental activity (CONTROL group) (for group descriptions,\n      please see detailed description below). We hypothesize that the combination of aerobic\n      exercise and cognitive training will be more effective in improving cognition after stroke\n      than either treatment on its own."
