            "textblock": "In France, lung cancer is the leading cause of death induced by cancer. Therapeutic advances\n      have been made in therapy of unresectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with tyrosine\n      kinase receptor inhibitors blocking the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR), as\n      erlotinib.\n\n      This drug usually does not induce rapid shrinking of NSCLC tumour explaining why RECIST\n      criteria are less reliable with erlotinib than cytotoxic drugs after 8 weeks of treatment.\n\n      Among patients with unresectable NSCLC, 3'-deoxy-3'-18F-fluoro-L-thymidine (18F-FLT) and\n      18F-2-18F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (18F- FDG) Positron Emission Tomography (PET) has\n      identified early responding patients and with better progression-free survival in erlotinib\n      first line and in the second or third line.\n\n      To date, none medico-economic study has been conducted to determine if this strategy will be\n      cost-effective.\n\n      The purpose of this study is to confirm that an early metabolic imaging with 18 F-FLT and\n      18FFDG PET could have theranostic issue by identifying at the fourteenth day of erlotinib\n      (second line or more) the subjects that do not respond to erlotinib, i.e. 6 weeks prior to\n      the morphological evaluation based on the new RECIST 1.1, that is typically done at week 8\n      of erlotinib treatment.\n\n      A health economics ancillary study will be achieved. Indeed, recent therapeutic\n      improvements, in particular targeted therapies in NSCLC, have improved quality of life and\n      life expectancy, but have also induce an important increase of the health costs. According\n      to studies, the mean cost of the treatments of NSCLC has been increased by a factor 3 during\n      the 10 last years. More efficient strategies that would permit to stop early with objective\n      endpoints, expensive therapies is a main achievement in thoracic oncology.\n\n      The potential clinical impacts of this work are 1) to stop early erlotinib in non-responders\n      and replace another treatment before a deterioration in their physical status, 2) reduce the\n      risk of side effects and costs of unnecessary treatment and 3) to propose a customization\n      treatment after the first line therapy."
