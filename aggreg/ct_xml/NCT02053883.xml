  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase IIb study designed
      to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Cethrin as a treatment for acute cervical spinal cord
      injury. During the trial, 3 mg and 6 mg doses of Cethrin will be compared with placebo.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Males or females, ages 18-62, inclusive

          -  Acute cervical spinal cord injury at a neurological level of C4 or C5

          -  AIS Grade A or B

          -  Scheduled to undergo decompression/stabilization surgery within five days of injury

          -  Written or verbal consent from patient or legally authorized representative that
             patient is able and willing to comply with the study protocol, including follow-up
             visits

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participation in any other clinical trial for acute SCI, including previous Cethrin
             trial

          -  Inability to receive study medication within five days of injury

          -  Acute SCI from gunshot or penetrating/stab wound, complete spinal cord transection,
             or multifocal SCI

          -  Detectable hemorrhage on MRI/CT scan

          -  Females who are breastfeeding or have a positive serum pregnancy test

          -  Body mass index (BMI) of â‰¥40 kg/m2 at screening

          -  History of an adverse reaction to a fibrin sealant or its human or bovine components

          -  Use of intravenous heparin in previous 48 hours

          -  Use of thrombolytics and/or aspirin-containing products in previous 24 hours

          -  Hemophilia or other bleeding abnormality (platelet level lower than 100 X 109/L,
             activated partial thromboplastin time or international normalized ratio higher than
             the upper limit of normal, or baseline hematocrit lower than 0.25)

          -  Unconsciousness or other mental impairment that precludes reliable ASIA examination

          -  Clinically significant neurological, cardiac, hepatic, or renal disease

          -  Any medical or other condition that, in the judgment of the investigator, would make
             participation in the study unsafe or unreasonably complicate follow-up/interpretation
             of study outcome data
