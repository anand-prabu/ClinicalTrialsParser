Except for certain syndromes there is today no good method for\n      identifying individuals with a hereditary high risk for CRC (about 25% of the cases). There\n      is currently no routine screening of the population in Norway for CRC today. Coloscopy,\n      which is the most reliable method, is demanding with respect to resources, it can be\n      painful, and may have complications. This project will attempt to find genetic determinants\n      for identification of individuals with increased risk for familial CRC. Such methods will\n      reduce unnecessary medical examination of unaffected family members, and will make it easier\n      to focus health services on individuals with increased risk. This will represent a\n      significant contribution towards improved health reduced death rate caused by CRC. The\n      project includes research on the ethical aspects, in particular challenges related to how\n      feedback to donors is handled."
