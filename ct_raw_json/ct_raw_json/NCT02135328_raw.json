Participants in the Intervention condition listened\n      to the \"radio stories\" and the participants in the control condition listened to an audio\n      brochure with relevant information.  We hypothesized that the intervention participants\n      would report higher intensions to engage in various healthful lifestyle behaviors than the\n      control participants after both participants listened to their respective health\n      information."

Through a CBPAR process, we aimed to create and test the effectiveness and\n      acceptability of \"SoLaHmo Radio Stories\" about changing knowledge and behaviors to prevent\n      or manage diabetes for Somali, Latino, and Hmong families.\n\n      Methods: SoLaHmo community researchers  interview 3 families (1 Somali, 1 Latino, and 1\n      Hmong) who have successfully implemented lifestyle changes to prevent or manage diabetes,\n      and then create 3 \"radio stories\" based on the families' experiences. To test the stories,\n      we are conducting a two-arm trial that includes intervention groups (20 people per\n      community) that listen to the radio stories and control groups (20 people per community)\n      that receive a brochure with similar information (N=120). Effectiveness and acceptability of\n      the program will be tested with pre-and post questionnaires.\n\n      Anticipated Results: Higher rates of satisfaction, increased knowledge, and intention to\n      change in participants receiving the radio stories, as compared to control group\n      participants, will indicate radio story program effectiveness and acceptability."
