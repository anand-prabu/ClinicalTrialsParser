  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the use of
      intravascular paclitaxel, in addition to standard therapy, for the treatment of
      arteriovenous dialysis access fistula stenosis.

      A fistulogram will be performed in standard fashion.  The diagnostic component will include
      evaluation of the inflow artery, arterial anastomosis and full length of the fistula vein or
      graft, plus venous return up to the heart.  The location, vessel size, lesion diameter and
      percent stenosis for each lesion will be recorded.   Enrollment and randomization will occur
      at this point.

      All patients will then receive standard therapy for their stenosis.  This will include
      intravenous heparin administered in a standard dose of 70 units/kg.  Lesions that respond
      poorly to angioplasty (&gt;30% residual stenosis after angioplasty treatment with 2 inflations)
      will be stented.  Stent selection will be based on clinical setting.  Initial stent
      treatment will utilize an uncovered nitinol stent.  Treatment of in-stent restenosis will
      include initial balloon angioplasty, and use of a covered stent (Viabahn, GORE, or Fluency,
      Bard).  Documentation of location and type of treatment for each lesion treated will be
      recorded.

      Once standard treatment is completed, the operating surgeon will be informed of the patient
      randomization: treatment (paclitaxel) or control.  For subjects assigned to treatment, the
      whole fistula vein outflow segment of the fistula will be treated with paclitaxel.

      A TAPAS infusion catheter will be used for all paclitaxel dose administrations. The volume
      of drug to be administered will be calculated by the length of the lesion and size of vessel
      to be treated.  After the full outflow vein segment is treated, the fistulogram is completed
      in the standard fashion. Prior to removal of the sheath, a final angiographic study of all
      areas treated is performed to document patency and lesion appearance.

      For the control group, instead of paclitaxel administration, a sham treatment period of 10
      minutes is allowed to elapse followed by the performance of the final completion angiogram.
      Any additional lesions identified with this study are then treated appropriately following
      standard technique.

      All patients will follow the same follow up evaluation schedule.

    <description>Standard treatment of all stenotic lesions will be carried out in the usual fashion.  Intravenous heparin will be administered in a standard dose of 70 units/kg.  Lesions that respond poorly to angioplasty (&gt;30% residual stenosis after angioplasty treatment with 2 inflations) will be stented.  Stent selection will be based on clinical setting.  Initial stent treatment will utilize an uncovered nitinol stent.  Treatment of in-stent restenosis will include initial balloon angioplasty, and use of a covered stent (Viabahn, GORE, or Fluency, Bard).
For this &quot;control&quot; group, no paclitaxel is administered.  The sham treatment is a period of 10 minutes that is allowed to elapse followed by the performance of a final completion angiogram to be labeled as &quot;PaciFIST Study Completion Angiogram.&quot;  Any additional lesions identified with this study are then treated appropriately following standard technique.</description>
