    <textblock>
      This study compares, by influenza type, the overall and cause-specific incidence rates of
      physician encounters, hospitalization and death following the diagnosis of a
      laboratory-confirmed influenza.  Multivariate models will be used to assess the effects of
      influenza type on clinical outcomes (e.g. hospitalization) while accounting for confounding
      by various characteristics.

    <textblock>
      Annual epidemics of influenza are an important public health problem globally and in Canada.
      Each year, 10-25% of the Canadian population become infected with influenza. Most of these
      infections are typically asymptomatic or associated with a mild self-limiting illness.
      However, influenza can cause severe illness leading to hospitalization and death, especially
      among the very young, the elderly and among those with underlying chronic conditions. It has
      been estimated that on average about 4,000 influenza-related deaths occur in Canada each
      year. In addition, the economic burden of influenza is significant because of the high
      direct costs associated with increased utilization of services and the indirect costs caused
      by school and work absenteeism.

      This project compares laboratory-confirmed cases of influenza A and B in terms of their
      epidemiology and clinical outcomes, and describes the comparative epidemiology of
      laboratory-confirmed influenza A and B cases in Manitoba over the period from 1990 to 2011.

      This analysis compares, by influenza type, the overall and cause-specific incidence rates of
      physician encounters, hospitalization and death following the diagnosis of a
      laboratory-confirmed influenza. It also describes multivariate models to assess the effects
      of influenza type on clinical outcomes (e.g., hospitalization) while accounting for
      confounding by demographic, socioeconomic, geographic and clinical (e.g., co-morbidity,
      immune status) characteristics.

      The study also assesses secular and seasonal trends in the incidence rates of influenza A
      and B cases in Manitoba during the period of 1990-2011, excluding the 2009 H1N1 pandemic
      period (April 2009-April 2010) and assesses whether these rates vary for different subsets
      of the population defined by demographic (e.g., age group, gender), socioeconomic,
      geographic (neighborhood of residence) and clinical (e.g., vaccination, presence of chronic
      conditions, immune status) characteristics.
