The Cardiac computed tomography (CT) shows the exact geometry of the\n      aortic annulus and help the physician to find the right position of the prosthesis during\n      the procedure. The hypothesis is that performing a cardiac CT before the TAVI could reduce\n      the number of vascular peripheral complication, the number of stroke and can minimize the\n      aortic regurgitation  during the follow up."
