Investigate whether pretreatment with microneedles enhances penetration of topical\n           aminolevulinic acid (ALA) that is marketed as Levulan\u00ae Kerasticks by DUSA\n           pharmaceuticals Inc.\n\n        2. Investigate whether pretreatment with microneedles can decrease the required incubation\n           times of the topical ALA prior to exposure to blue light photodynamic therapy."
