  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The recent dramatic increase in obesity has been linked to a reduction of dietary fibre
      intake. We hypothesized that supplementing the diet of overweight and obesity adults with
      pulse fibre will improve their metabolic status, chiefly defined as greater weight loss.
      Other metabolic health improvements may include improved glucose control and reduced
      inflammatory markers.

      The main objective of our study is to assess the effects of pulse fibre supplementation on
      weight loss in an overweight and obese adult population.

      Primary objective - To determine the effects of a 12 week intake of 15g/day of pea hull
      fibre on weight loss supported by body composition measures.

      Secondary objective - To measure glucose control and appetite regulation in overweight and
      obese adults consuming 15g/day of pea hull fibre compared to a placebo control with the use
      of plasma HbA1c and an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT).
