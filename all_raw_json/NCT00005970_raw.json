Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so\n      they stop growing or die. Monoclonal antibodies such as trastuzumab can locate tumor cells\n      and either kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal\n      cells. It is not yet known whether combination chemotherapy is more effective with or\n      without trastuzumab in treating breast cancer."

Compare the disease-free survival of women with HER-2-overexpressing node-positive or\n      high-risk node-negative breast cancer treated with doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide\n      followed by paclitaxel with or without trastuzumab (Herceptin).\n\n      II. Compare the cardiotoxic effects of these regimens in these patients.\n\n      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. Compare the overall survival of patients treated with these regimens.\n\n      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. Determine whether higher levels of shed extracellular domain or autoantibodies to HER-2\n      and HER-1 measured in the serum prior to treatment are prognostic for disease-free and\n      overall survival in these patients.\n\n      II. Determine whether the concordance of HER-2 overexpression is associated with\n      disease-free and overall survival in this patient population.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to nodal\n      status (0 vs 1-3 positive nodes by axillary nodal dissection vs 4-9 positive nodes by\n      axillary nodal dissection vs at least 10 positive nodes by axillary nodal dissection vs\n      positive sentinel node with no or negative axillary nodal dissection vs negative sentinel\n      node with no axillary nodal dissection vs node negative by axillary nodal dissection) and\n      receptor status (estrogen receptor [ER] or progesterone receptor [PR] positive vs other).\n      Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms.\n\n      ARM I*: Patients receive doxorubicin IV and cyclophosphamide IV over  20-30 minutes on day\n      1.  Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 4 courses.

NOTE: *Patients who completed paclitaxel on or\n      after October 25, 2004 may receive trastuzumab for a maximum of 52 weeks either concurrently\n      with paclitaxel or  following completion of paclitaxel treatment.\n\n      ARM II*: Patients receive doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and paclitaxel as in arm I.\n      Patients then receive trastuzumab (Herceptin\u00ae) IV over 30-90 minutes beginning on day 1 of\n      week 25 and continuing weekly for 52 courses in the absence of disease progression or\n      unacceptable toxicity. NOTE: *Patients who completed paclitaxel on or after October 25, 2004\n      may receive trastuzumab for a maximum of 52 weeks either concurrently with paclitaxel or\n      following completion of paclitaxel treatment.\n\n      ARM III: Patients receive doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide as in arm I.

Patients who  receive tamoxifen once daily for less than 4.5 years may\n      receive an aromatase inhibitor daily until they have received a  total of 5 years of\n      adjuvant hormonal therapy.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 4 years, and then\n      annually for 15 years or until disease progression."
