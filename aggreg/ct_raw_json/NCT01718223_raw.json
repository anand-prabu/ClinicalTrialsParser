Photodynamic therapy\n      uses a drug, such as temoporfin, that is absorbed by tumor cells. The drug becomes active\n      when it is exposed to light. When the drug is active, tumor cells are killed. Giving\n      photodynamic therapy using temoporfin before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce\n      the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed."
