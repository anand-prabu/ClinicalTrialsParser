To test this hypothesis, we use\n      a crossover in vivo experimental model in mild asthmatics and normal controls using a\n      state-of-the-art diesel exhaust exposure facility.\n\n      Participants took N-acetylcysteine (600 mg) or placebo capsules three times daily for six\n      days. On the final morning of supplementation, participants were exposed for 2 hours to\n      either filtered air or diesel exhaust (300 \u00b5g\u00b7m-3 of particulate matter smaller than 2.5\n      microns). Twenty-six non-smokers between 19-49 years were studied under three experimental\n      conditions (filtered air with placebo, diesel exhaust with placebo and diesel exhaust with\n      N-acetylcysteine) using randomized, double-blind, crossover design, with a two week minimum\n      washout between conditions. Methacholine challenge was performed pre-exposure (to determine\n      baseline airway responsiveness) and post-exposure (to determine the effect of exposure)."
