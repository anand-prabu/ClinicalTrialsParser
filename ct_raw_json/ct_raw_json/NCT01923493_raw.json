Setting: The study\n      will be performed at a University out-patient clinic specialized in Integrative Medicine,\n      with experience in the treatment of chronic pain.\n\n      Participants: 88 outpatients with chronic neck pain, who will be randomly allocated to two\n      groups (tuina, or no intervention (control)).\n\n      Intervention: Patients receive either six tuina treatments within 3 weeks or no additional\n      intervention.\n\n      Main outcome measure: The primary outcome is the mean neck pain intensity over the last\n      seven days on a visual analogue scale (Huskisson, 1974) (VAS, 0-100 mm, 0 = no pain, 100=\n      worst imaginable pain) after four weeks."
