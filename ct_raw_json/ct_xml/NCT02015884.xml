  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At the hospital, the attacks against health professionals are becoming commonplace, making
      working conditions difficult. The ophthalmological emergencies are a perfect testing ground
      to evaluate the effectiveness of a series of original actions to prevent the occurrence of
      violence against healthcare workers. The main objective is to measure the impact of an
      integrated prevention of the occurrence of antisocial behavior or attacks against the
      healthcare workers.

      The prevention program combines five interventions (steps): 1) a computer sorting algorithm
      and specific screens for calling patients in waiting rooms, 2) a clear signage to direct
      patients between waiting rooms, treatment rooms and administrative et medical offices, 3)
      Posts information on the activity of emergency services displayed on screens, in the waiting
      rooms, 4) a mediator/go-between/conciliator, 5) and a dummy surveillance camera.

      This is a time series study with alternating-month periods (4 months alternated for each
      step).

      All patients admitted to the ophthalmological emergency unit of a university hospital
      located in Lyon, France, are included in the study, from June 2013 to June 2015.
