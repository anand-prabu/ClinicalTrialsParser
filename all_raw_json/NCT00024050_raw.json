Peripheral stem cell transplantation may be able to replace\n      immune cells that were destroyed by chemotherapy.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of chemotherapy followed by peripheral\n      stem cell transplantation in treating patients who have myelodysplastic syndrome."

PBSC are selected for CD34+ cells.\n\n      Patients receive oral busulfan every 6 hours on days -7 to -4 and cyclophosphamide IV on\n      days -3 and -2. Allogeneic PBSC or bone marrow is infused on day 0.\n\n      As graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis, patients receive cyclosporine IV beginning on day\n      -1 and continuing orally twice daily (if feasible) until day 51 followed by a taper.\n      Patients also receive methotrexate IV on days 1, 3, 6, and 11.\n\n      Patients are followed through day 100, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually\n      thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years."
