  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase III, randomized, placebo controlled, blinded, parallel two arm, multicentre
      trial that will compare rivaroxaban 10mg daily with placebo in patients with symptomatic leg
      Superficial Vein Thrombosis (&gt;  or = 5cm) that otherwise would not initially be treated with
      anticoagulant therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with symptomatic superficial leg thrombosis will be randomized into two arms, a)
      rivaroxaban 10mg 1 tablet daily for 45 days or b) placebo to determine if rivaroxaban (10 mg
      once daily) is an effective and safe treatment for superficial vein thrombosis.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        -  Symptomatic Superficial Vein Thrombosis of the leg of â‰¥5 cm length (diagnosed
        clinically or with ultrasound)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Age  &lt;18 years

          -  Symptoms &gt;21 days

          -  Receiving an anticoagulant for another indication (example: atrial fibrillation) when
             Superficial Vein Thrombosis started.

          -  Superficial Vein Thrombosis already treated with &gt;1 dose of anticoagulant (example.
             fondaparinux or Low Molecular Weight Heparin).

          -  Planned treatment of Superficial Vein Thrombosis with a course of anticoagulant
             therapy.

          -  Another indication for anticoagulant therapy (example. Deep Vein Thrombosis,
             Pulmonary Embolism, atrial fibrillation).

          -  Judged to require immediate ligation of the saphenofemoral junction or stripping of
             thrombosed varicose veins.

          -  proximal Deep Vein Thrombosis or Pulmonary Embolism within the past 5 years.

          -  Superficial Vein Thrombosis associated with sclerotherapy or an intravenous canula.

          -  A high risk of bleeding as evidenced by any of the following:

               1. Active bleeding

               2. Bleeding within the past 30 days due to a cause that has not fully resolved.

               3. Known or expected thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of less than 80,000 x
                  10 9/L.

               4. History of ever having had spontaneous intracranial bleeding, or any
                  intracranial bleeding within the past 3 months.

               5. Receiving dual antiplatelet therapy (example. aspirin and clopidogrel).

          -  Elevated creatinine level is suspected and creatinine clearance has not been
             estimated, OR creatinine clearance (Cockcroft-Gault equation) of less than 30 ml/min.

          -  Clinically relevant hepatic disease (including Child-Pugh B and C) is known or
             suspected (example., associated with: International Normalized Ratio &gt;1.7; total
             bilirubin &gt;2 upper limit of normal; or Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or Aspartate
             aminotransferase (AST)  &gt;3 times upper limit of normal).

          -  Ongoing requirement for systemic treatment with azole-antimycotics (except
             fluconazole),  Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) -protease inhibitors, or strong
             Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inducers due to the potential interaction with
             rivaroxaban.

          -  Pregnant or lactating women, or at risk of becoming pregnant.

          -  Life expectancy less than 90 days

          -  Patient is unwilling or unable to comply with the protocol (example. unable to attend
             follow-up visits because of geographic inaccessibility).

          -  Participating in a competing clinical investigation and receiving any other
             investigational agent(s).
