However, these oral medications are also less expensive than biologic agents\n      and may be safer for use in some patients. The purpose of this study is to determine if\n      adding a topical psoriasis medicine, Taclonex topical suspension, will improve the severity\n      of psoriasis in patients already on methotrexate or acitretin and to determine if adding\n      this topical suspension will reduce the desire of such patients to switch to a biologic\n      agent to treat their psoriasis."
