Urine\n      samples will also be assessed for underlying infected cause of OAB using urinalysis,\n      microscopy and culture and cytokine assays (In collaboration with the University of Kent).\n      We hypothesize that Cystodistension has a therapeutic benefit to women with refractory OAB\n      and the there is an increase prevalence in chronic urinary infections with raised cytokines\n      in women with refractory OAB."
