The cesarean delivery rate in the United\n      States is around 30 percent. This is a number that continues to be increasing over the last\n      few decades and will continue to climb. Cesarean section is the most common surgery\n      performed in the United States. Each subsequent cesarean section put the mother and baby at\n      increased risk for postpartum hemorrhage, bowel and bladder injury, abnormal placentation,\n      febrile morbidity and death. The most common reason for a cesarean delivery is a repeat\n      cesarean delivery. One way to reduce this number is to prevent the first cesarean. The aim\n      of this study is to reduce the primary cesarean delivery rate, without increasing perinatal\n      morbidity."
