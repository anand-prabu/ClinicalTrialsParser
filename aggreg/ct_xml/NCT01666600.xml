  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with glioblastoma at first or second progression who have failed standard treatment
      that must have included radiochemotherapy with temozolomide and who are a candidate for a
      reirradiation can be included into the trial. In the phase I part the minimal tolerated dose
      (MTD)of BIBF 1120 in combination with radiotherapy will be investigated. Subjects in phase
      II will be randomised to receive reirradiation alone or reirradiation + 2 x MTD BIBF1120.

             radiotherapy (RT) for the brain tumour

          -  Previous irradiation therapy of the primary tumour with a maximal dose of 60 Gy; at
             least 8 months since the end of preirradiation

          -  If on steroids, stable or decreasing treatment with steroids within 5 days before
             treatment start

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  More than one RT of brain, prior first radiotherapy with more than 60 Gy

          -  HIV or hepatitis infection

          -  Pregnancy or breast feeding
