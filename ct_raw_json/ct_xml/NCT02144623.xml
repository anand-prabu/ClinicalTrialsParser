  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial includes patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, the most common kind of
      malignant lymphoma. Monoclonal antibodies directed against cluster of differentiation
      antigen 20  have improved treatment results in different forms of lymphomas; however in
      chronic lymphocytic leukemia treatment with monoclonal antibodies is less effective, and it
      has been suggested that this is depending on a lower expression of the cluster of
      differentiation antigen 20 protein on the chronic lymphocytic leukemia  cells.

      Valproate, an anticonvulsant drug, has been shown to increase the cluster of differentiation
      antigen 20  expression, and the rationale in this study is that an increasement of cluster
      of differentiation antigen 20 would make treatment with monoclonal antibodies in patients
      with chronic lymphocytic leukemia  more effective.
