    <textblock>
      Imvamune (licensed name of MVA being developed as a smallpox vaccine) has been tested in
      over 2,000 individuals and is on path for licensure. This study will be a Phase II to
      evaluate three different immunization schedules and two different modes of delivery. The
      study will look at condensed schedules.  Study will randomize subjects to one of four arms.

    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, randomized, open-label immunogenicity and safety study of different
      immunization schedules and delivery systems (syringe and needle vs. the Stratis™) in
      healthy, vaccinia-naïve adults 18 years to 40 years of age, inclusive.  Approximately 352
      subjects will be enrolled and randomized to one of four study arms. Study Arm A (N=88) will
      receive a two dose regimen of IMVAMUNE® (1x10^8 TCID50/0.5 mL per dose) via the SC route
      using a syringe and needle on Day 1 and 29. Study Arm B (N=88) will receive a two dose
      regimen of IMVAMUNE® (1x10^8 TCID50/0.5 mL per dose) via the SC route using a syringe and
      needle on Day 1 and 15. Study Arm C (N=88) will receive a two dose regimen of IMVAMUNE®
      (1x10^8 TCID50/0.5 mL) via the SC route using a syringe and needle on Day 1 and 22. Study
      Arm D (N=88) will receive a two dose regimen of IMVAMUNE® (1x10^8 TCID50/0.5 mL) via the SC
      route using the Stratis™ on Day 1 and 29. Immunogenicity assessments will be performed using
      ELISA and PRNT. Safety assessments will be done via solicited injection site and systemic
      reactions. Unsolicited AEs will be collected until 28 days post last injection and SAEs for
      the duration of the subjects' study participation. Safety laboratory assessments will be
      performed at baseline and 14 days after each vaccination. Primary outcome measures: For each
      subject, the peak PRNT will be defined as the highest titer among all available measurements
      post second vaccination; Occurrence of solicited local injection site reactions in subjects
      receiving vaccine via the Stratis™ compared to syringe and needle administration as
      collected on the memory aid and by in clinic assessment. Parent protocol to sub-study
