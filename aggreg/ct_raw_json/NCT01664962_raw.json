HSPE gene: Four polymorphic SNPs: rs4693608, rs11099592, rs6856901 and rs4364254 that\n           were found to be informative in the Ashkenazi Jewish population\n\n        2. TRPV1 gene: Two polymorphic SNPs: rs222747 and rs8065080.\n\n        3. NGF gene: A novel T to C SNP in the promoter region at position -198 (rs11102930) and\n           rs6330 which was found to be associated with anxiety-related personality traits and has\n           been suggested to may affect intracellular processing and secretion of NGF."
