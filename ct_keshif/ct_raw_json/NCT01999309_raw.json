            "textblock": "Rationale: Different lines of evidence now suggest that low grade inflammation in the\n      central nervous system is involved in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. These include the\n      altered risk of schizophrenia patients and their relatives for specific auto-immune\n      diseases, clinical similarities between the course of schizophrenia and auto-immune disease\n      and decreased prevalence of schizophrenia in men who have used Non-Steroidal\n      Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) or glucocorticosteroids for somatic disorders. Furthermore,\n      an infectious cause or trigger is suggested by the observed association between\n      schizophrenia and pre- and perinatal infections, as well as by seroconversion to certain\n      pathogens in patients with schizophrenia. On a cellular level, inflammation of the central\n      nervous system is suggested by an increased number of activated microglia cells in the\n      brains of patients with schizophrenia as visualized by positron electron tomography. In an\n      activated state, microglia cells can produce free radicals, pro-inflammatory components and\n      other neurotoxic substances, causing cell death in their proximity. The activation of\n      microglia cells provides a possible route by which an increased pro-inflammatory state in\n      the brain could cause increased gray matter loss and more severe negative and cognitive\n      symptoms. Although Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) have been shown to be able\n      to reduce symptoms in these patients, these drugs either have unfavourable cardiovascular\n      side effects or are otherwise not well tolerated. Moreover, patients with schizophrenia\n      already tend to have an increased cardiovascular risk. The combination of well-established\n      vascular protection and reduction of inflammation by simvastatin offers a highly attractive\n      potential to further improve the treatment of schizophrenia and related disorders.\n\n      Hypotheses: Daily treatment with 40mg simvastatin in addition to antipsychotic treatment\n      reduces the symptoms of schizophrenia, improves cognition and decreases the risk for\n      metabolic syndrome, as compared to placebo.\n\n      Objective: The primary objective of this trial is to investigate the proposed beneficial\n      effect of simvastatin as compared to placebo when given in addition to antipsychotic\n      medication. We expect lower symptom severity as measured with the Positive And Negative\n      Symptom Scale (PANSS) with an average of at least 7.5 points over the course of one year.\n      Secondary objectives are assessment of general functioning using the General Assessment of\n      Functioning (GAF), neurocognitive functioning with the BACS (Brief Assessment of Cognition\n      in Schizophrenia), presence and severity of movement disorders, lower severity of metabolic\n      syndrome as defined by the AHA/NHLB (American Heart Association/National Heart, Lung and\n      Blood Institute) and a shift in immunological parameters into the direction of\n      anti-inflammation.\n\n      Study design: Randomized placebo-controlled double-blind trial.\n\n      Study population: 250 men and women, between 18 and 50 years of age, diagnosed with\n      schizophrenia, schizoaffective or schizophreniform disorder (DSM-IV 295.*) or psychosis NOS\n      (not otherwise specified) (298.9). Duration of disease should be no more than three years.\n\n      Intervention: Patients will be randomized 1:1 to either 40 mg simvastatin or placebo daily,\n      in the form of identical tablets.\n\n      Main study parameters/endpoints: Primary outcome is change in total PANSS score from\n      baseline to end of treatment. Secondary outcomes will be the changes in GAF scores,\n      cognitive functioning, presence and severity of metabolic syndrome and movement disorders,\n      in addition to the measurement of various immunological biomarkers and depression symptoms.\n\n      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group\n      relatedness: Use of simvastatin implies that there is a risk of side effects, as all\n      lipid-lowering drugs carry the risk of negative effects. The number of patient visits will\n      be limited  and mainly requires time investment for a few physical examinations,\n      questionnaires and two cognitive testing sessions (around 10 hours per year in total).\n\n      Blood will be drawn at four occasions with negligible and known risks (e.g. irritation). The\n      burden and risks are acceptable while the benefits are expected to be considerable."
