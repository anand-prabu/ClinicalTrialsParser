When the healthy stem cells from a donor are infused into the patient they may help\n      the patient's bone marrow make stem cells, red blood cells, white blood cells, and\n      platelets.\n\n      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving combination chemotherapy followed\n      by donor bone marrow transplant or peripheral stem cell transplant works in treating\n      patients with hematologic cancer or genetic disorders."

Patients with a non-HLA-identical family member may also receive anti-thymocyte globulin\n      on days -4 to -1. Patients undergo allogeneic or syngeneic bone marrow or peripheral blood\n      stem cell transplantation on day 0. Patients receive graft-vs-host disease prophylaxis\n      comprising mycophenolate mofetil twice daily beginning on day -3, methylprednisolone\n      beginning on day 5 and continuing over 8 weeks, and cyclosporine IV or orally beginning on\n      day -3 and continuing until at least 6 months post-transplantation.\n\n      Patients are followed at 1, 3, and 6 months, and then at 1 year post-transplantation.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 52 patients will be accrued for this study within 5-6 years."
