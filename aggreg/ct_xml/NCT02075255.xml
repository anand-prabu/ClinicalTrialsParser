  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to confirm if benralizumab can reduce OCS dependence (after
      dose optimisation) in patients who are uncontrolled on high-dose ICS-LABA, and chronically
      dependent on OCS as part of their regular asthma controller regimen.

             hepatic, renal, neurological, musculoskeletal, infectious, endocrine, metabolic,
             haematological, psychiatric, or major physical impairment that is not stable in the

               -  Influence the findings of the studies or their interpretations

               -  Impede the patient's ability to complete the entire duration of study

             haematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis during screening/run-in period, which
             in the opinion of the Investigator, may put the patient at risk because of his/her
             participation in the study, or may influence the results of the study, or the
             patient's ability to complete entire duration of the study

          5. History of life-threatening asthma

          6. Asthma control reached at an OCS dose of ≤5mg during run-in/OCS optimization phase
