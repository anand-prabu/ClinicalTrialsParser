  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the safety and effects on the immune system of
      treatment with GSK2245035 in subjects who suffer from mild asthma and nasal symptoms caused
      by an allergy to pollen. In addition, the effect of treatment with GSK2245035 on  the body's
      allergic response in test situations will be explored. Approximately 20 subjects will
      receive GSK2245035 and 10 subjects will receive the dummy drug (placebo) during the study.
      Assignment of a subject to GSK2245035 or placebo will be done by chance, like flipping a
      coin. Neither the subjects nor the clinic staff will know whether a subject is being dosed
      with GSK2245035 or placebo during the course of the study. The study will include (a)
      Screening phase where the eligibility of subjects for enrolment will be assessed (b)
      Treatment phase during which subjects will receive either 8 nasal sprays of GSK2245035 80
      nanograms (ng) or a matching placebo once weekly for 8 weeks (each dose will be split
      between the two nostrils) (c) Follow-up period where any GSK2245035 induced changes to the
      immune system and the effect of treatment on the body's allergic response in test situations
      will be monitored. The maximum planned study duration for all subjects, including the
      screening, treatment and follow-up periods, is approximately 180 days.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Good general health, as determined by a responsible and experienced physician, based
             on a medical evaluation, including medical history, physical examination, laboratory
             tests and cardiac monitoring. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory
             parameters outside the reference range for the population being studied may be
             included only if the investigator agrees that the finding is unlikely to introduce
             additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures

          -  Body weight &gt;=45 kilograms (kg)

          -  Documented history of symptomatic pollen-driven allergic rhinitis and mild asthma for
             more than 2 years

          -  Positive skin allergy test (wheal &gt;=3 mm[millimeters]) or serum allergen-specific
             Immunoglobulin E (IgE) (&gt;=class 2) for pollen allergens, relevant to the area of the
             research unit, within a year from the study start

          -  Positive screening nasal allergen challenge, defined by a Total nasal symptoms score
             (TNSS) response of &gt;=5 (on a 12 point scale) and a decrease in Peak Nasal Inspiratory
             Flow (PNIF) of &gt;30%

          -  Positive screening inhaled methacholine provocation test, defined as a decrease of
             baseline forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) by 20% (PC20) with &lt;=16
             mg(milligrams)/(milliliter) mL methacholine

          -  Males and non-pregnant or lactating females between 18 and 65 years of age inclusive
             at the time of signing the consent form

          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of non-childbearing potential,
             defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy,
             or postmenopausal, defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea (in questionable
             cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt;40 million
             international units (MIU)/mL and estradiol &lt;40 picogram (pg)/mL (&lt;147 picomoles
             (pmol)/liter (L) is confirmatory). Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and
             whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the contraception
             methods with a failure rate of &lt;1% if they wish to continue their HRT during the
             study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of post-menopausal
             status prior to study enrollment. For most forms of HRT, at least 2-4 weeks should
             elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends on
             the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their post-menopausal status,
             they can resume use of HRT during the study without use of a contraceptive method

          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of child-bearing potential and
             has a negative early pregnancy test at screening, confirmed menses and/or a negative
             early pregnancy test within 10 days prior to the first dosing visit, a negative early
             pregnancy test before each dosing and agrees: to use one of the required
             contraception methods with a failure rate of &lt;1% starting at least 2 weeks prior to
             the start of dosing to sufficiently minimize the risk of pregnancy at that point. The
             subject must agree to use contraception until four days after the last dosing; or has
             only same-sex partners, when this is her preferred and usual lifestyle

          -  Male subjects with female partners of child-bearing potential must agree to use one
             of the contraception methods: Condom plus partner use of a required highly effective
             contraceptive (with a failure rate of &lt;1%); or Abstinence, defined as sexual
             inactivity consistent with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. Periodic
             abstinence (e.g. calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and
             withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. This criterion must be
             followed from the time of the first dose of study medication until four days after
             the last dosing

        Exclusion Criteria:

             and GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) medical monitor may pose additional risk factors

          -  Nasal conditions that according to the opinion of the investigator may affect the
             outcome of the study, i.e. nasal septal perforation, nasal polyps, other nasal
             malformations or history of frequent nosebleeds

          -  Respiratory tract infection within 4 weeks prior to the first dosing
