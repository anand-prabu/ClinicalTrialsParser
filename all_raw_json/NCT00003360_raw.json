            "textblock": "OBJECTIVES: I. Define the toxicity and determine the maximum tolerated dose of iodine I 131\n      humanized monoclonal antibody A33 (131I-huAb A33) in patients with advanced colorectal\n      cancer. II. Describe pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of 131I-huAb A33 by external\n      imaging in these patients. III. Determine the effect of human antihuman antibody response on\n      pharmacokinetics and targeting of 131I-huAb A33 in this patient population. IV. Determine\n      whether the dose planning methodology used here can adequately and safely be applied to\n      routine radioimmunotherapy planning.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients receive iodine I 131 humanized monoclonal antibody A33 (131I-huAb A33) by\n      IV infusion over 20 minutes every 6-8 days for up to 8 weeks (depending on dosage). Patients\n      receive a minimum of 6 weeks of treatments. In the absence of disease progression or\n      unacceptable toxicity, patients are retreated no sooner than 6 weeks after the previous\n      course. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of 131I-huAb A33 to determine the\n      maximum tolerated dose (MTD). The MTD is defined as the highest dose at which no more than 2\n      of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicity. Patients are followed for 6 weeks after the\n      last treatment.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: There will be 3-24 patients accrued into this study over 16 months."
