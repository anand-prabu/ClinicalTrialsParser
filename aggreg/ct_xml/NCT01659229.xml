      The investigators are comparing the range of movements the knees of patients who had total
      knee replacement surgery for knee osteoarthritis. In the study arm, the implant used was a
      Sigma Cruciate Retaining (CR) Press Fit Condylar (PFC) 150, which is a high flexion knee
      system designed to combine function with wear resistance. It can accommodate up to 150
      degrees of knee flexion. In the cohort arm, the implant used was the standard Sigma CR which
      can accommodate up to 120 degrees of flexion.

      Both sets of patients will undergo routine post-operative follow up in clinic. The study
      involves patients who had their surgery more than 2 years ago. We assess their range of
      movement using fluoroscopy. They are asked to perform lunges, squats and climbing up and
      down 3 steps. The fluoroscopic images are then analysed to assess their individual range of
      movements.
