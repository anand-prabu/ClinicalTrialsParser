Agree to remain in the study site1 for the PK measurements period.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          1. Known clinically significant allergy or hypersensitivity to drugs that, in the\n             opinion of the investigator, may affect the patient's safety\n\n          2. Have any clinically significant conditions that would interfere with the collection\n             or interpretation of the study results or would compromise the patient's health\n\n          3. Women of child bearing potential who do not use contraceptives, breastfeeding, or\n             pregnant women\n\n          4. Severe anaemia (haemoglobin <9 mg/dL)\n\n          5. In the judgment of the Investigator, is likely to be noncompliant or uncooperative\n             during the study, or unable to cooperate because of a language problem or poor mental\n             development\n\n          6.
