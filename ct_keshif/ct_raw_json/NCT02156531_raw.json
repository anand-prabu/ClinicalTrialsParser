Youth assigned to this arm will receive both the self-administered active CBM intervention and the telephone coach calls to deliver the Adherence Promotion (AP) procedures. AP procedures are intended to compensate for the important nonspecific 'scaffolding' provided by research staff when CBM has been traditionally delivered in laboratories. This includes technical assistance with use of the program, support/encouragement, motivational enhancement, and brainstorming solutions to barriers to regular sessions. The addition of AP to the 3rd arm of this trial attempts to recreate much of this nonspecific, yet likely important, support of in-person interventions, which we hypothesize will lead to greater participant adherence to the program and therefore better clinical outcomes."

            "textblock": "Research in the last fifteen years suggests that anxious individuals selectively attend\n      towards threatening information. Attention modification interventions for internalizing\n      adults have been developed to target cognition at this basic level; these programs have\n      demonstrated initial efficacy in attention bias and anxiety symptom reduction. To date,\n      there have been minimal published studies of attention modification in youths with clinical\n      levels of anxiety.\n\n      This study is a large randomized efficacy-effectiveness trial (N = 498) to test the benefit\n      of this low-cost, computerized attention modification intervention (Cognitive Bias\n      Modification (CBM) computer application) for anxiety disorders and symptomatology in youth\n      ages 12 to 17. This trial conducted will compare three intervention arms, all of which\n      include underlying treatment as usual (TAU). The investigators directly test the level of\n      clinical support (\"scaffolding\") needed to adequately deliver self-administered CBM to\n      anxious youth, a finding that will be key to preparing for future deployment-focused trials.\n      The investigators will compare an attention control version of the CBM program (Arm 1) to\n      two active versions of the CBM intervention that have varying levels of patient clinical\n      support: a self-administered CBM program that participants download and install on their\n      home computers (Self-Administered CBM-only; Arm 2), and the same CBM program paired with an\n      adherence promotion (AP) component delivered via brief telephone calls from study \"coaches,\"\n      including as needed, brief motivational enhancement and/or technical assistance\n      (Self-Administered CBM+AP; Arm 3).\n\n      The investigators expect that youth receiving CBM and CBM+AP will have improvement in\n      anxiety symptoms and functioning. The investigators will also complete a cost-effectiveness\n      analysis to examine potential costs offset by this intervention."

Our large sample allows for substantial variability on these characteristics. In addition, we will examine whether change in attentional bias mediates CBM effects and leads to improved anxiety, as posited by information-processing theories underlying the intervention. Finally, we will examine youth adherence to CBM, benchmarked against lab-based delivery of similar interventions (i.e., acceptable error rates). We will test whether the CBM+AP condition results in higher participant engagement and compliance (e.g., high completion rates, low error rates) compared to conditions without AP (Arm 3 vs. Arms 1 + 2) and assess whether these process variables are associated with outcomes.",
