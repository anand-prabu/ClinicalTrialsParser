Test whether the experimental combination of ABT-888 (veliparib) combined with TMZ\n      (temozolomide), compared to the control of placebo combined with TMZ, significantly extends\n      overall survival in newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patients with tumor\n      O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter hypermethylation.\n\n      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. Test whether the experimental treatment significantly extends progression-free survival.\n\n      II. Test whether the experimental treatment improves objective tumor response. III. Test\n      whether the experimental treatment is associated with significantly greater rates of grade 3\n      or higher adverse events.\n\n      IV. Evaluate the effect of the experimental treatment on overall survival, progression-free\n      survival, and objective tumor response for the subset of patients that have confirmed MGMT\n      promoter hypermethylation as determined by the central laboratory.\n\n      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. Evaluate the utility of dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) and diffusion weighted\n      imaging (DWI) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques in defining time to progression in\n      the setting of a large multi-institutional clinical trial.\n\n      II. Test the concordance between site-determined MGMT methylation status and central\n      laboratory determination of MGMT status.\n\n      III. Evaluate whether genetic or epigenetic alterations in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)\n      repair or replication genes are associated with overall survival, progression-free survival,\n      and objective tumor response.\n\n      IV. Test whether polymorphisms in MGMT, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1), or other DNA\n      repair proteins, are associated with overall survival, progression-free survival, objective\n      tumor response, or rates of grade 3 or higher adverse events.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\n      ARM I: Patients receive temozolomide orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-5 and veliparib\n      PO twice daily (BID) on days 1-7. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 6 courses in the\n      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      ARM II: Patients receive temozolomide as in Arm I and placebo PO BID on days 1-7. Treatment\n      repeats every 28 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable\n      toxicity.\n\n      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 3 years and\n      then every 6 months for 2 years."
