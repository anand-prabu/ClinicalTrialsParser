The study will be conducted in 3\n      steps. In Step 1 (screening phase), all adult participants visiting their gastroenterologist\n      (for any condition) within a 3 month period will be screened using the ANMA screening\n      worksheet. In Step 2A (diagnosis phase - during investigator chosen consecutive consultation\n      days), all the eligible participants will be required to complete a combination Diagnosis\n      Questionnaire to obtain a diagnosis of CC based on different criteria: self-defined,\n      investigator-judgement, ANMA tool, and ROME III criteria. Details about previous\n      examinations and demography will also be collected during Step 2A of the study, together\n      with Patient Assessment of Constipation Symptoms (PAC-SYM). Participants with a positive\n      response to the ANMA diagnosis tool will proceed to Step 2B. In Step 2B (documentation\n      phase), more information about the participant will be collected using the documentation\n      questionnaire: demography, medical history, history of CC, current symptoms of CC,\n      comorbidities, past and current medications for CC. The Patient Assessment of\n      Constipation-Quality of Life (PAC-QOL) scale will be used to assess participant's\n      satisfaction with their current treatment. Approximately 2000 participants will be screened\n      to yield approximately 400 participants with suspected chronic constipation for whom the\n      Diagnostic and Documentation Questionnaire will be filled in. Safety evaluations will\n      include assessment of adverse events and special reporting situations such as pregnancy."
