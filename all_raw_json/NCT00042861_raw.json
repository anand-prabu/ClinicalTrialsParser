Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from\n      dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining UCN-01 with chemotherapy may kill more tumor\n      cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combining UCN-01, fluorouracil, and\n      leucovorin in treating patients who have metastatic or unresectable solid tumors."

Courses\n      repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of 5-FU until the maximum tolerated dose\n      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 3\n      or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. The recommended phase II dose (RPIID)\n      is defined as the dose preceding the MTD. At least 6 additional patients are treated at the\n      RPIID.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24 patients will be accrued for this study within 16 months."
