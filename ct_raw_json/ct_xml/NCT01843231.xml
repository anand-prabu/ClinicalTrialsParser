    <textblock>
      This study is a multi-center, open/unblended study (3:1Treatment: Control) to evaluate the
      safety and effectiveness of the g-Cath EZ Suture Anchor Delivery Catheter as an early weight
      loss intervention compared to a diet and exercise control only.  Mean % Total Body Weight
      Loss [TBWL] in Treatment subjects versus that of Control subjects at 12 months is the
      primary endpoint.  The proportion of subjects achieving ≥ 5% TBWL at 12 months in the
      treatment group is a co-primary endpoint.

      This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the g-Cath EZ Suture Anchor
      Delivery Catheter as an early weight loss intervention compared to a diet and exercise
      control only.  The weight loss outcomes will be used to assess treatment effect. This study
      is a multi-center, open/unblinded, prospective randomized feasibility study (3:1Treatment:
      Control) study. Patients in the control group will be offered the opportunity to crossover
      to the treatment group at 12 months.
