Patients are stratified by\n      participating institution.\n\n      Patients are randomly assigned to 1 of 2 doses of oral dehydroepiandrosterone or placebo,\n      administered daily for a minimum of 7 months.  A prednisone taper is attempted each month in\n      patients with stable or improving disease.  Therapy continues until a successful prednisone\n      taper is achieved and sustained for at least 2 months, or until a maximum of 9 months.\n\n      Patients are followed for 1 year after entry."
