  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate gait when individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) are walking
      while talking to see how walking changes when challenged to perform a functional cognitive
      task simultaneously. By looking at walking alone and walking with varying cognitive loads
      the investigators will be able to determine motor and cognitive factors vulnerable to
      interference in PD. Each is important to understand so that training can address components
      of walking that become impaired when someone is distracted by a common cognitive task and so
      that the intensity of treatment matches the level of task difficulty. Using this initial
      data, the investigators will establish a protocol to improve walking taking into account the
      unique features of PD, including bradykinesia, freezing of gait, stiffness, and problems
      with memory and attention. The investigators will evaluate the potential for this treatment
      to improve walking and improve or maintain cognitive abilities necessary to multitask.

    <measure>Spatiotemporal measures of gait across conditions and over time.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline testing at day one of study; follow-up testing at three time periods: 4-5 weeks after baseline (immediate post-training); 5-6 weeks (one week post-training); and 9-10 weeks after baseline (one month post-training)</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Changes in gait parameters are a key measure of the difficulty of performing two tasks at once. Decreases in gait speed, increased time in double support (two feet on the ground) and stopping while talking have been linked to increased disability and risk for falls.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in cognitive performance measured with serial sevens.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (day one); week 4-5 (immediate post 4 week training program); 5-6 weeks (one-week post-training); 9-10 weeks (one month post-training)</time_frame>

    <description>Participants will count backward by sevens from a digit between 90 and 100.  The ability to perform the task will be used as a measure of cognitive trade-off relative to walking performance.</description>

    <description>Individuals will come in for a single visit to perform all tasks / conditions.  Measurements will be taken of spatial and temporal features of walking with and without a secondary task.  In addition, cognitive tests of memory and attention will be performed.  Outcomes will narrow measures to those most likely to show clinically significant change.</description>
