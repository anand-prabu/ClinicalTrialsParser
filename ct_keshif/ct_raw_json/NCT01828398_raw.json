The training session, which includes multiplanar, repetitive and target reaching movements, will be given 5 times a week for 2 weeks(REO Therapy System; Motorika, Medical LTD, Israel). Each session will last about 30 minutes.\nTranscranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) will be administered as follows. The anode will be placed on the primary motor cortex (M1) of the affected hemisphere and the cathode on the contralateral M1 area. The direct current is transmitted through a pair of sponge electrodes, with a surface of 35 cm2 (7x5), soaked in saline solution and, it is generated by a constant current stimulator, with rechargeable batteries (Brainstim, EMS, Italy). This continuous stimulation lasted 30 minutes, with an intensity of 1mA."
