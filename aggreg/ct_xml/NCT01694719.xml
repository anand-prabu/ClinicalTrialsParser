  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the potential effects of a cognitive training
      program when combined with a particular form of psychotherapy (behavioral activation
      therapy) for depression. Behavioral activation therapy targets changes in behavior as a
      method for improving a depressed individual's thoughts, feelings, and overall quality of
      life. This study is designed to test whether a computerized brain exercise called cognitive
      control training can enhance the effects of a 5-session behavioral activation therapy
      program. CCT has been shown to reduce depressive symptoms in two other studies, but it has
      not yet been combined with behavioral activation therapy. The investigators hypothesize that
      individuals assigned to the behavioral activation plus cognitive control training condition
      will demonstrate reduced depressive symptoms from pre to post treatment compared with those
      assigned to the behavioral activation plus computerized control condition.  The
      investigators hypothesize that these gains will be maintained at one-month follow up.
