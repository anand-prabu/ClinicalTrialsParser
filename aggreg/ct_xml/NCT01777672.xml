  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oropharyngeal dysphagia (OD) is a major complaint among many patients with stroke and causes
      severe complications. There is no specific treatment for these patients. Impaired swallow
      response is caused by a delay in the timing of oropharyngeal reconfiguration with delayed
      airway protection. Swallow response is initiated by sensory afferent fibers in the
      oropharynx and cerebral cortex reaching the central swallowing pattern generator (CPG) in
      the medulla oblongata and brainstem motor nuclei. Hypothesis: Stimulation of pharyngeal
      sensory afferent fibers through TRPV1 receptors and electrical stimuli might enhance the
      stimulation of the CPG and speed the swallow response. Long-term treatment of OD will
      improve clinical outcome of stroke patients. Aim: To assess the effect of TRPV1 agonists
      (capsaicin) and that of sensorial pharyngeal electrical stimulation (intrapharyngeal and
      transcutaneous) on VFS signs and swallow response at 3, 6 and 12 months after treatment in
      stroke patients with established OD. To compare the clinical effect of classical
      rehabilitation strategies with that of these new afferent sensorial neurostimulation
      strategies in terms of nutritional status parameters, incidence of aspiration pneumonia
      and/or low respiratory tract infection, quality of life, and mortality. Methods: Clinical
      screening of OD with the volume-viscosity swallow test and assessment by VFS and
      quantitative measurements of swallow response. Randomized controlled trial assessing the
      effect of standard rehabilitation with that of afferent sensorial neurostimulation
      strategies.

    <description>The efficacy of each treatment will be assessed by VFS in each patient after the treatment and at the end of the follow-up period, considering Rosenbek scale and measures of oropharyngeal swallow response including oropharyngeal reconfiguration, timing and extent of hyoid motion and bolus propulsion force of the tongue. Clinical outcome also evaluated are episodes of aspiration pneumonia and low respiratory tract infections, nutritional status, complications and clinical symptoms experimented during one year of follow-up and mortality rates and cause of death.
Participating clinicians will be instructed to register and describe all serious adverse events (SAE) occurred during the study and report them on a specific form within 24 hours. The guidelines for SAE reporting to the Ethical Committee and competent authorities will be followed.</description>

    <description>Patients in this group will receive recommendations from their healthcare providers about bolus volume and viscosity adaptation for fluids, dietary and nutritional adjustments (liquids and solids) of bolus volume and viscosity/texture. Before leaving each hospital they will also learn basic rehabilitation strategies for OD including swallow postures, compensatory manoeuvres and oropharyngeal rehabilitation exercises and oral hygiene to follow at home.</description>
