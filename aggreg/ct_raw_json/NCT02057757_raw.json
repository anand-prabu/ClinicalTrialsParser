NTZ is a medication that is approved in the United States and\n      Mexico to treat gastrointestinal parasitic diseases. This study will evaluate the use of NTZ\n      to treat SARI. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, effectiveness, and\n      tolerability of NTZ, in combination with standard care, in treating SARI in people who are\n      hospitalized.\n\n      Participants will be hospitalized and study entry assessments will include medical\n      assessments, blood collection, and a nasopharyngeal swab or wash. Participants will then be\n      randomly assigned to receive NTZ or placebo for 5 days. Participants younger than 12 years\n      will receive an oral suspension formulation of NTZ or placebo; participants 12 years and\n      older will receive NTZ or placebo tablets. All participants will also receive standard of\n      care treatment for acute severe viral respiratory infections, which may include antibiotics\n      and/or treatment for influenza. They will be discharged from the hospital based on their\n      doctors' recommendations. Participants will record their temperature and symptoms in a daily\n      diary, which will be reviewed by study staff during study visits. Follow-up visits will\n      occur on Days 3, 7, 14, and 28, and may occur as inpatient or outpatient visits. These\n      visits may include the same assessments that occurred at baseline, as well as physical\n      examinations, depending on the visit. Participants who are still hospitalized at Day 28 will\n      be followed by study staff until they are discharged from the hospital."
