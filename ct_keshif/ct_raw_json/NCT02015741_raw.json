Nowadays it can be evaluated by several monitoring methods, derived\n      from electroencephalogram analysis, namely the Bispectral Index (Aspect Medical Systems,\n      Newton, USA). A new modality is currently under development: the NeuroSENSE (Cleveland\n      Medical Devices Inc., Cleveland, OH 44103, USA).\n\n      Use of such devices is discussed in aged patients. The purpose of this study is to compare\n      Bispectral Index and NeuroSENSE during awake periods and during natural sleep."
