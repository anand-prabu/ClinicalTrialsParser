      Determine wether 24 months treatment with everolimus prolongs progression free survival rate
      (based on a central assessment) after embolisation ou chemoembolisation for liver
      metastases.

        -  H0 a 24 months progression free survival rate less than 35% is unacceptable

        -  H1 a 24 months progression free survival rate greater than 35% would show that
           everolimus treatment is beneficial, the expected 24 months progression free survival
           rate being 50%

    <description>Hepatic progression free survival rate as defined in RECIST 1.1 (with death considered as progression) during the 24 months of treatment with everolimus (appendix 3).
Progression-free survival rate (PFS) (based on the central assessment) according to RECIST v1.1 according to RECIST v1.1 will be defined as the time from the date of inclusion to the date of hepatic progression or death (due to any cause). For patients who are alive with no hepatic progression, it will be defines as the time from the date of inclusion and the date of the last tumor assessment.</description>
