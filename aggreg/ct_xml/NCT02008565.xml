  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goals of this trial are to compare the use of loperamide to oral placebo and to compare
      the use of anal sphincter exercise training with biofeedback to usual care (educational
      pamphlet) in the treatment of women suffering from fecal incontinence (FI). We will test the
      following null hypotheses:

        1. there is no difference in outcomes between women randomized to loperamide and women
           randomized to  oral placebo for treatment of FI;

        2. there is no difference in outcomes between women randomized to anal sphincter exercises
           with biofeedback and women randomized to usual care (educational pamphlet) for FI
           treatment;

        3. there is no difference between women randomized to both treatments together and women
           randomized to either FI treatment alone; and

        4. there is no correlation between anal manometry measurements and digital anal squeeze
           strength or measures of FI severity and bother.

    <description>Participants randomized to the loperamide treatment group will begin with 2mg of loperamide per day. The participant will be administered the Patient Global Symptom Control rating scale (PGSC) to determine dose escalation. The participant will be instructed to either maintain the current drug dose if PGSC is 4 or 5, or dose escalate if PGSC is 1-3. Participants who report inadequate control of stool leakage on the PGSC will be instructed to increase the daily dose of loperamide by 2 mg up to a maximum of 8 mg per day (1-4 capsules). Bothersome adverse events and resulting dose reduction will be based exclusively on the result of the PGTS. The participant will be instructed to reduce the current drug dose if PGTS is 4 or 5. The daily dose will be decreased by 2mg  to a minimum of 2mg every other day. If they have a PGSC score of 1-3 (inadequate control of stool leakage) combined with a PGTS score of 4-5 (bothersome side effects), the participant will discontinue the study medication.</description>

    <description>Subjects randomized to anal exercises with biofeedback will receive a formal anal exercises training program designed by experts in the use of manometry and biofeedback for fecal incontinence. The intent is to provide a simple program that can be easily applied in an office setting with minimal subject burden. Subjects will attend six separate anal exercises with biofeedback sessions with trained personnel over a 12-week period for the 24-week study. Sessions will include introduction, standard patient education, and exercises using anal manometry-assisted biofeedback introducing concepts such as shaping, generalization and termination. The protocol will include strength and sensory training including urge resistance training. During the final twelve weeks, subjects will perform anal exercises on their own. The sessions with interventionists will occur every other week for 12 weeks (total 6 supervised sessions).</description>
