  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label, multicenter, global Phase Ib study will evaluate the safety, to lerability
      and pharmacokinetics of MEHD7945A in combination with cobimetinib (GD C-0973) in patients
      with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors that carry a KRAS mutation. The study
      comprises a dose-escalation and an indication-specifi c cohort expansion stage. Cohorts of
      patients will receive MEHD7945A intravenous ly every two weeks and escalating doses of oral
      cobimetinib for 21 consecutive d ays followed by 7 days off (28-day cycle). Study treatment
      may be continued unti l disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Locally advanced or metastatic solid KRAS-mutant tumors, for which standard therapies
             do not exist, have proven ineffective or intolerable or are considered inappropriate

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1

          -  Evaluable disease or disease measurable per modified RECIST v1.1

          -  Consent to provide archival tumor tissue for biomarker testing

          -  Additionally,  for patients who are considered for enrollment into the indication
             specific expansion cohorts in Stage 2,  the current cancer must be either KRAS-mutant
             colorectal cancer (CRC) or KRAS-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of prior significant toxicity from another MEK pathway inhibitor or
             combination of another MEK and EGFR inhibitor requiring discontinuation of treatment

          -  Previous treatment with a combination of a MEK inhibitor with an EGFR inhibitor
             (applies only to the indication specific expansion cohorts in Stage 2)

          -  Allergy or hypersensitivity to components of the cobimetinib formulations

          -  History of severe (Grade 3 or 4) allergic or hypersensitivity reaction to therapeutic
             antibodies that required discontinuation of therapy

          -  History of interstitial lung disease (ILD)

          -  Known severe ulcer disease

          -  History of or evidence of retinal pathology on ophthalmologic examination that is
             considered a risk factor for neurosensory retinal detachment, CSCR, RVO, or
             neovascular macular degeneration.

        Patients will be excluded if they currently have either of the following conditions which
        have been identified as risk factors for CSCR:

          -  Uncontrolled glaucoma with intraocular pressure &gt;21 mmHg

          -  Grade &gt;/= 3 hypertriglyceridemia.
