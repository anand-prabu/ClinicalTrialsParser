The skin prick test will be\n             considered positive if the test results in a wheal major diameter of at least 3 mm or\n             an area at least 7 mm2. Positive skin prick test results are valid if performed\n             within one year prior to the inclusion of the subject in the study\n\n          -  A positive test for specific IgE to Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (CAP-RAST major or\n             equal to 2). IgE results are valid if performed within one year prior to the\n             inclusion of the subject in the study.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  Immunotherapy in the past 5 years with a Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus allergen\n             extract or other mites allergen extracts known to interfere with the allergen to be\n             tested, due to a high degree of cross-reactivity.\n\n          -  Use of drugs that may interfere with the skin reactions (e.g., antihistamines). See\n             Appendix 1 of the protocol.\n\n          -  Treatment with any of the following medications: oral tricyclic or tetracyclic\n             antidepressants or IMAOs, beta-blockers, chronic use of corticosteroids or use of\n             oral or parenteral corticosteroids in repeated and intermittent patterns (10 mg/daily\n             of prednisone or equivalent).\n\n          -  Women who are pregnant or period of breastfeeding and women with a pregnancy test\n             positive during the visit 2, prior to the prick test.\n\n          -  Dermographism affecting the skin area at the test site at either study visit.\n\n          -  Atopic dermatitis affecting the skin area at the test site at either study visit.\n\n          -  Urticaria affecting the skin area at the test site at either study visit.\n\n          -  Diseases of the immune system relevant clinically, both autoimmune and\n             immunodeficiencies.\n\n          -  Serious diseases not controlled that may increase the risk for the safety of the\n             subjects involved in this study, including, but not limited to the following: heart\n             failure, uncontrolled or severe respiratory diseases,endocrine diseases, clinically\n             relevant kidney or liver diseases or hematological diseases.\n\n          -  Participation in any other clinical trial within 30 days (or 5 times the biological\n             half-life of the research of the study product, whichever is longer) prior to the\n             inclusion of the subject in this clinical trial.\n\n          -  Patients with diseases or conditions that limit the use of adrenaline (heart disease,\n             severe hypertension...)\n\n          -  Severe psychiatric, psychological or neurological disorders\n\n          -  Abuse of alcohol, drugs or medicines in the previous year."
