Recent data established key roles of different specific lipid mediators in the\n      endogenous counter-regulation of inflammation and activation of resolution. Only little is\n      known about kinetics of these specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators during acute\n      allergic inflammation. Therefore, the primary propose of our study is to characterize the\n      temporal evolution of cellular inflammation and specific lipid mediators after allergen\n      challenge."
