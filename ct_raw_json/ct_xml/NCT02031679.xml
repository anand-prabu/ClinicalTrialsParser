    <textblock>
      We are recruiting for a chronic hives study.  This research is being done to test whether an
      investigational drug called AZD1981 may be helpful for treating people with Chronic
      Idiopathic Urticaria who continue to have symptoms despite taking antihistamines. The word
      &quot;investigational&quot; means that AZD1981 is not approved for marketing by the Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA).  The FDA is allowing the use of AZD1981 in this study.

      People with chronic hives lasting for at least 6 months and without a known cause may join.
      The study involves 6 visits over 8 weeks.  Approximately 48 participants expected to take
      part in this study at the Johns Hopkins Asthma and Allergy Clinic.  All participants will be
      treated with the study medication and/or placebo for 8 weeks.

      The results of this trial may have a benefit others with Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria who
      don't respond well to antihistamines by generating experience and data to support the design
      of a larger, multicenter trial investigating the efficacy of AZD1981 in treating
      antihistamine refractory CIU.

    <description>The safety of AZD1981 will be assessed using the following outcome measures: incidence and severity of treatment-emergent adverse events and serious adverse events, clinical laboratory measures, and vital signs. In particular we will measure CBC's with differential at baseline and week 4 and liver function tests every 2 weeks based on past trial experience of dose-related toxicity.</description>
