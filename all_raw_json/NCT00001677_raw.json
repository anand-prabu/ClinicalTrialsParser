In this randomized,\n      double-blind, placebo controlled trial, patients will be maintained on oral MTX at 17.5\n      mg/week to which either placebo or subcutaneous fludarabine at 30 mg/m(2) daily for three\n      consecutive days per month will be added for four months.  The fludarabine (or placebo)\n      treatment period will be followed by two months of follow-up, at which time patients will be\n      evaluated for response.  Patients will be monitored for adverse effects/tolerability,\n      disease activity, and changes in synovial volume as measured by magnetic resonance imaging\n      (MRI).  Additionally synovial biopsies will be obtained before and after treatment for\n      investigation of infiltrating cell numbers and phenotypes, cytokine profiles, Th1 versus Th2\n      responses, and angiogenesis."
