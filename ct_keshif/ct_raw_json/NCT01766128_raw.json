A total of 60 patients with early Parkinson disease who meet the study\n      criteria will be enrolled and randomized into two groups alternately based on their visit\n      date. Demographic data, Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), modified\n      Hoehn&Yahr and modified Schwab&England activities of daily living scale will be determined\n      and registered for each patient. Patients of group A will be treated by zonisamide 50mg/d\n      for 12 months and the other group will be treated by placebo for the same time. Primary\n      endpoint is occurrence of parkinsonian symptoms which interfere with patients' daily\n      activity or cause psychosocial embarrassment. The mentioned scores will be registered every\n      2 months for both groups by blinded neurologist and also regular blood test will be\n      performed to prevent drug adverse events."
