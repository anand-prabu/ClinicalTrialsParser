    <description>The first three patients will be enrolled at Dose Level 1. If dose level 1 is not found to be tolerable, then the next cohort will be enrolled at dose level -1. If dose level -1 is not found to be tolerable, then the study may be terminated based on discussions with the sponsor and the combination may be deemed intolerable. If 0/3 patients or 1/6 patients experience a DLT on dose level 2, this will be the RP2D.</description>

    <description>Response Rate (CR+PR, RECIST 1.1). Response rate (RECIST 1.1) will be determined as the proportion of evaluable patients who have complete response or partial response defined by the RECIST 1.1 criteria with a one-sided 90% confidence interval (CI) and a two-sided 95% CI provided.</description>

    <description>Patients will be treated with the combination therapy of MEK162 and imatinib. In the phase Ib portion of the study, patients will receive imatinib at 400 mg once daily and MEK162 at the standard 3+3 escalation doses. In the phase II portion of the study, patients will receive imatinib at 400 mg once daily (standard of care first line imatinib dose) and MEK162 at the RP2D twice daily. One cycle is 28 days. If no progression of the tumor is seen, patients will continue on therapy. Those patients who have progression of disease will proceed directly to second line therapy as per standard of care.</description>

             progressed on imatinib.

          -  In the Phase II portion, patients must be newly diagnosed or treatment naïve, or have
             been off adjuvant imatinib therapy for at least 3 months.

             ≤ 1.5 mg/dL, Total Serum Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN), Serum AST
             (SGOT) and/or ALT (SGPT) ≤ 2.5 x ULN (or ≤ 5.0 x ULN if considered due to tumor)ANC ≥
