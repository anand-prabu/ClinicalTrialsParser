      The purpose of this study is:

      • To obtain additional data on therapeutic efficacy of Anaferon for children in the
      treatment of influenza and acute respiratory viral infections in children
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study shall enroll outpatient subjects of both sexes aged 3-12 years with clinical
      manifestations of influenza/Acute Respiratory Viral Infections (ARVI), including fever of at
      least 38.0 С, who sought medical aid within the first day of the illness onset.

      Тhe doctor shall collect medical history information, perform an objective examination,
      record the concomitant therapy, and obtain nasal swab specimens for a rapid diagnostic
      influenza test. If the swab is positive, the doctor shall obtain swab specimens from the
      nasal cavity and oropharynx (nasopharyngeal swab) for a subsequent real time reverse
      transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to determine the viral load of influenza A
      and/or B virus. If the swab is negative for influenza the doctor shall collect a
      nasopharyngeal swab for a subsequent PCR test for other respiratory viruses.

      If inclusion criteria are met and non-inclusion criteria are absent at visit 1 (Day 1), the
      patient will be enrolled in the trial and randomized into one of the two groups: group 1
      patients will take Anaferon for children® following a 5-day regimen; group 2 patients will
      receive Placebo using the Anaferon for children® 5-day regimen. The parent/adopter of
      patient will receive a diary where they should record the child's axillary temperature data
      in the morning and at bed time, and score the severity of symptoms.

      The subject will be monitored for 14 days (screening, randomization - 1 day, treatment - 5
      days, follow-up − 1 day; late-scheduled &quot;telephone&quot; visit − day 14).

      At Visits 2-4, the doctor will document objective examination data; obtain nasopharyngeal
      swabs from subjects with positive influenza tests for subsequent real time RT-PCR to
      determine the viral load and its reduction in the course of treatment; monitor the
      prescribed and concomitant therapy, and check the patient's diary data. The &quot;telephone&quot;
      visit will be made to elicit information from the parents regarding the patient's general
      health, presence/absence of secondary bacterial/viral complications, and use of
      antibacterial drugs.
