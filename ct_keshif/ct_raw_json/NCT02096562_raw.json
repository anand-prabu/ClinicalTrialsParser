Group A will be\n      instructed to wear compression stockings for 24 hours on the first two postsurgical day,\n      afterwards at least for 8 hours a day.\n\n      Preoperatively the investigators are going to determine the volume and circumference of both\n      legs using the Bodytronic 600 by Bauerfeind. Subsequently the measurement will be repeated\n      on the first, forth and tenth postsurgical day. The investigators are going to measure the\n      range of motion, also the patients of both groups will be asked to mark pain and tension on\n      a visual analog scale and write down the amount of time they have been lying, sitting and\n      standing each day. Group A will document the amount of time for how long they were wearing\n      compression stockings each day."
