            "textblock": "Major depression, plus other chronic illness such as diabetes, coronary heart disease and\n      heart failure is common among low-income, culturally diverse safety net care patients.\n      Unfortunately, many of these patients are uncomfortable about either asking their doctor\n      questions about their illness and treatment options and their illness self-care or informing\n      their doctors about their treatment preferences. Lack of strong engagement with medical\n      providers occurs because patients believe they lack the knowledge to ask questions or to\n      understand and follow recommended self-care and their concern that their medical provider\n      lacks understanding of their treatment preferences. These factors often result in patient\n      worry, poor adherence to prescribed treatment, and worsening illness status and even early\n      death. The study will be conducted by a university, the Los Angeles County Department of\n      Health Services (DHS) and a community health worker organization research team. The study\n      will be conducted within two DHS Patient-Centered Medical Home clinics, with each patient\n      having a designated primary care team of physician, nurse, social worker and medical\n      assistant. Study patients with major depression and other illnesses face numerous self-care\n      management barriers: managing concurrent symptoms (depression, pain, anxiety etc.) and\n      cultural influences (depression stigma, diet), difficulty in navigating primary and\n      specialty doctor and treatment plans, while at the same time experiencing daily social and\n      economic stress. The randomized comparative effectiveness study will recruit 350 patients\n      with major depression and a concurrent chronic illness (i.e., diabetes, heart failure,\n      coronary heart disease) from two DHS PCMH community health centers. To enhance\n      patient-centered research community partnerships, patients will be provided A Helping Hand\n      (AHH) in which a community organization- based promotora aims to activate patient-centered\n      depression self-care training and practical assistance to: a) improve and personalize major\n      depression self-care (e.g., medication or psychotherapy preference, treatment adherence,\n      fatigue, pain, diet, activity, stress management, family/caregiver communication); b)\n      activate patient-provider communication, clinic appointment keeping and treatment\n      coordination; and c) and facilitate patient navigation and receipt of needed community\n      resources. AHH aims to improve patient self-care management and patient-provider care\n      management relationships among underserved low-income patients, who must simultaneously cope\n      with major depression and chronic co-morbid physical illness. Study objectives aim to\n      determine: 1) whether community health worker promotora care management training improves\n      patient-centered outcomes, such as self-care need and management, treatment adherence,\n      symptom improvement, and care satisfaction over the usual team care; 2) depression symptom\n      improvement; and 3) patient hospitalizations and ER visits frequency."
