      Rationale:

      Anal cancer incidence has increased dramatically in HIV (human immunodeficiency
      virus)-positive men. Like cervical cancer, anal cancer is causally linked to infections with
      high-risk papillomaviruses, and is preceded by precursor lesions: anal intraepithelial
      neoplasia (AIN). Several treatment options exist for AIN, but success rates are
      disappointingly low. An alternative strategy might be therapeutic HPV (human papilloma
      virus) vaccination. In women with vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN), a condition with a
      comparable pathogenesis, therapeutic vaccination with HPV-16 viral oncoproteins E6 and E7,
      was well tolerated, and proved to be effective.

      Objective:

      The objective of the current proposal is to assess, in a phase 1/2 study, the safety and
      efficacy of this synthetic vaccine SLP-HPV-01® in HIV+ men with CD4 counts &gt; 350 x 10E6/l
      and intra-anal high-grade, HPV16 positive AIN, who failed on previous treatment.

      Study population:

      HIV-positive MSM (men who have sex with men) with a CD4 count &gt; 350 cells/ul with
      HPV16-induced intra-anal high-grade AIN (grade 2-3) that was resistant to, or recurred after
      conventional cauterization or other forms of local treatment.

      Study design:

      The first phase of the study is a dose-response study, with 3 different dosage schedules
      (1,5,10; 5,10,20; and 10,20,40 μg of SLP-HPV-01®, administered intradermally with a
      three-week interval), each dosage schedule with or without the co-administration of
      pegylated interferon-α (Pegintron 1 μg/kg s.c.) at the day of vaccine administration. Each
      vaccination schedule is to be tested in 5 patients.

      The vaccination schedule that induces in HIV-positive MSM the best HPV16-specific response
      compared to that of the women with VIN in our previous study, is considered the optimal
      schedule. The size of this dose group will be increased to a total of 20 patients by
      treating an additional 15 patients.

      Intervention:

      Patients will be vaccinated 3 times with a 3-week interval with the SLP-HPV-01® vaccine.

      Endpoints:

      The primary clinical end points will be both toxicity/ safety, and the regression of the
      lesions at 3, 6 and 12 months, as assessed by HRA (high resolutions anoscopy), with biopsies
      taken of lesion sites.

      Secondary endpoints are regression of lesions at 18 months and HPV16-specific immunity in
      blood will be measured: i.e. ELISPOT (IFNg) for ex-vivo detection of antigen-specific
      responses and multiparametric intracellular cytokine/extracellular activation marker
      staining to determine the type (CD4+ and/or CD8+) and function (activation status and/or
      cytokines) of T-cells that respond.

    <description>Monitoring for spontaneous adverse events and injection-site reactions will be done weekly for three weeks after each vaccination. Clinical assessments and laboratory tests (routine hematology and chemistry) will be performed before the second and third vaccination and thereafter every 3 months for a total of 18 months of follow-up. Adverse events are graded according to version 3.0 of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), which grades events on a scale of 1 to 5, with higher grades indicating greater severity.</description>

    <description>High resolution anoscopy is performed to monitor the AIN lesions. Biopsies will be obtained of suspected lesions. Complete response is defined as histological resolution of AIN, partial response is defined as regression from high grade to low grade AIN. In case of persisting high grade AIN, a partial response is defined as a decrease in lesion size of 50% or more.</description>

    <description>In order to assess the systemic changes in immunity, which are induced by vaccination we will examine venous blood samples by using peripheral blood lymphocytes that are tested by a set of complementary T-cell assays: i.e. proliferation (LST), cytokine production (IFNg, TNFa, IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, and IL-2) as well as by ELISPOT (IFNg) for ex-vivo detection of antigen-specific responses and by multiparametric intracellular cytokine/extracellular activation marker staining to determine the type (CD4+ and/or CD8+) and function of T-cells that respond.
A vaccine-induced response is defined as a 3-fold increase compared to the pre-vaccination result.</description>
