      This is a Phase II, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-way crossover study to
      evaluate the safety, tolerability, and clinical activity of a new, dry powder for inhalation
      formulation of ASM-024 administered twice daily for 14 days to patients with GOLD-2 or
      GOLD-3 COPD.
