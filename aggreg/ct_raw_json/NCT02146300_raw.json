In addition to this, our\n      intention is  to clarify the effect of the facial mask on the breathing.\n\n      The allergic and control subjects undergo nasal provocation in 2 sessions. The first is done\n      with birch pollen extract (should block the nose in allergic subjects) and the second with\n      xylometazoline (should open the nose).\n\n      The mask group undergo similar measurements without nasal exposures.\n\n      The second objective of the study is to clarify if there are differences between the\n      allergic and control subjects in the function of the autonomous nervous system during these\n      provocations. This is done with the heart rate variability analysis method."
