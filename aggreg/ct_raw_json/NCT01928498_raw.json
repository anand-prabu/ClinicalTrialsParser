            "textblock": "In Canada, there are over 20,000 patients with chronic end-stage renal disease (ESRD)on\n      long-term hemodialysis and the number is increasing rapidly.The creation of hemodialysis\n      access (HA) (also called \"lifeline\" for dialysis patients) has become the most common type\n      of vascular surgery. These HA are frequently complicated by dysfunction after their creation\n      mainly due to neointimal hyperplastic stenosis (> 60% at one year). PTA is an established\n      cornerstone method of treating stenotic lesions because of its minimally invasive\n      percutaneous nature and widespread availability.Although PTA has a high initial success\n      rate,narrowing will often recur in 2-3 months hence requiring further interventions. There\n      are currently no durable therapies for the prevention or treatment of HA dysfunction\n      restenosis after PTA.\n\n      Recently drug eluting balloon (DEB) with paclitaxel have repeatedly demonstrated their\n      effectiveness to prevent restenosis due to intimal proliferation in the coronary and\n      peripheral arterial systems. The investigators believe that the DEB with paclitaxel will\n      significantly decrease the HA restenosis rate at the treated site and therefore will improve\n      the management of HA failures."
