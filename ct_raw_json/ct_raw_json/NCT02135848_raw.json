Functional assessments\n      will be performed following a single high dose (300mg), a single low dose (15mg), and\n      following 14 days of low dose treatment (15mg q.d.).  The objectives of this study are to:\n      1) Evaluate the safety and tolerability of GSK1278863 administered as a single dose and as\n      sub-chronic low dosing (i.e. 14 days) in subjects with peripheral artery disease; 2) To\n      demonstrate the potential pharmacodynamic effect of GSK1278863 on functional measures of\n      calf muscle endurance and fatigability and timed walking distance following a single high or\n      low dose and after 14 days of multiple low dose administration in subjects with\n      claudication-limited peripheral artery disease.  In this hypothesis-generating study,\n      multiple assessments of ambulatory and skeletal muscle function will be made during\n      standardized tests of claudication-limited exercise performance, and 3). Characterize the\n      relationship, if any, between the doses and plasma concentrations of GSK1278863 and the\n      pharmacodynamic effects."
