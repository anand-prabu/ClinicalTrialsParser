Patients are initiated on a DCCR dose\n      of about 1.5 mg/kg (maximum starting dose of 145 mg) and are titrated every 14 days to about\n      2.4 mg/kg, 3.3 mg/kg, 4.2 mg/kg, and 5.1 mg/kg (maximum dose of 507.5 mg).  These DCCR doses\n      are equivalent to diazoxide doses of 1.03, 1.66, 2.28, 2.9, and 3.52 mg/kg.  The\n      administered dose will be as close to the mg/kg dosing as can be achieved by the available\n      dose strengths of DCCR.  Patients will be up-titrated at each visit at the discretion of the\n      investigator. All patients will be randomized in the double-blind, placebo-controlled,\n      randomized withdrawal extension.  Any patient who showed an increase in resting energy\n      expenditure and/or a reduction in hyperphagia from Baseline through Day 55 or Day 69 will be\n      designated a responder, whereas all others will be designated non-responders.  Patients will\n      be randomized in a 1:1 ratio either to continue on active treatment at the dose they were\n      treated with on Day 69 or to the placebo equivalent of that dose for an additional 4 weeks.\n      Randomization will be stratified on responder/non-responder."
