  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fatigue is common in cancer patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy. To further understand
      the mechanism of fatigue and search for potential biomarkers, we will conduct a prospective
      study with breast cancer patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with breast cancer undergoing adjuvant systemic chemotherapy based on the use of
      anthracyclines will be screened before the start of chemotherapy.

      Patients whose scores on the brief fatigue inventory (BFI) increase after having received
      the first cycle of chemotherapy will be considered as having manifested fatigue. The
      patients whose fatigue won't worse  following the first cycle of chemotherapy will be used
      as controls. We will collect blood samples of both groups before and 21 days after the start
      of chemotherapy. We will analyze the following biomarkers: IL2, IL10, TNF and TGFB-1
      measured by amplification reaction; FSH, LH, estradiol, DHEA, DHEAS and cortisol hormones
      measured by chemiluminescent enzyme immunometric assay
