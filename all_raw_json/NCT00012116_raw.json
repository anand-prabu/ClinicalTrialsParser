Assess the safety and\n      tolerability of this drug in these patients. III. Determine the quality of life of patients\n      treated with this drug. IV. Determine the response rate of systemic disease outside the\n      central nervous system in patients treated with this drug.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral temozolomide daily for 6 weeks. Treatment repeats every 10\n      weeks for up to 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n      Quality of life is assessed on day 1 of each 10-week course. Patients are followed for 30\n      days.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-48 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years."

Prior therapy may include surgery\n             and/or whole brain radiotherapy and/or stereotactic radiosurgery.\n\n          -  At least 2 weeks must have elapsed since the completion of radiotherapy at any site\n             other than brain, prior to start of study medication.
