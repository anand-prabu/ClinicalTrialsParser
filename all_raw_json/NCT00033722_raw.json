Folic acid may be effective in preventing or lessening the\n      side effects of lometrexol. Combining lometrexol with folic acid may be an effective\n      treatment for non-small cell lung cancer.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining lometrexol with folic acid\n      in treating patients who have stage IIIB or stage IV non-small cell lung cancer that has\n      been previously treated."

Patients also receive\n      lometrexol IV over 30-60 seconds on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of\n      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed up to 2 months after removal from study and then every 3 months\n      thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50-100 patients will be accrued for this study."
