The hypothesis of the study is\n      that BGPP beside clinical treatment can improve the quality of life and coping in SLE\n      patients. The aim of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of BGPP in Brazilian SLE\n      patients.\n\n      Primary objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of BGPP to improve quality of life.\n      Secondary objectives: To evaluate the effectiveness of BGPP to improve coping, anxiety and\n      depression symptoms. SLE patients will be randomized to receive Psychotherapy or only\n      clinical treatment. The effectiveness will be assessed through specific questionnaires."
