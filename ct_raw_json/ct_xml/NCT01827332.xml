  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate how people who frequently use marijuana respond to
      a therapy session, and if a medication (oxytocin) affects this response.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Oxytocin has been shown to promote trust, social bonding, and calmness; however, its
      potential additive effects with a therapy intervention have not been explored in
      marijuana-dependent individuals. In the proposed study, the impact of intranasal oxytocin on
      therapy effectiveness, drug craving, and marijuana use outcomes following a brief therapy
      intervention will be investigated. It is hypothesized that oxytocin administration (vs.
      placebo) will improve treatment satisfaction, attenuate drug craving, and decrease marijuana
      use.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects must be able to provide informed consent and function at an intellectual
             level sufficient  to allow accurate completion of all assessment instruments.

          2. Subjects must meet DSM-IV criteria for current marijuana dependence (within the past
             three months). While individuals may also meet criteria for abuse of other
             substances, they must identify marijuana as their primary substance of abuse and must
             not meet criteria for dependence on any other substance (except nicotine) within the
             last 60 days.

          3. Subjects must consent to remain abstinent from alcohol for 24 hours and other drugs
             of abuse (except nicotine and marijuana) for three days immediately prior to study
             procedures. Subjects must abstain from marijuana for 24 hours prior to testing. By
             restricting marijuana use as proposed, subjects should not be under the acute effects
             of marijuana.

          4. Subjects must consent to random assignment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Women who are pregnant, nursing or of childbearing potential and not practicing an
             effective means of  birth control.

          2. Subjects with evidence of or a history of significant hematological, endocrine,
             cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal, gastrointestinal, or neurological disease including
             diabetes, as these conditions may affect physiological/subjective responses.

          3. Subjects with a history of or current psychotic disorder or bipolar affective
             disorder as these may interfere with subjective measurements.

          4. Subjects with current major depressive disorder or post-traumatic stress disorder as
             these disorders may interfere with subjective measurements.

          5. Subjects who pose a current suicidal or homicidal risk.

          6. Subjects taking any psychotropic medications, including SRI's or other
             antidepressants, opiates or opiate antagonists because these may affect test
             response. Individuals who take stimulants for treatment of ADHD will be allowed to
             participate.

          7. Subjects with any acute illness or fever. Individuals who otherwise meet study
             criteria will be rescheduled for evaluation for participation.

          8. Subjects who are unwilling or unable to maintain abstinence from alcohol and
             marijuana for 24 hours and other drugs of abuse (except nicotine) for three days
             prior to study procedures.

          9. Subjects meeting DSM-IV criteria for substance dependence (other than nicotine or
             marijuana) within the past 60 days.

         10. Subjects who, in the investigator's opinion, would be unable to comply with study
             procedures or assessments.
