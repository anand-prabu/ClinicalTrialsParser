Based on aforementioned data from the US Department of\n      Health and Human Services, standard 1 year survival for AML after stem cell transplant is\n      near 40%. We hypothesize that valproic acid and azacitidine will prolong survival, with a 1\n      year survival goal of 60%. In addition to assessing for 1 year survival, we will have\n      secondary objectives of assessing progression-free survival, relapse, and toxicity. The\n      primary toxicity endpoint from this will be cytopenias and infections."
