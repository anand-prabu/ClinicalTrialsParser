  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleep disorder is a common problem in menopausal women and the decrease in the sleep leads
      to poor daily activity. Traditional Chinese acupressure is a noninvasive, effective and safe
      technique that can be easily taught to menopausal women so that they apply it as a self-care
      method and a manager of sleep disruption. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate
      the effectiveness of acupressure on sleep quality of postmenopausal women.This double blind
      randomized clinical trial was performed on 120 qualified menopausal women at the age of
      41-65 years; and sleep quality was measured with Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI
      ).Participants were randomly assigned to an acupressure group, a sham acupressure group and
      a control group by two time randomized method (systematic and simple randomized). These
      interventions were carried out for 4 consecutive weeks. Participants in acupressure group
      and sham acupressure group learned to carry out acupressure technique as a self care at home
      with the simultaneous massage techniques that were to be performed 2 hours before sleep,
      whereas only conversation was used in the control group. The statistical software package
      for social science (SPSS) Version 17 was used for data analysis.
