  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of multisensory environment (MSE)
      and/or massage therapy (MT) in residents with severe and profound intellectual disabilities
      (ID) who received massage therapy in MSE, activities in MSE alone, massage therapy in usual
      care environment, or usual care with attention.

      Since there has not yet been any conclusive evidence to show the clinical efficacy of MT and
      MSE on relaxation and reducing challenging behaviours, the following null hypotheses are
      suggested:

        1. There will not be any differences on reducing heart and respiration rates between
           MT-MSE, MT, MSE, and usual care only over the 10-week intervention period and a 2-week
           follow-up.

        2. There will not be any differences on adaptive behaviours and levels of alertness
           between MT-MSE, MT, MSE, and control group over the 10-week intervention period and a
           2-week follow-up.

        3. There will not be any differences on frequency and severity of challenging behaviours
           between MT-MSE, MT, MSE, and control group over the 10-week intervention period and a
           2-week follow-up.

      Design:

      This study adopts a mixed methods research design, in which both quantitative (i.e.,
      randomized controlled trial design) and qualitative (exploratory) approaches will be used.

      Methods:

      After the study criteria are checked and met and proxy consent has been obtained, the
      participants will undergo a period of washout (4 weeks) from the current multisensory
      environment (MSE) and/or massage therapy (MT) sessions. After that, the baseline measurement
      of all outcome measures will be taken. All of them will then be randomly assigned to one of
      the four study groups, including three treatment groups, namely massage therapy in MSE
      (MT-MSE), MSE only and massage therapy in usual care environment (MT), and one control
      (routine care) group.

      The effects of the three proposed interventions and routine care only groups on the study
      outcomes, including frequency and severity of challenging behaviour, adaptive behaviour,
      alertness level, and heart and respiration rate, will be compared between groups at
      baseline, interim (i.e., 5 weeks after the interventions started), immediately after
      completion of the interventions (i.e. 10 weeks after the interventions started), and 2 weeks
      follow up (i.e. at 12 weeks from the start of intervention, but no intervention at week 11
      and 12).  A pilot study will be conducted to review the feasibility and clarity of the study
      procedure, intervention protocols, and outcome measurements in around 30 patients with
      similar clinical characteristics (i.e., 8 subjects per groups) before starting the main
      study.

      Primary outcomes of the study are frequency and severity of challenging behaviours, and the
      physiological signs (i.e., respiration and pulse rate). The secondary outcomes are the
      levels of alertness and adaptive behaviours.

      Primary nurses who are responsible to formulate the individualized MSE and/or MT programs of
      the participants in the three treatment groups will be invited to participate a face-to-face
      semi-structured interview in order to explore their perceptions and opinions towards the
      strengths and limitations of the intervention(s) used, factors influencing the challenging
      behaviours of the disabled residents, and their suggested strategies in reducing their
      clients' challenging behaviours in their work setting.

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>BPI-01 consists of 49 items with three subscales and has been widely employed in people with intellectual disability who are living in residential settings. This instrument is to evaluate the frequency and severity of challenging behaviours over the past two weeks of each assessment time points.
Each item of the scale can be assessed on both frequency and severity of each kind of behaviour.  The frequency scale is a 5-point rating scale: 0 - never, 1 - monthly, 2 - weekly, 3 - daily, and 4 - hourly. The severity scale is a 4-point Likert scale, denoted by: 0 - no problem, 1 - a slight problem, 2 - a moderate problem, and 3 - a severe problem.  If a resident does not exhibit any behaviour listed in the item, &quot;never&quot; and &quot;no problem&quot; should be rated on that item.</description>

    <description>Relaxation is a state of parasympathetic activation by vagal nerve, and suppressing the activity of sympathetic nervous system. If massage therapy and/or MSE indicate relaxation effect, the physiological parameters, i.e. pulse and respiration rates, are expected to drop to a lower level as compared with baseline readings after the interventions.
Respiration rate and heart (pulse) rate will be measured 3 minutes just after the participants attended the intervention sessions. Their average values will be used for outcome analysis.</description>

    <description>The Behaviour Checklist (BC) was developed by Shapiro et al. (1997) to assess the behavioral reactions toward multi-sensory environment and relevant psychological interventions. It consists of 22 items in which 16 items are for self-stimulating behaviours and 6 items for adaptive behaviours. Frequency of each of the listed behaviors in the checklist will be observed and counted at 1-minute intervals during the intervention sessions.</description>
