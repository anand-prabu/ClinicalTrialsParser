Patients are\n      randomized to one of two treatment arms; each arm receives a different dose of botulinum\n      toxin type A.\n\n      All patients undergo a flexible upper gastrointestinal endoscopy.  Botulinum toxin is\n      injected into the lower esophageal sphincter into each of 4 quadrants.  Some patients may\n      receive a second treatment, depending on response and/or time of relapse.\n\n      Patients are followed daily for 7 days, then every 1-6 months for 1-2 years after treatment."
