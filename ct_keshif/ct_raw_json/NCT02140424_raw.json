The investigators will be examining blood and urine hormone levels as\n      well as measures of bone density including DXA and high-resolution peripheral quantitiative\n      computed tomography. The investigators hypothesize that youth with type 1 diabetes will have\n      slower bone accrual and impaired bone microarchitectural integrity compared with\n      non-diabetic controls. The investigators hypothesize that poor bone accrual will be\n      associated with sub-optimal glucose control as well as lower levels of insulin-like growth\n      factor 1."
