It is hypothesized that the reduction of eosinophils with mepolizumab in\n      COPD patients would translate into a reduction of COPD exacerbations. The study will\n      determine the reduction in exacerbations in subjects who are above and below the baseline\n      blood eosinophil count of at least 150 cells/microlitres. The study will evaluate the\n      efficacy and safety of mepolizumab on the frequency of moderate and severe exacerbations in\n      COPD subjects at high risk of exacerbations, despite the use of optimized standard of care\n      background therapy.\n\n      Overall in this study, a total of 800 subjects will be randomised in 1:1 ratio to receive\n      placebo or mepolizumab (100 milligram (mg)) administered SC. The total duration of this\n      study will be approximately 62 weeks, consisting of a 1 to 2 week screening period, 52-week\n      treatment period and 8-week follow-up period."
