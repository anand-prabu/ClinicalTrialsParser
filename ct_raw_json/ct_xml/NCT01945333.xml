    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop and pilot test personalized and scalable approaches
      to Cognitive Remediation (CR) for schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder. The intent is
      to more clearly define the therapeutic targets important to the facilitation of cognitive
      and functional improvement so that clinicians know how to customize cognitive interventions
      and deliver treatment in a more effective, efficient and personally relevant manner.

      There are three phases of this study.

      Phase 1: Development and Adaptation. The goal of this phase is to adapt currently used
      computer based CR approaches to make them more personalized and scalable. We will create two
      CR interventions which differ in choice and pacing of the cognitive exercises.

      Phase 2: Open Trial and Intervention Refinement. The goal of this phase is to obtain
      quantitative and qualitative feedback on the acceptability and usability of the
      interventions from participants to inform further refinement of the assessment and treatment
      packages. We will recruit ten subjects from an outpatient psychiatric rehabilitation program
      in New York City. After determining study eligibility, individuals will complete a
      standardized neuropsychological battery for schizophrenia assessment, and a 5-minute Tone
      Matching Test to assess basic auditory processing. Participants will be randomly assigned to
      receive one of two intervention packages, developed in Phase 1. Each session includes 60
      minutes of computer-based learning activities and a 15 minute therapist-led discussion that
      links the computer activities to cognition as applied to daily tasks and recovery goals.
      Participants will complete a total of 10 sessions attending 2-3 times weekly for 5 weeks.
      During each session, participants will be asked to keep a log of software used. At the
      conclusion of this abbreviated trial, the participants will participate in focus groups in
      which they will be asked to provide verbal feedback on how enjoyable, engaging, and useful
      they perceived the computer and discussion based exercises to be. Participants will be asked
      to provide verbal feedback on the assessment procedures. CR clinicians will join the
      research team to discuss participants' engagement and their experience with administering
      the Tone Matching Test and interventions. Qualitative data summarized from participant logs
      and focus groups will be considered by the research team to refine the assessment battery,
      treatment parameters, and rubric of learning exercises.

      Phase 3: Pilot Feasibility Trial. People with a diagnosis of schizophrenia or
      schizoaffective disorder may be referred by their treating clinician or may respond to
      posted advertisements to inquire about study participation. After being informed of study
      procedures, interested individuals will be asked to sign a consent form that documents
      willingness to participate in this study. Following informed consent, participants will be
      asked questions about demographic characteristics (e.g. age, education, employment),
      medication and psychosocial treatment status, psychiatric symptoms and symptoms severity,
      and will complete a brief assessment of estimated IQ. Those with an IQ estimate below 70 or
      meeting substance dependence criteria at the time of evaluation will be exited from the
      study.  In the same or second assessment session, participants will complete assessments of
      neuropsychological ability, current functioning, and motivation for treatment. Participants
      will then be randomly assigned to one of two treatment conditions named &quot;Brain Basics&quot; or
      &quot;Brain Exercises&quot;.

      Each treatment condition is structured in a group format of up to 5 participants. Both
      treatments use commercially available computer-based training software to exercise cognitive
      skills such as speed of processing, attention, working memory, and verbal memory. Both
      conditions will entail 60 minutes on the computer and 15 minutes group discussion. In the
      discussion, participants review the cognitive activities they are working on and how they
      will help them achieve their recovery goals. The treatment phase will consist of 30 separate
      sessions each 75 minutes in duration, administered 3 times a week over the course of a
      10-week period. Participants will be re-tested on outcome measures approximately 1 week
      following end of treatment, and again 3 months later.
