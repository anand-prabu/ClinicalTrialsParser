This study is designed to correlate the gastrointestinal transit behaviour of\n      delayed-release diclofenac potassium tablets with their pharmacokinetic (PK) absorption\n      profiles.\n\n      We will be looking at:\n\n        1. The behaviour of the tablets (when, where and how quickly they break up)\n\n        2. The gastric emptying time of the tablets (when they leave the stomach)\n\n        3. The gastrointestinal transit of the tablets (how long they take to travel through the\n           gut)\n\n        4. Blood levels of the drug (diclofenac)"
