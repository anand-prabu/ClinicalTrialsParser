Peripheral stem cell transplantation may allow the doctor to\n      give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs to kill more tumor cells. Chemotherapy, given before\n      and after surgery, followed by peripheral stem cell transplantation may be an effective\n      treatment for metastatic neuroblastoma.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of chemotherapy, given before and after\n      surgery, followed by peripheral stem cell transplantation in treating patients who have\n      metastatic neuroblastoma."

Patients receive cisplatin IV over 1 hour on days 1-4 and etoposide\n      IV over 2 hours on days 1-3 of induction courses 3, 5, and 7. Patients also receive\n      filgrastim (G-CSF) IV or subcutaneously once daily beginning on day 5 of courses 3, 5, and 7\n      and continuing until blood counts recover. Treatment repeats every 21 days.\n\n      At the completion of induction chemotherapy, patients undergo surgical resection. Patients\n      in complete remission receive high-dose consolidation chemotherapy comprising oral busulfan\n      every 6 hours on days -7 to -3 and melphalan IV over 2 minutes on day -2. Autologous\n      peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) are reinfused on day 0. Patients with n-myc tumor\n      amplification undergo radiotherapy at least 70 days after PBSC transplantation.\n\n      Patients are followed every 6 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 15-45 patients will be accrued for this study."
