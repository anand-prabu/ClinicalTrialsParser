  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postmenopausal women who have hormone receptor positive breast cancer are typically treated
      with aromatase inhibitor medications, which substantially decrease the amount of estrogen
      produced by their bodies. These medications are fairly well tolerated, but can cause aches
      and pains which can be quite severe in some cases.

      People experience pain differently. Estrogen appears to play a role in how we experience
      pain. Therefore, decreasing estrogen levels may lead to more pain in some women than others.
      The goal of this study is to evaluate perception of pain in women with breast cancer, and to
      determine if differences in pain perception lead to more aches and pains in some women
      treated with aromatase inhibitors.

      In this study, we plan to enroll 55 women with breast cancer who are starting treatment with
      an aromatase inhibitor. Participants will undergo testing to evaluate their perception of
      pain, and will also complete a set of questionnaires. Testing will be conducted before
      starting aromatase inhibitor therapy, as well as after 3 and 6 months of therapy. We will
      investigate whether pre-existing differences in pain perception lead to different amounts of
      pain during aromatase inhibitor therapy.
