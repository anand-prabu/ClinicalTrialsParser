Usually the muscle cells of the ureter contract in a coordinated\n      fashion (peristalsis) in order to provide urinary flow from the kidney into the bladder. By\n      inserting a stent these contractions are disrupted, eventually resulting in a loss of\n      peristalsis. This phenomena is accompanied by swelling of the kidney and pain, which are\n      well-known negative side effects of stents. To avoid stent-related morbidity and improve\n      patients care this issue needs to be investigated further. A first step is to analyse the\n      impact of stents on peristalsis and to possibly bring these results into context with\n      hypothesised molecular mechanisms involved in peristalsis."
