This is a randomized clinical trial. The\n      sample consisted of 44 patients in preoperative of cardiac surgery, who were divided in two\n      groups: empathic behaviour by nurses and without specific empathic behaviour. Fear was\n      assessed at two time points: before and after the intervention. The instrument used was\n      developed and validated, comprising 15 defining characteristics of the nursing diagnosis\n      fear. The hypothesis is that the group who received empathic behaviour from nurse will\n      reduce the anxiety."
