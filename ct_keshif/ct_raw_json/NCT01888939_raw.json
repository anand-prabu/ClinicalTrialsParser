            "textblock": "Background:\n\n      - Some studies in adults have found that insulin and glucose blood levels are lower when a\n      long period of sitting is broken up with walking, compared to sitting without breaks. This\n      means that the body can better process sugars when there are walking breaks during the day.\n      Researchers want to know if this is also true for children. Some studies have found that\n      children   s attention and memory might be better after exercise. Researchers want to know\n      if short walking breaks have the same effects.\n\n      Objectives:\n\n      - To understand if breaking up sitting with walking helps children   s bodies better use\n      sugars and improves children   s concentration.\n\n      Eligibility:\n\n      - Healthy children ages 7 to 11.\n\n      Design:\n\n        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam, medical history, exercise test,\n           picture vocabulary test, and medical tests including blood tests and X-rays.\n\n        -  Participants will return for two 7-hour visits. In the month before the visits, they\n           will wear a physical activity monitor for one week so researchers know how active they\n           are. Once they will take the    sitting only    test and once the    sitting breaks\n           test.\n\n        -  During the    sitting only    test, participants will sit for 3 hours.\n\n        -  During the    sitting breaks    test, they will sit for 3 hours with 3-minute walking\n           breaks every 30 minutes.\n\n        -  Both days, they will drink sugar water. Then the participants will have blood drawn\n           from a needle that is kept in place, and they will wear a heart monitor. They will take\n           attention and working memory tests on a computer and answer questions about how they\n           feel. They will eat a meal at the end of the test day."

            "textblock": "Prevention of pediatric obesity and its complications are U.S. public health priorities.\n      Promoting physical activity has been proposed as an intervention strategy. Apart from\n      reducing excessive weight, physical activity improves cardiovascular fitness, insulin\n      sensitivity, and academic performance. However, emerging evidence in adults suggests that\n      increased physical activity may not entirely counteract the negative health effects of a\n      sedentary lifestyle.\n\n      Sedentary behavior is defined as a set of low-intensity activities involving limited body\n      movement (e.g.: TV viewing, prolonged sitting). TV viewing is associated with lower\n      cognitive functioning and depressive symptoms. Some studies found higher levels of childhood\n      sedentary behavior predicted higher body mass index (BMI) and cholesterol in adulthood,\n      suggesting that negative health consequences may begin early. Dunstan et al. conducted the\n      first lab-based study in adults investigating interrupting prolonged sedentary behavior with\n      physical activity breaks. The authors found that for overweight adults, adding 2-minute\n      moderate-intensity walking breaks every 20 minutes reduced postprandial insulin and glucose\n      responses by 23.0% and 29.6%, respectively. Thus, interrupting sedentary behavior may be an\n      intervention strategy to reduce health risks.\n\n      In children, cross-sectional observational studies indicate that sedentary behavior patterns\n      characterized by short bouts of activity are not associated with increased cardiometabolic\n      risk. However to date, no in-lab studies have manipulated sedentary behavior in children.\n      Therefore, we propose to conduct a randomized crossover pilot feasibility study to assess\n      whether interrupting sedentary behavior influences metabolic and executive function,\n      attention, mood, anxiety, and dietary intake. Children, ages 7-11 years, will complete two\n      conditions in random order: 3 hours of prolonged sitting and 3 hours of sitting interrupted\n      with 3 minutes of moderate-intensity walking every 30 minutes. The specific aim of this\n      project is to investigate whether interrupting sedentary behavior improves metabolic\n      parameters and changes executive function, attention, mood, anxiety, and dietary intake. The\n      primary hypothesis is that postprandial insulin incremental area under the curve (iAUC) will\n      be lower in the interrupted sitting vs. the prolonged sitting condition. The exploratory\n      secondary hypotheses are that glucose iAUC, executive function, attention, mood, anxiety,\n      and dietary intake will differ between the two conditions.\n\n      This project will investigate if interrupting sedentary time affects potential negative\n      health consequences of sedentary behavior in children. If interrupting sedentary time in\n      short bouts has beneficial effects among children, interventions examining the frequency,\n      duration, and intensity of such interruptions could be developed. Thus, these results have\n      the potential to provide insight into novel behavioral intervention targets in youth."
