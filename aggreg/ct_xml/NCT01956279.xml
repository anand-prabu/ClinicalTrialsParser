      This study will investigate the use of adjunctive pregnenolone for the following:

        1. fatigue that has limited usual activity,

        2. musculoskeletal pain involving 2 or more regions of the body and,

        3. cognitive symptoms (memory, concentration, or attentional difficulties by self-report)
           in Veterans deployed to the Gulf War theatre of operations between 1990 and 1991.

    <measure>Physical Component of the SF-36; assessing change between the baseline score (week 2), week 6 and week 10.</measure>
    <time_frame>Prospective, outcome measures collected over 10 week trial period. (Weeks 2, 6 and 10)</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The SF-36 is a health survey with an 8-scale profile embedded in 36 questions that measures physical and mental components of health.
Each item is scored on a 0 to 100 range with the lowest and highest possible scores are set at 0 and 100, respectively.  All of these items are scored so that a high score defines a more favorable health state.
This study will assess change between the baseline score (week 2), week 6 and week 10 of the SF-36.</description>

    <measure>Brief Pain Inventory; assessing change between the baseline score (week 2), week 6 and week 10</measure>
    <time_frame>Prospective, outcome measures collected over 10 week trial period (Weeks 2, 6 and 10)</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The Brief Pain Inventory is a 14-item self-report measure designed to assess the severity, frequency and daily pattern of fatigue as well as its perceived interference with quality of life.
Severity is measured on a 0-10 scale with 10 being the most severely fatigued
Frequency is measured on a 0-10 scale with 10 being severely fatigued for the entire day for all days of the week.
Perceived interference is measured on a 0-10 scale with 10 depicting extreme interference.
This study will assess change between the baseline score (week 2), week 6 and week 10 of the Brief Pain Inventory.</description>

    <measure>Tower of London test of the BAC-A; assessing change between the baseline score (week 2), week 6 and week 10.</measure>
    <time_frame>Prospective, outcome measures collected over 10 week trial period (Weeks 2, 6 and 10)</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Assesses executive functioning on a scale of 0-20.  (Note, if a perfect score of 20 occurs then there is the opportunity of 2 additional points, increasing the score to 22.)
The higher the number, the higher the degree of executive functioning.
This study will assess change between the baseline score (week 2), week 6 and week 10 of the Tower of London.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFSI); assessing change between the baseline score (week 2), week 6 and week 10.</measure>
    <time_frame>Prospective, outcome measures collected over 10 week trial period (Weeks 2, 6 and 10)</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The MFSI is an 83-item self-report measure designed to assess the principal manifestations of fatigue.
Items are rated on a 0-4 scale indicating how true each statement was for the respondent during the last week (0=not at all; 4=extremely).
This study will assess change between the baseline score (week 2), week 6 and week 10 of the MFSI.</description>

    <measure>Global Severity Index of the SCL-90R; assessing change between the baseline score (week 2), week 6 and week 10.</measure>
    <time_frame>Prospective, outcome measures collected over 10 week trial period (Weeks 2, 6 and 10)</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The SCL-90R is used as a screening measure of general psychiatric symptomatology.  It includes dimensions measuring somatization, obsessive-compulsive, depression, anxiety, phobic anxiety, hostility, interpersonal sensitivity, paranoid ideation, and psychoticism.
Global Severity Index (GSI) of the SCL-90R is designed to measure overall psychological distress.
This is a 90 item measure with each rated on a scale of 0-4 with 4 being the highest level of psychological distress for each item.
This study will assess change between the baseline score (week 2), week 6 and week 10 of the Global Severity Index of the SCL-90R.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Veterans deployed to the Gulf War theatre of operations between 1990 and 1991.

          -  Veterans who report at least 2 of the following 3 symptoms that began in 1990 or
             thereafter, that lasted for more than 6 months, and that are present at the time of
             screening:  1) fatigue that limited usual activity, 2) musculoskeletal pain involving
             2 or more regions of the body, 3) cognitive symptoms (memory, concentration, or
             attentional difficulties by self-report)

          -  Stable on medication regimen (no change in last 4 weeks) and no anticipated change in
             medication during study.

          -  Able to provide informed consent for study participation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with a history of clinically significant neurological, metabolic, hepatic,
             renal, hematological, pulmonary, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and/or urological
             disorders (e.g. unstable angina, seizures, cerebrovascular accident, decompensated
             congestive heart failure, CNS infection, cancer [other than non-melanoma skin
             cancer], or history of HIV seropositivity), which would pose a risk to the patient if
             s/he were to participate in the study or that might confound the results of the
             study.

          -  Concurrent enrollment in another clinical trial.

          -  Pregnant women or women of child-bearing potential who are not surgically-sterile or
             not using appropriate methods of birth control.

          -  Use of oral contraceptives or other hormonal supplementation such as estrogen
             [although early studies suggested no effects on menstrual cycle, alterations in
             downstream metabolites or pregnenolone (such as estradiol) could theoretically impact
             the efficacy or oral contraceptives and/or estrogen replacement].  Similarly, it is
             theoretically possible that pregnenolone could be metabolized to other steroids such
             a DHEA, potentially resulting in hair, skin, or other steroid-related changes.  Since
             we have determined in our prior study that pregnenolone administration does not
             result in downstream elevations in DHEA, DHEAS, estradiol, or testosterone, these
             possibilities may be unlikely.

          -  Women who are breast-feeding.

          -  Use of narcotic interventions.

          -  Known allergy to study medication.

          -  History of moderate or severe TBI (with loss of consciousness greater than 30
             minutes)

          -  A clearly defined disease entity that accounts for the Veteran's symptoms.

          -  Current DSM-IV/DSM-IVTR/DSM-V diagnosis of bipolar I disorder, schizophrenia or other
             psychotic disorder, or dementia.

          -  Subjects with a DSM-IV/DSM-IVTR/DSM-V diagnosis of alcohol or substance dependence
             (other than nicotine or caffeine) within the last month.

          -  Subjects with a current suicidal or homicidal ideation necessitating clinical
             intervention or representing an imminent concern.

          -  If in the judgment of the PI it is not in the subject's best interest to participate.

          -  Final eligibility decisions will be determined by the PI.
