            "textblock": "The purpose of this study is to investigate the role of the female sex hormone estrogen, on\n      metabolism, thermoregulation and energy expenditure.  Weight and fat gain increase after the\n      menopause, but reasons for this are not clear.  Loss of estrogen may cause changes in how\n      women regulate metabolism and thermoregulation, possibly leading to weight gain.\n      Specifically, this study will determine how loss of estrogen affects facultative\n      thermogenesis.  Loosely defined, facultative thermogenesis represents heat production that\n      is turned on when needed.  For example, when body core temperature falls below a certain\n      threshold, a shivering response is invoked in skeletal muscle to increase heat production\n      and, thus, energy expenditure.  However, exposure over several hours to mild cold\n      temperatures that do not trigger shivering (16-20\u2070 C) also induces an increase in energy\n      expenditure (cold-induced non-shivering thermogenesis).  Although several different tissues\n      may contribute to this response, the recent identification of functional brown adipose\n      tissue (BAT) in humans has promoted an interest in how BAT is activated in humans and its\n      potential role in regulating energy balance and body weight.  The investigators will measure\n      BAT activity using PET/CT scans pre and post three months of estrogen suppression."
