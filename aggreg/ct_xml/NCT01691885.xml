  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to test the hypothesis that lung hyperinflation
      contributes to cardiac dysfunction in COPD and that the treatment of lung deflation with
      FF/VI Inhalation Powder 100/25 mcg administered once daily (QD) will result in the reversal
      of this cardiac dysfunction compared with placebo. This will be assessed by measures of
      right and left global and regional systolic and diastolic cardiac function as assessed using
      a 30 minute CMR.

      A secondary objective will be to investigate the effect of FF/VI inhalation powder 100/25mcg
      QD on measures of arterial stiffness in the form of pulse wave analysis and distensability
      in the pulmonary and systemic circulation.

      This will be a Phase IIIb, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over,
      single-centre study to investigate the acute effects of FF/VI inhalation powder 100/25mcg QD
      in lung deflation on cardiac biventricular function and arterial stiffness in adults with
      COPD.

      Subjects will visit the clinic a minimum of 4 times over a 28-day period with a further
      contact which can be either a telephone contact or clinic visit (Visit/Contact 4). A 7-day
      run-in period will be followed by two 7-day (maximum 14-day) treatment periods separated by
      a 7(±2) day wash-out period. The first dose of treatment will be taken the day after
      randomisation. A safety Follow-up contact (either visit or telephone) will occur 7(±2) days
      post the last treatment day.

      Subjects will be prescribed appropriate COPD therapy at the end of Treatment Visit 5, if
      required. There are no plans to provide the study drug for compassionate use following study
      completion.

      It is planned to have 44 completed evaluable subjects. Subjects who withdraw early will be
      replaced. In order to ensure 44 evaluable subjects, assuming a 10% protocol deviation rate,
      49 subjects will be randomised. The total duration of subject participation, including the
      follow-up period, will be approximately 36 days.
