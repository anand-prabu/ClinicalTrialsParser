Part 2, The investigators use two outcome measures, including Barthel\n      index, and modified Rankin scale for neurological evaluation to assess whether BUN/Cr ratio\n      based hydration therapy results in sustained clinical benefit at three months."

            "textblock": "The investigators have recently reported a novel finding that the blood urea nitrogen\n      (BUN)/creatinine (Cr) ratio, a marker of hydration status, was an independent predictor of\n      SIE among patients who had suffered acute ischemic stroke. The investigators found that\n      patients who had a BUN/Cr ratio \u2265 15 were 3.4-fold more likely to experience SIE than\n      patients who had a BUN/Cr ratio < 15. The ratio of SIE was 13.9% in all patients, with 20%\n      in patients who had a BUN/Cr ratio \u2265 15 and 8.3% in patients who had a BUN/Cr ratio < 15.\n      Among the patients presenting with acute ischemic stroke, 37% of them had a BUN/Cr ratio \u2265\n      15.\n\n      The investigators' recent pilot study was designed to determine if providing hydration\n      therapy, specifically intravenous saline infusion, to patients with a blood urea\n      nitrogen/creatinine ratio (BUN/Cr) \u226515 reduces the occurrence of SIE after acute ischemic\n      stroke. Patients in the hydration group received a significantly larger (all P < 0.001)\n      median volume of infused saline than patients in the control group. And this allowed 82% of\n      the patients to maintain their BUN/Cr ratio <15 in first 8 hours. The proportion of patients\n      who experienced SIE was significantly lower in the hydration group compared with the control\n      group.\n\n      Dehydration, as indicated by an increased BUN/Cr ratio, is known to be relatively common\n      among patients who have experienced stroke. According to the result of our pilot study, a\n      hydration strategy with intravenous 20 cc per kilogram of body weight normal saline in first\n      8 hours was safe and effective to prevent dehydration related early neurological\n      deterioration.\n\n      In this study, the investigators conduct a randomized double-blind control trial to test the\n      hypothesis that whether BUN/Cr ratio based hydration therapy has clinical activity."
