French national health authority made the implementation of safety checklist\n      mandatory in operating rooms. The goal of this checklist is to improve teamwork and share\n      key elements for better patient outcomes. Observational studies in the OR showed low\n      compliance to this checklist, either on the way it is used or on the information\n      implemented.\n\n      The primary objective of this project is to assess the  efficacy of a simulation-based\n      curriculum involving OR medical and non-medical personnel in order to improve communication\n      in the OR."

Patient safety check-list are used worldwide as a way to improve communication and\n      teamwork in the operating room in order to decrease perioperative morbidity and mortality.\n      Previous studies have shown that communication failure in the OR may be associated with\n      adverse events. The improvement of safety culture (including communication and team work)\n      may be obtained by simulation based training.\n\n      The primary objective of this before-after study is to assess the efficacy of a\n      simulation-based curriculum involving OR medical and non medical personnel in order to\n      improve communication in the OR.\n\n      In brief, in a first period, an audit to assess communication efficacy and teamwork will be\n      realized during 125 surgical procedures. Communication failures and consequences will be\n      recorded using a standardized form filled by trained personnel. In a second phase, all the\n      OR personnel (surgeon, anesthesiologist, nurses) will be invited to participate to a special\n      training on communication and teamwork. This curriculum will include formal presentations\n      and also simulation-based training. Scenarios are built to improve the ability to\n      communicate in specific situations (fire in the OR, haemorrhage, wrong side, anaphylaxis).\n\n      In a third phase, an audit on communication and teamwork, similar to the first phase will be\n      realized. The primary endpoint is the frequency of surgical interventions having at least\n      one communication failure with a consequence. The investigators expect a significant\n      decrease in the rate of communication failures between phase 1 and 3. A fourth phase will\n      consist in a last audit two years after phase 1 to evaluate long-term effect of this\n      curriculum."
