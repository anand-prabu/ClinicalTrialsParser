Octreotide may help doxorubicin kill more cancer cells by\n      making tumor cells more sensitive to the drug.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of octreotide and doxorubicin in treating\n      patients who have advanced cancer."

Determine the pharmacokinetics and\n      pharmacodynamics of this treatment regimen in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of octreotide. Patients receive doxorubicin IV over\n      5 minutes on day 1 of course 1. For all subsequent courses, patients receive octreotide SC\n      continuously on days 1-7 and doxorubicin IV over 5 minutes on day 5. Treatment continues\n      every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with\n      stable or responsive disease after 3 courses of therapy receive a maximum of 6 additional\n      courses. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of octreotide until the maximum\n      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2\n      of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicity.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 21-30 patients will be accrued for this study."
