            "textblock": "This study will consist of 2 parts:  Part 1 is an open-label, sequential dose escalation\n      part to determine the Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) and Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of\n      TLC399 (ProDex) in patients with macular edema due to central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO)\n      or branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO).  Part 2 is a randomized, single-masked part of the\n      study designed to investigate the use of TLC399 (ProDex) in patients with macular edema due\n      to central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) or branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO).  Each of\n      the 3 groups will have a maximum of 10 subjects, adding Part 1 and Part 2.\n\n      Part 1:\n\n      About 9 to 18 patients will undergo screening for fulfilling the inclusion and exclusion\n      criteria in order to be eligible to enter this part of the study.  The screening period will\n      last for 28 days.\n\n      At first, 3 patients will be enrolled in Group 1 and administered a single intravitreal\n      injection of TLC399 (ProDex), i.e., 0.36 mg dexamethasone sodium phosphate (DSP) with 100 mM\n      phospholipid (PL) (30 \u00b5L) on Day 0.  After the intravitreal injection, each patient will be\n      observed for 4 weeks for Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs).  If 1 of 3 patients develops Dose\n      Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), the cohort will be expanded to a maximum of 6 patients (another\n      3 patients added subsequently).  If exactly 1 of the 6 patients experiences Dose Limiting\n      Toxicities (DLTs), then escalation to the next dose level (i.e., Group 2) will occur.  If\n      more than 1 patient out of the 6 develops Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), the study will be\n      temporarily suspended.  The protocol will be amended and new doses identified to restart the\n      study.  If none of the first 3 patients experiences a Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT), then\n      dose escalation will proceed to the next cohort of patients (i.e., Group 2).\n\n      n Group 2, in a similar manner, 3 patients will be enrolled and administered a single\n      intravitreal injection of TLC399 (ProDex), i.e., 0.6 mg DSP with 100 mM PL (50 \u00b5L) on Day 0.\n       After the intravitreal injection, each patient will be observed for 4 weeks for DLT(s).  If\n      1 of 3 patients develops Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), the cohort will be expanded to a\n      maximum of 6 patients (another 3 patients added subsequently).  If exactly 1 of the 6\n      patients experiences Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), then escalation to the next dose level\n      (i.e., Group 3) will occur.  If more than 1 patient out of the 6 develops Dose Limiting\n      Toxicities (DLTs), then the dose of Group 1 will be the Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT).  This\n      part of the study will stop and Part 2 of the study will commence at this dose.  If none of\n      the first 3 patients experiences a Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT), then dose escalation will\n      proceed to the next cohort of patients (i.e., Group 3).\n\n      In Group 3, in a similar manner, 3 patients will be enrolled and administered a single\n      intravitreal injection of TLC399 (ProDex), i.e., 0.6 mg DSP with 50 mM PL (50 \u00b5L) on Day 0.\n      After the intravitreal injection, each patient will be observed for 4 weeks for Dose\n      Limiting Toxicities (DLTs).  If 1 of 3 patients develops Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs),\n      the cohort will be expanded to a maximum of 6 patients (another 3 patients added\n      subsequently).  If no patient experiences a Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) or exactly 1 of the\n      6 patients experiences Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), then the study will proceed to Part\n      2 with all 3 dose groups, Groups 1, 2, and 3.  If more than 1 patient out of the 6 develops\n      Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), then the dose of Group 2 will be the Dose Limiting Toxicity\n      (DLT).  Part 2 of the study will commence with the 2 dose groups, Groups 1 and 2.\n\n      After the completion of Part 1, these patients will continue to be evaluated for efficacy\n      and safety outcomes up to a period of 12 months unless the patient is withdrawn or\n      discontinues the study.  The evaluations will be similar to Part 2 from Visit 3 onwards\n      until the end of the study.\n\n      Escalation to any of the next planned dose level will require the approval from an informal\n      cohort review meeting. The cohort review group will comprise of the Principal Investigator,\n      contract research organization's (CRO's) Medical Monitor and Project Manager (to facilitate\n      meetings and writing minutes), and the Sponsor's Chief Scientific Officer, President, or\n      designee.  The review meetings will be held after all patients complete the 4-week\n      observational period for that dose group. The Investigators whose patients will be reviewed\n      at the meeting must participate in the meeting.  The rest of the Investigators of the study\n      will be invited to participate on an optional basis. The cohort review group will review all\n      safety data to date including adverse events (AEs), clinically significant laboratory\n      abnormalities, and Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) (as defined later in the synopsis) to\n      decide whether the study will advance unaltered, the protocol requires an amendment, to halt\n      recruitment until the resolution of a specific issue, or to terminate the study.\n\n      Part 2 Once the Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) is established, further enrollment will\n      continue to expand that dose cohort (and any dose cohort below) for a maximum of 10 subjects\n      for each of the dose levels (inclusive of subjects both in Part 1 and Part 2 of the study).\n      After the completion of Part 1 of the study, patients will be screened during a period of 28\n      days to be eligible for this part of the study.\n\n      The inclusion and exclusion criteria for Part 2 will be the same as for Part 1 of the study.\n       The number of subjects to be enrolled for this part will be decided after the completion of\n      Part 1.  About 12 to 21 patients will be randomized if no Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs)\n      are observed in 2 subjects at any dose level to 1 of the 3 groups (Groups 1, 2, and 3) as\n      below:\n\n        -  Group 1:  0.36 mg DSP with 100 mM PL (30 \u00b5L)\n\n        -  Group 2:  0.6 mg DSP with 100 mM PL (50 \u00b5L)\n\n        -  Group 3:  0.6 mg DSP with 50 mM PL (50 \u00b5L) Randomization will be performed centrally.\n           Stratification in the enrolled patients will be done by RVO type (BRVO or CRVO) for\n           meaningful data analyses.  Only the patient will be masked.  The Investigator as well\n           as the administration staff will be aware of the dose of the study medication.  The\n           safety and efficacy outcomes will be assessed for up to about 12 months.\n\n      If 2 of the 6 subjects in Group 2 experience a Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT), then Part 2 of\n      the study will proceed with subjects only in Group 1.  If 2 of the 6 subjects in Group 3\n      experience a Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT), then Part 2 of the study will proceed with\n      subjects randomized to either Group 1 or Group 2.\n\n      Parts 1 and 2 The Investigator will select 1 eye per patient to be the study eye.  During\n      the trial, if there is an underlying inflammatory condition in the fellow eye, topical\n      steroids or periocular or intravitreal steroid injection could be used.  If both eyes are\n      eligible for the study, the eligible eye with the shorter duration of disease (macular\n      edema) will be used as the study eye.\n\n      Any patient experiencing worsening of disease as judged by the Investigator such as a visual\n      acuity loss of 15 letters or more (in the study eye) based on Best Corrected Visual\n      Acuity(BCVA) measurements may be treated with any therapy (including laser photocoagulation,\n      intravitreal or periocular steroid injection, or intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial\n      growth factor [VEGF]) that the Investigator deems appropriate to ensure patient safety.\n\n      These treatments, though prohibited, will not require such patients to be discontinued from\n      the study.  Their efficacy and safety outcomes will be included in the intent-to-treat (ITT)\n      and safety analyses, respectively.  The data from patients who received prohibited\n      treatment/medications will be considered major protocol violations and excluded from the\n      per-protocol (PP) analyses.\n\n      Safety interim analyses will be performed every 6 months and formal safety interim analyses\n      reports will be issued."
