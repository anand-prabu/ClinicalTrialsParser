In order to treat the same half during each visit, a transparent sheet will be marked, using a marking pen, to delineate the borders of the treatment area with a central dividing line. The other half will be covered and used as a control. Treatments will be given randomly (by sealed envelope randomization method) into one of the two halves in different patients but will be given into the same half in each patient in all treatment sessions. Only one investigator will know the intervention each half has received. A total of 23 treatments will be given over 12 weeks."
