  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients diagnosed with low risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) are at risk of
      frequent low grade recurrence, which usually necessitates surgical intervention under
      general anaesthetic. This multicentre study aims to establish the short term efficacy of
      chemoresection using chemotherapy within the bladder for the treatment of NMIBC.

      Should the levels of complete response following chemoresection meet predefined criteria, a
      larger phase III trial would be developed to assess longer term disease related endpoints,
      with the aim of standardising management of recurrent low risk NMIBC and potentially
      removing the need for over a thousand patients each year to undergo surgery.

      CALIBER is a phase II, multicentre, randomised clinical trial.  CALIBER will aim to recruit
      174 participants; randomised 2:1 with 116 patients in the chemoresection group and 58
      patients in the surgical management (control) group.

      Patients assigned to the chemoresection group will receive 4 once weekly intravesical
      instillations of 40mg Mitomycin C (MMC) as outpatients. This treatment will be delivered via
      catheter under local anaesthetic.

      Patients assigned to the surgical management group will receive the standard surgical
      management in use at their hospital for treatment of recurrence which may include a single
      post-operative installation of 40mg MMC within 24 hours.

      All participants will be followed up at 3 weeks from the start of treatment (ie at time of
      final MMC instillation for chemoresection group) and each will receive a cystoscopy three
      months from the end of treatment to assess response, in accordance with European Association
      of Urology (EAU) guidelines.  Subsequent cystoscopic follow up will take place 12 months
      after treatment if recurrence-free at 3 months and then annually.
