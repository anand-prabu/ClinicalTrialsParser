Since an open wound precedes the large majority (85%) of\n      amputations in diabetes, avoidance of ulcer recurrences is important. This study tests the\n      current academic opinion that nerve decompression will not decrease ulcer recurrence risk.\n      Null hypothesis: nerve decompression will not decrease diabetic foot ulcer recurrence risk."
