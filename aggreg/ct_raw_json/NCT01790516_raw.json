Cisplatin and cetuximab\n      (Erbitux)are both approved by the FDA to treat head and neck cancer in combination with\n      radiation therapy. In this study the investigators will test whether genetic differences\n      between patients can be used to pick which of these two drugs a patient should receive. All\n      patients will have a blood sample drawn that will be tested for genetic differences. If\n      patients have genetic differences that correlate with a better outcome from cisplatin they\n      will receive cisplatin with radiation. If patients have genetic differences that do not\n      correlate with a better outcome from cisplatin they will receive cetuximab with their\n      radiation therapy."
