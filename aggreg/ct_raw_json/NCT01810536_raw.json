            "textblock": "Introduction: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease that leads to chronic lung\n      infections and recurrent respiratory exacerbations. Supplemental oxygen is usually required\n      during respiratory exacerbations. Recently, a new high flow nasal cannula system that\n      provides flows up to 40l/min at 100% humidification was developed and tested in neonates and\n      children, providing greater comfort to the patient. The main hypothesis of the study is that\n      this method has advantages for oxygen supplementation to patients with CF hospitalized for\n      respiratory exacerbation. Methods: 40 patients with CF aged 6 to 18 years will be randomized\n      to receive supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula or Venturi masks during hospitalization for\n      respiratory exacerbation. Main outcomes will be the duration of hospitalization and oxygen\n      supplementation, viscosity and transportability of sputum and personal impressions of\n      patients regarding the method of oxygen administration (questionnaire). Spirometry and\n      venous blood gas analysis will be performed after the second hospital day, and sputum\n      samples will be obtained in the first and third day of hospitalization. Clinical treatment\n      (antibiotics, etc) will be defined by the medical team of the institution, not involved in\n      the study. Expected Results: The use of high flow nasal cannula will result in significantly\n      less time of supplemental oxygen, with increased comfort for patients, without significant\n      differences in the levels of PaCO2. Sputum samples obtained from the patients treated with\n      the high flow nasal cannula will have lower viscosity and higher transportability as\n      compared to those obtained from patients treated with Venturi mask."
