  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Platelet recovery is significantly hampered following umbilical cord blood transplantation
      (UCB). Thus, after UCB transplantations, patients are platelet transfusion-dependent for
      prolong periods of time.

      Eltrombopag is a thrombopoietin-receptor agonist that initiates thrombopoietin-receptor
      signaling and thereby induces proliferation and maturation of megakaryocytes.

      We will evaluate the safety and efficacy of eltrombopag for enhancing platelet engraftment
      in pediatric patients undergoing cord blood transplantation.

    <description>Pediatric patients undergoing allogeneic UCB transplantation will receive eltrombopag from day +1 until platelet count has exceeded 50,000/microliter for 14 consecutive days without platelet transfusion.
Starting doses are 100 mg/d for children &gt;40 kg body weight (BW), 50 mg/d for children 20-40 kg BW, and 2 mg/kg/d for children &lt;20 kg BW.
If unsupported platelet count has not reached the threshold of 20,000/microliter, doses will be escalated every 2 weeks up to maximal doses of 200 mg/d for children ≥ 40 kg BW, 150 mg/d for children 20-40 kg BW and 3.5 mg/kg for children &lt;20 kg BW.</description>

    <description>Children ≥= 40 kg BW:
From day +1, start eltrombopag 100 mg/d. If primary end point not reached on day +14, then from day +15 - 150 mg/d. If primary end point not reached on day +28 then from day +29 - 200 mg/d (maximal dose).
Children 20-40 kg BW:
From day +1, start eltrombopag 50 mg/d. If primary end point not reached on day +14, then from day +15 - 75 mg/d. If primary end point not reached on day +28 then from day +29 - 100 mg/d.If primary end point not reached on day +42, then from day +43 and on - 150 mg/d (maximal dose).
Children &lt; 20 kg BW:
From day +1, start eltrombopag - 2 mg/kg/d. If primary end point not reached on day +14, then from day +15 - 3 mg/kg/d. If primary end point not reached on day +28 then from day +29 - 3.5 mg/kg (maximal dose).
If present dose not tolerated, return to last tolerated dose. Eltrombopag will be discontinued after platelet count has exceeded 50,000/microliter for 14 consecutive days without administration of platelets.</description>
