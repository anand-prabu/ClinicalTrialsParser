This study also evaluates the effect of rIL-2 on the immune system of these\n      patients.\n\n      IL-2 is a substance naturally produced by the body's white blood cells that plays an\n      important role in helping the body fight infection. HIV-infected patients do not produce\n      enough IL-2, and it is hoped that the use of rIL-2 may improve immune system function in\n      these patients. First, it is necessary to determine the safety and effectiveness of this\n      drug in HIV-infected children."

            "textblock": "According to study records, IL-2 has not been tested in HIV-infected children. Experience\n      with IL-2 in pediatric populations is extremely limited. Pahwa et al. gave 30,000 units/kg\n      daily IV to a child with severe combined immunodeficiency. This dose was well tolerated and\n      the patient improved clinically as well as immunologically. Part A is necessary to determine\n      the maximum tolerated dose of IL-2 in infected children. Part B will determine the efficacy\n      of the maximum tolerated dose in infected children.\n\n      Part A: Children will receive rIL-2 intravenously for 5 days every 8 weeks for 3 cycles. The\n      study will enroll 4 patients in each of 3 dose levels. Dose escalation may occur if all 4\n      patients in a dose level tolerate therapy without evidence of Grade 3 (or higher) toxicity.\n      If 1 of 4 subjects in any dose level experiences at least Grade 3 toxicity, 2 additional\n      patients will be enrolled in that dose level. If 1 of these 2 additional patients\n      experiences at least Grade 3 toxicity, dose escalation will not proceed. NOTE: Once Part A\n      is completed and the maximum tolerated dose is established, children who participated in\n      Part A and received less than the maximum tolerated dose will be offered additional therapy\n      consisting of 3 cycles of rIL-2 at the maximum tolerated dose.\n\n      Part B: Children will receive rIL-2 intravenously at the maximum tolerated dose established\n      in part A. Treatment  will be given for 5 days every 8 weeks for 3 cycles. [AS PER AMENDMENT\n      6/4/98: Children will receive rIL-2 intravenously at the lowest dose for 5 days every 8\n      weeks for 6 cycles. Patients who received this dose in part A will also be offered this\n      regimen.]"
