Substrate\n      replacement therapy is a potential therapeutic strategy based on the success of replacing\n      missing SA and reducing muscle disease in a relevant mouse model of the human disease\n      (Malicdan et al., 2009). Successful use of SA replacement therapy in humans is believed to\n      depend upon providing steady long-term exposure to the compound in an extended release form\n      (such as Sialic Acid-Extended Release [SA-ER]), given SA's short half-life. Following a\n      Phase 1 study to establish the pharmacokinetics for SA-ER and an ongoing Phase 2 study to\n      assess the pharmacodynamic effect of restoring sialylation of muscle by treatment over 48\n      weeks, Ultragenyx is conducting this study to evaluate the long term safety and efficacy of\n      an increased dosed of SA-ER combined with Sialic Acid-Immediate Release (SA-IR) capsules as\n      treatment, for up to 36 additional months."
