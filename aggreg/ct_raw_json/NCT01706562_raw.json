This study collects baseline information about underlying disease, sign of\n      fungal infection, neutropenia (a decrease in white blood cells), neutropenic fever duration\n      and the reason for discontinuation. Neutropenia is defined as a neutrophil (white blood\n      cell) count of \u2264500 cells/mm3 or a count of \u22641000 cells/mm3 with a predicted decrease to\n      \u2264500 cells/mm3. Fever is defined as a body temperature \u226538.3 Celsius degrees at least once a\n      day with no definite external factor or a body temperature of \u226538 Celsius degrees continued\n      for at least 1 hour."
