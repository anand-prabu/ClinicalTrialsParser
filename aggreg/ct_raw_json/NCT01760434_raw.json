            "textblock": "The investigators hypothesize that sagittal alignment and thoracic volumes will predict\n      successful treatment outcomes as measured by improved pulmonary function and health-related\n      quality of life in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis patients at a minimum 20-year follow-up.\n      Significant focus has been placed on the coronal plane in order to determine treatment\n      indications for scoliosis, but with new understanding about the important of sagittal\n      balance and pulmonary function, the treatment indications should be broadened.  Thus, the\n      investigators propose the following study to explore parameters associated with a durable\n      and acceptable outcome following scoliosis treatment, minimizing the need for further\n      surgery and to optimizing quality of life and pulmonary health.  Beyond the standard\n      radiographs and Scoliosis Research Society (SRS) scores, this study undertakes a\n      comprehensive assessment of health-related quality of life, chest asymmetry and body\n      satisfaction scoring, sagittal plane parameters, and 3D modeling of the childhood and\n      current spinothoracic deformity.  Thus, the investigators research team is uniquely poised\n      to determine broader treatment indications for scoliosis.   The overarching goal of this\n      research effort is to determine new parameters based on thoracic volume and sagittal plane\n      alignment in addition to coronal deformity in order to determine the appropriate treatment\n      threshold for surgical intervention in children with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis."
