Pregnant woman  in weeks 34-36 of gestation who did not receive a betamethasone course\n           to enhance fetal lung maturity during pregnancy\n\n        2.

Data on the neonate, including birth weight, 1\n      and 5 minute Apgar scores, and complications during the first week of life, including\n      hypoglycemia, seizures, intubation or medications will also be collected.\n\n      Prospective control group 100 women will be recruited who delivered in the hospital during\n      the study period in weeks 34-37 of pregnancy, who did not receive a course of betamethasone\n      during pregnancy.\n\n      Demographic data will be collected, full medical and obstetric anamnesis including current\n      and previous pregnancies.\n\n      After birth, data will be collected on the delivery, including birth week, method (vaginal,\n      cesarean, forceps, etc.), obstetric complications (abruption of the placenta, Premature\n      rupture of membranes,  preeclampsia, etc.). Data on the neonate, including birth weight, 1\n      and 5 minute Apgar scores, and complications during the first week of life, including\n      hypoglycemia, seizures, intubation or medications will also be collected.\n\n      Data will be collected over a one-year period.
