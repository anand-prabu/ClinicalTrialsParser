Twenty-four subjects with\n      type 2 diabetes mellitus will make three study visits. At each visit, the will consume an\n      orange-flavored beverage containing escalating amounts of erythritol (6, 12, and 18 grams).\n      Endothelial function will be assessed before and two hours after beverage consumption.\n      Endothelial function will be measured as the change in pulse amplitude in response to\n      reactive hyperemia measured in the fingertip by peripheral arterial tonometry. The results\n      will be used to plan a randomized, placebo-controlled study."
