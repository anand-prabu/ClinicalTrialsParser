  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative pain after cardiac surgery is a risk factor for postoperative complications.
      In cardiac surgery, pain is more intense during the first 48 hours and disturbs the
      patient's capacity of coughing, deep breathing, and early mobilisation. It may be
      responsible for respiratory complications such as bronchial or pulmonary infection, and may
      also delay the patient's rehabilitation and therefore prolong the duration of in-hospital
      stay. A previous pilot study performed in our department showed a sensible improvement of
      analgesia at movement and of rehabilitation with a continuous bilaterosternal infusion of
      local anaesthesia [Eljezi et al.. Reg Anesth Pain Med 2012; 37:166]. Such strategy shall be
      tested in a subpopulation of patients at risk for respiratory complication.

      Prospective, controlled, randomised, parallel, single-centre, single-blinded trial,
      comparing to a control (conventional care with no locoregional anaesthesia) an infusion of
      ropivacaine through two multihole catheters placed lateral to the sternum. In both groups,
      postoperative analgesia will be achieved by paracetamol plus titrated then self-administered
      intravenous morphine.
