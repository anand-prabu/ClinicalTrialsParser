II. Determine the qualitative and quantitative\n      toxicity, and reversibility of toxicity, of this regimen in this patient population.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients receive irinotecan IV over 90 minutes, leucovorin calcium IV over 15\n      minutes, and fluorouracil IV once weekly for 4 weeks followed by 2 weeks of rest. Treatment\n      continues every 6 weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.\n      Patients are followed at 30 days, and then until death.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-37 patients will be accrued for this study."
