            "textblock": "ROS1 is a receptor tyrosine kinase with constitutive kinase activity. ROS1 was previously\n      discovered in cell lines where ROS1 fused with other proteins to act as a driver oncogene.\n      In 2007, Rikova et al reported ROS1 fusion as driver mutations in NSCLC cell line (HCC78;\n      SLC34A2-ROS1) and NSCLC patient (CD74-ROS1). Li et al also found about 1% of samples\n      harboring CD74-ROS1 fusion in 202 resected lung adenocarcinomas from never smokers. The\n      incidence was as high as 10% in East Asian population. Currently there are now at least 13\n      ROS1 fusion variants involving 8 fusion partners (CD74-, SLC34A2-, FIG-, TPM3-, SDC4-,\n      LRIG3-, ERZ-, KDERL2-) identified in ROS1 positive NSCLC. LDK378 is an orally highly\n      selective and potent ALK kinase inhibitor. In preclinical studies, LDK378 has much lower\n      IC50 values than crizotinib in cell lines engineered to express ROS1 rearrangement (0.15 nM\n      versus 3 nM) and is approximately 20-fold more potent. LDK378 is a potent inhibitor of tumor\n      growth in rodent models of both ALCL and NSCLC.  We suggest a phase II trial of LDK378 in\n      advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients with ROS1 rearrangement. The aim of current\n      trial is to evaluate the antitumor efficacy and safety profile of LDK378 and to identify\n      biomarker to predict the tumor response to LDK378."
