In order to evaluate the effects of the two\n      different skin preparation techniques an intraindividual comparison of the skin reactivity\n      in terms of the immediate phase I reaction to serial dilutions of birch pollen extracts was\n      chosen. The serial dilution approach allows a dose dependent effect evaluation and\n      comparison of the sensitivity. The differences will be explained mainly by the two different\n      skin preparations allowing a quantitative comparison of these techniques."

            "textblock": "The Objective is the determination of the allergic skin reactivity to epicutaneoulsy applied\n      birch pollen allergen extract after skin preparation (microporation by P.L.E.A.S.E.\n      Professional) and standard skin prick test. By using the standard prick test the stratum\n      corneum is overcome by a single puncture (1 mm).\n\n      Micropores induced by P.L.E.A.S.E. Professional penetrate the stratum corneum less deep but\n      with a higher density (five pores). It is therefore suggested that a skin preparation with\n      micropores by P.L.E.A.S.E. Professional previously to the allergen contact may lead to a\n      higher sensitivity. Less allergen might still elicit a skin reaction which won?t be seen by\n      a conventional prick skin test. Whereas skin prick test may lead to true-negative (patient\n      shows no allergic reaction on prick skin test but is an allergy sufferer in clinic),\n      IgE-determination may lead to false-positives (patient is determined as allergy sufferer but\n      has no clinical symptoms). So the sensitivity with micropores skin preparation by\n      P.L.E.A.S.E. Professional could be a good compromise. The preparation of the skin with\n      P.L.E.A.S.E. Professional leads to a better understanding of the influence of different\n      types of skin injury patterns on the allergic skin reactivity. Namely, how important is the\n      role of the exposed area, the depth of injury and the keratinocyte activation.\n\n      This will be checked in a late phase reaction evaluation."
