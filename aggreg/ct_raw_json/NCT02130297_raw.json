An attempt will be made to determine the ideal timing for\n      treating the excision scar as previous studies have ranged from treating the day of the\n      excision up till 10 weeks post-excision (2-4).  In order to evaluate the treated portion\n      versus untreated portion of the scar, investigators and the subjects will use a quartile\n      rating scale.  In addition, punch biopsy samples will be taken to quantify the difference in\n      collagen architecture 9 weeks after treatment with the laser.\n\n      There will be a total of 7 study visits to include the day of the excision and laser\n      treatment if randomized to this group, post-op day number 10 for suture removal as well as\n      laser therapy if the subject has been randomized to that treatment group, 4 weeks post-op, 9\n      weeks post-op and laser treatment for subjects randomized to this time frame for treatment,\n      12 weeks post-op, 17 weeks post-op and 24 weeks post-op.  Each visit will last approximately\n      30-45 minutes each in which clinical photos of the surgical scar will be taken and any wound\n      care or side effects of the laser therapy or surgery will be addressed.  Healing and scar\n      appearance will be reviewed and rated at each of the six postsurgical visits."
