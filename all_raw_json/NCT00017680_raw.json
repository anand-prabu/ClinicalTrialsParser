Patients\n      then receive filgrastim (G-CSF) or another growth factor for 4-6 days as peripheral blood\n      stem cell (PBSC) mobilization.  PBSC (or bone marrow) is harvested over 2-3 days.\n\n      Patients receive high-dose melphalan IV over 30 minutes twice daily on days -2 and -1.  PBSC\n      and/or bone marrow is reinfused on day 0.  Patients receive G-CSF beginning on day 0 and\n      continuing until blood counts recover.  This course may be repeated 4-12 weeks later.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then annually for 5 years."
