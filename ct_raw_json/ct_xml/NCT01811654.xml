  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and effectiveness of intra-articular
      hyaluronan (IAHA) injections for the treatment of symptomatic patellofemoral pain syndrome
      (PFPS) and determine if this treatment can provide incremental clinical benefits over
      standard care for patients with this diagnosis.

    <description>A 100mm visual analog scale (VAS) for activity related pain assessment will serve as the primary outcome measure</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in PFPS Severity Scale (PSS) score</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and 3 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The PSS was specifically designed and tested on patients suffering from patellofemoral pain syndrome. In its original form, it is a visual analog scale (100 mm) for pain while performing 10 different activities that reflect typically painful movements for physically active subjects with PFPS. For the purposes of this study, the PSS was modified from a 10 cm visual analog scale to a 10 point Likert scale. This modified PSS will be used by all subjects. In addition, patients will be asked to identify which activity within the PSS is most painful to them.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Tegner Activity Scale score</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and 3 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The Tegner activity scale will be used as an additional secondary outcome measure in this study because it has been demonstrated to be a valid clinimetric instrument for assessing function in patients with knee pain. The Tegner activity scale uses a numerical scale ranging from 0 to 10. Each value indicates the ability to perform specific activities. An activity level of 10 corresponds to participation in competitive sports, including soccer, football, and rugby at the elite level. Whereas an activity level of 0 is assigned if a person is on sick leave or receiving a disability pension because of knee problems.</description>

    <arm_group_type>No Intervention</arm_group_type>
    <description>Patients in this group will receive treatment per standard care.  Standard Care is defined as consisting of physical therapy, activity modification (relative rest), and/or oral analgesic therapy. A specific physical therapy (PT) protocol will be implemented.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>Patients assigned to this group will receive treatment per standard care AND three (3) consecutive weekly injections of intra-articular hyaluronan (Euflexxa). Oral analgesics will be used at the lowest dose and for the shortest time possible to treat PFPS symptoms.</description>

    <description>IAHA was approved by the FDA in 1997 as a synovial fluid replacement device to help relieve the pain associated with knee osteoarthritis (OA) in patients who fail to respond adequately to conservative treatment and simple analgesics.  In this study, IAHA, specifically Euflexxa, will be used off-label to determine whether patients afflicted with PFPS will experience similar analgesic effects as seen in those with OA.</description>
