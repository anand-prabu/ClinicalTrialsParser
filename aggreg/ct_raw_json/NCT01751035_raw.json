Adolescents\n      receiving RRFT and their caregivers will report improvement in empirically-demonstrated risk\n      and protective factors for substance use and abuse at the individual level (e.g., coping)\n      and at each level of an adolescent's ecology (e.g., increased number of positive family\n      activities, reduced family conflict, reduced number of peers who use drugs, improved school\n      attendance, increased involvement in pro-social community activities) during treatment and\n      follow-up than control adolescents who receive TAU. Adolescents receiving RRFT will\n      experience less PTSD symptoms (per youth and caregiver reports) during treatment and\n      follow-up than control adolescents who receive TAU. Adolescents receiving RRFT will report\n      engaging in fewer risky sexual behaviors (e.g., increased condom use, fewer partners) during\n      treatment and follow-up than control adolescents who receive TAU. Changes during treatment\n      in family relations (familial cohesiveness and conflict, satisfaction with caregiver-youth\n      relationship) and parenting practices (monitoring) will mediate changes in substance use.\n      Changes during treatment in emotional reactivity will mediate changes in PTSD symptoms."
