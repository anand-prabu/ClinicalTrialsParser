    <textblock>
      This research is studying the effect that Resolvine injection will have on patients with
      vitreomacular adhesion. The investigators propose that intravitreal injection of Resolvine®
      36% will: 1)Result in release of the vitreous adhesion to the macula in subjects with
      symptomatic vitreomacular attachment (VMA). 2)The Release of the VMA will create a
      measurable and favorable retinal change. 3) The release of vitreomacular traction may also
      result in visual acuity improvement within the short time frame of this study.

    <description>The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety of an active arm treated with Resolvine®  36%, which may contain up to two 100-microliter intravitreal injections, in comparison to a control arm treated with Resolvine 9%, which may contain up to two 100-microliter injections, in subjects with VMA. Cumulative adverse event rates for each arm will be evaluated.</description>

    <description>These analyses will compare the efficacy an active arm treated with Resolvine® 36%, which may contain up to two 100-microliter intravitreal injections, to a control arm treated with Resolvine 9%, which may contain up to two 100-microliter injections, to assess inducement of a more extensive PVD over the study period as demonstrated by Trese Grade III or higher B-Scan Ultrasound and OCT.</description>

    <description>These analyses will assess a parameter of improved eye function as calculated by either the reduction in the retinal thickness of at least 10% over baseline at Day 0 as quantified by OCT, or an improvement in visual acuity of more than 10% over baseline at day 0 as quantified by ETDRS.</description>

          5. If both eyes are found to have Anatomic VMA the eye with lower visual acuity will be
             declared the study eye.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects with high myopia in the study eye (axial length greater than or equal to
             26.0 millimeters by ultrasound or spherical equivalent at the spectacle plane greater
