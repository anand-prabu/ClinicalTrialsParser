Courses are repeated every 4\n      weeks. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      The dose of MG98 is escalated in cohorts of 1-6 patients until the maximum tolerated dose\n      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6\n      patients experience dose limiting toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed at week 4, then at least every 3 months until relapse of disease.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 20 patients will be accrued for this study within 10-12\n      months."
