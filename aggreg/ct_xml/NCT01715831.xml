    <textblock>
      This multicenter, open-label, single-arm extension study will evaluate the long-term safety
      of RoActemra/Actemra (tocilizumab) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.  Patients who have
      completed the MA21488 core study and the ML21530 study and who could benefit from the study
      drug, according to the opinion of the investigator, will receive 8 mg/kg of intravenous
      RoActemra/Actemra every four weeks. The anticipated time on study treatment is 104 weeks.
