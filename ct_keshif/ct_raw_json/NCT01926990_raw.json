Demonstrate quantitative perfusion CT characteristics can predict early response to\n      targeted therapeutics in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC).\n\n      II. Correlate CT results with circulating tumor cells (circulating tumor cells [CTC]\n      collection and analysis covered under separate protocol, e-protocol 12597) to predict\n      response to targeted therapies (TT) in advanced RCC.\n\n      OUTLINE:\n\n      Patients undergo perfusion CT at baseline, 7 days, and 12 weeks.\n\n      After completion of study, patients are followed up for 1 year."
