  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to find out if the drug Bortezomib (VELCADE ®), along
      with a procedure called plasmapheresis, can be effective at desensitization.

      Bortezomib works is by decreasing plasma cells in the blood.  Plasma cells produce
      antibodies.  Plasmapheresis is a procedure that removes antibodies from the  blood. Plasma
      cells and the antibodies they produce can be involved in rejection after organ
      transplantation.    This trial is trying to see if decreasing plasma cells and antibodies
      with Bortezomib and plasmapheresis can reduce complications while participants are waiting
      for their transplant and improve heart transplantation outcomes.
