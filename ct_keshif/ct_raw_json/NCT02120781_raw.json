Follow-up examinations\n      will be performed at 1, 4, 8, and 12 months after the final treatment.  If there are any\n      evident safety issues, follow-up treatments will be delayed or withheld.\n\n      In the Blinded Phase of the study, subjects will be followed for safety and efficacy for 4\n      months after the final treatment.  After all subjects have completed the 4-month follow-up\n      visit, the study will be unblinded and subjects will continue to be followed for safety for\n      12 months after the final treatment.  Efficacy assessments will be made through the 12-month\n      follow-up visit in order to document any duration of effect.  All AEs that have an onset\n      date from biopsy through the 4-month follow-up visit will be recorded."
