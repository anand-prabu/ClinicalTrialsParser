Patients undergo\n           collection of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) on day -4. The PBMC are\n           cultured with sargramostim (GM-CSF) and interleukin-4 for 5 days and CD40 ligand for 24\n           hours and then pulsed for 2 hours with the appropriate peptide to form a vaccine.\n           Patients receive ras peptide-pulsed dendritic cell vaccine IV over 5 minutes on days 1,\n           15, 29, 43, and 57.\n\n        -  Group B: Patients undergo collection of PBMC and receive vaccination as in group A.\n           Patients also receive interleukin-2 subcutaneously on days 2-6 and 9-13.\n\n      Treatment in both groups repeats every 2 weeks for up to 5 vaccinations in the absence of\n      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed on days 75, 90, 120, and 365.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 500 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years."
