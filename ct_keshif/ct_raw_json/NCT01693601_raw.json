A 3+3standard dose\n      escalation scheme will be employed and the occurrence of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs)\n      will be captured and the occurrence of such events will determine dose cohort escalation by\n      predetermined and established rules. In addition to establishing the DLTs, maximally\n      tolerated dose (MTD), and recommended phase II dose (RPTD) in the phase I portion of this\n      trial, exploratory biomarkers will be evaluated within phase I as well. Pharmacodynamics and\n      exploratory genetic and epigenetic biomarkers will be explored as predictors of response to\n      therapy. The RPTD cohort will be expanded to incorporate   a total of 22 patients, including\n      6 from phase I, in order to assess clinical response as assessed by International Working\n      Group for Myelofibrosis Research and Treatment (IWG-MRT) as a primary endpoint for the phase\n      II portion of this trial."
