  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Airway epithelium is composed of 4 major cell types, including ciliated cells, secretory
      cells, undifferentiated columnar cells, and basal cells (BC). The earliest changes
      associated with the development of smoking-induced lung diseases, such as chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung cancer, occur in the airway epithelium,
      including BC hyperplasia, squamous metaplasia, mucous cell hyperplasia and metaplasia,
      impaired ciliated cell structure and function, loss of Clara cells, and increased epithelial
      permeability due to impaired junctional barrier. The focus of this study is to look at how
      smoking-induced EGF alters the ability of BC to form normally differentiated airway
      epithelium.
