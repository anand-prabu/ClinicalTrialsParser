Data will be collected mainly\n      from questionnaires administered to pregnant women at these visits. The questionnaires\n      contain the following standard questions which will be asked at each visit, in addition to\n      some visit-specific questions related to delivery and health status of infants up to 90 days\n      of age. The standard questions will be related to the following aspects:\n\n        -  Logistics of transportation to the study site (type, time it takes, cost incurred)\n\n        -  Accessibility to a telephone/cell phone\n\n        -  Provisions of alternative child care during site visits if there are other children\n           under the subject's care"
