  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to test the efficacy of using standard immune therapy for melanoma prior to
      stereotactic radiosurgery (ipilimumab induction), as compared to stereotactic radiosurgery
      followed by immune therapy. The study's hypothesis is that  ipilimumab induction is as good
      as or better than controlling brain metastases as compared to stereotactic radiosurgery
      followed by immune therapy.

      This is a randomized Phase II selection study investigating the use of ipilimumab induction
      prior to stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), versus no induction, for melanoma brain
      metastases. Participants will be randomized to Arm A &quot;Induction&quot; (two doses of  ipilimumab
      prior to SRS, two doses of ipilimumab after SRS)  versus Arm B &quot;No induction&quot; (SRS first,
      followed by 4 doses of ipilimumab). Participants will undergo multiple dynamic
      contrast-enhanced MRIs of the brain and submit blood samples for immune testing.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a histologically-confirmed diagnosis of melanoma who have imaging
             findings suggestive of 1 to 4 brain metastases

          -  At least one lesion in the brain that is measurable, which is defined as ≥5 x 5mm
             (Prior craniotomy and surgical resection is allowed, as long as there is at least one
             remaining measurable lesion in the brain)

          -  Patients must be candidates for stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and planning to
             undergo SRS

          -  Patients must be candidates for ipilimumab as determined by the treating physician

          -  Patients must be neurologically asymptomatic, or very minimally symptomatic, as
             judged by the treating physicians

          -  At least 3 weeks has elapsed from any prior therapy, and the patient has recovered
             from side effects to ≤ grade 1 toxicities per  Common Terminology Criteria (CTC) for
             Adverse Events

          -  Age &gt; or = 18 years old

          -  Performance status of ECOG of 0 or 1 (ECOG is the Eastern Oncology Cooperative Group
             Scoring system used to quantify cancer patients' general well-being and activities of
             daily life; scores range from 0 to 5 where 0 is perfect health and 5 is death)

          -  Adequate organ and marrow function:  alanine aminotransferase (ALT ) &lt; 2.5x's upper
             limit of normal (ULN) of the institutional normal reference range, aspartate
             aminotransferase (AST) &lt; 2.5x's ULN of the institutional normal reference range,
             Bilirubin &lt; 1.5x's ULN of the institutional normal reference range, Creatinine &lt; 2.0

          -  Previous radiotherapy to the lesion(s) of interest, including prior treatment with
             whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT). Prior treatment with SRS is allowed if the
             index lesion(s) is in a different, non-contiguous location than the previously
             treated lesion.

          -  Patients who have previously received ipilimumab, PD-1 inhibitors or PD-L1 inhibitors
             are excluded due to the potential of effects on primary outcome

          -  Patients who require WBRT or surgery at the time of enrollment

          -  Neurologic symptoms or imaging findings that necessitate the use of steroids on the
             day of enrollment or in the prior 7 days

          -  Highly suspicious magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or cerebrospinal fluid evidence of
             leptomeningeal metastases, unless all measurable disease is localized and SRS is
             considered the treatment of choice

          -  Concurrent treatment with any other anti-neoplastic drug or concurrent participation
             in another therapeutic clinical trial

             implanted cardiac defibrillator, aneurysm clips, history of allergic
             reaction/hypersensitivity to gadolinium)

          -  Women who are pregnant or are nursing

          -  Patients with absolute lymphocyte count of &lt;500 cells/microliter, who are known to be
             HIV positive, who have clinically significant active autoimmune disease, or are
