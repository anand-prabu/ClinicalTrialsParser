            "textblock": "Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD), in both its acute and chronic forms, is the major\n      intrinsic complication of allogeneic hematopoeitic stem cell transplant (allo-HSCT).\n      Moreover, chronic GvHD may be regarded as a \"late effect\" of cancer therapy, and the\n      severity of chronic GvHD is the chief determinant of long-term survival following allo-HSCT.\n       Unfortunately, the investigators understanding (and thus management) of chronic GvHD is not\n      optimal; a recent NIH Consensus Conference has defined inadequacies in virtually all facets\n      of chronic GvHD management.  Notably for this study, the lack of suitable biomarkers\n      compromises diagnosis, staging and therapeutic response evaluation of chronic GvHD - and\n      also hinders better understanding of the biology of this process.\n\n      In particular, the activity of chronic GvHD is often difficult to discern, potentially\n      causing either undertreatment, with the risk of morbidity and/or mortality due to\n      uncontrolled chronic GvHD, or possibly overtreatment, with potent ISTs causing unnecessary\n      toxicity. Obviously, the development of reliable biomarkers of chronic GvHD activity would\n      be a very useful advance in addressing this problem, as well as other facets of management\n      not addressed due to certain limitations, as detailed herein.\n\n      Potentially, certain imaging technologies could address this problem.  To date, imaging\n      technology has been used only sporadically in chronic GvHD and is not an integral part of\n      routine assessments.  However, and despite its nonspecific nature, certain \"inflammatory\"\n      features of  some chronic GvHD cases, plus clinical similarity to certain autoimmune\n      diseases in which functional imaging has been tested in research trials - (and perhaps\n      notably), a limited experience in acute GvHD - the investigators postulate that Positron\n      emission tomography - computed tomography (PET-CT) scans may be useful as a biomarker of\n      disease activity in chronic GvHD.  This protocol is an initial effort to that end."

(It is recognized that some patients develop chronic GvHD while on\n             immunosuppressive prophylaxis; such patients will remain eligible, even if dose\n             adjustment of these prophylactic agents occurs.  The \"two week\" interval pertains to\n             the use of additional agents in this case.)\n\n          -  Diagnosis of chronic GvHD must be confirmed.  In the usual case, tissue biopsy will\n             be required; however, some chronic GvHD patients do not require tissue biopsy for\n             confirmation.

Patients either pregnant or unwilling to use\n             satisfactory contraception (if appropriate) will not be eligible.  All female\n             patients must use a highly effective birth control method or a combination of 2\n             additionally effective birth control methods while in this study.  Examples of highly\n             effective birth control are: a condom or a diaphragm with spermicidal jelly, oral,\n             injectable, or implanted birth control, or abstinence."
