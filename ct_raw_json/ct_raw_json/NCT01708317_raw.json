In order to do this, we are\n      asking all relatives including your parents or guardians to respect several things so that\n      you may participate:\n\n        -  We cannot tell family or friends the exact questions on the survey\n\n        -  You must be given complete privacy to answer the questions\n\n        -  The answers will only be shown to the healthcare team taking care of them today and the\n           people running the study - family members will not be shown the answers\n\n        -  Family and friends will not pressure you to discuss the survey or their answers after\n           you are done\n\n        -  You will be given privacy to discuss their answers with the healthcare team\n\n      If you do not feel your friends and family can respect these requests, then you cannot take\n      the survey and cannot enroll in the study.\n\n      If you agree to these requests, we will use a private area and allow you to use a computer\n      to do the following:\n\n        -  Explain in more detail what types of questions we will ask and why they are important\n\n        -  Tell you how we will use your answers to improve their health care\n\n        -  Give you a chance to answer any questions you have about the study\n\n        -  Answer a series of questions about yourself and your health\n\n      You are allowed to skip any questions you do not want to answer and can stop at any time.\n\n      After you have completed the survey, a summary of your answers will become part of your\n      medical record from today and be shown to the doctors and nurses taking care of you today.\n\n      Most participants will be asked to review their answers in private with the doctors and\n      nurses taking care of them.
