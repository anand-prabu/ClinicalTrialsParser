It too has been approved by the\n      FDA to treat other types of cancer, but not for breast cancer.\n\n      In this study the investigators will be combining both of these two treatments, but at\n      different doses.\n\n      One third of the patients will take Crizotinib 200 mg, twice daily with Sunitinib 25.0 mg\n      once a day.\n\n      One third of the patients will take Crizotinib 250 mg, twice daily with Sunitinib 25.0 mg\n      once a day, and One third of the patients will take Crizotinib 250 mg, twice daily with\n      Sunitinib 37.5 mg once a day."
