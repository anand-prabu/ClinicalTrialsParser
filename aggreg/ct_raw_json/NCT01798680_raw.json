Observational studies have shown low vitamin D is a risk factor\n      for HIV progression and incidence of pulmonary tuberculosis among adults initiating HAART;\n      however, whether this relationship is causal and if vitamin D supplementation starting at\n      HAART initiation can improve health outcomes has not been determined. This study is a\n      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted to examine the effect of\n      vitamin D3 supplementation on morality and pulmonary tuberculosis for adults initiating\n      HAART. Participants are HIV-positive Tanzanian men and women aged 18 years and older, who\n      are initiating HAART at the time of randomization whose baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D\n      (25(OH)D) concentration is <30ng/mL. Eligible individuals are randomized to receive a) a\n      vitamin D3 regimen consisting 50,000 IU of vitamin D3 taken orally once per week for 4 weeks\n      (weeks 0, 1, 2, 3) followed by 2,000 IU of vitamin D3 supplements taken orally once per day\n      starting at 4 weeks until study discharge at 12 months or b) placebo pills taken once weekly\n      for 4 weeks (weeks 0, 1, 2, 3) followed by placebo pills taken daily starting at 4 weeks\n      until study discharge.  Participants will be followed for 12 months after ART initiation."
