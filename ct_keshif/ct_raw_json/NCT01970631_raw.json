The US Department of Human and Health Services\n      (DHHS) guidelines recommend that adults engage in >150 minutes of moderate physical activity\n      per week. However, adherence to PA guidelines is poor in the general population,\n      particularly in persons with knee OA.\n\n      Total knee replacement (TKR) is widely used in patients with symptomatic, advanced knee OA.\n      While the vast majority of persons undergoing TKR experience considerable reduction in pain\n      and improvement in functional capacity, far fewer take this opportunity to become more\n      physically active. Since physical activity has a direct relationship with quality of life\n      and with prevention and amelioration of many chronic conditions, many TKR recipients do not\n      derive maximum benefits from the procedure.\n\n      The focus of this proposal is to conduct a proof of concept RCT to establish the efficacy of\n      a behavioral economics-based intervention that would facilitate engagement in physical\n      activity and improve adherence to PA guidelines in the growing population of TKR recipients.\n      We address the innovative hypothesis that the period following TKR presents a window of\n      opportunity to fundamentally change attitudes and beliefs regarding PA, and that tangible\n      economic incentives will effectively induce behavior change and facilitate adherence to PA\n      guidelines."
