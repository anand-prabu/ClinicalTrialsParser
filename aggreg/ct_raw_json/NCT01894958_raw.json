            "textblock": "Fragile X Syndrome is a genetically determined neurological disorder in which affected\n      individuals are intellectually handicapped to varying degrees and display a variety of\n      associated psychiatric symptoms. Clinically, Fragile X Syndrome is characterized by\n      intellectual handicap, hyperactivity and attentional problems, autism spectrum symptoms,\n      emotional lability and epilepsy.  The epilepsy seen in Fragile X Syndrome is most commonly\n      present in childhood, but then gradually remits towards adulthood.  Physical features such\n      as prominent ears and jaw, and hyper-extensibility of joints are frequently present but are\n      not diagnostic.  Intellectual handicap is the most common feature defining the phenotype.\n      Treatment for the disorder is symptomatic - focusing on the management of symptoms - and\n      supportive, requiring a multidisciplinary approach.\n\n      This study will investigate the safety and tolerability of treatment with oral\n      administration of NNZ-2566 at 35 mg/kg or 70 mg/kg BID in adolescent or adult males with\n      Fragile X Syndrome. The study also will also investigate measures of efficacy during\n      treatment."

Males, aged 14-40 years\n\n          3. Subjects with a Clinical Global Impression - Severity (CGI-S) score of 4 or greater\n             at Screening\n\n          4. Subjects with a total score of 30 or greater on the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC)\n             at Screening\n\n          5. Current treatment with no more than 3 psychotropic medications.  This includes\n             medications used to treat problems with sleep onset and sleep continuity. Melatonin\n             for difficulties with sleep onset is permissible and is excepted from the count of\n             psychotropic medications.  Similarly, anti-epileptic medications are permitted and\n             are not denoted as \"psychotropic medications\" if they are used for treatment of\n             seizures.  Use of anti-epileptics for other indications such as the treatment of mood\n             disorders counts towards the limit of permitted medications.  Concurrent use of\n             omega-3 fatty acids is also permissible and does not count towards the allowed number\n             of concomitant psychotropic medications. A complete list of permitted concomitant\n             psychotropic medications can be found in Appendix A.\n\n          6. Concomitant medications for chronic medical conditions are permissible.  Examples of\n             chronic medical conditions include gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and asthma.\n             Every effort should be made to keep the doses and dosing regimens of these\n             medications stable in the 4 weeks preceding Screening and during the period between\n             Screening and the commencement of study medication.\n\n               1. Permitted psychotropic concomitant medications (except for anti-epileptic\n                  medications-see below) must be stable, in terms of dose and dosing regimen, for\n                  at least 4 weeks prior to Screening and must remain stable during the period\n                  between Screening and the commencement of study medication.\n\n               2. Anti-epileptic medications must be at a stable dose and dosing regimen for 12\n                  weeks prior to Screening and must remain stable during the period between\n                  Screening and the commencement of study medication\n\n          7. Behavioral treatments excluding psychotherapy (see exclusion criteria) must be stable\n             for 4 weeks prior to Screening and must remain stable during the period between\n             Screening and the commencement of study medication\n\n             a. For each enrollee, every effort should be made to maintain stable regimens of\n             allowed concomitant medications and allowed behavioral therapies from the time of\n             commencement of single-blind study medication until the last study assessment.\n\n          8. Sufficient expressive language capabilities to complete the Expressive Language\n             Sampling Task.\n\n          9.

History of, or current, cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, respiratory and/or\n             gastrointestinal disease, which may interfere with the absorption, distribution,\n             metabolism or excretion of the study medication, or which may interfere with the\n             interpretation of the safety/tolerability or efficacy of the study medication.\n\n          5. History of, or current cerebrovascular disease or clinically significant brain\n             trauma.\n\n          6.
