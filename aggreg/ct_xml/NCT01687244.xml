    <textblock>
      This Phase 2 study is designed to assess the efficacy and safety of INSTILADRIN (rAd-IFN
      with Syn3) when given intravesically to patients with high grade non-muscle invasive bladder
      cancer who are refractory to or have relapsed from BCG therapy.  The pharmacodynamics of
      INSTILADRIN will also be studied by measuring the interferon (IFNα2b) levels excreted in the
      urine.  rAd-IFN is a non-replicating recombinant adenovirus type 5 (Ad5)-vector encoding the
       interferon alpha-2b (IFNα2b) gene. Syn 3 is clinical surfactant excipient which enhances
      the ability of the adenoviral vector to transfect cells in the bladder wall.

      Criteria for Evaluation:

      Efficacy:  A Response is defined as no evidence of recurrence of a high grade tumor by
      cystoscopy, cytology or if clinically indicated, biopsy.

      Safety:  The safety and tolerability of INSTILADRIN will be evaluated based on adverse event
      reports, vital signs, ECGs, clinical laboratory values and results of physical examination.

          3. Subjects with high grade BCG-refractory or relapsed NMIBC including

               -  High grade non-invasive papillary carcinomas (Ta) and subjects with high grade

                  either maintenance or re-induction at 3 months.  Adequate induction is defined
                  as a minimum of 5 out of 6 induction doses and adequate maintenance is defined
