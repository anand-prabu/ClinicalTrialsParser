Determine the levels of iduronate-2-sulfatase enzyme in these patients attained by\n      infusing increasing doses of lymphocytes transduced with a retroviral vector designed for\n      insertion and expression of this iduronate-2-sulfatase gene (L2SN).\n\n      III.  Determine the duration of survival of these transduced cells in these patients.\n\n      IV.  Determine whether monthly infusion of L2SN-transduced lymphocytes accomplishes\n      metabolic correction (as measured by glycosaminoglycan excretion), decrease in liver or\n      spleen volume, any therapeutic effect upon cardiac and pulmonary dysfunction, or any other\n      effects from treatment."
