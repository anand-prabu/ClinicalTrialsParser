The fibroblast growth factor/fibroblast\n      growth factor receptor (FGF/FGFR) signaling pathway is important for normal organ, vascular\n      and skeletal development.  However, FGFR gene abnormalities have been linked to various\n      cancers.\n\n      TAS-120 is a highly potent, selective small molecule inhibitor of FGFR and is therefore is\n      being studied as a therapy for cancer."
