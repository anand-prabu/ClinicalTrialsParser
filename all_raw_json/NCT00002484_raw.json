Computer systems\n      that allow doctors to create a 3-dimensional picture of the tumor in order to plan treatment\n      may result in more effective radiation therapy.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of high-dose radiation therapy planned\n      using a 3-dimensional picture of the tumor in treating patients who have stage I, stage II,\n      or stage III non-small cell lung cancer."

The MTD is defined as the dose at which no more than 20% of\n      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed at 1 month and then every 4 months thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60-70 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years."
