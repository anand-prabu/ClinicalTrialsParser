Determine the efficacy of phenylacetate in terms of response rate and time to\n      progression in children with recurrent or progressive brain tumors, or with previously\n      untreated poor prognosis brain tumors. II. Assess the toxicity of phenylacetate in these\n      patients treated at the maximum tolerated dose. III. Determine the correlation between serum\n      steady state phenylacetate levels and toxicity or response in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified by histologic type (anaplastic astrocytoma and glioblastoma\n      multiforme vs brain stem glioma vs medulloblastoma and primitive neuroectodermal tumors vs\n      ependymoma vs low grade glioma vs others). Patients receive phenylacetate as a continuous\n      intravenous infusion on days 1-28. Courses of treatment are given continuously without rest.\n      Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients\n      are followed weekly.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 9-30 patients per stratum will be accrued for this study in 2\n      years."
