  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter study of Brincidofovir (CMX001) (BCV) administered twice weekly (BIW)
      for the treatment of AdV infection detected during asymptomatic AdV viremia or during
      symptomatic AdV infection. After completing a screening assessment to confirm study
      eligibility, all enrolled subjects will undergo a treatment period of 12 weeks. Beginning on
      Day 1, adult (â‰¥ 18 years) and adolescent (13-17 years) subjects weighing &gt; 50 kg will
      receive BCV 100 mg BIW; children up to 12 years of age will receive weight-based doses of 2
      mg/kg BIW, not-to-exceed a total dose of 200 mg/week.
