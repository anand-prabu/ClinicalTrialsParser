However, there\n      is previous research conducted that has indicated that after administration of oxytocin,\n      adults with ASD demonstrated improvements in social cognition, and reduced repetitive\n      behaviours and anxiety. There is also early research to suggest that children may also\n      benefit in these areas. The purpose of this study is to test if oxytocin works to help\n      children and adolescents with ASD."

The Principal Investigator and Co-Principal Investigator of this\n      study have previously documented: 1) an association between ASD and a single nuclear\n      polymorphism of the oxytocin receptor gene, 2) ability to measure oxytocin levels in the\n      blood by enzyme immunoassay and 3) preliminary data to support safety and efficacy of\n      intranasal oxytocin in the treatment of social deficits and repetitive behaviors in adults\n      with autism.  A medication treatment targeting the core deficits of ASD in childhood is\n      highly valuable because it could influence the developmental trajectory and make further\n      psychosocial interventions possible.  In this context, we propose a randomized placebo\n      controlled trial of intranasal oxytocin in children and adolescents with ASD."
