Autoimmune cytopenias are\n      low blood counts due to antibodies or proteins produced against an individual's own blood\n      cells.  Having a low red blood cell count (anemia) can make a person feel tired and require\n      blood transfusions frequently. A low platelet count (blood cells that help blood to clot)\n      can make a person bleed or bruise easily. A low neutrophil (white blood cell) count can make\n      a person have infections.\n\n      All of these things can be a serious complication after bone marrow transplant and can cause\n      prolonged hospital stay. Bortezomib is being used in children with certain types of blood\n      cancer, however, bortezomib has not been used in children with autoimmune cytopenia(s) and\n      its use in this study is investigational."
