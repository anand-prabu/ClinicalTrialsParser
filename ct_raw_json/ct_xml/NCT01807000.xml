  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phase I study to evaluate the excretion of radioactivity, the metabolic profile,
      pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability following a single oral administration of [14C]
      Prucalopride Succinate in healthy male volunteers aged 18 to 50 years (inclusive).The
      purpose of this study is to investigate how and how quickly Prucalopride Succinate or its
      break down products are excreted by analysing blood, faeces and urine samples collected
      during the study.
