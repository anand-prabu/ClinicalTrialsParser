  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if daily consumption of a probiotic in the period
      before, during and after academic exams will help maintain digestive and immune health and
      quality of life of undergraduate students.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial will be used. Healthy full-time
      undergraduate students will be recruited from the University of Florida via flyers, emails,
      announcements, etc. Informed consent will be obtained and the inclusion/exclusion criteria
      will be reviewed to determine whether a participant qualifies for the study. All
      participants will be consented for the main six-week intervention and a subgroup
      (n=50/group) of these students will be consented to provide two stool samples.

      Participants will provide saliva and stool samples (for the sub-group)during the
      pre-baseline week and during the week of final exams at approximately week 4. At the
      randomization visit, height, weight and age will be obtained. Participants will be
      stratified based on body mass index and randomized via sealed envelopes to one of four
      groups: Lactobacillus helveticus, Bifidobacterium longum  ssp. Infantis, Bifidobacterium
      bifidum or the placebo (n=145/group). Participants will take the study provided capsule of
      probiotic or placebo daily for 6 weeks. Participants will receive daily questionnaires via
      email throughout the prebaseline week and the 6-week intervention. Daily questionnaires will
      ask about intake of the supplement, cold symptoms, and general health (i.e., new
      medications, doctor visits). Throughout the study, participants will also be asked to
      complete weekly questionnaires (inquiring about gastrointestinal symptoms and physical
      activity) and Quality of Life Questionnaires (administered during pre-baseline, final exam
      week and week 6 of the study).

    <description>The intensity of cold/flu symptoms (running/congested nose, stiffness or chills, headache, cough, fatigue, fever, sore throat, achiness, and ear discomfort)will be scored as 0 (not experiencing) to 3 (severe). The symptom intensity from the 9 cold/flu symptoms will be summed to obtain a symptom intensity score. A symptom intensity score of &gt;6 will be designated as a day of cold. The mean proportion of days without a cold/flu will be compared between each probiotic and the placebo.</description>
