        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of CSU refractory to H1 antihistamines with/without LTRAs, as defined by
             the following:

          -  The presence of itch and hives for &gt; 6 consecutive weeks at any time prior to
             enrollment despite use of H1 antihistamines during this time period

          -  UAS7 score greater than 16 and itch component of UAS7 greater than 8 during 7 days
             prior to Day 1. Patients must have been on daily stable doses of H1 antihistamine for
             at least 3 consecutive days immediately prior to the screening visit and must
             document current use at screening

          -  CSU diagnosed for more than 6 months

          -  Patients must have a minimum diary compliance (6 out of 7 consecutive days) prior to
             Day 1

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Treatment with an investigational agent within 30 days of screening, and previous
             treatment with monoclonal antibody therapies used to treat CSU 9 months prior to
             screening

          -  Chronic urticarias other than CSU, including the following: Acute, solar,
             cholinergic, heat, cold, aquagenic, delayed pressure or contact.

          -  Other diseases and conditions with symptoms of urticaria.

          -  Routine doses of the following medications within 30 days prior to screening:
             systemic or topical corticosteroids (prescription or over the counter),
             hydroxychloroquine, methotrexate, cyclosporine, or cyclophosphamide

          -  IV immunoglobulin G (IVIG), or plasmapheresis within 30 days prior to screening

          -  Patients with cancer, history of cancer considered uncured or in complete remission
             for &lt; 10 years, or currently under work-up for suspected cancer except non-melanoma
             skin cancer that has been treated or excised and is considered resolved

          -  History of anaphylactic shock without clearly identifiable avoidable antigen

          -  Presence of clinically significant cardiovascular, neurological, psychiatric,
             metabolic or other pathological conditions.

          -  Medical examination or laboratory findings that suggest the possibility of
             decompensation of co-existing conditions for the duration of the study.

          -  Evidence of current drug or alcohol abuse

          -  Nursing women and women of childbearing potential, unless using effective
             contraception as defined by protocol
