Thirty two (32)\n      healthy participants are planned to be included in total, in four cohorts (groups).\n      Participants in each cohort will receive JNJ-42165279 (n=6) or placebo (n=2) once-daily for\n      10 consecutive days. In Part 1, two cohorts of healthy male participants, 18 to 55 years of\n      age, will be enrolled. Cohort A will receive 50 mg JNJ-42165279 or placebo for 10 days, and\n      Cohort B will receive 30 mg JNJ-42165279 or placebo for 10 days. In Part 2, Cohort C will\n      consist of 8 healthy female participants of non-childbearing potential (surgically sterile\n      or postmenopausal), 18 to 58 years of age, who will receive 100 mg JNJ-42165279 or placebo\n      for 10 days. Cohort D will consist of 8 healthy elderly male or female participants, from 65\n      to 85 years of age, who will receive 100 mg JNJ-42165279 or placebo for 10 days. The dose\n      may be adapted before each cohort starts based on available data. The maximum dose will not\n      exceed 100 mg once-daily. For all participants, this study will consist of an eligibility\n      screening examination (between 28 and 3 days prior to the first dose administration), a\n      double-blind treatment phase consisting of 2 days before dosing, 10 dosing days (Day 1 to\n      10), 4 days after dosing (Day 11 to 14), and a follow-up examination (within 7 to 14 days\n      after last dose administration).
