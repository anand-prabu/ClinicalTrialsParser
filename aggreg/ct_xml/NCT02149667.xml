  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sponsor is conducting this post market clinical follow-up (PMCF) study to evaluate the
      safety and efficacy of its total hip arthroplasty (THA) components marketed in the European
      Union (EU) .  These types of studies are required by regulatory authorities for all THA
      devices that do not have medium to long-term clinical evidence available at the time of
      gaining approval to market in the EU.  This study has been designed in accordance with
      MEDDEV 2.12/2 rev 2.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is a candidate for primary unilateral THA for any of the following

          -  Non-inflammatory degenerative joint disease such as osteoarthritis, avascular
             necrosis, ankylosis, protrusio acetabuli, and painful hip dysplasia

          -  Inflammatory degenerative joint disease such as rheumatoid arthritis

          -  Correction of functional deformity

          -  Subject is able to undergo primary THA procedure

          -  Subject is a candidate to be implanted with the specified combination of components

          -  Subject is willing and able to complete required study visits or assessments

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Overt infection

          -  Distant foci of infections (which may cause hematogenous spread to the implant site);

          -  Rapid disease progression as manifested by joint destruction or bone absorption
             apparent on roentgenogram

          -  Skeletally immature (less than 21 years of age at time of surgery)

          -  Inadequate neuromuscular status (e.g., prior paralysis, fusion, and/or inadequate
             abductor strength), poor bone stock, poor skin coverage around the joint which would
             make the procedure unjustifiable

          -  Neuropathic joints

          -  Hepatitis or HIV infection

          -  Neurological or musculoskeletal disease that may adversely affect gait or
             weight-bearing

          -  Subjects currently enrolled in another clinical investigation

          -  Subjects unwilling to sign the Informed Consent document

          -  Subjects with substance abuse issues

          -  Subjects who are incarcerated
