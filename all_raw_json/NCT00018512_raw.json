The primary purpose of the proposed clinical outcome study is to compare\n      the relative efficacies of three different combinations of implant-supported maxillary and\n      mandibular prostheses with traditional complete dentures for edentulous patients.\n      Completion of this study will determine the relative cost-effectiveness of the\n      implant-supported denture treatments for use in the general population of edentulous\n      patients."

Oral hygiene condition will be assessed from the amount\n             of food debris, plaque and calculus in their present dentures.\n\n          -  Insufficient mandibular or maxillary bone height to accommodate 10 mm long implants\n             in potential implant sites.\n\n          -  Presence of temporomandibular joint dysfunction and evidence of severe bruxism.\n\n          -  Physician determines a contraindication for oral surgery.\n\n          -  Candidate expresses reservations about participating for at least three years."
