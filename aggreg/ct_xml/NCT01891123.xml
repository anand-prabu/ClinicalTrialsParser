    <textblock>
      This is a clinical experience trial, using the rapid plasma drug concentration detection kit
      to detect the plasma drug concentration of docetaxel and paclitaxel in Chinese lung cancer
      patients and breast cancer patients. To assess the statistical difference of PTX/DOC plasma
      drug concentration using traditional body surface area method, and to evaluate the
      correlation between plasma drug concentration and clinical toxicity or clinical effect, at
      last, achieve the personalized treatment according to the plasma drug concentration

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer patients receive a paclitaxel and carboplatin doublet regimen, lung cancer and
      breast cancer patients receive a docetaxel single-agent regimen chemotherapy are included in
      this clinical experience trial. So this trial consists of three sub-trials: PTX in lung
      cancer, Doc in lung cancer and Doc in lung cancer. Patients are randomly assigned into the
      BSA-based dosing group and the concentration-based dosing group. In the BSA-based dosing
      group, patients receive PTX or DOC dose based on body surface area every cycle, PTX
      175mg/m2, DOC 75mg/m2. The dose will adjust according to the China Great Pharmacopoeia only
      when the adverse reaction occurs. In the concentration-based dosing group, the dose of PTX
      or DOC will adjust based on the plasma drug concentration of previous cycle. A target
      interval of PTX and DOC have been set before the trial based on earlier studies of the
      drugs. Patients should finish at least 4 cycles chemotherapy, treatment should continue
      until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs. Toxicity assessment is conducted
      every cycle.
