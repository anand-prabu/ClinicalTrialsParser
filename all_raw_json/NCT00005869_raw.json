It is not yet known whether nitrocamptothecin is more effective\n      than gemcitabine for pancreatic cancer.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of nitrocamptothecin with\n      gemcitabine in treating patients who have unresectable locally advanced or metastatic\n      pancreatic cancer."

            "textblock": "OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the overall survival, time to treatment failure, clinical benefit\n      response rate (analgesic consumption, pain intensity, performance status, and weight\n      change), and objective response rate in chemotherapy-naive patients with unresectable\n      locally advanced or metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas treated with oral\n      nitrocamptothecin vs gemcitabine. II. Compare the toxicity of these 2 regimens in these\n      patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter study. Patients are stratified\n      according to measurable disease (yes vs no), Karnofsky performance status (50-70% vs\n      70-100%), and prior radiotherapy. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. Arm I:\n      Patients receive oral nitrocamptothecin on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every week for 8\n      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with stable\n      or responding disease after week 8 may receive additional courses. Arm II: Patients receive\n      gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every week for 7 courses in the\n      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then undergo 1 week of\n      rest. Patients with stable or responding disease after week 8 may receive gemcitabine IV\n      over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every 4 weeks. Pain is assessed within\n      7 days prior to study, at days 28 and 56 during study, and then every 28 days after\n      completion of study. Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year or until death.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 994 patients (497 per arm) will be accrued for this study\n      within 22 months."
