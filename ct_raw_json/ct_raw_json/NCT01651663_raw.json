            "textblock": "Influenza virus infections result in major health and economic burdens worldwide. The World\n      Health Organization estimates that the average global burden of interpandemic influenza is\n      approximately 1 billion cases of influenza, from 3 to 5 million cases of severe illness, and\n      from 300 000 to 500 000 deaths annually. Arbidol (Umifenovir) is currently licensed for the\n      treatment and prevention of influenza in Russian Federation. Arbidol (Umifenovir) has a\n      direct antiviral effect. Arbidol (Umifenovir) belongs to fusion inhibitors; it interacts\n      with the virus hemagglutinin and thus prevents fusion of the viral envelope with cell\n      membranes. The aim of the study is to obtain additional data on safety and therapeutic\n      efficacy of investigational product Arbidol (Umifenovir) in patients with a diagnosis of\n      influenza and common cold. Furthermore, study of viral resistance in patients with seasonal\n      influenza infection treated with Arbidol (Umifenovir) will be performed."
