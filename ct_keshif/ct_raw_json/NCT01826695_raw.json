It has been reported to be about 2-5% of the\n      general global population.\n\n      Fibromyalgia have been reported to have neurodynamic disorders. The purpose of this\n      prospective study was to examine the combined effects of soft tissue mobilization and nerve\n      slider neurodynamic technique on pain and pressure sensitivity in women with fibromyalgia."
