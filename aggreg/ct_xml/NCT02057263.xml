  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vaccines are one of our most effective public health tools but many who need them don't
      respond well and are not protected.  Adjuvants boost immune responses and are commonly
      included in vaccine preparations. Bisphosphonates are the most commonly prescribed treatment
      for osteoporosis and may represent a new class of adjuvant. Bisphosphonates are well
      tolerated with chronic administration and have very few adverse effects. Research suggests
      that these medications can stimulate the immune system.

      Bisphosphonates are of special interest in populations with impaired immunity and an
      inability to amount protective antibody responses following immunizations. We propose a
      pilot study to evaluate the clinical relevance of this finding in humans.  We will study the
      effect of bisphosphonates on quantitative humoral immune response to hepatitis B vaccine in
      healthy older volunteers who have not previously received this vaccine.

    <description>Safety is assessed by clinical symptoms and exam at final in-person visit. Standardized CTAE will be recorded and graded (mild/moderate/severe) with a special focus on vaccine related adverse events: Temperature, local injection site reactions, fatigue and malaise, AND adverse events related to alendronate which are primarily gastrointestinal: nausea, vomiting, esophagitis, ulceration. Rare, unlikely events such as atypical fractures and jaw osteonecrosis are extremely unlikely with this duration of dosing (4 weekly doses) but will also be specifically sought.</description>

    <time_frame>8 weeks to 5 months after final alendronate dose</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Efficacy is assessed by quantitative Anti Hepatitis B Surface IgG (immunoglobulin G) antibody titers in international units (iU) per ml. All subjects must  have levels of ZERO  in order to participate.  A value of 10 iU/ml is considered protective.  Titers directed against hepatitis B surface antigen will be measured by commercially available testing Efficacy will also be assessed as a categorical value: Yes/No for protective level of antibody achieved at either 8 weeks or 6 months (5 months after second vaccination).   A protective level of hepatitis B surface antibody is defined as 10 iU/ml; levels of 10-100 are considered protective but &quot;poorly responsive.&quot;  We will compare mean titers between groups (placebo vs. alendronate).  We believe a mean increase of 20% is likely clinically significant/important.</description>
