Approximately 32 healthy participants will be equally divided into 2 groups\n      (Group 1 and Group 2) to receive TMC435 for 7 days. Safety will be evaluated by the\n      assessment of adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, and physical\n      examination which will be monitored at various timepoints throughout the study. The total\n      duration of study participation for each participant will be approximately 47 days."
