  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This six center international study will include two United Kingdom National Health Service
      centers, two centers in Melbourne, Australia and one center each in Denmark and Spain. The
      objective of the study is to evaluate subject acceptance of the a new insulin pump and
      transmitter together with the accompanying training materials. Descriptive data from
      participant questionnaires and device uploads will be evaluated.

      Pediatric subjects between the ages of 7 - 18 years and adults from the age of 19 years of
      age upwards, who currently use an insulin pump in the management of their type 1 or type 2
      diabetes, will be invited to participate. Each subject will be trained on the study device
      and then use it for approximately six weeks.  During this time there will be three in-clinic
      visits and four follow-up phone calls, scheduled at the subjects' convenience.   At the end
      of this period, they will revert back to their original insulin pump and complete a
      questionnaire on the study pump training materials, features and usability.
