Whole-body planar scintigraphic images will be acquired at various time points on the\n      day of study drug administration.  A pelvic SPECT/CT image will be acquired on the day of\n      study drug administration.  Blood will be collected for pharmacokinetic measurements\n      following study drug administration.  Each participant will receive an initial study drug\n      administration (preparation A) and a second study drug administration (preparation B)\n      approximately 7 to 21 days later.
