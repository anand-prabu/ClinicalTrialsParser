    <textblock>
      The AfFIRM Study is a Phase 2 study during which patients with advanced multiple myeloma
      will receive single-agent investigational study drug filanesib (ARRY-520). Patients will be
      followed to determine the effectiveness of filanesib in treating myeloma. Approximately 160
      patients from North America and Europe will be enrolled in this study.

      Eligible patients will have received at least two prior lines of therapy; have received
      prior bortezomib and lenalidomide; and have disease refractory to carfilzomib and/or
      pomalidomide.

        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with confirmed multiple myeloma whose treatment history must include all of
             the following:

               1. Received at least 2 prior lines of therapy (induction therapy and stem cell
                  transplant ± maintenance are to be considered a single line of therapy).

               2. Received at least 2 cycles of a bortezomib-containing regimen and 2 cycles of a
                  lenalidomide-containing regimen, unless intolerant to these agents (defined as
                  requiring discontinuation due to toxicity).

               3. Disease refractory to a carfilzomib-containing regimen and/or a pomalidomide
                  containing regimen. Refractory is defined as either failure to achieve a minimal
                  response (MR) or better while on therapy, or development of progressive disease
                  (PD) while on therapy or within 60 days from last dose of therapy.

          -  Measurable multiple myeloma disease, defined as meeting at least one of the following
             criteria within 14 days prior to first dose of study drug:

               1. A monoclonal Ig (M-protein) concentration on serum protein electrophoresis
                  (SPEP) of ≥ 1.0 g/dL.

               2. Measurable urinary light chain secretion by quantitative analysis using urine
                  protein electrophoresis (UPEP) of ≥ 200 mg/24 hours.

               3. Involved serum free light chain (FLC) level ≥ 10 mg/dL, provided the serum FLC
                  ratio is abnormal.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0, 1 or 2 within 14
             days prior to first dose of study drug.

          -  Adequate hematology, hepatic and renal function laboratory values within 14 days
             prior to first dose of study drug.

          -  Additional criteria exist.

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior treatment with filanesib (ARRY-520) or any other KSP inhibitor.

          -  Past or current plasma cell leukemia.

          -  Primary amyloidosis (amyloidosis associated with multiple myeloma is allowed).

          -  POEMS syndrome (polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal protein and
             skin changes).

          -  Autologous or allogeneic stem cell or bone marrow transplant within 3 months prior to
             first dose of study drug.

          -  Concomitant malignancies or previous malignancies (other than multiple myeloma) with
             less than a 2-year disease-free interval at the time of first dose of study drug.
             Patients with adequately resected basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin,
             carcinoma in situ of the cervix or breast, or Stage 1 prostate cancer are eligible
             irrespective of the time of diagnosis.

          -  Use of an investigational agent that is not expected to be cleared by the time of
             first dose of study drug or that has been demonstrated to have prolonged side
             effects. Patients must have recovered from all side effects to a Grade 0 or 1 (except
             alopecia and neuropathy).

          -  Any severe concurrent disease or condition (including severe graft-versus-host
             disease, requirement for dialysis, symptomatic congestive heart failure [New York
             Heart Association Class III or IV], unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia)
             which, in the judgment of the Investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for
             study participation.

          -  Known positive serology for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), active hepatitis
             B and/or hepatitis C.

          -  Acute active infection requiring treatment.

          -  Additional criteria exist.
