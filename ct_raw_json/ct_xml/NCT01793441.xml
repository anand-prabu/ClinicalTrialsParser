    <textblock>
      This multi-center, randomized, double-blind, parallel group, placebo-controlled, proof of
      concept study will investigate the efficacy and safety of RG7314 in ad ult patients with
      autism spectrum disorders (ASD). In stage I of the study, pati ents will be randomized to
      receive daily oral doses of 1.5 mg RG7314 or placebo for 12 weeks. After an independent
      safety review, the study may proceed to stage II. In stage II of the study, additional
      patients will be randomized to receive daily oral doses of 4 mg RG7314 or placebo for 12
      weeks. The anticipated time o n study treatment is 12 weeks.

          -  Male adult patients, 18 to 45 years of age

          -  Patients meet DSM-5 criteria for ASD and ICD10 criteria for Autism diagnosis

          -  Social Responsiveness Scale &gt; / = 66

          -  Clinical Global Impressions   Severity (CGI-S) &gt; = 4 (moderately ill)

          -  Patients have an IQ &gt; = 70

          -  A body mass index (BMI) between 18 to 40 kg/m2 inclusive

          -  Language, hearing and vision compatible with the study measurements as judged by the
             investigator

          -  Lives with (or has substantial periods of contact with) a caregiver who is willing
             and able to attend visits when required, oversee the patient's compliance with
             protocol-specified procedures and study medication dosing, and report on the
             patient's status via completion of study assessments. Any period of absence must be
             covered by another caregiver. Non-cohabitating caregiver(s) must spend sufficient
             time with the subject so that, in the opinion of the investigator, the caregiver(s)
             can reliably assess patient's mental status, activities and behavior.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Alcohol and/or substance abuse/dependence during the last 12 months

          -  A significant risk for suicidal behavior, in the opinion of the investigator

          -  Systolic blood pressure greater than 140 or less than 90 mm Hg, and diastolic blood
             pressure greater than 90 or less than 50 mm Hg

          -  Resting pulse rate greater than 90 or less than 40 beats per minute

          -  Use of prohibited medications or herbal remedies within 2 weeks prior to
             randomization, or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer)

          -  Initiation of a new major change in psychological intervention within 4 weeks prior
             to randomization. Minor changes in ongoing treatment are not considered significant

          -  Participation in an investigational drug or device study within 60 days prior
             screening
