Glucagon-like peptide-1\n      (GLP-1) has been demonstrated to protect the heart when it is deprived of blood supply\n      (ischaemia). The mechanism for this protection is not clear. Similar protection occurs with\n      ischaemic conditioning of the heart, which is dependent on potassium channel opening.\n\n      The investigators intend to establish whether GLP-1 mediated protection shares a similar\n      mechanistic pathway. In order to do this the investigators will measures pressure--volume\n      loops generated in the main pumping chamber of the heart at the time of a percutaneous\n      coronary intervention (stenting). Patients will be randomised to GLP-1 alone, GLP-1 with\n      glibenclamide (a potassium channel blocking medication approved for human use) or\n      glibenclamide alone.\n\n      The investigators hypothesis is that the effect of GLP-1 will be abrogated by use of\n      glibenclamide."
