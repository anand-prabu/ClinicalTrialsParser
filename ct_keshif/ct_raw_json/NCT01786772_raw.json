Preliminary\n      evidence suggests applying cryotherapy to a joint prior to exercise can increase quadriceps\n      activation. It is unknown if applying cryotherapy and intermittent pneumatic compression can\n      also increase quadriceps force output and voluntary activation. The purpose of this study is\n      to determine changes in quadriceps force output and voluntary activation following the\n      application of cryotherapy and compression. The investigators hypothesize there will be an\n      increase in quadriceps force output and voluntary activation following the application of\n      cryotherapy and compression."
