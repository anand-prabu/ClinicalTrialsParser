This study is to better understand how the brain works to control ones\n      emotions after a brain injury. The investigators will also study a treatment method to\n      improve control of ones emotions called Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS). This\n      method involves electrical stimulation of the scalp with sponge-soaked metal plates and a\n      battery. This non-invasive treatment has already been cleared by the FDA for the treatment\n      of anxiety, depression and insomnia which are problems patients are experiencing since their\n      brain injury. Several studies have found this treatment useful for improving mental and\n      physical functions after brain injury. The purpose of using this treatment is to understand\n      how it affects changes in emotional functions."
