Urea and creatinine group, biochemical tests for urea and creatinine in mIU/ml to\n      detect their presence in the wash will be done. In Nitrazine group wash will be assessed by\n      nitrazine paper showing bluish discoloration in rupture membranes. Sensitivity of each test\n      in diagnosed rupture of membranes will be assessed.Which means how many patients in each\n      test show positive results in case of diagnosed case."
