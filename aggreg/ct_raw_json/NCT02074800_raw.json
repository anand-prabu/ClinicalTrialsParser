Part 1\n      is the double-blind (neither physician nor participants know the treatment that the\n      participant receives) and staggered parallel (a clinical study comparing the response in two\n      or more groups of participants receiving different treatments) part of the study.\n      Participants in Part 1 will receive either 1.4 or 2.8 mg/kg of either Sp2/0-derived CNTO 328\n      or CHO-derived CNTO 328 or placebo. Part 2 is the open-label (all people know the identity\n      of the intervention) part of the study. Participants in Part 2 will receive 1.4 mg/kg of\n      either Sp2/0-derived or CHO-derived CNTO 328. Safety will be evaluated by the assessment of\n      adverse events, vital signs, physical examination, 12-lead electrocardiogram, and clinical\n      laboratory tests which will be monitored throughout the study. The total duration of study\n      participation for each participant will be approximately 199 days including a screening\n      phase (within 30 days before the first study medication administration) and a treatment\n      phase (inpatient [hospitalization period] 12 days and outpatient [follow-up] visits up to\n      169 days)."
