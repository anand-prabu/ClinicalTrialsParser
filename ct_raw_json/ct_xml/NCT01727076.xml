      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of recombinant interleukin-15 in
      treating patients with advanced melanoma, kidney cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, or head
      and neck cancer. Recombinant interleukin-15 may kill tumor cells by stopping blood flow to
      the tumor and by stimulating white blood cells to kill melanoma, kidney, non-small cell
      lung, and squamous cell head and neck cancer cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of recombinant human IL15 (recombinant
      interleukin-15) (rhIL15) administered subcutaneous.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the effect of the dose schedules of rhIL15 on the number and phenotype of
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells including total white blood cell count, absolute
      lymphocyte count (ALC), total number of T cells and natural killer (NK) cells, as well as
      activated T cells, T cell subsets and NK cell subsets.

      II. To determine the effects of the dose schedules of rhIL15 on the function of peripheral
      blood mononuclear cells including T cell subset response to recall viral antigens including
      cytomegalovirus (CMV) and influenza A virus, T cell responses to non- physiologic stimuli
      including: phytohemagglutinin (PHA), and NK cell cytokine (interferon gamma [IFN-y])
      secretion and degranulation by cluster of differentiation 107a (CD107a) expression.

      III. To assess tumor response rate by objective response rate (ORR). IV. To assess the
      immunogenicity, pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) profiles of National Cancer
      Institute (NCI) rhIL15.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive recombinant interleukin-15 subcutaneously (SC) daily on days 1-5 and 8-12.
      Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 24 weeks.

             antibody [HBsAb] positive and hepatitis B core antibody [HBcAb] negative), or a fully
             resolved acute hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is not an exclusion criterion
