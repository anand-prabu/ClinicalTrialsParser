Within 72 hours after MRgFUS procedure, patients undergo\n      gadolinium-enhanced MRI to evaluate ablation borders. Within 7-10 days after MRgFUS\n      procedure, patients undergo an ultrasound exam. Guide wires may be placed to assist in\n      pre-surgical lesion localization. Within 10-21 days after MRgFUS procedure, patients undergo\n      segmental resection or mastectomy.\n\n      Patients are followed at 5-10 days post-surgery.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 45 patients will be accrued for this study."
