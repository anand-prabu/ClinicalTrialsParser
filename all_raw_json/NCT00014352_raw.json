Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.\n      Anticoagulant drugs such as warfarin may reduce the risk of blood clots.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy plus warfarin\n      in treating patients who have prostate cancer."

Determine the safety, efficacy, and durability of docetaxel and estramustine\n      followed by doxorubicin and ketoconazole in patients with high-risk, androgen-independent\n      prostate cancer. II. Determine whether anticoagulation with warfarin can reduce the\n      frequency of thromboembolic complications associated with estramustine in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: Regimen A: Patients receive oral estramustine 3 times daily on days 1-5 and\n      docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 3 weekly. Patients also receive oral warfarin daily.\n      Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for a total of 2 courses in the absence of disease\n      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Regimen B: After completion of regimen A, patients\n      receive doxorubicin IV over 30 minutes weekly and oral ketoconazole twice daily. Treatment\n      repeats every 4 weeks for a total of 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or\n      unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed monthly until disease progression.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year."
