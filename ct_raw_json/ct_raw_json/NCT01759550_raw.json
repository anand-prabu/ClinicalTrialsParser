Both devices are regularly used at Duke in the Bariatric Surgery division. The surgeon will select which device is used. There will be no randomization. The device decision tree will be based upon the procedure.  Cases that require enterotomy will utilize the AdvanceTM pistol grip.  Cases which don't need enterotomy will utilize the 5 Blunt Tip. The LigaSure AdvanceTM pistol grip and LigaSureTM Blunt Tip are used exclusively with the Force TriadTM Energy platform. There is no simultaneous use."

Also, Economic\n      value of using LigaSure in gastric surgeries will be appraised.\n\n      In this prospective case series, 60 patients previously scheduled to undergo a Roux-en-Y or\n      gastric reduction procedure (sleeve gastrectomy or placation) will have hemostasis\n      controlled with LigaSure Advance \u2122 Pistol Grip or LigaSure\u2122 Blunt Tip, respectively. All\n      subjects undergoing Roux-en-Y or gastric reduction procedures (sleeve gastrectomy or\n      placation) procedure at Durham Regional Hospital will be recruited.\n\n      Data Analysis will be performed using the data collected in the software program titled\n      MetaBar at Duke University Medical Center. Categorical variables will be summarized as\n      proportions for each category; continuous measures will be summarized by mean and standard\n      deviation or median and range as appropriated for the data distribution. Procedure-related\n      risks are those typically associated with gastric procedures and general anesthesia\n      including intra-operative bleeding, infection, and injury to surrounding organs and\n      structures. Device related risks include those normally associated with the use of\n      electrosurgery including intra-operative bleeding, unintended tissue burns, electrical\n      shock, and electrical stimulation of muscles and nerves."
