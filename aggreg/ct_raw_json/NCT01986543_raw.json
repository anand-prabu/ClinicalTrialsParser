            "textblock": "Justification: In vitro and animal studies have shown that increasing the dose of rifampicin\n      (R) improves the R sterilising effect. If a similar effect can be demonstrated in the\n      clinical setting, this could allow shortening treatment duration from 6 to 4 months, with\n      good tolerance. Several phase 2 trials in HIV-negative patients are ongoing. We propose a\n      first interaction study between efavirenz (EFV) and R20mg/Kg taking into consideration the\n      absence of data about R induction at this dose. Due to an important inter-patient\n      variability of the CYP2B6 polymorphism, the EFV pharmacokinetic (Pk) will be compared in\n      same patients with and without TB treatment.\n\n      Principal objective: To compare the Pk parameters of EFV in HIV-TB co-infected patients,\n      with and without TB treatment, using R at 10 and 20mg/Kg/day and EFV at 600 and 800mg/day.\n\n      Secondary objectives: To describe the Pk parameters of R and isoniazid (H); the TB treatment\n      r\u00e9ponse (Mycobacterium tuberculosis culture conversion after 8 weeks(w) and  cure after 24w)\n      ; the virological response; the occurrence of severe adverse events, especially hepatic and\n      neurological events; the treatment adherence; the genes involved in the EFV metabolism of\n      EFV, R  and H, and its relation with the Pk parameters.\n\n      Primary endpoint: AUC0-24, Cmax, Cmin, Tmax of EFV after 4w of TB treatment + ARV, and 4w\n      after interruption of TB treatment.\n\n      Study design : phase 2 randomized, open label 3 arms therapeutic trial:\n\n        -  Arm 1 :        8 weeks R20mg/Kg + H + pyrazinamide(Z)+ ethambutol(E) and EFV600mg/J +\n           tenofovir-lamivudine\n\n        -  Arm 2:         8 weeks R20mg/Kg + H+Z+E and EFV800mg/J + tenofovir-lamivudine\n\n        -  Standard arm : 8 weeks R10mg/Kg + H+Z+E and EFV600mg/J + tenofovir-lamivudine\n\n      The ARV treatment will be initiated 4 weeks after starting TB treatment. After 8 weeks, all\n      patients will receive 16 weeks of H+R with R at 10mg/Kg/day and EFV at 600mg/day. Treatment\n      will be observed at home by a domiciliary treatment monitor (DTM). Patients will be followed\n      during 28 weeks after starting TB treatment: weekly visit during first 8 weeks  and then\n      every 4 weeks.\n\n      Pk sampling for EFV, R and H will be at w2 (Pk1), w8 (Pk2) and w28 (Pk3). Liver function\n      test and full blood count will be measured after 2, 4 and 8 weeks; sputum culture for TB at\n      baseline and w8; HIV-1 RNA at baseline, w4, w12 and w24 and CD4 count at baseline and w24.\n\n      Eligibility criteria: > 18 years old; previously untreated pulmonary TB; Xpert confirming\n      Mtb susceptible to R; body weight >45Kg; CD4 between 50 and 250cells/mm3; Karnofsky score\n      >80%; ALAT/biluribin <5xULN; no grade 4 clinical/biological sign; no pregnancy + barrier\n      contraception; agree to participate and sign a consent form.\n\n      Randomisation block, 1:1:1. Sample size: 28 patients to show that the reduction of AUC of\n      EFV with R20mg/Kg vs no R is not greater to 30%, with 20% expected reduction. Same number\n      per study arm and 20% increase for patients' withdrawals or lost to follow-up resulting in a\n      total of 105 patients.\n\n      Site: Mbarara (Uganda)"
