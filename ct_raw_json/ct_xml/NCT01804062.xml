    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to meet the respiration rate accuracy specifications for the
      study pulse oximeter monitoring system (study device)in a healthy volunteer population when
      compared to established technologies for measuring parameters related to respiration, such
      as Capnograph Respiration Rate (RR) (CO2).

    <textblock>
      Volunteer subjects with no significant medical problems (see specific inclusion/exclusion
      criteria) over the age of 18, male and female, who provide written informed consent prior to
      the procedure, are not pregnant, and without any contact skin allergies to adhesives found
      in standard pulse oximetry sensors.

      The study consists of measuring parameters related to respiration in healthy volunteers by
      means of the Bedside Respiratory Patient Monitoring System with RR V2.0 (Nightingale). The
      prototype Nightingale device and multiparameter reference devices will be attached to the
      subject via sensors, nasal cannulas and ECG leads and the information from all devices will
      be captured continuously for up to 40 minutes to allow for at least 30 minutes of artifact
      free data 30 minutes.
