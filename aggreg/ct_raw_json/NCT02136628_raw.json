It is estimated that in the United States are made about a million of reoperations for\n      correction of this complication , with millions and despite the myriad studies that have\n      been done in recent years there has been a decrease in the incidence losses and mortality of\n      this complication.\n\n      Given the seriousness of this problem the last global consensus guidelines sent to the\n      surgical community in three main areas: Identify the importance of the problem, improve the\n      theoretical knowledge and technical capacity in the closure of the abdominal wall and\n      Implement prophylaxis in selected patients.\n\n      The technique of reinforced tension line (RTL) was proposed by hollinsky and collaborators\n      and is a strengthening of the abdominal incision with placement of a suture that runs\n      lateral to the edge of the incision and closure of the abdominal wall is performed the usual\n      manner with the only surgete continuous suture for closure is placed lateral to the suture\n      reinforcement.\n\n      In the present study may contribute to these guidelines and to groups of patients at high\n      risk were identified and applying the RTL technique and demonstrate that its use is safe and\n      useful in reducing the presence of this complication could be implemented as prophylaxis\n      handling the same .\n\n      The RTL method was applied experimentally on bodies to close the abdominal wall also be used\n      in a cohort of patients for hernia repair wall , showing that by using it the abdominal wall\n      is more resistant to shear forces by theoretical foundation that exists to show that could\n      prevent the development of incisional hernias. There are no studies in the literature\n      comparing this technique against conventional methods of closure of the abdominal wall as to\n      the prevention of the same."
