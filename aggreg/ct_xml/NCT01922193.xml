          -  Early follicular phase (day 2-3), serum levels of FSH within limits
             (1-12IU/L)(results obtained within 90 days prior to down regulation treatment)

             within normal range for the clinical laboratory or considered not clinically
             significant by the investigator (results obtained within 90 days prior to down
             regulation treatment)

             in unsuccessful fertilization and no related medical conditions improved

             cycle for IVF/ICSI

          -  Known malformations of the sexual organs incompatible with pregnancy

          -  According to the judgment of the investigator, abnormal laboratory value of renal or
             hepatic function is clinically significant

             of alcohol or drugs, and/or current or past smoking habit of more than 10 cigarettes
             per day

          -  Any known endocrine or metabolic abnormalities (pituitary, adrenal, pancreas, liver
             or kidney) which can compromise participation in the trial with the exception of
             controlled thyroid function disease

          -  Known history of chemotherapy (except for gestational conditions) or radiotherapy

          -  According to the judgment of the investigator, abnormal laboratory value is
             clinically relevant
