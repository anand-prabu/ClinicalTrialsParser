On day 22 a\n      single intravenous dose of oxytocin 10 IU Syntocinon\u00ae will be given. Oxytocin plasma levels\n      after intravaginal and intravenous administration  will be analysed day 1, 15 and 22 at\n      timepoints: -1.0, -0.5, 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0 and 8.0 hours,\n      relative to dosing.  Based on the obtained plasma levels for oxytocin, pharmakokinetic\n      variables will be calculated. The % of oxytocin which was absorbed following vaginal\n      administration (bioavailability)will also be calculated."
