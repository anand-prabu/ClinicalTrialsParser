On each\n      stimulation day, a given patient shall receive 5 sessions with a between session delay of 10\n      to 15 minutes. Patients will be selected using the structured Mini-International\n      Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI). All will be at least stage I treatment resistant. Because\n      concomitant antidepressant treatment can confound outcome results, all patients will go\n      through a medication washout before entering the study and they will be free from any\n      antidepressant, neuroleptic and mood stabilizer for at least two weeks before entering the\n      treatment protocol. Only habitual benzodiazepine agents will be allowed.\n\n      All patients will be closely matched for gender and age with 50 never-depressed\n      medication-free healthy volunteers. Only baseline measurements will be collected: no\n      volunteer will undergo the treatment.\n\n      We expect that real Theta burst treatment and not sham will result in a significant and\n      clinical meaningful response."
