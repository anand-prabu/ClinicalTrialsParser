The changes in pain is measured as well.\n\n      In second phase the control group receives TNS treatment six times at home as a placebo so\n      that the power of TNS is limited to very low level. The number of treatments are controlled\n      as well as the time of treatment. The treatment group receives six manipulation treatments\n      within 3 week period. The effects are measured immediately after the treatment weeks, and 3\n      and 8 week follow-up. Moreover the one year follow-up will be performed by mail\n      questionnaire."
