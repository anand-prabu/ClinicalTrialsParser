If idarubicin (10\n      mg/m2, 3 days) was administered instead of daunorubicin, the complete remission (CR) rate in\n      adults up to 60 years was 75%. To improve the proportion of CRs and to decrease relapse rate\n      appearing in 50% of patients, the phase II AML-99 trial includes intermediate\n      dose-cytarabine during induction and risk-adapted post remission treatment based on the\n      improvement in prognostic characterization of AML and the implementation of novel\n      transplantation techniques."
