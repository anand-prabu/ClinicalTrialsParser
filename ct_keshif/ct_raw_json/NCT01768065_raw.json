            "textblock": "The nasal expiratory positive airway pressure (NEPAP) device has been used to treat OSAS in\n      adults. A disposable device is placed in each nostril at night and attached with adhesive.\n      The device acts as a one-way valve, during inspiration the valve opens, with negligible\n      resistance to flow. During expiration, the valve closes and airflow is directed through\n      small air channels, increasing resistance. The increased resistance helps to maintain the\n      upper airway pressure during the critical end-expiratory period when the upper airway has\n      been found to be most narrow in the breaths preceding an apnea event. In contrast to\n      Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) which provides positive pressure during both\n      inspiration and expiration, NEPAP creates pressure during expiration. NEPAP is a potential\n      alternative therapy which is less cumbersome than CPAP and may increase adherence."

Subjects age 5-16 years (note: Due to the size of the devices, it is expected that\n             most children will be at least 8 years old, but a few may be younger. Subjects will\n             be evaluated in clinic to fit for size and habituate to the device)\n\n          2. OSAS (AHI > 5/hr)\n\n          3. Subject has had adenotonsillectomy or is not a candidate for adenotonsillectomy\n\n          4. Subject is non-adherent to CPAP or is seeking an alternative therapy\n\n          5. Tolerance of NEPAP device during a daytime session\n\n          6. Parental/guardian permission (informed consent) and if appropriate, child assent.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          1. Severe developmental delay thought to involve a high risk of aspiration\n\n          2. Family does not understand English well enough to perform the standardized, validated\n             questionnaires.\n\n          3. Age >16 years since results may be similar to adult studies in these older patients.\n\n          4. Severe breathing disorder (including respiratory muscle weakness, bullous lung\n             disease, bypassed upper airway, pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum)\n\n          5. Severe heart disease (including heart failure)\n\n          6. An acute upper respiratory (including nasal, sinus or middle ear) inflammation or\n             infection or perforation of the ear drum\n\n        Subjects that do not meet all of the enrollment criteria will not be enrolled.  Any\n        violations of these criteria will be reported in accordance with Institutional Review\n        Board (IRB) Policies and Procedures.\n\n        Study members will not recruit females who are known to be pregnant. However, if a subject\n        becomes pregnant during the study, we will continue to use the device.  Pregnancy is not\n        an exclusion criterion as positive airway pressure therapy does not harm the pregnant\n        woman or fetus."
