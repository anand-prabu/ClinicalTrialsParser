In this study we aimed to investigate\n      the effects of dexmedetomidine on early stage renal function in pediatric patients\n      undergoing cardiac angiography.\n\n      Methods: 60 pediatric patients between 6 and 72 months of age undergoing cardiac angiography\n      were included in the study. Patients were divided into two groups. The patients in both\n      groups were administered 1mgkg-1 ketamine, 1mgkg-1 propofol as bolus and followed by 1\n      mgkg-1hour-1 ketamine and 50 \u00b5gkg-1min-1 propofol infusion. Additionally, a loading dose of\n      1 \u00b5gkg-1 dexmedetomidine given over 10 minutes followed by 0.5 \u00b5gkg-1hour-1 dexmedetomidine\n      infusion to patients in group D. The patients were evaluated for NGAL, creatinine, renin,\n      endothelin-1, TAS and TOS blood levels before the procedure and 6th and 24th hours after the\n      procedure. pRIFLE criteria were used to define CIN and its incidence in the study."
