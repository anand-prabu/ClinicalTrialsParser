    <description>Clearance of a drug is a measure of the rate at which a drug is metabolized or eliminated by normal biological processes.  Clearance obtained after oral dose (apparent oral clearance) is influenced by the fraction of the dose absorbed. Clearance was estimated from population pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling.  Drug clearance is a quantitative measure of the rate at which a drug substance is removed from the blood.</description>

    <description>Vd is the theoretical volume that the total amount of administered drug would have to occupy to provide the same concentration as it currently is in the blood plasma.</description>
