The major symptoms of LEMS are progressive muscle weakness.  Many\n      patients experience other symptoms like dry mouth or impotence. Congenital Myasthenia (CM)\n      is an inherited disorder with similar affects and symptoms.\n\n      3,4-Diaminopyridine (DAP) is an experimental drug that has improved strength in some\n      subjects with (LEMS). There are no other accepted treatments for LEMS and DAP has relatively\n      few side effects."

The upper limit is a total of 100 mg/day.  Subjects will be monitored for\n      strength and side effects via routine clinic visits at intervals of one month for the first\n      three months, then every three months for the first year, and  at least every six months\n      thereafter.  Treatment will be continued indefinitely if a good clinical response is\n      achieved and side effects are tolerable."
