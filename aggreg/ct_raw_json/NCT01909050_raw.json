The cells lining the intestine of a person with celiac disease should be different\n      than a person without celiac disease. The study doctors would like to see how the cells\n      react after coming in contact with gluten and if substances that act on the immune system\n      can prevent gluten related inflammation.  Examples of these substances include steroids.\n      The cells should produce chemicals of their own in response to the gluten. These other\n      chemicals will be measured and the results compared between those with:\n\n        -  celiac disease that does not respond to a gluten-free diet (refractory celiac disease)\n\n        -  celiac disease which is controlled by a gluten-free diet\n\n        -  uncontrolled celiac disease (either newly diagnosed with celiac disease or not on a\n           gluten-free diet\n\n        -  gluten-sensitivity\n\n        -  disorders other than celiac disease."
