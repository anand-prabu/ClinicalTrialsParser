  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Depression is common among elderly with an estimated prevalence of 5%. Due to ageing the
      national burden will double in the coming decade. Antidepressants as TCAs and SSRIs are
      effective in reducing symptoms, especially in people with severe depression. To optimize
      treatment efficacy and reduce side effects, the Pharmacogenetics Working Group of the Royal
      Dutch Pharmacists Association developed guidelines for dose-adaptation, for instance for
      antidepressants such as nortriptyline and venlafaxine based on their main relevant genotype
      (CYP2D6) accompanied by Therapeutic Drug Monitoring. Such personalized drug dosing based on
      pharmacogenetic information at the start of therapy can speed up the titration phase of
      antidepressants to establish an adequate maintenance dose. However, pharmacogenetic
      screening programs are expensive and evidence on effects and costs of such a program among
      elderly antidepressant starters from randomized controlled studies is lacking. The
      investigators will conduct a pragmatic randomized controlled trial to determine the effects
      and costs of pharmacogenetic screening information to optimize drug dosing in depressed
      elderly patients who start with nortriptyline or venlafaxine.

      Objective: The primary objective is to determine the effects of pharmacogenetic screening
      for CYP2D6 on the time to reach adequate blood levels as an accepted proxy for adequate
      treatment. Secondary objectives include adverse drug reactions and cost-effectiveness

      This study is a multicenter randomized controlled trial in which psychiatric elderly care
      centers participate in the Netherlands. Deviating genotypes are expected to be found in ~30%
      of the population, therefore the study consist out of two parts. First a basic study in
      which ~750 patients, starting with nortriptyline or venlafaxine will be genotyped to
      identify patients with deviating genotypes (Poor, Intermediate or Ultrarapid Metabolizers).
      Second in the main study 150 patients with a deviating genotype are randomly allocated to
      two study arms one with and one without information on the genotype. From the extensive
      metabolizers('normal'genotype) 75 patients are allocated to a third arm as an external
      control.

    <description>Serum drug levels will be assessed by 'dried blood spot' analysis, blood will be obtained by a fingerprick.
Adequate serum drug levels is defined as: serum drug levels within the therapeutic window (for nortriptyline 50-150 µg/L, for venlafaxine 200-400 µg/L in combination with stable drug dosing for at least 3 weeks.</description>

    <description>Adverse drug events will be assessed by a self-reported questionnaire (ASEC). Two different questionnaires will be used, one for the side-effects of venlafaxine and another one for nortriptyline. Both are based one the ASEC questionnaire.</description>
