            "textblock": "Rivaroxaban is a substance developed for use in the treatment of blood coagulation\n      disorders. Thrombosis (blood clots) can occur as a result of excessive coagulation activity\n      in the blood vessels. Excessive coagulation activity can occur in children as well, and\n      rivaroxaban is therefore being developed for the treatment of thromboembolic events in\n      children and adolescents. As small children are often unable to swallow tablets, an oral\n      suspension (mixture of a liquid containing finely distributed solids) has been developed\n      which allows dosing according to body weight. The objective of this trial is to compare the\n      bioavailability (proportion of a substance that remains available unchanged in the blood\n      circulation) of a rivaroxaban oral solution with that of the rivaroxaban tablet approved for\n      treatment. In order to evaluate the potential influence of food, the oral suspension\n      containing 20 mg rivaroxaban will be taken after consuming food. In addition, the\n      pharmacokinetics (concentrations of the drug and breakdown products (metabolites) in blood),\n      safety and tolerability will be assessed."
