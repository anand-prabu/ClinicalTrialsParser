  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of low-molecular-weight
      heparin in the prevention of venous thromboembolism and improvement of disease-free survival
      in patients after surgery for colorectal cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A consecutive patients after surgery for colorectal cancer from ZhongShan hospital, Fudan
      university were enrolled and randomly assigned to taking low-molecular-weight or placebo.
      Post-operative formation of venous thromboembolism, major and minor bleeding, disease-free
      survival were compared.
