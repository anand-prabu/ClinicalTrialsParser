    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study is to establish the natural history of BK virus viremia and
      other possible opportunistic viral pathogens in renal transplants receipients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Natural History study in renal or renal-pancreas transplant recipients.  In an
      effort to capture patients early in the course of an evolving BK  virus infection and avoid
      patients who have already developed evidence of BKV-induced nephropathy (BKVN), this
      protocol will emphasize the initiation of screening in the early post-transplant period.
      Patients who have undergone renal or renal/pancreas transplantation within 4 weeks, but not
      more than 90 day previously, will be asked to participate  and then consented to be enrolled
      in a Natural History-Surveillance period for up to approximately 24 months. Participants
      enrolled in this study will provide valuable natural history data regarding BKV viremia, and
      potentially other viral pathogen, in the post-renal transplant period. Participants will
      provide blood samples to undergo measurement for plasma BKV DNA by PCR approximately every 6
      weeks, to be resulted in real time at the UAB Diagnostic Virology Laboratory at UAB.
