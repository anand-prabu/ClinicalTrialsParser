The\n      information gathered from this study will help understand if patients with higher body\n      weights need a different dosing plan.\n\n      Patients in this study will have blood draws once before they take Neupogen and 6 times\n      after they take the Neuopen (for a total of 24 hours).  These patients will be in the\n      hospital already and will not need to make additional trips back to have blood drawn.  A\n      total of about 5-6 tablespoons of blood will be drawn for this study.  15 obese patients and\n      15 matched, non-obese patients will be enrolled into this study."
