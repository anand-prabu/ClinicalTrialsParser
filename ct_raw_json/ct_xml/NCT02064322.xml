  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the SAIF study is to evaluate the SImmetry Sacroiliac Joint Fusion System for
      fusion and pain reduction of the SI joint.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, non-randomized, single center study to collect data on fusion and
      pain reduction following implantation of the SImmetry device. Up to 15 total subjects will
      be implanted and followed for 24 months. Data will be collected pre-operatively, at implant,
      discharge, and at specified follow-up time points (6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months,
      24 months.)

    <description>The SImmetry device consists of one 12.5mm SIJ Implant and one 6.5mm SIJ Implant. The implanted devices consist of a range of thread-tapping cannulated implants designed to transfix the sacrum and ilim, providing stability for intra-articular fusion.
The SImmetry Surgical Instruments consist of standard manual surgical instruments used to access and prepare the sacroiliac joint space for intra-articular fusion.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must be indicated for the SImmetry device according to the approved SImmetry
             labeling

          -  Subject has three (3) positive (experiences pain) Provocative Tests for SIJ pain; for
             example, Compression, Thigh Thrust, FABER, Distraction or Gaenslen's

          -  Subject has documentation of failed, non-operative management of SIJ pain for ≥ 6
             months prior to surgery; for example, use of medications, braces, SI belts,
             orthotics, physical therapy or manual manipulation

          -  The subject has two (2) positive diagnostic SIJ injections, fluoroscopically guided,
             with two different local anesthetics. The first injection using a numbing agent (e.g.
             lidocaine) and the second injection using a different numbing agent (e.g.
             Bupivicaine) must both must result in a ≥75% decrease in pain from the anesthetic
             portion of the injection

          -  The subject has VAS back pain score of ≥ 60 mm

          -  The subject has an ODI ≥ 40%

          -  The subject is at least 18 years of age and skeletally mature

          -  The subject agrees and is able to comply with study requirements

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects contraindicated per the cleared labeling will be excluded from participation
             in the study

          -  The subject has pelvic soft tissue or bony tumors

          -  The subject has had any trauma causing fracture of the sacrum or iliac bones or has
             had spinal trauma leading to a neurological deficit

          -  The subject has a history of a central nervous system (CNS) disorder(s)

          -  The subject is pregnant or is planning on becoming pregnant in the next two years

          -  The subject has chemical dependency problems as evidenced by a history of abusing
             drugs which is documented in their past medical history or is elicited from an
             interview

          -  The subject has a history of significant emotional or psychosocial disturbance
             (anxiety attacks, obsessive/compulsive disorders, depression or schizophrenia) as
             documented in their past medical history or elicited by an interview
