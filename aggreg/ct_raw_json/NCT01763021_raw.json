In the treatment phase, a single dose of PCI-32765 560 mg\n      will be administered orally on Day 1 and Day 11. Rifampin 600 mg (2 X 300 mg) will be\n      administered orally on Days 4 to 13; followed by a single dose of PCI-32765 on Day 11.\n      Follow up will be continued until Day 14. Safety evaluations for adverse events, clinical\n      laboratory tests, electrocardiogram, vital signs, and physical examination will be monitored\n      throughout the study. The duration of the study will be approximately for 45 days."
