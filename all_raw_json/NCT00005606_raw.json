Treatment repeats every 4 weeks in the presence of EBV viremia or\n      lymphoproliferative disease. After 5 patients have received therapy without unacceptable\n      toxicity, patients may receive lymphocytes as prophylactic therapy.\n\n      Patients are followed at 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10-20 patients will be accrued for this study."
