Receiving an organ from a living donor eliminates\n      the need to wait for a deceased donor, an option that many transplant recipients do not\n      survive. However, donating an organ presents health concerns to the donor as well. This\n      study will use surveys to evaluate the understanding of risk and psychological pressure that\n      living organ donors felt when making the decision to donate.  It will also compare\n      participants' answers across geographic, racial and socio-economic backgrounds."
