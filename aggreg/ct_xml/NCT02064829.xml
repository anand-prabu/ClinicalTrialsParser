      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate bioequivalence of IG-001 versus Abraxane in
      female patients with metastatic or locally recurrent breast cancer. In addition, the study
      will compare the safety and tolerance of IG-001 and Abraxane during the bioequivalence
      2-period crossover portion of the study. The study will also evaluate the long-term safety
      of IG-001 over repeated cycles, up to 4 additional cycles of administration.

      This study is designed to compare the pharmacokinetics (PK) of IG-001 and Abraxane in
      patients with metastatic or locally recurrent breast cancer. Patients meeting the
      eligibility criteria will be randomized to determine which drug is administered first.

        -  Patients randomized to Group 1 will receive a single dose of IG-001 (Period 1) followed
           3 weeks later by a single dose of Abraxane (Period 2).

        -  Patients randomized to Group 2 will receive a single dose of Abraxane (Period 1)
           followed 3 weeks later by a single dose of IG-001 (Period 2).

      Blood samples for PK analysis will be taken at specified times before, during, and after the
      infusion of each drug in Periods 1 and 2. Following successful completion of Period 1 and
      Period 2, patients may be eligible for up to 4 additional cycles of treatment with IG-001 in
      the extension study.

      Safety will be monitored throughout the study.
