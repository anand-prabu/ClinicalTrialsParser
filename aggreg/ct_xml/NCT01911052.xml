  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inadequate bowel preparation results in decreased rates of cecal intubation, increased rates
      of missing important lesions, increased patient discomfort, higher risk of complications,
      prolonged procedure time and increased health-care cost. Recent study reported that
      Telephone-based re-education (TRE) on the day before colonoscopy significantly improved the
      quality of bowel preparation and polyp detection rate. However, there is no study to compare
      the effect of telephone with short message system (SMS) based re-education on the quality of
      bowel preparation in health screened population. Our goal is to improve the quality of bowel
      preparation with telephone or SMS based re-education for outpatients undergoing screening
      colonoscopies. The investigators hypothesise that efforts to improve education and maximise
      patient compliance during the preparatory period will enhance the efficacy of bowel
      preparation.
