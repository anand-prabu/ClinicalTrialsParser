  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Myo-inositol has been shown to decrease the rate of diabetes in pregnancy in European
      studies.  It is not known exactly how this occurs or what it does to the sugar when the
      supplement is taken. This study purpose is to look at the patient's sugar levels while
      taking the supplement to see if the overall levels of sugar go down.  We hypothesize that in
      addition to sugar levels, other hormones influencing diabetes will be altered.

    <textblock>
      Myo-inositol is important for glucose homeostasis and has been shown to improve insulin
      sensitivity. This is a prospective cohort pilot study to determine daily glycemic
      pharmacokinetics and metabolic influences of myo-inositol supplementation using continuous
      glucose monitoring system (CGMS) and pre- and post-supplement blood work in high risk
      pregnancies and women diagnosed with gestational diabetes mellitis (GDM).  Risk factors
      include: obesity, previous pregnancy with GDM, family history of diabetes, glucose
      intolerance, and polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). Women will have a CGMS device placed on
      day one and begin with 3 days of placebo plus folic acid (400mcg) to determine baseline
      glycemia and metabolic levels.  For the final 4 days, women with take myo-inositol
      supplementation (4g) plus folic acid (400mcg).  The CGMS device will be removed on day 7
      when final blood work will be obtained.  Self-capillary glucose testing 4 times per day is
      recorded to calibrate CGMS glucose values.  These observations will help determine the
      effects of myo-inositol on overall mean glucose and other metabolic factors in high risk and
      GDM patients, identify pharmacokinetic discipline in pregnancy, and develop the groundwork
      for future prospective clinical trials for the prevention and/or augmentation in treatment
      GDM.
