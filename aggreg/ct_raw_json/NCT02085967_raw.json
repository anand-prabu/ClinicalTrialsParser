In Part A, the effects of\n      steady-state dosing of a strong CYP3A inhibitor (itraconazole) or inducer (rifampin) on the\n      pharmacokinetics of E2006 and metabolites will be assessed.  Approximately 30 subjects will\n      be sequentially assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups to receive itraconazole or rifampin in\n      equal numbers (approximately 15 subjects per group).  The itraconazole treatment group will\n      be fully enrolled before enrollment is initiated for the rifampin treatment group.  In Part\n      B, the effects of steady-state dosing of E2006 on the pharmacokinetics of midazolam, a\n      substrate of CYP3A, plus bupropion, a substrate of CYP2B6, will be assessed in approximately\n      24 subjects.  The 2 study parts can be conducted in parallel."
