Treatment repeats every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or\n      unacceptable toxicity. Once the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is reached, patients receive\n      subsequent doses of the inverse sequence of the combination drugs until a new MTD is\n      determined.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of irinotecan and gemcitabine until the MTD\n      is reached. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients\n      experience dose limiting toxicities.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months until death.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: At least 12 patients will be accrued for this study."
