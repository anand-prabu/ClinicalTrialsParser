Shenogen decided to further investigate the efficacy and safety of Icaritin and to\n      explore potential gene targets for treating HCC.\n\n      The results of phase I study showed Icaritin has good safety and tolerance. The biological\n      availability of Icaritin after meal is high and the half-life is relatively short.\n\n      The phase Ib study enrolled 28 subjects. Among the 18 HCC subjects, 12 subjects received\n      treatment in the oral administration group with 600 mg once, twice per day, after meal 30\n      minutes, 6 subjects received treatment in the oral administration group with 800 mg once,\n      twice per day, after meal 30 minutes. The results showed that in the 600mg group there are\n      12 HCC patients whose therapeutic efficacy is evaluable now, one case of PR (10%), 5 cases\n      of SD (50%) and 4 cases of PD (40%) were observed.Safety data showed that totally 24 AEs are\n      probably related to investigational drug. Among them, 19 AEs are grade I, 5 AEs are grade\n      II, no grade III or above AE."
