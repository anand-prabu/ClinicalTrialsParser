CAMPATH-IH\n      is an investigational drug. CAMPATH-1H is used to prevent participants from rejecting or\n      refusing to let the donor blood cells grow in the body. After the drug treatment,\n      participants will be given bone marrow from a brother or sister who has healthy bone marrow\n      that matches."
