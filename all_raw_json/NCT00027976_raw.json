Patients\n      are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral celecoxib twice daily for 9 months in the absence of\n           disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo as in arm I. Patients are followed at 2 months\n           after completing treatment.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 240 patients (120 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this\n      study."
