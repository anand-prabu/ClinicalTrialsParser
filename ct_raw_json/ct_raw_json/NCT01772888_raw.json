Follow-up for 3 years.\n\n      Study hypothesis: Chewing efficiency, maximum bite and lip force decrease with time in ALS\n      patients and may be a marker of texture adaptation and PEG necessity.\n\n      Study aims:  The primary aim is to determine whether chewing efficiency, determined by a\n      two-colour mixing ability test, and maximum bite and lip force decrease in ALS patients.\n\n      The secondary aims are to determine, in ALS patients, whether:\n\n        -  Maximum bite and lip force decrease.\n\n        -  Chewing efficiency, maximum bite and lip force decrease more in ALS patients with\n           bulbar than with spinal onset.\n\n        -  Chewing efficiency and bite force correlate with energy intakes, nasofibroscopic\n           assessment, and a validated swallowing questionnaire.\n\n        -  Saliva volume increases with time and progression of disease and influences masticatory\n           efficiency.\n\n        -  Saliva volume is associated with nasofibroscopy assessment.\n\n      Methods : Every three months, we will perform:\n\n        -  As part of the ongoing cohort study (already accepted by the Ethical Committee)\n           calculation of energy intakes through a 24h recall, nasofibroscopy, swallowing\n           questionnaire and score of disease severity.\n\n        -  As part of this study: assessment of dental status at first visit, chewing efficiency\n           test by a with a colour mixing ability test, maximum voluntary bite and lip force,\n           saliva volume and calculation of a 3-day dietary recall instead of a 24h recall.\n\n      Statistics: Evolutions with time and between groups, of chewing efficiency, bite and lip\n      force will be assessed by repeated measures ANOVA. Correlations between two continuous\n      variables will be examined by Spearman's correlation coefficients at the different time\n      points. Correlations between a continuous variable and a binary variable (nasofibroscopic\n      assessment) will be explored by logistic regression with mixed effect model."
