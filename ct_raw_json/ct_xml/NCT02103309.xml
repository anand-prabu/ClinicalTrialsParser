      The purpose of this study is to evaluate lens centration and subjective impressions of
      DAILIES® AquaComfort Plus® (DACP) lenses compared to 1-DAY ACUVUE® MOIST® (1DAM) lenses in
      ball sports players.

             irritation

          -  Those who have had ocular disorder or ocular surgery that may affect soft contact
             lens wear within 3 months before the start of the study

          -  Those who are participating in another clinical study or research or have a plan of
             such participation during the present study
