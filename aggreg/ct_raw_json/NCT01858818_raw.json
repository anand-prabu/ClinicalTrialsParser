Project 4 aims to investigate how dysfunctional learning and\n      habitization are affected by acute alcohol exposure, and whether individual differences in\n      such alcohol effects can predict later development of AUDs. The project investigates eighty\n      18-year-old healthy male subjects, a subsample of LeAD project 1 that were already tested in\n      Dresden using fMRI(Clinical Trials.govID: NCT01744834). Participants are tested on two days\n      in a within-subjects design with blinded administration of alcohol or placebo. On 2 days\n      participants are performing three behavioral and learning tasks measuring: 1. conditioning\n      of money vs. drink stimuli 2. habitization vs. instrumental learning and 3. approach and\n      avoidance behavior towards money and drink stimuli. The investigators investigate how\n      alcohol influences the performance during these tasks, whether alcohol effects differ\n      between high- and low-risk subjects, and whether task performance under alcohol predicts\n      future AUDs. Participants will be followed up after three years. The project  investigates\n      whether single doses of alcohol affect the conditioning of monetary reward or alcoholic\n      stimuli, impair instrumental learning, and enhance stimulus-response associations. The\n      investigators want to test whether individual performance parameters are related to other\n      risk factors for AUDs, e.g. family history of alcoholism or impulsivity."
