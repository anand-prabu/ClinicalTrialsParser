            "textblock": "Climacteric or Menopausal Transition is defined as the time period where there is a change\n      to non-reproductive reproductive life, with extension of variable length. During this\n      period, and after the establishment of Menopause and non-functioning ovarian, the appearance\n      of various symptoms that express the depletion of ovarian follicles is common; among these\n      symptoms, the most frequently reported by women are vasomotor symptoms or hot flashes. In\n      addition to hormonal therapy, other medications have been employed in an attempt to improve\n      these symptoms; although they present better results than placebo, yet have little clinical\n      impact in reducing vasomotor symptoms. Therefore, this gap allows the evaluation of\n      alternative therapies, such as Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS). The rationale\n      for studying the effect of this technique in this context is its possible autonomic\n      modulatory effect. What reinforces the choice of this technique is the fact that it\n      demonstrated efficacy in other pathologies such as depression, pain, Parkinson's disease,\n      among others. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a renewed method of\n      non-invasive brain modulation. It is based on a transcranial application of weak direct\n      currents in a non-invasive, simple and painless manner. Its use in the treatment of\n      vasomotor symptoms has not been studied. The objective of this study is to evaluate the\n      improvement of vasomotor symptoms in postmenopausal women, after application of tDCS, and\n      compare them to a control group. This Randomized Clinical Trial will be held in female\n      postmenopausal patients, followed in the outpatient Menopause Clinic of Obstetrics and\n      Gynecology Service, Hospital de Clinicas de Porto Alegre. From these results, it is expected\n      to present a new therapeutic option in the treatment of vasomotor symptoms."
