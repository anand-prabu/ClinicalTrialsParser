            "textblock": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VaD) are the most common forms of dementia.\n      Yet, the cause of these diseases is still unknown. A potentially important initiating factor\n      is a disrupted blood-brain barrier. This can initiate cerebral microangiopathy, which has\n      frequently been associated with VaD. Nevertheless, also in most AD patients a substantial\n      increase of vascular damage has been observed. The present study investigates the\n      correlation between blood-brain-barrier breakdown and cognitive decline in AD and VaD. An\n      innovative dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI scan that has recently been developed and tested at\n      our institute, will be used to measure blood-brain barrier permeability.\n\n      Objective: We will investigate the relationship between this permeability measure and (i)\n      cognitive performance and (ii) the status of MRI visible cerebrovascular pathology (i.e.\n      white matter hyperintensities, lacunar infarctions, microbleeds) in the most common forms of\n      dementia."
