            "textblock": "Leading medical organizations have called on primary care pediatricians to take a central\n      role in the prevention of childhood obesity.  Weight counseling typically has not been\n      incorporated into routine pediatric practice due to time and training constraints.  Brief\n      interventions with simple behavior change messages are needed to reach high-risk children,\n      particularly Latino and Black children who are disproportionately affected by obesity and\n      related comorbidities.  Steps to Growing Up Healthy (Added Value) is a randomized controlled\n      trial testing the efficacy of brief motivational counseling (BMC) delivered by primary care\n      clinicians and the added value of supplementing BMC with monthly contact by community health\n      workers (CHW) in the prevention/reversal of obesity in Latino and Black children ages 2-4\n      years old.    Mother-child dyads (targeted n=150) are recruited for this 12-month randomized\n      trial at an inner-city pediatric primary care clinic and randomized to: 1) BMC delivered by\n      clinicians and nurses at well, sick, and WIC visits with the goal of reducing obesogenic\n      behaviors (BMC); 2) BMC plus monthly phone calls by a CHW (BMC+Phone); or 3) BMC plus\n      monthly home visits by a CHW (BMC+Home).  During BMC, the medical team facilitates the\n      selection of a specific goal (i.e., reduce sugar sweetened beverage consumption) that is\n      meaningful to the mother and teaches the mother simple behavioral strategies.  Monthly\n      contacts with CHWs are designed to identify and overcome barriers to goal progress. Dyads\n      are assessed at baseline and 12 months and the primary outcome is change in the child's BMI\n      percentile.  We hypothesize that BMC+Phone and BMC+Home will produce greater reductions in\n      BMI percentiles than BMC alone and that BMC+Home will produce greater reductions in BMI\n      percentiles than BMC+Phone."
