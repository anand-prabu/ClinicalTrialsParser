            "textblock": "Complaints about memory and thinking are common in women as they go through menopause and\n      estrogen levels fall. The ovarian hormone estrogen is important for supporting normal\n      cognitive function, and changes in brain activity and function occur when estrogen levels\n      are decreased. Estrogen is also important for maintaining healthy blood vessels which also\n      support normal cognitive function. In Alzheimer's disease and other types of dementia, there\n      is significant damage to the blood vessels in the brain. This study will test whether\n      changes in brain activity and function with the loss of estrogen are related to changes in\n      vascular function. We will measure vascular function using ultrasound, and brain activity\n      using MRI scans in women who are enrolled in the Females, Aging, Metabolism and Exercise\n      (FAME) study (NCT01712230). In the FAME study, healthy premenopausal women either take a\n      medication to decrease their estrogen levels, or a placebo. This sub-study may provide new\n      information about how estrogen affects vascular function and cognitive function, and lead to\n      new ways to prevent or delay cognitive impairment or dementia."
