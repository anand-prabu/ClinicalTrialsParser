This constitutes a\n      major therapeutic problem and new treatment approaches are highly needed.\n\n      Cabazitaxel (Jevtana\u00ae) is a new taxane with effect in breast and prostatic cancer. In both\n      tumors it has effect in patients refractory to taxotere. Consequently, it could be\n      anticipated that cabazitaxel may have an effect in platinum refractory ovarian cancer."
