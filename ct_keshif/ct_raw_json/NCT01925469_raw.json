            "textblock": "Hysterosalpingography (HSG) is a radiographic evaluation during which a radio-opaque medium\n      is inserted through the cervical canal in order to define the size and shape of the uterine\n      cavity and patency of the fallopian tubes. The utility of HSG is an integral part of the\n      evaluation of infertile women for intrauterine pathology. In some cases, HSG can a painful\n      procedure. Poor pain control can limit the quality of the study due to inability to complete\n      the procedure in cases of extreme discomfort. There is little consensus regarding pain\n      control during HSG, although a number of approaches have been studied.  Patients undergoing\n      HSG are typically advised to premedicate with ibuprofen, which is consistent with the\n      current standard of care. This study will assess pain control using a benzocaine spray (in\n      addition to ibuprofen) in patients undergoing routine HSG at the Hospital of the University\n      of Pennsylvania. All patients who present to the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania\n      for HSG will be eligible for the study. Benzocaine spray versus a placebo spray will be\n      applied to a tenaculum (a surgical hooklike instrument used to grasp and hold the cervix).\n      The tenaculum will then be applied to the cervix prior to HSG and pain relief will be\n      assessed at 3 time intervals: 0, 5, and 30 minutes. The primary outcome is the mean\n      difference in patients pain score and will be measured using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)\n      which has been shown to be a valid and reliable scale.  The secondary outcome will assess\n      patient satisfaction in each group using a validated patient satisfaction survey.  The study\n      design will be prospective, randomized, placebo controlled, and double blinded."
