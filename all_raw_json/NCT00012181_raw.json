Determine the toxic effects and pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients.\n\n      III. Determine the antitumor activity of this drug in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study.\n\n      Patients receive flavopiridol IV over 1 hour on days 1-3. Treatment repeats every 21 days in\n      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 3 to 6 patients receive escalating doses of flavopiridol until the maximum\n      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2\n      of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed every 6 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 30 patients will be accrued for this study within 18 months."
