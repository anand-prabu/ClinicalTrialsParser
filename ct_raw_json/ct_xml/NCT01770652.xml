  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multi-center, non-randomized, open-label, single-dose, parallel group study to determine the
      effect of impaired renal function on the PK of deferiprone and its 3-O-glucuronide
      metabolite following a single oral dose of 33mg/kg Ferriprox®.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Post-marketing study to evaluate the effect of impaired renal function on the
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of deferiprone and its 3-O-glucuronide metabolite and on the safety of
      Ferriprox® in subjects with mild, moderate and severe renal impairment as compared to
      healthy volunteers.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>From serum and urine deferiprone concentration-time profiles: Cmax, Tmax, AUC0-t,AUC0-∞ ,T½ , CL/F,,CLr, Vd/F, Ae, Fe. From serum and urine deferiprone 3-O-glucuronide concentration-time profiles: Cmax, Tmax, AUC0-t, AUC0-∞, T½, CLr, Ae.</measure>
    <time_frame>Prior to dosing and at 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 1, 1.33, 1.66, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 16 and 24 hours post-dose</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Pharmacokinetic parameters will be assessed over a 24 hour interval using blood and urine samples for analyses of deferiprone and its 3-O-glucuronide metabolite in subjects with normal, mild, moderate and severe renal impairment.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Safety and tolerability of Ferriprox® in subjects with renal impairment.</measure>
    <time_frame>Prior to dosing until 72 hours post-dose</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>Yes</safety_issue>
    <description>Safety and tolerability will be assessed based on changes in: physical examinations, vital signs, 12-lead ECG, clinical laboratory tests, use of concomitant medication and frequency of adverse events (AEs) following a single dose of Ferriprox.</description>
