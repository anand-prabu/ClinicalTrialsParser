            "textblock": "This study examines the effects of smoking low nicotine cigarettes in different groups of\n      smokers. The investigators are focusing on differences in how smokers' bodies break down and\n      eliminate nicotine from their systems. Some people are fast metabolizers of nicotine,\n      meaning they break down and eliminate nicotine from their bodies more quickly. Other people\n      are slower metabolizers meaning they break down and eliminate nicotine more slowly. The\n      investigators are comparing these two groups of smokers for their responses to low nicotine\n      cigarettes. The investigators hypothesize that individuals who smoke low nicotine cigarettes\n       may smoke more intensely or smoke more each day, thereby maintaining their desired nicotine\n      levels, and as a result continue to be exposed to significant toxin levels."

Provide a baseline breath CO reading equal to or greater than 10 parts per million.\n\n          5. smoke predominantly non-menthol filtered cigarettes (research cigarettes are only\n             non-menthol).\n\n          6. not currently  using  any  other  nicotine  containing products such as cigars,\n             smokeless tobacco, nicotine replacement therapies (patch or gum).\n\n          7. are fluent in English and are capable of providing written informed consent, which\n             includes compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed in the combined\n             consent and HIPAA form.\n\n        Participants who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria and attend an Intake Visit for\n        medical screening will be asked to provide a blood sample to determine NMR.
