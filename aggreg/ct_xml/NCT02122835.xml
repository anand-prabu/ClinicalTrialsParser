  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to understand the differences in how patients with heart
      failure respond to exercise training compared to patients with heart failure and type 2
      diabetes.

      The investigators will measure exercise capacity in patients with heart failure or heart
      failure plus type 2 diabetes prior to and following a 12-week exercise training program
      (5d/wk, 30 min/d, 60-75% VO2max) to determine whether improvements in exercise capacity in
      response to exercise training are mitigated in patients with combined heart failure plus
      type 2 diabetes.
