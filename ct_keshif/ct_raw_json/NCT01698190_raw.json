            "textblock": "When ultrasound is used during endoscopy, we are able to visualize the structures adjacent\n      to the gastrointestinal tract in close detail.  Once the mass is visualized, we use\n      endoscopic ultrasound to obtain a tissue sample, which the pathologist can examine in order\n      to provide a diagnosis.\n\n      The conventional method for obtaining a sample of tissue with endoscopic ultrasound is\n      called fine needle aspiration (FNA).  This involves the insertion of a thin needle into the\n      mass and obtaining a small sample of tissue which the pathologist can examine.  An\n      alternative technique is called fine needle biopsy (FNB), and involves the insertion of a\n      thin double-edged needle into the mass.  This double-edged needle may potentially provide a\n      larger sample of tissue to examine.\n\n      Both of these techniques are commonly used, and both methods are equally safe.  However, it\n      is not known if one of these techniques is more effective at obtaining a sample of tissue or\n      if one of these techniques is more cost-effective than the other.  The purpose of this study\n      is to determine if one method is more efficacious and cost-effective than the other while\n      maintaining diagnostic accuracy.  The results of this study may alter the way\n      gastroenterologists obtain tissue samples during endoscopic ultrasound, improving the\n      utility of the exam and reducing unnecessary healthcare costs."
