            "textblock": "Novel treatments are needed in anal cancer. An important percentage of patients with locally\n      advanced anal cancer will have persistent loco-regional disease or develop systemic\n      metastases. Virtually all cases of anal cancer are related to infection by HPV. Anal cancer\n      cells infected with HPV have the tumor associated antigen HPV E7. ADXS11-001 causes antigen\n      presenting cells to be stimulated to facilitate immune cells to attack cancer cells\n      expressing HPV E7. ADXS11-001, at the phase II dose of 1x109 CFU,  has been shown to be safe\n      in patients with advanced cervical cancer which also is caused by HPV infection. Anti-tumor\n      activity and safety have been demonstrated in cervical cancer to single agent ADXS11-001 and\n      the combination of ADXS11-001 and cisplatin chemotherapy. Data presented at ASCO 2012\n      ADXS11-001 is currently being evaluated in women in the United States with cervical\n      intraepithelial neoplasia. Radiation may augment the activity of ADXS11-001 increasing the\n      exposure of tumor related antigens thereby increasing the chance for loco-regional disease\n      eradication and preventing systemic recurrence. Therefore, ADXS11-001 may increase complete\n      response, prevent recurrence disease and increase disease-free and overall survival in anal\n      cancer. This protocol will develop sufficient preliminary safety and efficacy data to\n      facilitate the investigation of ADXS11-001 in anal cancer within \"NRG\", the newly formed\n      cooperative group based on the merger of the RTOG, NSABP and GOG.\n\n      As described above, Phase I studies and preliminary data from phase II studies have\n      demonstrated that ADXS11-001, 1x109 CFU, can be safely administered as a single agent and in\n      combination with chemotherapy. For example in over 200 patients treated at the dose of\n      1x109CFU there have been no cases of severe listeria bacteremia or grade 3 cardiopulmonary\n      toxicity. However, since ADXS11-001 has not previously been administered with radiation, the\n      primary objective of this study will be to establish the safety of the addition of\n      ADXS11-001 to chemoradiation for anal cancer. The following schedules will be assessed.\n\n        -  Treatment Schedule #1:  The first dose will be given 10-14 days prior to the initiation\n           of chemoradiation. The 2nd-4th dosages of ADXS11-001will not be until after completion\n           of all chemoradiation. The second dosage of ADXS11-001 will not be administered until a\n           minimum of 10 days after completion of chemoradiation, ANC > 1,000 cells/mm3, serum\n           creatinine < 1.5 mg/dl and all toxicities from chemoradiation have resolved to grade 2\n           or less. The subsequent third and fourth treatment with of ADXS11 will be administered\n           at 28 day intervals. This will provide the needed safety data to evaluate Treatment\n           Schedule #2.\n\n        -  Treatment Schedule #2: If dose limiting toxicities (defined below) are not exceeded\n           during Treatment Schedule #1, then Treatment Schedule #2 will investigate\n           administration of the second dose of ADXS11-001 on day 21 of chemoradiation.\n           Administration of ADXS11-001 on day 21 of chemoradiation would only be administered if\n           ANC > 1,000 cells/mm3, serum creatinine < 1.5mg/dl and all toxicities from ongoing\n           chemoradiation were grade 2 or less. The third treatment with ADXS11-001 would be\n           administered no less than 10 days after completion of all chemoradiation, if ANC >\n           1,000 cells/mm3, serum creatinine < 1.5mg/dl and all toxicities from ongoing\n           chemoradiation were grade 2 or less. The fourth treatment would be 28 days later.\n\n      Standard treatment with mitomycin, 5-FU and radiation for anal cancer has substantial\n      toxicity. In RTOG 9811, 74% of patients had grade 3/4 nonhematologic toxicity and 61% of\n      patients had grade 3 or grade 4 hematologic toxicity from this regimen. Therefore, the\n      toxicities of standard chemoradiation with mitomycin, 5-FU and radiation are well above the\n      conventionally accepted parameters in a phase I study even prior to adding ADXS11-001.\n      However, it is critical that the addition of ADXS-11-001 does not compromise the delivery of\n      potentially curative standard chemoradiation for anal cancer."
