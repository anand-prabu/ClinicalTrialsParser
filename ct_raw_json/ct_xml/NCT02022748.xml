      A phase I, open-label study comparing the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety and
      tolerability of ticagrelor in hemodialysis patients to healthy subjects with normal renal
      function.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a single dose, randomised, open label, parallel group study conducted in the US
      to examine the PK, PD, safety, and tolerability of ticagrelor in ESRD subjects on HD
      compared with healthy subjects with normal renal function. Up to a total of 30 male and
      female adult subjects greater than or equal to 18 years of age will be dosed to assure that
      there will be 20 evaluable subjects (10 subjects on HD and in 10 healthy subjects with
      normal renal function (CrCL ≥90 mL/min). Subjects will be required to have an inpatient stay
      from the day prior to dosing until the 48-hour post-dose time-point to ensure that all PK
      samples are collected at the appropriate timepoints. The study will be conducted in two
      groups: Group A consisting of ESRD subjects, Group B consisting of healthy subjects. A
      crossover design will be implemented for Group A subjects as follows: Group A subjects will
      be randomized into two sequences, Sequence 1 and Sequence 2. In Sequence 1, subjects will
      receive treatment A in Period 1 and treatment B in Period 2. There will be washout period of
      10-14 days between Period 1 and Period 2 in Sequence 1. Similarly in Sequence 2, subjects
      will receive treatment B in Period 1 and treatment A in Period 2. There will be a washout
      period of 10-14 days between Period 1 and Period 2 in Sequence 2 as well. Treatment A and
      treatment B are defined as follows: Treatment A: subjects will be dosed with an oral 90 mg
      ticagrelor tablet 2 days before the dialysis session; • Treatment B: subjects will be dosed
      with an oral 90 mg ticagrelor tablet just prior to dialysis session. Group B subjects
      (healthy subjects) with normal renal function (CrCL of &gt;90 mL/min) will receive just an oral
      90 mg ticagrelor referred to as treatment H. All doses will be administered in an open-label
      design.
