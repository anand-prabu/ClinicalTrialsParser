After injecting 3 cc of prilocaine to each of the right and left lobes in the right and left periprostatic region, prostatic size was measured and changes in the zonal anatomy and ultrasonographic view of the tissue were defined. Next, biopsy procedure was performed with an 18 G, 20 cm tru-cut biopsy needle and an automatic biopsy gun. After passing beyond the rectal mucosa, the needle was advanced until 0.5 cm proximal to the area of interest by tracking the image of the needle on the screen. As a total,24,26 or 28 biopsies were taken depending on prostate volume."

Patients with an abnormal digital examination\n      findings and/or abnormal serum prostate specific antigen levels were biopsied. The\n      indication for a repeated biopsy was determined as the continued suspicion for a malignancy\n      after the initial benign biopsy result and/or a pathology result consistent with a\n      high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia or atypical small acinar proliferation.\n      Patients who underwent saturation and core 10-12 biopsies at repeated biopsies were\n      compared. Statistical analyses were performed with Shapiro-Wilk test and Mann- Whitney U\n      test. A p value less than 0.05 was accepted as statistically significant."
