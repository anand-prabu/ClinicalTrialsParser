      The purpose of this study is to focus on the effect of platelet-rich-plasma on diabtic ulcer
      foot, as adjuvant treatment along with the standard care of chronic diabetic, and evaluate
      the efficiency and the clinical application of PRP on serious wound healing.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes is a condition in which the body dose not effectively use sugar so that there is
      too much sugar in the blood.  It is estimated that 15% of the diabetics suffer from diabetic
      food ulcers at some point.  The healing process can be slow and easily to be infected with
      some pathogens so the patients are at risk in amputation.  The wound healing process is a
      complex mechanism involves the interaction of molecular signals and different cell types.
      Platelets play important roles in wound healing.  When injury occurs platelets are activated
      with thrombin and clot is formed.  In addition to the function of hemostasis, activated
      platelets release many growth factors that trigger angiogenesis, extracellular matrix
      production and cytokine release, which is need for wound healing.

      Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is a portion of plasma fraction of autologous blood having a high
      concentration of thrombocytes.  Thrombin induces the activation of PRP and results in the
      release of multiple growth factors, including platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF),
      vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), epidermal growth factor   (EGF), insulin-like
      growth factor (IGF), and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β).  PRP is known for the
      capacity to stimulate cell proliferation and differentiation.  PRP can also interact with
      macrophage to improve tissue healing and regeneration, and exhibit potent activities against
      several kinds of pathogens.

      Our study will focus on the advantage of PRP for aiding wound healing for diabetes.  PRP
      from autologous blood can be mixed with thrombin in appropriate ratio and inject into the
      sites around the wound, as adjuvant treatment along with the standard care of chronic
      diabetic.  The wound will be checked 1 to 2 times each week for the evaluation of PRP on
      clinical application.
