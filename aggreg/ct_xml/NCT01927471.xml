  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators would like to determine how aspects of metabolism and age influence
      ovarian function. The purpose of the study is to understand how nutrition and metabolism
      relate to follicle development in women with regular cycles, irregular cycles, or polycystic
      ovary syndrome.

      In the ovaries, eggs rest in fluid filled sacs called follicles. When follicles grow they
      form small fluid-filled cysts that can be easily seen when we use ultrasound to view the
      ovaries. In women with regular menstrual cycles, groups of follicles grow and regress 2 to 3
      times during their cycle (usually over a 28- day period). Several of these follicles grow to
      a stage where they begin to develop the potential to ovulate - but in general only one
      follicle is chosen to ovulate. Thus, at any given time during the menstrual cycle, numerous
      fluid-filled follicles can be visualized in a woman's ovaries at various stages of
      development using transvaginal ultrasonography.  In women with absent or infrequent
      menstrual cycles, very little is known about the growth patterns of their follicles and how
      factors such as metabolic hormones, might play a role in the failure to ovulate. Being
      underweight or overweight increases your chances of having irregular or absent menstrual
      cycles and a history of abnormal reproductive function compounds your risks for chronic
      diseases such as infertility, diabetes, hypertension, atherosclerosis and certain cancers.
      This is particularly the case for women with PCOS that have menstrual cycles that appear to
      worsen or improve depending on their body weight and metabolic status. Polycystic ovary
      syndrome (PCOS) is an endocrine disorder that affects 6-12% of reproductive-aged women
      within the general population. The hallmark features of PCOS are menstrual irregularity,
      increased levels of androgens, and polycystic ovaries. The current diagnostic criteria
      require 2 out of 3 of these features to be present for the diagnosis, therefore a number of
      phenotypes of PCOS exist. However, the metabolic and reproductive differences across the
      phenotypic spectrum of PCOS are not well understood. Women with PCOS characteristically have
      polycystic ovaries, where up to 10 times more follicles are present in the ovary at any
      given time. Further, the follicle-size populations and overall distribution throughout the
      ovary varies in women - follicles may be situated around the periphery of the ovary or may
      be distributed throughout the ovary. Presumably these small follicles are arrested in
      development - but emerging data from the Lujan laboratory suggest that this is not the case.
      Rather, follicles continue to grow in a dynamic pattern during these prolonged periods of
      anovulation. By comparing follicle populations, reproductive hormones and markers of
      metabolism in women with regular cycles, women with irregular cycles, and women with a
      history of PCOS, the researchers plan to identify what factors might explain why fertility
      potential and long-term health are compromised in some women but not in others. By including
      women at both early and late stages of their reproductive potential, the researchers will
      also be able to assess what influence age has on these factors. The ultimate goal of this
      research is to understand how nutrition and metabolism regulate follicle development in
      women so we can better develop lifestyle and drug therapies to help women preserve their
      fertility and long-term health. Since obesity has recently become the leading cause of
      infertility in North America, these studies are especially important.

      To accomplish these objectives, the investigators plan to recruit 150 women with regular
      menstrual cycles and 150 women with irregular menstrual cycles, with or without PCOS
      (sub-grouped into 75 women with irregular menstrual cycles and 75 women with a history of
      PCOS). Their goal is to recruit an equal number of women in each group such that they are
      matched for age (18 - 48 years old) and body mass index (BMI; Normal weight = 18 - 24 kg/m2;
      Overweight = 25 - 29 kg/m2; Obese = 30kg/m2). Women will be included in the PCOS sub-group
      if they have a confirmed PCOS diagnosis from their primary care provider. Ultrasound scans
      of the ovaries will be assessed for the total number, size, and distribution of follicles
      using both two- and three-dimensional imaging techniques. Participants will have blood
      samples collected determine serum concentrations of luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle
      stimulating hormone (FSH), estradiol, progesterone, anti-müllerian hormone (AMH), and
      inhibin B. The following metabolic parameters will be assessed: (1) 75-gram oral glucose
      tolerance test to characterize glucose and insulin dynamics at 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120
      minutes post-glucose ingestion; (2) dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan to quantify body
      fat and lean muscle distribution; (3) vitals and anthropometry assessment to measure waist
      and hip circumference, height, weight, blood pressure, and heart rate, and (4) fasting blood
      tests to detect serum concentrations of androgens (i.e., total testosterone,
      androstenedione, free androgen index) and serum markers of metabolic syndrome (i.e., lipids
      and hemoglobin A1C).
