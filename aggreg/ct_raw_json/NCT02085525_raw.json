The\n      variables studied included; rate of hospitalization, dose completion and dose reductions.\n      The results revealed an overall improvement in all variables for those patients seen in the\n      weekly NP clinic.\n\n      To further analyze this data a randomized, prospective study is proposed to validate the\n      findings of the retrospective study. It is predicted that a weekly NP led clinic will\n      decrease costly hospitalizations, increase patient treatment completion and improve overall\n      patient quality of life and satisfaction."
