      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the incidence of urinary and rectal acute side
      effects of a pelvic and prostatic intensity-modulated arctherapy with simultaneous
      integrated boost (SIB-IMRT)combined with long-term androgen deprivation for patients with
      high risk localized prostate cancer
