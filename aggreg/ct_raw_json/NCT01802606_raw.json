The patients were randomly\n      allocated into control group, cefazolin group and levofloxacin group, with digital meter\n      method , 400 in each group. The data such as age, sex, case number, length of hospital stay,\n      antibiotic usage, post-operative infection, infection site, bacterial culture were filled in\n      self-designed forms on computer."

The\n      surgical-site infection (SSI) was diagnosed according to the criteria of the Centers for\n      Disease Control and Prevention [5-6].\n\n      We chose cefazolin sodium and levofloxacin sodium chloride injection as peri-operative\n      antibiotics. Cefazolin sodium is an effective antibiotic with a short plasma elimination\n      half-life against gram-positive cocci (GPC) except for enterococci and meticillin-resistant\n      staphylococci. It is recommended as one of the prior antibacterial agents used for clearing\n      cuts and preventing infection in many countries including China. Levofloxacin sodium\n      chloride injection has a wide anti-bacterial spectrum composed of gram-negative bacteria and\n      gram-positive anaerobic bacteria including anaerobic bacteria. It can remain a high\n      concentration in urine, so it is recommended as an attractive antibiotic for urinary tract\n      operation [5].\n\n      In the control group, we gave normal saline as placebo by intravenous drip infusion for\n      30-60 min before operation. Cefazolin group and levofloxacin group received intravenous\n      administration of cefazolin sodium 1000 mg and levofloxacin sodium chloride injection 200\n      mg, respectively, for 30-60 min before operation."
