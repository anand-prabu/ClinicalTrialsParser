Their incidence is 6,6/1000 people-year and this amount increases from 40\n      years old. The majority are successfully treated with immobilization  and rehabilitation.\n      The surgical treatment is recommended in case of displacement. In elderly population with\n      fractures types three or four of Neer's classification  there is no consensus on which\n      technique is the best surgical option. Classically hemiarthroplasty has been widely\n      performed as a reconstruction method but its outcomes in old patients are unclear due to the\n      bad bone quality and joint features. Recently some authors recommend the reverse\n      arthroplasty in patients over 70 years old . The aim of this study is to compare the results\n      between Hemiarthroplasty and reverse arthroplasty in patients over 70 years old. As far as\n      the investigators are concerned there's no published studies like this."
