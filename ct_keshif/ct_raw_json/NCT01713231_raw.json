            "textblock": "-  Overall Objective: To test the hypothesis that oral vitamin D supplementation at higher\n           than currently prescribed doses has a beneficial effect on the skeleton of young\n           patients with osteogenesis imperfecta (OI).\n\n        -  Specific Aims: 1. To determine whether 12 months of high-dose vitamin D\n           supplementation, compared to standard-dose vitamin D supplementation, increases areal\n           bone mineral density z-scores at the lumbar spine. 2. To examine the effectiveness of\n           high-dose vitamin D supplementation to increase trabecular and cortical bone mineral\n           density at the radius. 3. To examine whether high-dose vitamin D supplementation has an\n           effect on physiological determinants of bone mass (parathyroid hormone, activity of\n           bone metabolism, muscle function).\n\n        -  Background: In a preliminary cross-sectional study of 282 OI patients we observed an\n           inverse relationship between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D and parathyroid hormone levels\n           and a positive relationship between circulating levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D and\n           lumbar spine areal bone mineral density z-scores. This suggested that high-dose vitamin\n           D supplementation would have a beneficial effect on bone density. Most OI patients\n           currently receive oral vitamin D supplementation of 400 International Units per day,\n           but doses of 2000 International Units per day are safe and have been shown to be\n           beneficial in studies on healthy adolescents.\n\n        -  Study Design: This is a parallel-group double-blind randomized controlled trial of 12\n           months duration on 60 children and adolescents aged 6 to 19 years with a clinical\n           diagnosis of OI. One group of 30 participants will be randomized to receive vitamin D3\n           at a dose of 2000 international units per day ('high-dose group'). The other group of\n           30 participants will be randomized to receive vitamin D3 at a dose of 400 international\n           units per day ('standard-dose group'). Randomization will be stratified according to\n           pubertal status and bisphosphonate treatment status.\n\n        -  Clinical Relevance: The proposed study aims at direct improvements in the care of OI\n           patients. If a simple and low-cost 'intervention' such as high-dose vitamin D\n           supplementation can be shown to be effective in relieving some of the disease burden\n           associated with OI, the benefit to OI patients worldwide would be substantial."
