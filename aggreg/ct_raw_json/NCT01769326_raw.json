This study involves research because it will test two\n      experimental devices, the MusicGlove and the Resonating Arm Exerciser (RAE), compared to\n      conventional hand and arm exercises.  The MusicGlove is a glove that measures finger\n      movements and allows its user to play a musical computer game using those movements. The RAE\n      is a lever that attaches to a manual wheelchair with elastic bands and can be pushed back\n      and forth to exercise the arm."
