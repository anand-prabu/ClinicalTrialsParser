  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to examine the effects of timing of administration of
      intravenous (IV) acetaminophen and how timing relates to analgesic efficacy as measured by
      postoperative pain scores. A maximum of 138 patients meeting inclusion criteria who present
      for a scheduled total hip replacement under general anesthesia will be randomized into one
      of two arms: 1) the pre-closure group will receive the first dose administered upon onset of
      skin closure,  2) the preemptive group will receive the first dose administered within 60
      minutes prior to incision.  Both groups will receive subsequent doses every 6 hours x 24
      hours.

      acetaminophen administered upon onset of skin closure,  2) the preemptive group will receive
      the first dose of one gram of intravenous acetaminophen administered within 60 minutes prior
      to incision.  Both groups will receive subsequent doses of one gram of intravenous
      acetaminophen every 6 hours x 24 hours. The maximum dose in a 24 hour period will not exceed
      4 grams according to FDA recommendations.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients 30-75 years of age weighing ≥55 kg scheduled for elective total hip
             arthroplasty performed under general anesthesia will be included.  As determined by
             the anesthesia team assigned to the case, eligible patients will also be assigned ASA
             physical status of I, II, or III and deemed capable of reporting their perceived pain
             using numeric pain scales and capable of operating a patient controlled anesthesia
             (PCA) device.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Exclusion criteria include known allergy, hypersensitivity, or contraindication to
             acetaminophen, history of alcohol or drug abuse, prisoners, emergency THAs, patients
             with chronic malnutrition or a body mass index (BMI) &lt; 18 kg/m2 and non-English
             speaking patients. Additional exclusion criteria include impaired liver function
             defined as AST and ALT each ≥ twice normal limits and renal dysfunction (creatinine
             &gt;2.0 mg/dl).
