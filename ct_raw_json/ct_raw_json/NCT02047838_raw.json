The primary outcome\n      of the study was to assess the impact on ovarian reserve of second surgery for recurrent\n      unilateral endometriomas. The evaluation of ovarian reserve was performed by assessing serum\n      AMH level, serum FSH level, 17-beta estradiol level and antral follicle count."
