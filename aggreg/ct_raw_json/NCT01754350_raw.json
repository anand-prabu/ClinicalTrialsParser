Thereby, glucose is\n      important for the generation of ATP, supply of anabolic substrates and defense against\n      reactive oxygen species in tumor cells. In preclinical models, restricting glucose\n      availability using a ketogenic diet, calorie-restriction or transient fasting inhibits tumor\n      growth.\n\n      Therefore, the purpose of the study is to evaluate whether a calorie-restricted, ketogenic\n      diet and transient fasting can enhance the efficacy of reirradiation in patients with\n      recurrent glioblastoma."
