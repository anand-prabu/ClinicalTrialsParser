  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anxiety disorders affect 40 to 50% of children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD),
      contributing to substantial distress and impairment. The goal of this study is to examine
      the effectiveness of a personalized type of psychotherapy against standard-care
      psychotherapy for addressing anxiety in youth with ASD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are common neurodevelopmental syndromes affecting 1% of U.S.
      children. Comorbid anxiety disorders affect 40 to 50% of children with ASD, causing
      substantial distress and impairment over and above that caused by ASD alone. Although
      standard practice cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) has been established as an efficacious
      and safe treatment for anxiety disorders among typically developing youth, its utility in
      comorbid cases with ASD remains unknown. To date, no studies have experimentally compared
      standard practice CBT to a cognitive-behavioral intervention that has been personalized for
      children with a comorbid presentation of anxiety and ASD. Accordingly, we are proposing a
      randomized controlled trial to be conducted at three treatment sites to evaluate the
      efficacy of personalized CBT for anxiety in ASD (Behavioral Intervention for Anxiety in
      Children with Autism: BIACA) relative to standard practice CBT for anxiety (Coping Cat
      program). Furthermore, this study will employ a waitlist control group to assess the
      efficacy of each CBT arm relative to the absence of treatment (i.e., a Waitlist control
      arm). The proposed research will: (1) examine the efficacy of BIACA relative to Coping Cat,
      which represents standard practice treatment, and the efficacy of both these treatments
      relative to a waitlist control group, (2) evaluate the maintenance of treatment gains, (3)
      examine the impact of personalized intervention on functional outcomes. A total of 201youth
      across 3 study locations (ages 8-13 years) with ASD and co-occurring anxiety will be
      randomly assigned to one of the three conditions. The three recruitment sites for this study
      are University of California, Los Angeles, the University of South Florida (USF), and Temple
      University. Considering the rising number of children diagnosed with ASD together with the
      frequency and severity of comorbid anxiety, the proposed work is tailored to the unique
      needs of youth with ASD and will provide a timely contribution to public health efforts.
