The children will randomized to receive\n      2500 IU of vitamin D or a placebo. It is intended to enrol 320 children, 160 to receive\n      vitamin D and the other 160 to receive a placebo. This sample size was calculated at 80%\n      power and 5% significance. The children will be enrolled within 24 hours of admission and\n      the intervention (supplement or placebo) will be daily until the child is discharged fron\n      the hospital.\n\n      The severity of ALRTI will be assessed using the modified Respiratory Distress Assessment\n      Instrument (MRDAI) score. The thorough physical examination and classification of severity\n      of the symptoms will be done at enrolment and daily until hospital discharge.\n\n      Blood samples for vitamin D and calcium concentrations will be assessed at enrolment, before\n      the child is given the supplement or placebo.\n\n      The difference in the improvement in MRDAI score between the placebo and the supplement will\n      be assessed by analysis of variance (ANOVA). Similarly the difference in duration of\n      hospital stay between the two groups will also be analysed using ANOVA. The association\n      between the vitamin D levels and the MRDAI score on admission will also be assessed and\n      analysed using ANOVA.\n\n      All eligible children will be sequentially enrolled until the desired sample size is\n      reached. A simple randomisation by means of computer generated numbers will be used to\n      minimize selection bias. Both the study subjects and the investigators will be blinded to\n      the allocation (treatment or placebo). The unblinding will be done only after the analysis\n      has been completed."
