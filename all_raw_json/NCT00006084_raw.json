Determine the safety and efficacy of monoclonal antibody HuG1-M195 as\n      demonstrated by frequency of complete remission (CR) in patients with acute myelogenous\n      leukemia with regimen failure on the control arm of PDL Study 195-301. II. Determine\n      additional evidence of clinical benefit of this treatment as demonstrated by frequency of\n      partial remission (PR), durations of CR and PR, and progression free and overall survival in\n      these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive monoclonal antibody HuG1-M195 (MOAB\n      HuM195) IV over 4 hours on days 1-4 every 2 weeks for 4 courses. Patients without disease\n      progression after completion of course 4 continue to receive MOAB HuM195 as above. Treatment\n      repeats every month for a maximum of 8 additional courses in the absence of disease\n      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 100 patients will be accrued for this study."
