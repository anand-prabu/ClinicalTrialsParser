      The objective of our study is to evaluate the efficacy of helmet ventilation as compared
      with Face mask in patients with respiratory failure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Respiratory failure is often treated with endotracheal intubation and mechanical
      ventilation.  Although, the institution of mechanical ventilation is considered life saving,
      the associated complications of tracheal stenosis,  ventilator associated pneumonia,
      barotrauma , and neuromuscular weakness  are not without considerable morbidity and
      mortality.

      Non-invasive ventilation has demonstrated significant benefit in patients with hypercapnic
      respiratory failure from COPD, acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema, and hypoxemic respiratory
      failure in immunocompromised patients.

      Despite the advantages of non-invasive ventilation via facemask, some patients fail because
      of mask intolerance and severity of disease. Further limitation to facemask non-invasive
      ventilation is that the seal integrity is lost when higher pressures are required.
      Unfortunately, certain types of respiratory failure such as that due to hypoxemia or shock
      may require such higher pressures.

      In an attempt to improve patient tolerability and deliver higher pressures, a transparent
      helmet has been proposed as a novel interface for non-invasive ventilation.  It encloses the
      entire head and neck of the patient. The design of the helmet confers some important
      advantages: 1) the transparency allows the patient to interact with the environment; 2) the
      lack of contact to the face lowers the risk of skin necrosis; 3) the helmet avoids problems
      of leaking with higher airway pressures that are seen with the face mask; 4) it can be
      applied to any patient regardless of facial contour.
