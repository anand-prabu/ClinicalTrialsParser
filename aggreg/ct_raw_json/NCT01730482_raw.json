Six subjects will be dosed, with the goal of having at least 4 subjects\n      complete the study through follow-up. All subjects will be screened within 28 days before\n      admission to the Clinical Unit. Subjects will be confined to the clinical unit for 10 days\n      after dosing and will return to the clinic for a follow-up visit 28 days after dosing.\n\n      Each subject will receive a single oral dose of AT1001 as an aqueous solution containing 150\n      mg [14C] AT1001 (1 \u03bcCi). Blood, duodenal bile, expired air, urine, and feces samples will be\n      collected at specified time points after dosing throughout the period of confinement at the\n      study site. Safety will be assessed throughout the study by monitoring clinical laboratory\n      tests, ECGs, physical examinations, vital signs, and adverse events. The total duration of\n      the study for each subject is approximately 8 weeks."
