  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Compared with standardized western medical drug therapy, this study is mainly about whether
      the combination of standardized western medical drug therapy and Chinese medical continued
      treatment, can further decrease the rate of cardiovascular events for stable angina patients
      and change the condition of angina.

      We will pick 1100 patients who are according with the II、III stage in CHD western medical
      diagnosis standard, treat them with combination of standardized western medical drug therapy
      and Chinese medical continued treatment, or only with standardized western medical drug
      therapy,the treat course will last 6 months. The patients will be separated in two groups:
      Integrative treatment of Chinese medicine and western medicine group(integrative group) and
      western medical group according to the exposure factors(whether the patients accept
      differentiation of TCM ) during the follow-up period, observe the main indexes: Primary
      Endpoint: all because of death, stroke, nonfatal myocardial infarction, revascularization.
      Secondary endpoint: the events needed hospitalization which are because of (acute coronary
      syndrome)ACS,heart failure, severe arrhythmia, and complications. Secondary indexes: angina
      symptoms. Including the attack times, lasting time, inducing factors of angina attacks, pain
      degree of angina, discontinue rate of nitroglycerin, and electrocardiogram.
