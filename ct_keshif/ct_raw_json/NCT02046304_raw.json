EBRT delivered preoperatively (for patients with measurable disease) or postoperatively (for patients who have undergone pre-referral excisional biopsy) to a dose of 50 Gy in 25 fractions at 2.0 Gy per fraction. Radiotherapy given once daily (Monday through Friday) for 5 weeks.  Surgical resection of the post-treatment tumor mass performed 4 to 8 weeks after the final dose of gemcitabine. Gemcitabine administered intravenously (IV) on days 1, 8, 22, 29, 43, and 50, concurrently with radiotherapy. Starting dose of gemcitabine 400 mg/m2 by vein once a week."

Radiation treatments will be given 5 days a week for 5 weeks.\n      The gemcitabine and radiotherapy will be given on an outpatient basis.  Chemotherapy and/or\n      radiotherapy may be stopped if side effects become severe.\n\n      About 4 to 6 weeks after the final dose of gemcitabine, surgery will be done to remove the\n      tumor or to remove any previous surgical scar and leftover tumor.\n\n      During the combined treatment, participants will be seen weekly by the doctor in charge of\n      radiotherapy or by the study nurse.  Blood tests will be done every week during treatment.\n      A MRI scan and a chest x-ray will be done within 14 days before surgery.  A PET scan will be\n      done if thought necessary.\n\n      After the surgery is done, participants will return to M. D. Anderson for follow-up visits\n      every 4 months for the first 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then yearly from then\n      on.  An ultrasound and MRI scan (of the extremity or trunk) will be done 3 months after\n      completion of all treatment.  Ultrasound scans will be performed at each visit.  A MRI scan\n      will only be done again at later visits if needed.\n\n      This is an investigational study.  Gemcitabine is approved for use by the FDA.  Its use\n      together with radiation therapy in this study is experimental.   About 36 individuals will\n      take part in the study.  All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson."
