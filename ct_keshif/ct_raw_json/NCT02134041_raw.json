            "textblock": "We are extending the researches of Taiwan neurosurgery traumatic brain injury (TBI) database\n      which is led by Professor WT Chiu in Taipei Medical University and will recruit mild TBI\n      (mTBI) participants who have ever been registered in the database. This database has been\n      established for over 15 years and contains the information of over 150000 patients. It is\n      one of the largest TBI database in the world.\n\n      TBI usually results from traffic accidents, falls or violence events. Most of the victims\n      are young people and the victims suffer from life-threatening and mental-physical deficits.\n      Mild TBI (mTBI) usually was neglected before because its symptoms, signs are mild and mTBI\n      patients usually were not obtained enough initial treatment. Therefore, mTBI might result in\n      long-term cognitive and affective impairments, such as depression, indifference, anxiety,\n      memory impairment, loss of attention and executive function. These late effects not only\n      decrease the life quality of patients and their family but also increase the social and\n      medical burden.\n\n      Recent epidemiology studies have pointed out that TBI would increase the risk for dementia,\n      especially Alzheimer disease (AD) by 2-4 times. However, the association between TBI\n      severity, number of repeats, genetic factors and onset of AD remains further investigation.\n\n      Amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are the pathological hallmarks for AD.\n      Accumulation of A\u03b2 is considered to be the first step of pathophysilogy of AD. Compelling\n      researches have supported TBI accelerates the formation and accumulation of A\u03b2. These\n      findings could link TBI with AD but the previous researches had limitations. There was lack\n      of mTBI pathology data so the impacts of mTBI on A\u03b2 accumulation were still obscure. By\n      amyloid-PET, we could study the effects of mTBI on the accumulation of A\u03b2 and this tool\n      could be helpful for understanding the real impacts and pathophysiological mechanisms of\n      mTBI on AD."
