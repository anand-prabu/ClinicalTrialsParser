  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A phase Ib dose-escalation study of the AEB071 and MEK162 combination in adult patients with
      confirmed metastatic uveal melanoma.  Cohorts of 3-6 patients will be assessed for dose
      limiting toxicities (DLTs) during Cycle 1 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the
      combination therapy is determined. The MTD or Phase 2 Recommended Dose (P2RD) will be used
      in a Phase II part of the study, which will enrol 55 patients each into two randomized
      groups: the combination therapy or MEK162 alone.  The Phase II part will continue until
      proof of concept is established.  Patients will continue treatment as long as clinical
      benefit is seen and no limiting adverse toxicity is observed
