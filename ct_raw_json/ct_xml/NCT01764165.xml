  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is being conducted to examine the effects of nasal insufflation of warm and
      humidified air through a small nasal cannula on sleep, breathing pulmonary function, and
      daytime exercise capability.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is associated with significant morbidity
      including substantial daytime fatigue exertional intolerance and ventilatory impairment,
      which hits a nadir in the morning. Nocturnal disturbances in sleep and breathing are common
      in COPD, although the impact of these disturbances on COPD morbidity remains largely
      unknown. The hypothesis is that COPD induces specific sleep and breathing disturbances that
      remain a substantial source of morbidity in this disorder.

      Current therapy for treating nocturnal disturbances in sleep and breathing in COPD including
      nocturnal oxygen has failed to improve morning fatigue and pulmonary function. This study
      promises to significantly alter our approach to the diagnosis and management of sleep
      disordered breathing in COPD.

    <description>Patients with COPD often exhibit inspiratory air flow limitation during sleep. We hypothesize that delivering warm and humidified air at a rate of 20 L/min reduces the degree of inspiratory air flow limitation compared to oxygen.</description>

    <description>Patients with COPD have impaired exercise tolerance in the morning.  We hypothesize that delivering warm and humidified air at a rate of 20 L/min over the entire night extends morning 6 minute walk length.</description>

    <description>The combination of in- and expiratory flow limitation can lead to dynamic hyperinflation during sleep. We hypothesize that compared to oxygen, high flow nasal insufflation of warm and humidified air at a rate of 20 L/min will reduce the number of breaths associated with dynamic hyperinflation.</description>
