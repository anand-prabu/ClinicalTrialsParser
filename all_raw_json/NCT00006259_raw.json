Determine the neurologic function in these patients after receiving this\n      treatment regimen. III. Determine the quality of life in these patients with this treatment\n      regimen.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients undergo stereotactic head frame placement, followed by stereotactic\n      radiosurgery using Gamma Knife, on day 1. Quality of life is assessed one week prior to and\n      one week after treatment, and then at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 months. Patients are followed\n      at one week, at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 months, every 4 months for one year, and then every 6\n      months for 3 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 52 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years."
