Assess the pharmacokinetic profile of\n      SAHA in these patients. III. Assess the biologic effects of SAHA on normal tissues and on\n      tumor cells in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid\n      (SAHA) IV over 2 hours on days 1-3. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 8 courses in the\n      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Accelerated Phase: One patient per\n      dose level receives escalating doses of SAHA until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is\n      determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which a patient experiences\n      grade 2 or greater toxicity (other than hemoglobin anemia) with the first course or when 2\n      different patients experience a grade 2 toxicity (other than hemoglobin anemia) during any\n      course of treatment. Standard Phase: Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of\n      SAHA until the MTD is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2\n      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 45 patients will be accrued for this study."
