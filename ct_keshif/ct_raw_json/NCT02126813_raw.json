The currently used\n      interventional threshold for urinary bladder catheterization are a bladder volume of\n      approximately 500 ml., but no evidence exists for this threshold. At the same time, the\n      current knowledge suggest, that a bladder volume up to 1000 ml. for 2-4 hours are safe in\n      humans, and as the use of urinary bladder catheterization are increasing the risk of\n      complications, the investigators are hypothesizing that increasing  the interventional\n      threshold for urinary bladder catheterization after fast-track total hip or knee\n      arthroplasty, will reduce the number of patients needing urinary bladder catheterization,\n      without increasing the incidence of urological complications - including urinary tract\n      infections."
