Data has shown that\n      the following 3 groups of diabetic patients are at extremely high risk for future events:\n\n        1. Obese type 2 diabetic patients: Weight control is a major therapeutic challenge which\n           often requires cognitive-psychological-behavioral therapy (CBT) in addition to\n           pharmacological and surgical interventions. After long disease duration, often\n           characterized by the presence of complications, many obese diabetic patients need\n           insulin to control glycemia which put them at risk of further weight gain  which sets\n           up a vicious cycle.\n\n        2. Young type 2 diabetic patients: In both Pima Indian and Caucasian type 2 diabetic\n           patients, young age of onset substantially increased risk of cardiovascular and renal\n           complications, mainly due to long disease duration. Furthermore, these patients often\n           default follow up or are non-compliant due to competing priorities and lack of\n           symptoms. These young patients also have marked phenotypic heterogeneity characterised\n           by insulin insufficiency and/or obesity with strong family history.\n\n        3. Diabetic patients with established cardiovascular-renal complications. In a series of\n           analyses, Chinese type 2 diabetic patients with established cardiovascular and kidney\n           disease had 38% event rates including all-cause death and cardiovascular-renal\n           complications including peripheral vascular disease (PVD) over 5 years.\n\n      These 3 groups of patients are difficult to treat with many unmet needs requiring complex\n      treatment regimens, intensive counselling and emotional support.\n\n      In a series of studies, the investigators have confirmed the marked benefits of using a team\n      approach to deliver structured care with particular emphasis on continuation of care and\n      periodic reminders on clinical outcomes. Preliminary analysis from our peer support program\n      also demonstrated the benefits of utilizing organized and visual information to communicate\n      personalized risks and targets, further augmented by peer support, to improve risk factor\n      control in type 2 diabetic patients."
