To determine the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of melphalan in patients with normal and\n      abnormal renal function undergoing autologous stem cell transplants for myeloma when treated\n      with palifermin to prevent mucositis.\n\n      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. To assess overall response (compete response [CR], partial response [PR], stable disease\n      [SD]) at D+28 and D+100 after autologous transplant when treated with combination of\n      palifermin and Melphalan.\n\n      II. To evaluate the efficacy of Palifermin as a cytoprotective agent in reducing incidence\n      and duration of Grade 3 and 4 mucositis due to high dose Melphalan.\n\n      III. To assess patient reported outcomes and impact of using palifermin on quality of life\n      in the post transplant duration.\n\n      IV. To assess the qualitative and quantitative toxicities associated with this regimen.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of melphalan.\n\n      CONDITIONING REGIMEN: Patients receive high-dose melphalan intravenously (IV) on day -2 and\n      palifermin IV on days -5 to -3 and 1-3.\n\n      TRANSPLANTATION: Patients undergo autologous PBSCT on day 0.\n\n      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at days 28 and 100, and then\n      periodically thereafter."
