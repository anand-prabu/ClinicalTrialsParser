Twenty-eight volunteers with TMD were randomly distributed into two groups,\n      massage therapy and occlusal splint. Both treatments lasted 4 weeks. Fourteen individuals\n      without TMD were consecutively allocated to the control group. The Fonseca's anamnestic\n      index was used to characterize TMD and allocate the volunteers to either the intervention\n      groups or control group. Mandibular ROM was evaluated before and after treatment using a\n      digital caliper. Two-way analysis of variance with the Bonferroni test was used for inter\n      and intragroup comparisons (level of significance was set to 5%). Cohen's d was used to\n      calculate the effect size."
