The order in\n      which participants receive the beverages will be counterbalanced and randomised. There will\n      be a two-week washout period in which none of the beverages are consumed between the\n      different beverage manipulations. Participants will fast overnight before each visit and\n      consume the same evening meal before each test day. Participants will be instructed to avoid\n      consuming food or calorific beverages for one hour before or after consuming the beverage.\n      Following the last satiety testing day participants will be debriefed and open questions\n      will be asked about experiences of the beverages in a focus group format."
