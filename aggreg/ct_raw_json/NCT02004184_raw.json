            "textblock": "Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for a majority (approximately 85%) of lung\n      cancer cases. Patients with localized disease can be cured through surgery, but only 20 %\n      are operable.For the majority of patients with advanced disease, palliative cytotoxic\n      chemotherapy remains the recommended therapy. Chemotherapy prolongs survival and improves\n      quality of life.\n\n      The recommended first-line therapy is 4-6 courses of a platinum in combination with a third\n      generation compound (e.g. gemcitabine, vinorelbine, docetaxel, pemetrexed, paclitaxel).\n      After first-line therapy, it has been recommended to observe the patients and offer\n      second-line chemotherapy at disease progression.\n\n      Regimens for second-line therapy include docetaxel or pemetrexed monotherapy. Pemetrexed is\n      less toxic and superior to gemcitabine in non-squamous NSCLC, whereas docetaxel is the\n      recommended second-line therapy in squamous cell carcinoma.\n\n      The results of the studies of maintenance pemetrexed therapy are encouraging; the observed\n      survival benefit is clinically relevant and relatively large considering the poor survival\n      in patients with advanced NSCLC. Furthermore, pemetrexed appears to be well tolerated. There\n      are, however, several limitations to the studies that have been conducted: Relatively few\n      elderly patients and no PS 2 patients were enrolled - and not all patients on the\n      control-arms received pemetrexed at progression.\n\n      The overall aim of this study is to investigate whether immediate maintenance pemetrexed\n      therapy prolongs survival compared to observation and pemetrexed therapy at progression in\n      patients with advanced NSCLC. Furthermore, it will be explored whether patients with\n      'performance status' 2 and elderly \u2265 70 years tolerate and benefit from maintenance therapy;\n      and what characteristics and blood biomarkers are associated with sensitivity and\n      tolerability of such therapy."

We consider an improvement in overall survival of\n      two months to be the minimum difference that will lead to routine use of maintenance\n      pemetrexed in Norway. To demonstrate an improvement in median overall survival from 6 to 8\n      months with an \u03b1 =0.05 and \u03b2 =0.20, 198 evaluable patients are required on each arm. We\n      expect a drop-out rate of maximum 10 %, and therefore intend to randomize a total of 436\n      patients  (PS 0-1) - of which we expect 150 to be 70 years or older.\n\n      Sample size is calculated on PS 0-1 patients only. In addition, PS 2 patients will be\n      randomized until the required number of PS 0-1 patients have been accrued. We estimate that\n      a total of 100 PS 2 patients will be enrolled - sufficient for hypothesis-generating\n      analyses of the benefit of maintenance therapy in elderly and PS 2 patients.\n\n      Based on experience from our previous studies we estimate that approximately 30% of patients\n      will not complete or progress during induction chemotherapy; or be ineligible due\n      deterioration of PS. Consequently, we need to include approximately 765 patients."
