Patients\n      are randomized to one of 3 treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive placebo orally twice\n      daily for one year. Arms II and III: Patients receive tamoxifen, at 1 of 2 different doses,\n      orally twice daily for one year. Quality of life is assessed before treatment and then\n      monthly thereafter. Patients are followed monthly until death.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: This study will accrue 300 patients."
