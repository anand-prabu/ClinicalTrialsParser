            "textblock": "Clinical evaluation of garlic in HIV disease is warranted for several reasons. First, garlic\n      is used as a botanical medicine and as an alternative therapy by many HIV-infected\n      individuals. Baseline data from the Bastyr's Alternative Medicine Care Outcomes in AIDS\n      (AMCOA) study [1] indicate that garlic is the most frequently used botanical medicine among\n      HIV-infected men and women (52.9%) who utilize complementary and alternative medicine (CAM).\n      In the same cohort, 50% of the subjects who use antiretroviral therapy are also taking\n      garlic supplements.  Second, there is a growing body of studies that indicate that garlic\n      exhibits lipid and glucose lowering as well as hepato-protective activities. Third, several\n      of the pharmacological activities of garlic and their reported clinical benefits in other\n      conditions, especially in hyperlipidemia, may be relevant in the management of highly active\n      antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in HIV-infected subjects.\n\n      Study Medication: We will utilize GarlicinTM, an allicin-standardized dried garlic\n      supplement in two escalating doses in HIV-infected subjects who are receiving HAART."
