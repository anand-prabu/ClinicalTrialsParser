The evaluated stent is clinically non-inferior to control BMS in terms of freedom of\n           MACE\n\n        2. The evaluated stent is clinically beneficial compared to control BMS by reducing\n           exposure to radiations, amount of contrast medium administered, procedure time, as well\n           as amount of administered heparin,\n\n        3. The evaluated stent does not result in more frequent adverse events than control BMS,\n\n        4. The evaluated stent improves direct stenting success while not decreasing procedural\n           success compared to control BMS.\n\n        5. Resource utilization (R.U.):\n\n             1. Hospital-perspective resource utilization during the index admission and index\n                procedure is not greater with evaluated the stent and potentially lower than with\n                control BMS\n\n             2. Resource utilization over a 6-month time-horizon, in relation to routine follow-up\n                and MACE, is not greater with the evaluated stent than with control BMS."
