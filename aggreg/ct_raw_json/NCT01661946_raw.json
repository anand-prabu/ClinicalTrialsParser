These medications are called ranibizumab (Lucentis) and\n      bevacizumab (Avastin).  They both have a similar mechanism of action and work equally well,\n      however only ranibizumab was designed for use in the eye.  It is significantly more\n      expensive per injection than bevacizumab (by a factor of roughly 40x).\n\n      In published studies trends have been noted towards an increased rate of systemic side\n      effects such as heart attacks and strokes.  This is presumably due to absorption of the\n      drug(s) from the eye into the bloodstream, however this has never been shown before.  The\n      purpose of the investigators study was to compare the bloodstream levels of bevacizumab and\n      ranibizumab at various time points after injection into the eye.  This required the creation\n      of a sophisticated assay to measure blood levels of the drugs."
