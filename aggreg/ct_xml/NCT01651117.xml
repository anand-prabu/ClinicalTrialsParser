    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the effectiveness of a peer mentor model in a mixed
      race population of poorly controlled diabetic veterans. Also, the study aims to assess the
      effects of becoming a mentor on those who originally were mentees. It is expected that
      participants in the peer mentoring arms (Arm 2 and 3) will have improved glucose control
      regardless of race or ethnicity at the end of the intervention.

      The primary objectives of this study are: (1) test the long-term effectiveness of a peer
      mentor model on improving glucose control, blood pressure, LDL levels, diabetes mellitus
      quality of life, and depression scores in a mixed race population of poorly controlled
      diabetic veterans; (2) test the effectiveness of using former peer mentees as peer mentors
      as a means of creating a self-sustaining program; and (3) and test the effects of becoming a
      mentor on those who were originally mentees given a growing literature that being a mentor
      is good for your health. Secondary objectives include: (1) in those randomized to being a
      mentee, explore mentor characteristics associated with improved HbA1c.

      This study will be a prospective randomized controlled trial. Outcomes to be measured
      include glycosylated hemoglobin, blood pressure, direct LDL, diabetes quality of life and
      depression.

      The trial has two phases. In phase one, patients with poorly controlled diabetes are
      randomized to usual care or receiving peer mentoring. In phase two, poorly controlled
      diabetics are randomized to usual care or receiving peer mentoring from former mentees.
      Former mentees from phase 1 are also randomized such that they will have a 50% chance of
      becoming a mentor.

    <description>Participants in this arm will be mentored for 6 months by a veteran who was once in poor control but is now in good control. They will then be further randomized to either becoming a mentor for 6 months or having no other additional active intervention. All participants in this arm will be evaluated in person at baseline, 6 months, 12 months, and 18 months.</description>
