Youth are 12-17 years\n      old with a first or second misdemeanor charge (excluding any gang, violence, or sex crimes\n      charge). Nearly all (97%) of these youth are ethnic minorities (Hispanic and African\n      American). They are at risk for school failure, substance use, and chronic delinquency due\n      to drug availability in their communities, poor family functioning, peer drug\n      use/delinquency, and school failure / disengagement.\n\n      120 youth who enter the Civil Citation Program and are eligible for the study will be\n      assigned to one of the two interventions: CCP+SAU or the experimental intervention,\n      CCP+MDFT.\n\n      The study asks a classical services research question(Compton et al, 2005) - does the\n      addition of a family therapy intervention, multidimensional family therapy, into an existing\n      diversion program significantly enhance the program outcomes in key outcome domains:\n      recidivism, substance use, delinquency, school and family functioning."
