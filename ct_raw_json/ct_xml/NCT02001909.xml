        Inclusion:

          -  Healthy male subjects

          -  Age: 18 to 45 years (inclusive) at the first screening examination/visit

             examination/visit

          -  Subjects enrolled in this study must use adequate barrier birth control measures
             prior to, during the course of the study, and 3 months after the last administration
             of regorafenib. An adequate contraception includes the use of condoms or a vasectomy.
             In addition, adequate birth control measures for the subject's partner is required,
             such as a hormonal contraception with implants or combined oral contraceptives,
             certain intrauterine devices, bilateral tubal ligation, or hysterectomy.

        Exclusion:

          -  Known or suspected hypersensitivity to regorafenib and/or neomycin

          -  Any illness or medical condition that is unstable or could jeopardize the safety of
             the subject and his compliance in the study

          -  Clinically significant illness within 30 days prior to Day 1, Period 1.

          -  Regular use of medicines at the time of screening, including herbal supplements and
             high dose vitamins

          -  Smoking; however, former smokers who have stopped smoking at least 3 months before
             the first study drug administration may be included

          -  Clinically relevant findings in the electrocardiogram (ECG)

          -  Clinically relevant findings in the complete physical examination

          -  Positive results for hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis C virus
             antibodies (anti-HCV), human immune deficiency virus antibodies (anti-HIV 1+2) at
             screening.

          -  Positive urine drug screening
