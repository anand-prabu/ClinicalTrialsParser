To determine the proportion of patients who will receive a cancer-related therapy based\n      on the results provided by the FMI test.\n\n      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. To explore and report estimates of progression free survival (PFS) of the regimen\n      administered after the FMI test results are revealed and the PFS of the most recent regimen\n      administered before the FMI test results were received.\n\n      II. To determine the feasibility of performing Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) on\n      metastatic tumor tissue.\n\n      III. To determine the feasibility of administering cancer-related drugs that are proposed by\n      the results of NGS that are not Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for a patient's\n      specific cancer diagnosis.\n\n      IV. To collect and report the molecular alterations discovered by NGS of advanced breast and\n      colorectal cancer.\n\n      V. To determine in an exploratory manner the concordance of the genomic alterations detected\n      by the FMI test in circulating tumor cells (CTCs) to the genomic alterations detected by FMI\n      test in tumor tissues collected from the same patient.\n\n      OUTLINE:\n\n      PART I: Within 10 weeks of beginning a treatment regimen, tumor tissue samples and CTCs from\n      patients are collected for NGS and FMI testing, respectively. Patients remain on current\n      line of therapy until a change in treatment is warranted.
