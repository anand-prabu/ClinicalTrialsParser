        The Registry is designed for open enrollment of all patients who meet the inclusion
        criteria. The function and activities of the Nuvigil/Provigil Pregnancy Registry will be
        publicized through direct mailings to obstetricians and pharmacists.  Known prescribers
        identified from marketing sources will be targeted for Registry awareness.  A toll-free
        phone line will be established for patient enrollment and a website containing information
        about the Registry for both physician and patient recruitment will be available.  The
        Registry will be posted on the FDA website for pregnancy registries, with a direct link to
        a Nuvigil/Provigil Registry website.  For ongoing awareness, information on the Registry
        will be included in the prescribing information and in the Medication Guides distributed
        by the pharmacist at the time of dispensing.  In addition, patient support groups or
        condition-related sources of information may be targeted to raise patient awareness of the
        Registry.
