      Background of the study:

      Multiple electroencephalographically derived indices have been developed to measure the
      cerebral hypnotic drug effect during anesthesia, using a variety of mathematical algorithms
      such as bispectral index, spectral entropy and spectral edge frequency. The complexity of
      the raw EEG is reduced to -an easy to interpret- number. It varies generally between 100
      (fully awake patient) to 0 (an excessively sedated patient).

      The anesthesiologist adjusts his dosing scheme to target a number between a predefined
      range. (e.g. between 40 and 60) These monitors are currently solidly integreted in clinical
      practice although they keep being hampered by several limitations. The most important
      problem is that they are not extracted from a direct neuro-physiological phenomenon that is
      known to be closely related to loss and return of consciousness, rather they have a
      probabilistic nature, indicating whether your probability of responsivenessis is high or
      low.

      You are never sure which EEG phenomenon relates to the index. Also, the number that relates
      to loss of consciousness rarely is the same as the number that indicates return of
      consciousness, which decreases the predictive value during recovery of anesthesia.
      Additionally, the dose response relationship differs on multiple parameters between each
      monitors. As such the performance of one monitor cannot be extrapolated to another. Finally,
      although the detection capacity of responses to verbal command is fairly good, EEG extracted
      numbers perform worse on correlation with movement after a noxious stimulus. Most problems
      are related to the limited understanding of the relationship between the changes in EEG and
      the underlying (insufficiently understood) neurophysiological mechanism that evokes
      (un)consciousness during anesthesia. Secondly, at the time of development of most monitors,
      the methods of drug administration were less reproducible to allow a more rational drug
      titration in a population of different demographics. The last two decades, major progress
      has been made on both issues. Therefore, new insights in neuro-physiology and better drug
      titration systems opens new perspectives to improve EEG derived data extraction.

      Recently, Mashuire et al found a typical EEG characteristic that is correlated consistently
      with the loss and return of responsiveness, independent of the anesthetic used (inhalation
      or intravenous) and independent of the species tested (rats and humans). These findings do
      suggest that new information can be extracted from the raw EEG that has a much closer
      connection with the essential neurophysiological processes involved to evoke
      consciousness/unconsciousness or responsiveness/unresponsiveness. In this study we want to
      collect data that allows us to recognize these patterns on the EEG as a better measurement
      of consciousness/unconsciousness.

      Additionally, we have the ability to use (clinically availlable) target controlled infusion
      techniques for propofol (plasma- and/or effect-site controlled) and end-tidal titrated
      sevoflurane (through a Zeus Ventilator (Draeger)) If we titrate our hypnotics through these
      more advanced and pharmacologically more rational titration methods, we may detect a more
      relevant correlation between the dose given and the EEG behavior. By adding remifentanil, we
      will also explore the alteration of performance of EEG derived information during
      interaction with opioids. The obtained data may result in a breakthrough in the methodology
      to titrate anesthesia in a more predictable and reproducible way, because the extracted
      information relates closer to a neuro-physiological process related to (un)responsiveness.
      Moreover, the index may produce more consistent results whether inhaled anesthetics or
      intravenous drugs are given.
