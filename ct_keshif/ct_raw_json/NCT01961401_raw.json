The precise\n      intensity and volume of aerobic exercise needed to produce the most wanted effects on\n      targeted risk factors for subjects at risk of/with established type 2 diabetes, is still\n      uncertain. In this study the investigators will investigate the acute effects of a single\n      bout of moderate versus high intensity exercise on insulin sensitivity in pregnant women\n      with and without gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).  The investigators think that very\n      short bouts of high intensity exercise can be a way to reduce blood glucose in these women."
