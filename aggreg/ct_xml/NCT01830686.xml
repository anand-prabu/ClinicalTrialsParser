  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to help understand the benefits of eating food supplemented
      with fiber in the form of sugarcane bagasse (the leftover fiber after cane juice is
      extracted) on glucose metabolism and body weight.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will employ a double-blind randomized controlled study design with 3 arms
      such that obese, insulin resistant adults will be randomly selected to receive food made
      with 1) sugarcane bagasse, 2) non-caloric, non-fermentable fiber, or 3) a similar product
      with minimal fiber for 4 weeks.  The intervention will be in the form of brownies and
      cookies and will look and taste nearly identical to each other.  Caloric value will be
      constant with all three delivery systems.  Subjects will have blood testing and body
      composition analysis before and after the intervention.

    <description>Participants will be randomly selected to eat food supplemented with either 1) sugarcane bagasse, 2) another type of fiber of equal weight, or 3) minimal fiber. At baseline each eligible subject will have a 3 hour oral glucose tolerance test. Subjects will consume one brownie and two cookies a day for four weeks. At the end of four weeks, the blood tests conducted at baseline will be repeated.</description>
