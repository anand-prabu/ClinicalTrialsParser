  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main hypothesis being tested is that imaging and serologic biomarkers of apoptosis and
      progressive extracellular matrix remodeling will precede echocardiographic indices of
      systolic and diastolic function among childhood cancer survivors treated with anthracyclines
      thus allowing evaluation of new therapies to prevent and manage heart failure in these
      patients.
