    <textblock>
      This study will be looking at whether MK-3475 (an antibody that blocks negative signals to T
      cells) is effective (anti-tumor activity) and safe  in three different patient populations.
      These include: 1. patients with MSI positive colon cancer, 2. patients with MSI negative
      colon cancer, and 3. patients with other MSI positive cancers.
