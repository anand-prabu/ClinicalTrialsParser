The hypothesis is, that the ES-induced\n      contractions of the muscles cause a stabilisation respectively an increase of the blood\n      pressure during the tilt-table test.\n\n      Subjects:\n\n      20 Women and men, at least 18 years of age, following an acute and traumatic SCI, with a\n      lesion level above T6, an American Spinal Injury Association (AIS) Impairment Scale A,B or C\n      and a diagnosis of OH (by tilt table test) were eligible for the study.\n\n      Methods:\n\n      Each patient underwent randomly three different types of ES sessions while being positioned\n      on a tilt-table. The following sessions were planned:\n\n      A) ES of the abdominal muscles B) ES of the lower limb muscles C) Combination of A and B D)\n      Control session (=diagnostic session)\n\n      Study type: Intervention Design: Prospective interventional study"
