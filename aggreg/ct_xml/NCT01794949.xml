  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of drug eluting stents (DES) used to treat coronary artery blockages is limited by
      poor healing of the stented area. This will require the combined use of blood thinners such
      as aspirin and clopidogrel (i.e. dual anti-platelet therapy (DAPT)) to prevent complications
      such as clot formation on the stent which may lead to a heart attack. Diabetic patients and
      those presenting with a heart attack at the time of stent placement are at increased risk
      for clot formation the stent however little is known of the healing responses after stent
      placement in these populations.

      Currently all patients receiving DES are advised to complete DAPT for twelve months although
      more personalized durations of DAPT based on stent healing would reduce both clot formation
      and potential bleeding from the blood thinners, thereby improving the long-term safety of
      DES.

      Intracoronary optical frequency domain imaging (OFDI) is a novel high resolution invasive
      imaging technique that has the ability to evaluate stent healing at follow-up.  Among the
      commercially available coated stents used in the U.S., the zotarolimus eluting stents
      (RESOLUTE Integrity, Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN) has demonstrated superior healing in both
      preclinical and clinical studies.

      The purpose of this trial is to determine the healing responses to the RESOLUTE Intregrity
      stent as detected by OFDI in patients with and without diabetes presenting with ACS.
      Specifically in this observational study, we will investigate non-insulin dependent
      diabetics and non-diabetics in the setting of ACS and RESOLUTE Integrity stent placement.

      The investigators hypothesize that healing responses in patients with non-insulin dependent
      diabetes will be similar to those without diabetes presenting with ACS and that a majority
      of patients will demonstrate complete healing as determined by OFDI measurements.
