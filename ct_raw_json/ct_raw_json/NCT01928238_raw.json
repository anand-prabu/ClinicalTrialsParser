            "textblock": "Reintubation, which occurs after planned extubation, is a relevant consequence of\n      respiratory failure after extubation. The early use of noninvasive pressure support\n      ventilation averted respiratory failure after extubation in patients at increased risk.\n      However patient tolerance to the technique is a critical factor determining its success. One\n      of the key factors determining tolerance to Non Invasive Ventilation (NIV) is optimal\n      synchrony between the patient's spontaneous breathing activity and the ventilator's\n      settings, known as patient ventilator interaction. Optimal patient-ventilator synchrony\n      during NIV can prove very difficult to achieve due to the presence of leaks, the type of\n      interface which can interfere with various aspects of ventilator function. Patient\n      ventilator synchrony during NPSV can be compromised when using conventional pneumatic\n      triggering, with the ventilator-delivered inspiratory support starting after the patient's\n      inspiratory effort. The switch from inspiration to expiration (cycling-off) should, ideally,\n      coincide with the end of the patient's inspiratory effort. However greater asynchrony at the\n      end of inspiration, with the ventilator cycling off either too early or too late compared to\n      the end of the patient's inspiratory effort can be observed during NPSV. A possible solution\n      is to replace the pneumatic triggering with neural triggering and cycling off using the\n      diaphragm electrical activity (Eadi). Neurally adjusted ventilatory assist (NAVA) uses the\n      electrical activity of the diaphragm to control the timing and pressure of the ventilation\n      delivered. The ventilator is triggered, limited and cycled-off directly by Eadi. The Eadi is\n      measured by a multiple array oesophageal electrode. The array of bipolar electrodes can be\n      mounted on a feeding tube, which is routinely introduced in critically ill patients."
