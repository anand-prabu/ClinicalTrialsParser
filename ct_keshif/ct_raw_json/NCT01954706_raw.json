Due to their effectiveness in postmenopausal women, aromatase\n      inhibitors (AIs) are the standard of care for long-term estrogen suppression in these\n      patients.  Estrogen deficiency, however, results in multiple side effects.  Some of the most\n      common side effects in women taking AIs are joint and muscle aches, which promote physical\n      deconditioning.  Because of the long term use of AIs in postmenopausal breast cancer\n      patients and the improvements in cancer-related outcomes that are observed with their use,\n      identifying methods to reduce these side effects to maintain adherence to treatment is\n      important.  Exercise interventions in breast cancer patients also improve quality of life\n      and reduce fatigue.  Understanding the role of exercise in AI side effect prevention will\n      allow us to translate these findings into therapy guidelines."
