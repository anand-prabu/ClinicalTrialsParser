Participants in the LM cohort who, on\n      longitudinal sexual risk behavior surveillance, report increased levels of sexual\n      risk-taking such that they meet enrollment criteria for the H-cohort will be transitioned to\n      the H-cohort.\n\n      At each follow-up visit, a careful safety assessment will be made, including signs/symptoms\n      and laboratory assessments.  STI testing will be performed at 3 month intervals.  An\n      escalating-intensity adherence intervention will be implemented based on real-time serum\n      tenofovir levels.  A computer-assisted self-interview (CASI) will be used to capture\n      detailed sexual risk, adherence, and substance use behavior."
