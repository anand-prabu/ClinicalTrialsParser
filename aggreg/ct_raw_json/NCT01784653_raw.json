The investigators hypothesize that both iMET and MET  will be more effective\n      than TAU in engaging/retaining patients in treatment and in reducing substance use during a\n      12-month follow-up period. The investigators also hypothesize that Self-directed iMET will\n      be as effective as the clinician-guided MET in increasing treatment engagement and\n      abstinence during the 12-months follow-up period."
