  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and antiviral efficacy of ledipasvir
      (formerly GS-5885)/sofosbuvir (LDV/SOF) fixed-dose combination (FDC) with or without
      ribavirin (RBV) administered for 8 or 12 weeks of treatment in participants with chronic
      genotype 1 hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection who are treatment-naive and for 12 weeks in
      participants who had previously received a regimen containing a protease inhibitor for the
      treatment of HCV.
