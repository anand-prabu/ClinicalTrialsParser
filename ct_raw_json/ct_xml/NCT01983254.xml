  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients who receive life support in intensive care units commonly suffer from persistent
      depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms after discharge.  We
      are trying to learn which is a better way to manage this distress:  a telephone-based
      adaptive coping skills training program or an educational program.

      Public Summary of Research Project Why is this important?  Nearly 800,000 Americans receive
      mechanical ventilation for acute respiratory failure in the ICU each year.  Afterward, over
      half of both patients and their family caregivers suffer from psychological distress
      (depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress [&quot;PTSD&quot;]) for over 1 year after discharge.
      Patients and families told us that they need help with their distress because it worsens
      their quality of life.  More specifically, patients said that learning how to adapt (that
      is, how to cope) with the physical and emotional changes of critical illness would be
      helpful.  In fact, most ICU survivors use coping skills infrequently, which worsens
      psychological distress.  But patients also told us that they wanted more information about
      critical illness, recovery, and what to expect.  A lack of information increases PTSD
      symptoms.  However, there are few treatments for this distress that can overcome ICU
      survivors' physical disability, great distance from expert medical centers, and concerns
      about how much treatments would cost. Therefore, we developed two treatments to address
      coping and lack of information.

      What is the main goal? We aim to compare which of two treatments are more effective in
      reducing psychological distress and improving quality of life.  One is a coping skills
      training (CST) program provided by telephone.  The other is an education program about
      critical illness that is accessed primarily online.  Also, we will determine if unique
      groups of people with special characteristics have especially good improvementâ€”and if so,
      what personal factors explain this response.

      How will we know which treatment is better? We will determine which treatment is most
      helpful by comparing participants' levels of psychological distress and quality of life with
      surveys taken over 6 months.  We'll also record patients' own descriptions of how the
      treatments impacted their daily lives.  The study will take 3 years and would be performed
      at 5 medical centers across the US that treat patients with diverse backgrounds and
      illnesses.  200 ICU survivor-family member pairs will be randomly assigned (like a coin
      flip) to receive either the CST program or the education program.  Treatments consist of 6
      weekly telephone calls with a trained staff member, web-based modules, and handouts.

      How will this help others in the future? This research is important because it aims to
      improve long-term recovery for entire families by focusing on a devastating, common, yet
      inadequately addressed problem.  These treatments were developed with the direct input of
      patients and families.  These treatments represent a new direction in treating critical
      illness because they can be delivered inexpensively by phone, easily adapted to future
      technologies, overcome barriers to care common to ICU survivors, and shared easily by phone
      or computer with others in need across the world.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Patient inclusion criteria:

          -  age &gt;=18 and

          -  mechanical ventilation for more than 48 consecutive hours

        Patient exclusions (pre-consent):

          -  current significant cognitive impairment (&gt;=3 errors on the Callahan scale) or lacks
             decisional capacity

          -  pre-existing significant cognitive impairment

          -  residence at location other than home before hospital admission

          -  need for a translator because of poor English fluency [many study instruments are not
             validated in other languages]

          -  expected survival &lt;3 months

          -  discharged to hospice (outpatient or inpatient)

          -  not liberated from mechanical ventilation at discharge

        Additional patient exclusion criteria (present post-consent but pre-randomization):

          -  Patients will become ineligible if they become too ill to participate

          -  they develop significant cognitive disability, exhibit suicidality, they do not
             return home within 2 months after hospital discharge, or die.

        Informal caregiver inclusion criteria:

          -  age &gt;=18 years

          -  person most likely to provide the most post-discharge care.

        Exclusions for caregivers are:

          -  history of significant cognitive impairment

          -  English fluency poor enough to require a medical translator

        Informal caregiver exclusion criteria present after consent but before randomization:

          -  no longer available

          -  become too ill to participate

          -  exhibit suicidality

        A total of 200 patient-caregiver dyads (total cohort = 400) are targeted
