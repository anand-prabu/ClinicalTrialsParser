    <textblock>
      Objectives: We conducted a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of Students for Nutrition and
      eXercise (SNaX), a middle-school-based obesity-prevention intervention combining school-wide
      environmental changes, multimedia, encouragement to eat healthy school cafeteria foods, and
      peer-led education and marketing.

      Methods:  We randomly selected schools from the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD)
      and assigned five to the intervention group and five to a wait-list control group.  School
      records were obtained for number of fruits and vegetables served, students served lunch, and
      snacks sold per attending student.  Pre- and post-intervention surveys assessed psychosocial
      variables among 2,997 seventh-graders (75% of all seventh-graders across schools).

      Hypotheses: For the RCT of SNaX, we hypothesized that SNaX would lead to increases in the
      proportion of students served in the cafeteria (because SNaX markets cafeterias' healthy
      foods); increased fruit and vegetable servings (because SNaX increases access to
      sliced/bite-sized fruits and vegetables); decreased school store snack sales; and greater
      water consumption.  We also hypothesized that SNaX would lead to more positive attitudes
      about the cafeteria and water, improve obesity-prevention knowledge, and increase intentions
      to drink water.
