            "textblock": "OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of ICI D1694 (TDX) when given with\n      irinotecan (CPT-11) every 3 weeks in patients with advanced solid malignancies. II. Describe\n      the pharmacokinetics of TDX and CPT-11 when given in combination. III. Investigate the\n      relationship between topoisomerase I expression in peripheral mononuclear cells and\n      myelosuppression and/or gastrointestinal toxicity. IV. Investigate the effect of CPT-11 on\n      thymidylate synthase expression in tumor.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalating study to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of\n      ICI D1694 (TDX) given in combination with irinotecan. Irinotecan is given intravenously on\n      day 1 and ICI D1694 intravenously on day 2. Treatment is repeated every 3 weeks until\n      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity intervenes. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive\n      escalated doses of TDX until the MTD is defined; an additional 10-12 patients will be\n      entered at the MTD to confirm this as a recommended phase II dose.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 30-35 patients will be entered."
