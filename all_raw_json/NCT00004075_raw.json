Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups.\n\n        -  Group I: Patients receive 17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) IV over 1\n           hour on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease\n           progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n        -  Group II: Patients receive 17-AAG IV over 1 hour on days 1, 4, 8, and 11. Courses\n           repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 1-6 solid tumor patients receive escalating doses of 17-AAG until the maximum\n      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2\n      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n      Once the MTD is determined, 10 patients with either lymphoma or superficial solid tumors\n      accessible for biopsy are treated as in group II at the MTD.\n\n      Patients are followed for 3 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 58-130 patients (30-72 for group I and 28-58 for group II)\n      will be accrued for this study within 2 years."
