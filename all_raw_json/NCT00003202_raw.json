Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor\n      cells. Combining radiation therapy with chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to compare the effectiveness of gemcitabine with radiation therapy\n      alone or following two-drug combination chemotherapy in treating patients with stage III\n      non-small cell lung cancer."

Concurrent\n      radiation therapy is administered 5 days a week for 6 weeks.\n\n      Arm II: Patients receive 2 cycles of induction chemotherapy consisting of gemcitabine as a\n      30 minute infusion on day 1 and 8 and cisplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1. Each cycle is 21\n      days. Patients then receive gemcitabine and radiation therapy as in arm I.\n\n      Cohorts of 3 patients are enrolled into each treatment arm at each dose level of\n      gemcitabine. Toxicity for each arm is assessed independently. Once dose limiting toxicity\n      (DLT) is observed at any dose level, 3 more patients are enrolled at the same dose level.\n      The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is defined as the dose at which no more than 1 of 6\n      patients experiences grade 4 toxicity, or no more than 4 of 6 patients experience grade 3 or\n      worse toxicity (DLT). After the MTD is determined for each treatment arm, additional\n      patients are treated at that dose level for the phase II portion of the study.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, then every 4 months for the next 2 years,\n      and then every 6 months thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: There will be approximately 24-48 patients accrued into this study within\n      1-2 years."
