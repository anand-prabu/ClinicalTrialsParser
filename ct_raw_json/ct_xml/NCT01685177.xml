  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Single-Anastomosis Duodeno-Ileal bypass with a 250 cm common/alimentary loop is a
      modification of standard duodenal switch in which a Roux-en-Y duodeno-ileal anastomosis is
      performed at 250 cm from the cecum and a 60 cm to 100 cm common channel is build up.
      Hypothesis of the study is that Single-Anastomosis Duodeno-Ileal bypass behaves at least
      equally to standard duodenal switch as a second step after sleeve gastrectomy in the
      super-morbid patient. Secondary aims are to demonstrate that single-anastomosis
      duodeno-ileal bypass is simpler to perform, quicker and has less postoperative short, mid
      and long-term complications.

    <textblock>
      Sleeve gastrectomy is a restrictive operation for morbid obesity which has a 60% success
      rate in solving both morbid obesity and related co-morbidities, mainly diabetes mellitus.
      When the sleeve is not enough for the patient, due to alimentary habits or to an excessive
      initial BMI before surgery (usually over 50 - 55), a second-step operation should be
      performed to increase effectiveness. Some patients are submitted to a second restrictive
      operation, i.e.: a re-sleeve, a gastric plication or sleeve banding. Other group are offered
      a gastric bypass. And, finally, a subset of patients, generally those with higher initial
      BMI, are offered a malabsorptive operation. While re-sleeve is adequate for many patients,
      gastric bypass is not offering a greater weight loss rate, and it is a complex operation
      requiring sectioning of the sleeve and two anastomoses. We support the performance of
      malabsorptive operations which warrant a better weight loss result for &quot;resistant&quot; patients
      needing a second-step. As Single-Anastomosis Duodeno-Ileal bypass with Sleeve gastrectomy
      (SADI-S) has behaved as a good primary operation for morbid obesity, we decided to test this
      one-loop reconstruction as a second step operation. Results will be compared to those
      obtained with a Roux-en-Y duodenal switch performed as a second step after a &quot;failed&quot;
      sleeve.
