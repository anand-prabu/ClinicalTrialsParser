Treatment continues for at least 2\n      courses in the absence of disease progression. Patients with responsive disease may receive\n      an additional 2 months of therapy.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive deescalating doses of azacitidine until the minimal\n      effective pharmacologic dose (MEPD) is determined. The MEPD is defined as the dose above the\n      dose at which more than 1 of 6 patients do not meet the target enzyme inhibition of greater\n      than 90%.\n\n      Once the MEPD and toxicity have been established for a 5 day schedule, daily dose schedule\n      of azacitidine is increased to 10, 14, and 21 days, followed by phenylbutyrate for 7 days.\n      Courses are repeated every 28 days.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 32 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years."
