      Background Excessive Crying (Infantile Colic) is one of the most common complaints for which
      parents seek treatment. These otherwise healthy and well fed infants show no signs of
      failure to thrive, cry without identifiable cause, fuss a lot and are hard-to-soothe.

      Objective To explore the feasibility of running a Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) that
      investigates the effectiveness of cranial osteopathy in addition to usual National Health
      Service (NHS) care in infants with colic.

      Methods Pragmatic randomised controlled trial, involving United Kingdom (UK) osteopaths in
      private practice and NHS health visitors. Parents of 60 excessively crying infants/infants
      with colic will be recruited by NHS health visitors. Infants will be included into the study
      if they are healthy (full-term) and aged 1-7 weeks, diagnosed with excessive
      crying/infantile colic, and have no co-morbidities. Participants will be randomised into the
      usual NHS care group or the usual NHS care plus cranial osteopathic intervention group.

      Usual NHS care will be provided by health visitors and osteopathic treatment will be carried
      out by experienced osteopaths in private practice.

      Primary outcome measures are acceptability and feasibility of intervention procedures.
      Furthermore, changes in the frequency and duration of crying will be documented in a daily
      crying diary. Parental quality of life will also be assessed.

      This pilot investigation will provide useful information in order to further develop and
      adapt the current interventions and trial procedures with a view to a full-scale randomised
      controlled trial.

    <description>Usual NHS care is provided by a health visitor who will diagnose excessively crying infants/infants with colic in the first instance. Parents usually will then have the opportunity to consult their health visitor when needed. The health visitor will provide support and advice on how to manage the condition within their professional remit.</description>

Treatment will be individualised, according to clinical findings, and involves using standard cranial osteopathic techniques. All parents will be able to ask questions.</description>
