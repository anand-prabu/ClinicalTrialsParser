      This long-term, open-label extension study will evaluate the safety of RoActemra/Actemra
      (tocilizumab) in patients with polyarticular-course juvenile idiopathic arthritis who
      completed the WA19977 core study. Patients aged 9-18 years with at least JIA ACR30 clinical
      response to RoActemra/Actemra in the core study will be eligible to receive
      RoActemra/Actemra 8 mg/kg intravenously every 4 weeks. Anticipated time on study treatment
      is 104 weeks.
