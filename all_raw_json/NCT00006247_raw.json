Determine the acute and chronic\n      dose-limiting toxicity and cumulative toxicity of this regimen in these patients. III.\n      Determine the maximum tolerated dose and pharmacokinetics of this regimen in this patient\n      population. IV. Determine the effects of hepatic enzyme-inducing drugs, such as\n      anticonvulsant agents, on the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients. V.\n      Determine the efficacy, in a preliminary manner, of this regimen in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to\n      concurrent use of enzyme-inducing anticonvulsant drugs (yes vs no drugs or modest-induction\n      drugs). Patients receive SU5416 IV over 1 hour twice a week for 6 weeks. Treatment repeats\n      every 6 weeks for 17 courses (approximately 2 years) in the absence of unacceptable toxicity\n      or disease progression. Cohorts of 3-6 patients in each stratum receive escalating doses of\n      SU5416 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose\n      preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 4 years, and then\n      annually for 5 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients (25 per stratum) will be accrued for this study."
