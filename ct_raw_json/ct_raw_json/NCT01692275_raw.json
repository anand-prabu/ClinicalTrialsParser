            "textblock": "Low back pain (LBP) is the most common cause of disability worldwide, but it is even more\n      prevalent in active duty military personnel; more than 50% of all diagnoses resulting in\n      disability discharges from the military across all branches are due to musculoskeletal\n      conditions. LBP has been characterized as \"The Silent Military Threat\" because of its\n      negative impact on mission readiness and the degree to which it compromises a fit fighting\n      force. For these reasons, military personnel with LBP need a practical and effective\n      treatment that relieves their pain and allows them to return to duty quickly, but also one\n      that preserves function and military readiness, addresses the underlying causes of the\n      episode and protects against re\u2010injury. Currently a clear \"gold standard\" medical treatment\n      for low back pain does not exist and studies show that evidence\u2010based guidelines are rarely\n      used in general practice. Thus, there is a need to consider innovative treatment options for\n      chronic diseases such as LBP. Therefore the primary purpose of this study is to assess the\n      effectiveness of chiropractic manipulative therapy (CMT) for pain management and improved\n      function in active duty service members with orthopedic injuries or disorders of the low\n      back that do not require surgery. This multi\u2010site Phase II Clinical Comparative\n      Effectiveness Trial is designed to rigorously compare the outcomes of CMT and conventional\n      medical care (CMC) to CMC alone. Chiropractic treatment will include CMT plus ancillary\n      physiotherapeutic interventions. CMC will be delivered following current standards of\n      medical practice at each site. At each of the four participating sites, active military\n      personnel, ages 18\u201050, who present with acute, sub\u2010acute or chronic low back pain that does\n      not require surgery will be randomized to one of the two treatment groups. Outcome measures\n      include the Numerical Rating Scale for pain, the Roland\u2010Morris Low Back Pain and Disability\n      questionnaire, the Back Pain Functional Scale for assessing function, and the Global\n      Improvement questionnaire for patient perception regarding improvement in function. Patient\n      Expectation and Patient Satisfaction questionnaires will be used to examine volunteer\n      expectations toward care and perceptions of that care. Pharmaceutical use and duty status\n      data will also be collected. The PROMIS-29 will be utilized to compare the general health\n      component and quality of life of the sample at baseline. In addition, doctors of\n      chiropractic are well positioned to provide information to support tobacco cessation. Thus\n      this clinical trial will include a nested study designed to measure the impact of a tobacco\n      cessation program delivered by a doctor of chiropractic. The results from this randomized\n      clinical trial, with a nested tobacco cessation intervention, will provide critical\n      information regarding the health and mission\u2010support benefits of chiropractic health care\n      delivery for active duty service members in the military"
