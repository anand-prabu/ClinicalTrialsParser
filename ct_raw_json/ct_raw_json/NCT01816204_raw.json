            "textblock": "Therapist assisted, internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (TAI-CBT) has been shown to\n      be effective with patients who have Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) in multiple studies\n      from several countries, including: the United Kingdom, Australia, Sweden, and the\n      Netherlands.  Despite strong evidence of efficacy, TAI-CBT has not been offered in the USA.\n      TAI-CBT could provide an effective alternative to face-to-face psychotherapy that would\n      expand the availability and convenience of evidence- based treatment anywhere clinical\n      availability is limited. The University of Florida (UF) has historically had greater demand\n      for psychotherapy than the available supply of psychotherapy hours resulting in waiting\n      lists for students needing to receive treatment for anxiety.   Anxiety disorders interfere\n      with memory and concentration thus impairing academic functioning.  Students who must wait\n      for treatment for 3-4 weeks are at risk for failing courses or dropping out of school.  If\n      TAI-CBT proved to be effective with UF students, providing it could increase the number of\n      students who would receive effective and timely treatment.  This project will create a 6-8\n      session therapist assisted on-line treatment for anxiety disorder.  The investigators will\n      offer TAI-CBT as an experimental treatment in summer and fall, 2013 comparing outcomes to\n      face-to-face individual therapy, group therapy, and wait-list controls.  The investigators\n      hypothesize that students receiving TAI-CBT will have a reduction in anxiety symptoms\n      comparable to face-to-face counseling and greater than wait list controls."

Students who meet criteria and agree to participate will select from three\n      treatments, individual face-to-face, group therapy, or therapist assisted on-line treatment.\n       Prior to each session of individual therapy, group therapy, or on-line treatment\n      participants will complete three short measures of psychological symptoms, one of these, the\n      Behavioral Health Measure-20 is a normal part of treatment at the CWC.  In addition\n      participants will complete the GAD-7, which contains seven, 4-point Likert-type items, and\n      the Penn State worry questionnaire (PSWQ), which consists of 16 Likert-type items.  These\n      additional instruments will take about 2-5 minutes to complete prior to each session.\n\n      In addition, the researchers will contact participants by e-mail 6 months after completion\n      of treatment to ask them to complete the instruments as a follow-up.  If a participant is\n      assigned to individual or group therapy he/she will receive this mode of treatment as usual\n      at the Counseling and Wellness Center at the University of Florida.\n\n      If a particpant is assigned to the Therapist-assisted on-line (TAO) treatment he/she will be\n      asked to complete a seven module on-line treatment.  Each module includes interactive,\n      educational materials and weekly assignments.  Subjects may participate in an on-line\n      discussion forum with other participants for each module.  The forum will use only first\n      names or a pseudonym to protect  confidentiality.  In addition, participants in the TAO\n      treatment will receive a 10-20 minute videoconference weekly with a doctoral level\n      therapist.  Therapists will review assignments, answer questions, and help  to apply the\n      educational materials contained in the modules to the subjects life.\n\n      The video conference will be on Adobe Connect.  This involves a free download for a\n      computer, tablet, or smart phone.  Medical records will be kept for ten years, per UF\n      policy.  Adobe connect is HIPAA and HITECH compliant.  Research records will be\n      de-identified and use an identifier number that cannot be connected to individual\n      participants."
