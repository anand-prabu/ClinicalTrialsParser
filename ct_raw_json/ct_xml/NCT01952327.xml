  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a research study examining the safety of a new, automated pump for the drainage of
      fluid in the chest cavity which is caused by cancer (also known as malignant pleural
      effusion, or MPE). The purpose of the trial is to assess whether the new pleurapump device
      is safe and effective in the management of patients with MPE. The study will try to identify
      what kind of problems may arise from using the device, how often they happen, and how severe
      they are if they occur.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. &gt; 18 years of age

          2. Recurrent pleural effusion due malignancy Malignant pleural effusions are defined as
             either Fluid in the context of histocytologically confirmed pleural malignancy, or
             pleural fluid in the context of histocytologically confirmed malignancy elsewhere,
             with no other clear cause for the effusion.

          3. 1 or more therapeutic procedures for pleural fluid drainage prior to   enrolment.

          4. Written informed consent

          5. Ability to comply with study procedures and ability to operate the device

          6. Expected survival of more than 3 months after device insertion

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Haemothorax

          2. Purulent pleural effusion

          3. Significant pleural fluid septation or loculation on thoracic ultrasound or
             cross-sectional imaging

          4. Obstructive uropathy or any bladder anomaly which might contraindicate implantation
             of the device.

          5. Pregnant females or females anticipating pregnancy during study period.

          6. Patients currently enrolled in another interventional clinical study

          7. Concurrently implanted with any other Active Implantable Medical Device, including,
             but not limited to cardiac pacemaker or cardioverter defibrillator.

          8. Major comorbidity which, in the opinion of the principal investigator, is likely to
             significantly decrease life expectancy, increase anaesthetic risk, or lead to device
             removal (e.g. moderate to severe congestive heart failure, significant valvular heart
             disease, persistent immunosuppression, etc.)

          9. Other  contraindication to general anaesthesia

         10. Other contraindication to procedure (e.g. uncorrectable bleeding diathesis, infection
             or malignant involvement over proposed insertion site)

         11. Significant renal impairment, as determined by the principal investigator
