            "textblock": "Background The over use of antimicrobials is recognised as the main selective pressure\n      driving the emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance in human bacterial pathogens.\n      Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs)  are one of the most common infections presented in primary\n      care and empirical antimicrobial treatment is currently recommended. Previous research has\n      identified that a substantial proportion of Irish GPs prescribe antimicrobials for UTI that\n      are not in accordance with the Guidelines for Antimicrobial Prescribing in Primary Care in\n      Ireland.\n\n      Aim To design, implement and evaluate the effectiveness of a complex intervention on GP\n      antimicrobial prescribing and adult (18 years of age and over) patients' antimicrobial\n      consumption when presenting with a suspected UTI.\n\n      Methods The SIMPLE study is a randomised three armed intervention with practice level\n      randomisation. Adult patients presenting with suspected UTI in primary care will be included\n      in the study.\n\n      The intervention integrates components for both GPs and patients. For GPs the intervention\n      includes interactive workshops, audit and feedback reports and automated electronic prompts\n      summarising recommended first line antimicrobial treatment and, for one intervention arm, a\n      recommendation to consider delayed antimicrobial prescribing. For patients multimedia\n      applications and information leaflets are included. A minimum of 920 patients will be\n      recruited through 30 practices. The primary outcome is change in prescribing of first line\n      antimicrobials in accordance with the Guidelines for Antimicrobial Prescribing in Primary\n      Care in Ireland. The intervention will take place over 15 months. Data will be collected\n      through a remote electronic anonymised data extraction system (iPCRN), a text messaging\n      system and through GP and patient interviews and surveys. The intervention will be\n      strengthened by the implementation of a social marketing framework and an economic\n      evaluation."
