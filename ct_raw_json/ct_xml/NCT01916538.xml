  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Anorexia Nervosa Genetics Initiative (ANGI) is the largest and most rigorous genetic
      investigation of eating disorders ever conducted. Researchers in the United States, Sweden,
      Australia, and Denmark will collect clinical information and blood samples from over 8,000
      individuals with anorexia nervosa and individuals without an eating disorder.

      ANGI represents a global effort to detect genetic variation that contributes to this
      potentially life-threatening illness. The goal of the research study is to transform
      knowledge about the causes of eating disorders to work toward greater understanding and
      ultimately a cure.

      If you have suffered from anorexia nervosa at any point in your life, you can help us
      achieve this goal. Your contribution would include a brief interview and a blood sample. If
      you have never had anorexia nervosa, but still want to contribute, we invite your
      participation as well.

      Participation in this genetics study requires participants to answer some questions, online,
      about eating behaviors (about 15-30 minutes) and to provide a single blood sample that
      should take only a few minutes.

      To obtain the blood sample, investigators will mail you a reimbursement form for the cost of
      the blood draw and a kit which participants would take to their primary care provider or
      your local laboratory to have them draw a small sample of blood (about 40 mL, which is less
      than three tablespoons). Once the sample is drawn, participants will place it in a box and
      contact FedEx for pick up. There is no cost for the FedEx shipment. Participants will also
      fill out the reimbursement form and send it and the receipt to our office. Investigators
      will reimburse participants for the cost of the blood draw. The samples will be studied
      directly or reprogrammed prior to further study.

      The blood sample participants provide will be used to identify biological characteristics
      and other biological &quot;markers.&quot; Some analyses will include genetic analyses which are
      measured using DNA and can look at places in DNA, and others can analyze most of the genome.
      Other analyses measure a large number of proteins. Still others assess the messenger
      substance (called RNA) that transfers information from DNA to protein. Investigators plan to
      store the blood specimens and data indefinitely.

      Investigators will be collecting DNA to permit immediate and future genetic analyses and
      analyses of immune, endocrine, and proteins. All blood will be biobanked indefinitely to
      allow for assays that may become available in the future analyses.
