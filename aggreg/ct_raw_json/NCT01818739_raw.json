To estimate the negative predictive value of pelvic sentinel lymph node (SLN) in\n      endometrial cancer to predict nodal metastasis.\n\n      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:\n\n      II. To examine the ability of sentinel lymph nodes to increase the detection of metastatic\n      disease through ultra-sectioning and immuno-histochemical (IHC) staining by comparing IHC\n      results and standard hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) results.\n\n      OUTLINE:\n\n      Patients undergo sentinel lymph node detection using fluorescence imaging with indocyanine\n      green solution and isosulfan blue and sentinel lymph node biopsy and detection of sentinel\n      lymph nodes is noted in the within 30 minutes of injection of the dye, followed by full\n      pelvic lymph node dissection and aortic lymph node dissection as indicated, and standard\n      hysterectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy.\n\n      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years,\n      every 6 months for 3 years for a total of 5 years according to the standard surveillance\n      guidelines for endometrial cancer."
