The study will consist of 2 phases: screening\n      phase up to 7 days before starting the treatment and treatment phase of 30 days. The first\n      patch will be applied by investigator then by participants until 30 days. The dose of\n      TTS-fentanyl can be increased, if needed, by 12.5 microgram per hour until adequate\n      (reasonably good) pain control is achieved and taking into account the daily dose of\n      supplemental paracetamol required by the participant. Other concomitant (given at the same\n      time) analgesics (drug used to control pain) will not be used during this phase. Efficacy\n      with regard to pain control will be recorded principally by the participant through\n      questionnaires in a daily diary. This record will be used to support more detailed\n      assessments at study visits on Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis\n      Index (WOMAC) questionnaire.

Individual question responses are assigned a score of between 0=extreme and 4=none. Maximum scores for each element differ and therefore, scores were normalized. Total normalized score ranges from 0=worst to 100=best.",
