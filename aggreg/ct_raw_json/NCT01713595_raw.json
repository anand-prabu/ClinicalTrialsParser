Safety concerns in mechanically\n      ventilated patients with ARDS center primarily on HS's effects on lung water distribution\n      (intra vs. extra alveolar) and on airway reactivity. For that reason we plan a small\n      feasibility trial with narrowly focused physiologic endpoints, namely to measure the effects\n      of a single 5ml dose of 7% Saline aerosol on blood gas tensions, hemodynamics and the static\n      and dynamic properties of the relaxed respiratory system. This narrowly scoped study is to\n      lay the foundation for a larger multicenter intervention trial."
