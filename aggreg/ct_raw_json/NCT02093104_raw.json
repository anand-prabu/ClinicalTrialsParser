We have developed a new approach that should allow us to overcome this speed\n      limitation. The major difference between conventional CT versus CT perfusion is the\n      obtaining of an extra series of images. CT perfusion results in an increase in the amount of\n      radiation exposure during the CT scan that measures the blood flow of the targeted tumor;\n      however, CT perfusion is much faster than conventional CT.\n\n      Prospective participants are being invited to the study because part of the treatment\n      towards the tumour therapy involves obtaining an angiogram."
