  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase III, multicenter, open-label study of RI-002 administered as an intravenous
      infusion of RI-002 (IGIV) every 21 or 28 days in approximately 60 subjects with Primary
      Immunodeficiency Diseases (PIDD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary immunodeficiency diseases (PIDDs) are genetically determined disorders of the immune
      system resulting in greatly enhanced susceptibility to infectious disease, autoimmunity and
      malignancy.  As most subjects with PIDDs present with infections, the differential diagnosis
      and initial investigations for an underlying immune defect are typically guided by the
      clinical presentation. In subjects with PIDDs, individual infections are not necessarily
      more severe than those that occur in a normal host. Rather, the clinical features suggestive
      of an immune defect may be the recurring and/or chronic nature of infections with common
      pathogens that may result in end organ damage, such as bronchiectasis.  Several immune
      globulin products have already been approved by the FDA.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        To be eligible to participate in this study, the subjects must meet the following
        criteria:

          1. Signed a written informed consent or a specific assent form for minors.

          2. Have a diagnosis of primary immunodeficiency disease.

          3. Be ≥ 2 years and ≤ 75 years.

          4. Have body weight ≥ 12 kg at screening.

          5. Have been receiving IGIV at a dose that has not been changed by &gt;50% of the mean dose
             on a mg/kg basis for at least 3 months prior to study entry and have maintained a
             trough serum IgG level ≥ 500 mg/dL on the previous 2 assessments prior to receiving
             RI 002.  The trough level must be at least 300 mg/dL above the pre-treatment serum
             IgG level.

          6. For female subjects, be of non-childbearing potential or have a negative pregnancy
             test prior to study start and be deemed not at risk of becoming pregnant by adherence
