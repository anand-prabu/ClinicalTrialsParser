Acute treatment (3 to 5 time topical\n      use of Euminz\u00ae) will start immediately after assessment of a baseline pain intensity of at\n      least moderate pain (3 on VPRS).\n\n      Second primary objective of the first headache episode will be the decrease of intensity of\n      pain measured by a visual analogue scale (VAS). The difference from measure point 0 (before\n      first application of Euminz\u00ae) on the VAS in comparison to 15, 30, 45, 60, 90 and 120 minutes\n      after start of treatment will be shown as area under the curve representing the pain\n      intensity difference (PID)."
