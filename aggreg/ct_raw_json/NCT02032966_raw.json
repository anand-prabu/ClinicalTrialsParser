The purpose of this\n      study is to help determine if surgically repairing only the tibia fracture will lead to\n      equivalent clinical outcomes when compared with surgical repair of both bones.\n\n      The hypothesis of this study is that operative stabilization of the medial malleolus\n      fracture only, in otherwise ligamentously stable bimalleolar and/or trimalleolar fractures\n      of the ankle, will lead to equivalent clinical outcomes and functional scores as those\n      treated with operative stabilization of both malleoli and/or all malleoli."
