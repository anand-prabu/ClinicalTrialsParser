The primary objective of this study is to\n      determine the long-term safety and tolerability of ataluren in patients with nmCF, as\n      assessed by adverse events and laboratory abnormalities. The secondary objective of this\n      study includes the assessment of the efficacy of ataluren, as measured by FEV1 and pulmonary\n      exacerbation rate, and change from baseline in other safety parameters (eg, 12-lead ECG\n      measurements, vital signs). Study subjects will be enrolled at approximately 19 sites in the\n      United States, Europe and Israel that previously participated in Study PTC124-GD-009-CF.\n      All study subjects will receive 10-, 10-, and 20-mg/kg ataluren (PTC124\u00ae) 3 times per day\n      (morning, midday and evening, respectively) for 48 weeks. Subjects will be evaluated at\n      clinic visits every 16 weeks and supplemented with interim phone calls in between onsite\n      visits.  A final 4-week post-treatment follow-up visit will also be conducted."
