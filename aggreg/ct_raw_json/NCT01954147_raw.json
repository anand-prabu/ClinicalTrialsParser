Clinical trials had verified that good\n      metabolic control would be achieved when Liraglutide (GLP-1) was added to the conventional\n      therapies. The investigators hypothesized that the combined therapy of umbilical cord\n      mesenchymal stem cells transplantation and Liraglutide in type 2 diabetes mellitus will aid\n      the differentiation of stem cells into insulin-producing cells, improve the survival of\n      differentiated cells, protect the residual beta-cells and improve insulin secreting\n      function, so as to achieve a favorable glucose homeostasis."
