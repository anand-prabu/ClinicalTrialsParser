  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of the pilot study is to provide data that can be used to better determine
      sample size for the design of a larger clinical trial. The pilot will evaluate the
      effectiveness of Lipoic Acid (LA) plus Omega-3 fatty acids (Omega-3) on preventing
      Alzheimer's Disease (AD). The investigators will also collect data to evaluate recruitment
      rate, safety, and compliance over the 12 month study period.

      The primary aim is to collect data so that we can determine effect size between lipoic acid
      plus omega-3 fatty acids and placebo on the primary outcome measure Trails B (executive
      function). This is designed as a pilot randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study
      with a 12 month intervention period. Thirty participants diagnosed with hypertension that is
      treated (systolic blood pressure 90-160 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure 60-90 mm Hg) that
      have low omega-3 fatty acid levels, and normal cognitive function will be randomized to
      receive study drug or placebo.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  55 years or older

          -  Non-demented: Montreal Cognitive Assessment &gt; 26 and Clinical Dementia Rating = 0

          -  Diagnosis of Essential Hypertension with systolic 90-160 mm Hg and diastolic 60-90 mm
             Hg

          -  Stable dose of antihypertensive medication 4 month prior to study enrollment

          -  Stable dose of lipid lowering medication - dose must be stable for 4 months prior to
             study enrollment

          -  Low Omega-3 fatty acid Status: Omega-3 index, &lt; 4% of total fatty acid of combined
             docsahexanoic acid and eicosapentanoic acid

          -  Geriatric Depression Scale &lt; 5

          -  General health status that will not interfere with the participant's ability to
             complete the study.

          -  Screening laboratory values within normal limits or, if abnormal, deemed clinically
             insignificant by the investigator

          -  Sufficient English language skills to complete all testing

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Alzheimer's, Dementia or other neurodegenerative disease.

          -  Health conditions such as cancer diagnosed &lt; 5 years prior to enrollment  (prostate
             cancer gleason grade &lt; 3 and non metastatic skin cancers are acceptable), liver
             disease, history of ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia, major
             psychiatric disorder, central nervous system diseases (e.g. brain tumor, seizure
             disorder)

          -  Insulin dependent diabetes or uncontrolled diabetes (diabetes controlled on
             medications other than insulin are acceptable)

          -  Fish intake of one 6 ounce serving &gt; once a week less than 4 months prior to
             enrollment

          -  Omega-3 fatty acid supplement intake (e.g. fish oil capsules, cod liver oil) less
             than 4 months prior to enrollment

          -  Lipoic Acid supplementation less than 1 month prior to enrollment

          -  Taking systemic corticosteroids, neuroleptics, antiparkinsonian agents, and/or
             narcotic analgesics. Low dose sinemet and dopamine agonist taken once a day for
             restless leg syndrome is not an exclusion.

             pacemakers, aneurysm clips, non-removable hearing aids, or metal fragments in the
             eyes. Other exclusion criteria include the inability to lie flat on the back for 40
             minutes at a time or a self-reported history of claustrophobia. Subjects with a
             history of hip replacement and those with well-documented, verifiable, MRI-safe
