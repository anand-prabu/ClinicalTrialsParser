The\n      participant will be fitted with a heart rate monitor fastened around their chest using an\n      elastic strap. They will also be fitted with a portable metabolic system (COSMED). This unit\n      fits around their waist and back, much like a backpack. The unit is attached to a face mask\n      that fits over their mouth and nose and is secured by elastic straps which wrap around their\n      head.\n\n      The participants will first rest motionless in a chair for 20 minutes. Following this, they\n      will complete three different simulated working conditions by typing at a computer while 1)\n      seated in an office chair, 2) seated pedaling while using a prototype pedal desk, and 3)\n      walking on a treadmill. The order of testing for the seated pedaling and treadmill walking\n      working conditions will be counterbalanced with participants randomly assigned to the two\n      possible order permutations. They will complete the 3 working conditions for 15 minutes each\n      at their own self-selected level of effort. A rest period of 5 minutes will be given between\n      each condition. During the working conditions, they will be asked to retype a displayed\n      standard set of text."
