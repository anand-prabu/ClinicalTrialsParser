      The goal of this project is to improve the treatment of veterans with co-occurring alcohol
      dependence and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).   The PI and co-investigators will
      conduct a controlled clinical trial of topiramate for the treatment of these co-occurring
      disorders.
