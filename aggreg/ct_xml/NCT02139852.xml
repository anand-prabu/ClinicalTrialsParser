  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Capsaicinoids (the active ingredient in hot peppers) have been shown to cause a moderate
      increase in energy expenditure (50 kcal/day) as well as reductions in appetite, energy
      intake, and (visceral) adiposity. As such, there is considerable interest in capsaicinoid
      for weight loss supplements.  Of particular interest are the recent findings that free-fatty
      acids in the blood are elevated 2-2.5hrs post ingestion, yet changes in typical
      cardiovascular or sympathetic nervous tone indicators (heart rate, blood pressure) were
      unaffected, suggesting some of the negative consequences of other stimulants may be avoided.
      At present, however, more in depth investigations of the effects on endothelial function,
      vascular autonomic tone and inflammation are lacking.

      The investigators seek to understand the effect of 3 months capsaicinoid ingestion on
      alterations in body composition, traditional cardiovascular risk factors and cardiovascular
      function

      Hypotheses:

      1) Continued use of capsaicinoids will alter resting metabolism substrate use, which will
      result in moderate (but clinically meaningful) alterations in body composition manifested as
      a decrease in adiposity. 2) Blood lipids will be unaffected by capsaicinoid use, as will
      brachial blood pressure. 3) Levels of systemic inflammation may increase slightly, and this
      could have an effect on vascular reactivity to hyperemic flow or baseline vascular tone.
      However, previous research suggests that these alterations will not be manifested in
      autonomic nervous tone assessed by changes in heart rate variability.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects will be male or female

          -  18 yr -45yr and free from any known or suspected chronic conditions.

          -  General health and suitability to participate in an exercise/health research study
             will be confirmed through use of the PAR-Q+ screening questionnaire

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any participant who has a positive answer to a screening question will be required to
             seek physician approval prior to any physical exercise.

          -  Baseline arrhythmia (tachycardia (&gt;100pbm) and systolic or diastolic hypertension
             (&gt;140/90 mmHg) will also be reason for exclusion.

          -  During baseline anthropometric assessment we will confirm that participants all fall
             within a typical BMI range (20-30 kg/m2) of either &quot;normal&quot; weight or &quot;overweight&quot;,
             but not &quot;underweight&quot; or &quot;obese&quot;.

          -  Persons who take cardiovascular medications, metabolic medications, smoke cigarettes,
             excessively consume alcohol, are prone to heartburn, or have a previous diagnosis of
             hyperlipidemia or hyperinsulemia will also be excluded
