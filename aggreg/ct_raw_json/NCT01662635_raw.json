Criteria for probe\n      signal interpretation in at least 200 interphase nuclei were as follow: 1) separated green\n      and orange signals or single red signals identified cells with rearranged ALK; 2)\n      overlapping of red and green signals (yellowish) indicated cells in which ALK was not\n      rearranged.\n\n      FISH-positive samples for ALK rearrangement were defined as having cells with a clearly\n      separated pair of probe signals, or with >15% of cells having loss of the 5\u00b4(centromeric)\n      probe. The higher threshold for loss is necessary because parts of probes can be lost during\n      sectioning Clinical details of these patients were included in a database.
