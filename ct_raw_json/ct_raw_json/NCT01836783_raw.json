Amniotic tissue is an abundant source\n      of collagen which provides an extracellular matrix to act as a natural scaffold for cellular\n      attachment in the body; collagen provides a structural tissue matrix that facilitates\n      cellular migration and proliferation in-vivo. The product is developed using proprietory\n      techniques by BioDlogics, LLC. The amniotic allograft growth factors are thought to enhance\n      formation of a supportive scaffold for regeneration, to facilitate interactions between cell\n      types, and to influence anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial and immuno-privilege activities.\n\n      Atraumatic extractions and socket grafts will be performed. Dental implants will be inserted\n      into the grafted areas 8 weeks post-graft. The implants will be restored and followed for 24\n      months post-insertion."
