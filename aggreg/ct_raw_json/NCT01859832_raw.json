This assay measures ATP as an activation response of CD4+ cells\n      to stimulation with phytohemagglutinin (PHA) in whole blood samples as a reflection of the\n      immune system of the patient at any point in therapy.   The natural history of the immune\n      status of the renal transplant recipient as reflected by the ImmuKnow assay will be\n      determined at specific time points of interest including: pre and post transplant, as an\n      adjunct to therapeutic drug monitoring, and pre and post infectious or rejection episode.\n      Analysis of the results of the assay at these time points will allow us to retrospectively\n      study the effects of routine immunosuppressive agent modulation on immune function, and its\n      subsequent effects in times of renal allograft insult."
