Diagnosis should be confirmed by appropriate test(s) (enzyme\n             and/or mutation analysis) before study entry. Patients must not be eligible for\n             myeloablative chemotherapy as a preparative regimen for transplant due to age,\n             co-morbidities or organ dysfunction.\n\n             Inborn errors of metabolism / Inherited Metabolic Disorders (IMD) eligible for this\n             Compassionate Use Provision include Metachromatic Leukodystrophy (MLD)\n\n          2. Patients must be \u2265 3 years of age\n\n          3. Patients must have Lansky or Karnofsky performance status \u226540\n\n          4. Patients must have adequate function of other organ systems as measured by:\n\n               -  Creatinine < 2.0 mg/dl and creatinine clearance \u226560 cc/min/1.73m2.  Newborns\n                  must have a creatinine clearance > 25 cc/min.  For babies < 3 months of age, the\n                  raw value on glomerular filtration rate (GFR) must be > 1 cc/kg/min.\n\n               -  Hepatic transaminases (ALT/AST) \u22644 x normal, bilirubin <2.0mg/dl\n\n               -  Normal cardiac function by echocardiogram or radionuclide scan (ejection\n                  fraction or shortening fraction >80% of normal value for age)\n\n               -  Pulmonary function tests demonstrating forced expiratory volume at one second\n                  (FEV1) of >50% of predicted for age.

Patient must have a related donor [identical or mismatched for 1, 2 or 3\n             histocompatibility leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A, -B or -DR loci].\n\n          6. Patient, and parent, or legal guardian must have given written informed consent\n             according to FDA guidelines.\n\n          7.
