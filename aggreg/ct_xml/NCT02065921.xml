      1. Background Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is an inflammatory disease of
           the lungs, which is most commonly caused by smoking. It is characterized as not fully
           reversible airflow limitation, chronic cough and dyspnoea. Being the fourth leading
           cause of death worldwide, COPD is an important public health challenge and can be
           prevented and treated.  It is estimated that at least  400,000 individuals in
           Switzerland are affected by COPD. This number may increase in the coming years due to
           increasing nicotine consumption.

           In response to the rising trend, the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung
           Disease (GOLD) has established new guidelines on the global strategy for diagnosis,
           management and prevention of COPD. Systematic diagnosis and stratification are crucial
           for effective treatment measures.

           As COPD is an irreversible and progressive disease, its treatment aims an early
           detection and better management, which leads preventing progression. Disease management
           programs have shown that only patients who understand their exacerbation symptoms can
           benefit. Moreover, it is a major goal to improve health-related quality of life by
           reducing symptoms and decelerating disease progression.

           Spirometry is the golden standard for the diagnosis of COPD, to assess the severity of
           the obstruction, and as a guide for optimal therapeutic measures.

        2. Aim of the study The objective of this project is to establish a COPD cohort database
           to allow high quality research on diagnosis, treatment, complication and progression of
           COPD on long-term course.

           Spirometry should be used consistently for the diagnosis and the monitoring of the
           development of the disease. Using collected information such as spirometric data,
           disease progression's data and therapeutic measures should help improve the management
           and self-management of the patients.

        3. Methods 3.1 Study design We are conducting a prospective cohort study, based on COPD
           patients from northern and western Switzerland, who are managed under primary care
           setting. Patients with mild to very severe COPD (GLOD stages I-IV) are enrolled in the
           study.

           Currently, 67 General practitioners (GPs) are participating in our Study. Each GP
           recruits 1-20 patients with presumed mild to very severe COPD according to criteria of
           the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung disease [GOLD].

           Patients' follow-up-visits occurs at 6-month intervals; their history, symptoms and
           examination status is recorded. Data is entered into an online database either by the
           physicians or by study team after receiving the collected data questionnaires by
           facsimile.

           Data collection includes demographic data, physical examination, spirometric
           parameters, medical treatment and exacerbation history besides death.

           A spirometer (EasyOne™, ndd Medizintechnik AG, Zürich, Switzerland) is used to assess
           lung function. All participating physicians were instructed on the usage of the
           spirometer and on how to complete spirometry according to the guidelines. For the
           assessment of the severity of COPD, we use the spirometric data provided by the GPs.
           The COPD severity is interpreted according to criteria of the GOLD committee.

           3.2 Patient population Patients with newly diagnosed or existing COPD, who are managed
           in primary-care practices.

           3.3 Inclusion criteria

             -  Tiffenau (FEV17FVC) &lt; 70 without reversibility (Increase in FEV1 after inhalation
                of a bronchodilator &lt;200 ml and &lt;12%).

             -  Age: &gt; 40 years

             -  Both genders

             -  Smokers or ex-smokers of at least 20 pack years.

             -  Informed consent.

           3.4 Archiving and Data Retention All study-related records such as medical records,
           informed consent documents, information regarding participants who discontinued, and
           other pertinent data will be maintained and therefore retained as long as required by
           the applicable Swiss regulatory requirements (10 Years).

           3.5 Data security The complete data of the study will be entered anonymously into a
           database. The data is password-protected and can only be accessed by investigators and
           study members.

        4. Publication and authorship 4.1 Publication policy

      Authorship credit is based on:

        1. Substantial contribution to conception and design, acquisition of data, or analysis and
           interpretation of data.

        2. Drafting the article or revising it critically for important intellectual content.

        3. Final approval of the version to be published. Each author should have participated
           sufficiently in the work to take public responsibility for appropriate portions of the
           content.
