  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adductor canal block will provide adequate analgesia to patients undergoing arthroscopic ACL
      reconstruction surgery, yet result in less motor blockade than a femoral block.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to demonstrate that postoperative analgesia produced by the adductor
      canal block is not inferior to that produced by femoral nerve block in patients undergoing
      arthroscopic ACL reconstruction surgery. The study will also compare the degree of motor
      blockade of the adductor canal block to that of the femoral nerve block.

    <description>Examination of the adductor canal using ultrasound will be performed using a high frequency linear probe. Following this the ultrasound probe will be positioned perpendicular to the skin in the medial upper-thigh region. The ultrasound probe will be moved either cephalad or caudad from its initial position in order to visualize the femoral artery immediately deep to the middle of the sartorius muscle. This point will then be selected as the appropriate level for needle insertion. Sham blocks using subcutaneous injection of normal saline will be used in both groups to maintain patient blinding.</description>

    <description>Examination of the femoral nerve using ultrasound will be performed using a high frequency linear probe. Following this the ultrasound probe will be positioned perpendicular to the skin at the level of the femoral crease. The femoral artery will be identified and the femoral nerve will then be located immediately lateral to the artery, deep to the fascia iliaca and superficial to the iliopsoas muscle. The needle will be positioned next to the femoral nerve. Following this 20 ml of 0.25% bupivacaine with epinephrine will be injected incrementally over a 1 to 2 minute period. Sham blocks using subcutaneous injection of normal saline will be used in both groups to maintain patient blinding.</description>
