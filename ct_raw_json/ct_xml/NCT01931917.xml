      baby)in Denmark. 200 families will be randomised to IY Baby (intervention) og UC (control).
      Families recruited to the study have infants aged 0-12 months. In one municipality first

    <measure>Karitane Parenting Confidence Scale (KPCS)</measure>

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The KPCS measures perceived parenting self-efficacy (PPSE) in parents of children aged 0-12 months. High PPSE has been shown to act as a buffer against factors that can compromise a child's development, such as parental depression, anxiety, stress and relationship difficulties, and is associated with actual parenting competence and positive child outcomes
The KPCS is a short self-report instrument. It was developed in Australia primarily for health professionals experienced in working with parentcraft and psychosocial issues of early parenthood, including Maternal, Child and Family Health Nurses, and allied health and medical professionals.</description>

    <description>In the Incredible Years Parents and Babies Program, parents learn how to help their babies feel loved, safe, and secure. They learn how to encourage their babies' physical and language development. The parenting group format fosters peer support networks and shared learning. Trained Incredible Years facilitators use video clips of real-life situational vignettes to support the training and stimulate parenting group discussions and practice exercises with their babies. The program is group based with 6-8 mothers and partners attending 8-10 2 hour sessions with their babies.</description>
