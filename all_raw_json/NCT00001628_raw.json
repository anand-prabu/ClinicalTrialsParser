Inhibition of the RAS is useful in\n      the treatment of hypertension, cardiac failure and in some patients with myocardial\n      infarction.  Several recent clinical trials with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors\n      (ACEI) have shown that they also reduce the incidence of myocardial infarction, but the\n      mechanisms underlying this anti-ischemic effect are poorly understood.  ACEI reduce\n      angiotensin II synthesis and prevent bradykinin degradation.  Results from ongoing studies\n      in the Cardiology Branch (Protocol 95-H-0099) designed to investigate the link between ACEI\n      and the vascular endothelium indicate that ACEI improve peripheral endothelial function, an\n      effect that is partially mediated by bradykinin.  The current protocol is designed to\n      investigate whether the beneficial effects of ACEI on peripheral endothelial function are\n      also due to inhibition of angiotensin II.  The recent development of selective angiotensin\n      II type 1 (AT1) receptor antagonists allows us to specifically examine the effects of\n      angiotensin II on vasomotor activity."
