  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Review of the medical files of 69 patients with neuroendocrine tumours who were treated at
      the CCI from January/10 - July/12 with Lutetium-177 DOTA-TATE under Health Canada's Special
      Access Programme (SAP). Efficacy, safety, and other relevant data will be collected.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neuroendocrine tumours comprise a spectrum of rare neoplasms. Data analysis will be
      conducted to obtain efficacy, safety, and other relevant data from each Lu-177 DOTA-TATE
      treatment.
