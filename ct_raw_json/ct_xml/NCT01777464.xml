  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In order to evaluate the effects a nasal provocation on the activation of different brain
      regions, the investigators want to set up a clinical trial investigating the short-term
      effects of a nasal histamine provocation in healthy volunteers and allergic patients while
      in supine position under the functional MRI device in order to visualize different brain
      regions.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a positive skin prick test to grass pollen and with pollen allergic
             symptoms during the pollen season OR patients with a negative skin prick test and
             with no allergic symptoms during the pollen season.

          -  Age &gt; 18 and &lt; 50 years

          -  Written informed consent

          -  Willingness to adhere to visit schedules

          -  Adequate contraceptive precautions in female patients with childbearing potential

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Current or recent (finished less than 2 years) immunotherapy against grass pollen.

          -  Systemic steroid treatment less than 6 weeks before the inclusion in the study.

          -  Nasal steroid spray, oral leukotriene antagonists or long-acting antihistamines less
             than 4 weeks before the inclusion.

          -  Presence of purulent secretions in nasal cavity.

          -  Severe septal deviation (septum reaching concha inferior or lateral nasal wall).

          -  Patient is pregnant or breastfeeding.

          -  Patient has any disorder of which the investigators feel at the time of evaluation
             for participation in the study that this may compromise the ability to give truly
             informed consent for participation in this study.

          -  Patient is currently enrolled in other investigational drug  trial(s) or is receiving
             other investigational agent(s) for any other medical condition.

          -  No independent medication management in daily life or disability to perform fine
             motoric handling of medication

          -  Patients with asthma will be excluded.

          -  Patients suffering from claustrophobia
