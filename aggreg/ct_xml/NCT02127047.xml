  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Increasing evidence suggests pancreatic islet beta-cell regeneration occurs throughout the
      course of the disease in patients with type 1 diabetes. Therefore, decreased beta-cell mass
      in type 1 diabetes may be improved through inhibition of beta-cell destruction and
      stimulation of proliferation, even after prolonged duration of disease.

      Physical activity improves insulin secretion via unknown underlying mechanisms. We recently
      observed that Interleukin-6 induces glucagon like Peptide (GLP)-1 production and release
      from the islet alpha-cell and the intestinal L-cell. Furthermore, exercise induces release
      of Interleukin-6 from skeletal muscle resulting in elevated circulating Interleukin-6
      levels. Therefore we hypothesize that exercise-induced Interleukin-6 promotes glucagon like
      peptide-1 secretion from the islet α-cell and the intestinal L-cell, thereby providing a
      mechanism how physical activity can help maintain and improve beta-cell function in patients
      with type 1 diabetes. This mechanism can be enhanced by concomitant dipeptidyl peptidase-IV
      inhibition.

      Physical activity is also known to enhance insulin sensitivity and to attenuate the immune
      system activity.

      Therefore by combining physical activity and dipeptidyl peptidase-IV inhibition we aim to
      allow for beta-cell regeneration in a interventional randomized open-label study.
