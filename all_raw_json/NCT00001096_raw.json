To determine whether the new preparation of QS-21 in polysorbate\n      80 is less reactogenic than the QS-21 formulation used in AVEG Protocols 016, 016A, and\n      016B. To examine whether QS-21 is immunologically equivalent to that used in 16B. To\n      determine if QS-21, when given with low doses of antigen, induces measurable HIV-1-specific\n      CTL activity. To evaluate if the QS-21 dose-sparing effect extends to an antigen dose of 0.5\n      micrograms. To determine if the bivalent vaccine gives responses equivalent to the\n      monovalent product or if a broadening of the HIV-1-specific binding and neutralizing\n      antibody responses occurs.\n\n      An effective vaccine to prevent HIV-1 infection may need to generate diverse and\n      multifaceted immunologic responses. Required parts of the immune response may include:\n      humoral antibodies, which broadly neutralize non-syncytium-inducing strains of HIV-1; T cell\n      help provided by both CD4 and CD8 positive subsets; and a class I-restricted cytotoxic\n      lymphocyte response. Other effector responses, such as the generation of antibody-dependent\n      cellular cytotoxicity, cytokines, chemokines, or other antiviral factors may also be\n      critical in mounting protective immunity. Given the lack of a surrogate immunologic marker,\n      the most practical approach for possible efficacy trials would be to evaluate a candidate\n      vaccine that elicits as many of these responses as possible."
