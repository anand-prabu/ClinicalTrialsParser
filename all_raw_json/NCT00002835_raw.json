Patients are stratified according to tumor score (3 or\n      4 vs 5 or 6).\n\n      During the first course of induction, patients receive IDSHAP comprising idarubicin (IDA)\n      and cisplatin IV continuously on days 1-4, cytarabine (ARA-C) IV over 2 hours on day 5, and\n      methylprednisolone (MePRDL) IV over 15 minutes on days 1-5. During the second course of\n      induction, patients receive MBIDCOS comprising vincristine, bleomycin, and cyclophosphamide\n      IV over 15 minutes on day 1, IDA IV continuously and MePRDL IV over 15 minutes on days 1-3,\n      methotrexate (MTX) IV over 2 hours on day 10, and oral leucovorin calcium every 6 hours on\n      days 11 and 12. Each course lasts 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or\n      unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Patients with stable or responding disease after induction are randomized to 1 of 2\n      treatment arms.\n\n      Arm I\n\n        -  Patients receive the following 3 courses of early intensification.\n\n             -  First course: Patients receive ifosfamide (IFF) IV continuously and etoposide\n                (VP-16) IV over 2 hours every 12 hours on days 1-3. Filgrastim (G-CSF) is\n                administered subcutaneously (SC) beginning on day 5 and continuing until blood\n                counts recover and then autologous peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) are\n                harvested, selected for CD34 positive cells, and purged in vitro. If more than 5%\n                of the WBC contains lymphoma cells after induction, then 2 courses of IFF and\n                VP-16 are administered before PBSC harvest.\n\n             -  Second course: Patients receive IFF IV continuously on days 1-3, mitoxantrone\n                (DHAD) IV on day 1, and G-CSF SC as in the first course.\n\n             -  Third course: Patients receive carmustine IV over 1 hour on day -6, ARA-C and\n                VP-16 IV every 12 hours on days -5 to -2, and melphalan IV on day -1. PBSC are\n                reinfused on day 0. G-CSF is administered SC beginning on day 0 and continuing\n                until blood counts recover. Each course lasts 3 weeks in the absence of disease\n                progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Arm II\n\n        -  Patients receive IDSHAP during courses 2 and 5, MBIDCOS during courses 3 and 6, and IFF\n           and VP-16 IV over 1 hour on days 1-3 and DHAD IV over 15 minutes on day 1 during\n           courses 1, 4, and 7. Each course lasts 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or\n           unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Patients with residual disease after completion of arm I or II treatment undergo\n      radiotherapy to areas of bulk disease if feasible. Patients on both arms with meningeal\n      involvement receive ARA-C intrathecally (IT) alternated with MTX every other day until 1\n      week after clearing of CNS disease and then 2 IT injections during every course of\n      chemotherapy thereafter. Patients with divergent histology who achieve complete response\n      after completion of arm I or II treatment receive interferon alfa 3 times a week for 1 year.\n\n      Patients are followed at 1 month, every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 1 year, and\n      then annually for 2 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 136 patients will be accrued for this study within 4 years."
