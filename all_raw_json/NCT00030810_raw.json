Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to damage tumor\n      cells. Combining chemotherapy with radiation therapy before surgery may shrink the tumor so\n      that it can be removed during surgery.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy followed by\n      radiation therapy before surgery in treating patients who have stage IIIB non-small cell\n      lung cancer."

Treatment\n      repeats every 3 weeks for 3 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Beginning 3 weeks after the last chemotherapy dose, patients without progressive disease\n      receive radiotherapy 1-2 times daily on days 1-5, 8-12, and 15-19.\n\n      Patients undergo surgery within 3-4 weeks after completion of radiotherapy.\n\n      Patients are followed at 1 month and then every 3 months thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-46 patients will be accrued for this study."
