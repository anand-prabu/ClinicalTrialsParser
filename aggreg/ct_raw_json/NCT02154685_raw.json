            "textblock": "Smoking occurs in approximately 21% of the US population, is responsible for an annual\n      mortality rate of approximately 438,000 citizens, and has an associated healthcare economic\n      burden of $167 billion. Although pharmacotherapies have improved cessation outcome, the vast\n      majority of individuals making quit attempts relapse within 5-10 days of cessation. The\n      hypotheses to be examined in this study may have potentially important implications for\n      smoking cessation treatment and will, therefore, target the single greatest\n      addiction-related cause of morbidity and mortality.This study will investigate a novel\n      behavioral strategy for altering important memory processes that underlie human\n      smoking-related nicotine addiction. This strategy used in this study employs established cue\n      exposure procedures to putatively update smoking-related memory with information that will\n      suppress responding to smoking cues. The goal here is to alter existing nicotine-related\n      memory directly rather than rely exclusively on the establishment of an inhibitory\n      extinction process, via traditional cue exposure therapy, which is known to be vulnerable to\n      spontaneous recovery, renewal and reinstatement. Positive findings would represent a\n      significant advance in exposure-based therapy for addiction and could lead to a treatment\n      that uniquely targets the problem of cue-elicited craving and reactivity, thereby addressing\n      a major obstacle to successful smoking cessation."

            "textblock": "We propose to examine the effects of two sessions of retrieval-extinction (R-E) training in\n      smokers who are making a quit attempt. Retrieval will be initiated by a brief (5-min.) video\n      with smoking-related content and the extinction will consist of protracted (1 hr.) exposure\n      to smoking cues. A control group receiving the same treatment except that the retrieval\n      video will have nonsmoking/neutral content will serve to demonstrate that retrieval is a key\n      feature of R-E training. Effects of training on smoking craving and cue reactivity will be\n      assessed 1-day, 2-weeks and 4-weeks post-training, whereas training effects on indices of\n      smoking behavior/cessation will be preliminarily assessed 2-weeks and 4-weeks post-training.\n      It is expected that the R-E training will result in significant and enduring reductions in\n      craving and reactivity to both novel and familiar smoking cues and have a favorable impact\n      on smoking. Positive findings from this study could lead to a safe and effective behavioral\n      intervention that will help smokers overcome the threat to cessation posed by cue-elicited\n      craving and reactivity, and thereby reduce the burden levied against society by this most\n      costly addiction. Additionally, this intervention could be modified to treat addiction to\n      other substances."
