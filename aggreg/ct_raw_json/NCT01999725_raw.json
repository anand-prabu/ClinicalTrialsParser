All subjects receive a single dose of study drug (EDP-788 or placebo).\n\n      Subjects in Cohort C will receive a second single dose of study drug (EDP-788 or placebo)\n      approximately 2 weeks after the first dose. The second dose will be administered as a liquid\n      suspension rather than as a capsule formulation. The purpose of the second dose is to\n      estimate the bioavailability of the capsule formulation relative to the suspension.\n\n      Subjects in Cohort E will receive a second single dose of study drug (EDP-788 or placebo)\n      approximately 2 weeks after the first does.
