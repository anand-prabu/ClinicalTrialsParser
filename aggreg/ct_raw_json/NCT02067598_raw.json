The participants have experienced spontaneous scapular pain for longer than 12 weeks\n             (chronic) and that at least one trigger point will be present in the scapular region\n             (serratus posterior superior, rhomboid groups, levator scapulae and trapezius\n             muscles). Trigger points will be diagnosed as the presence of focal tenderness in a\n             taut band and with pain recognition (Chatchawan et al., 2005; Tough et al., 2007).\n\n          4.
