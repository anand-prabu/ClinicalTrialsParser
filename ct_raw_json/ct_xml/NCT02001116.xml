  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A cooperation agreement between the Ministry of Health (MOH) of Kyrgyz Republic and WHO-EURO
      was established, for the implementation of a WHO Project to improve  the quality of
      pediatric care in the referral hospitals. The pilot regions selected for this intervention
      are the three northern regions of Thalas, Chiu and Issik-Kul Region in Kyrgyz Republic. The
      MOH project will be implemented at a first stage in a group of 10 pilot hospitals, randomly
      selected among the existing hospitals in the above cited regions. Pilot Hospitals will be
      compared to &quot;control hospitals&quot;, which are the hospitals in the region not receiving the
      intervention, using a pre-defined set of indicators of quality of care. The results of the
      present evaluation on the pilot hospitals will provide data that will inform the MOH on how
      better to scale up this project at a national scale.
