Although the results are promising, concerns\n      about adherence, pharmacokinetics, and toxicity still needs further exploration so new and\n      more effective preventive pharmacological approaches should be evaluated. This trial will\n      evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of ex vivo HIV infection of rectal mucosa\n      by the CCR5 antagonist drug maraviroc (Selzentry) administered to healthy volunteers. This\n      trial will last approximately one year. Twenty-one volunteers will receive MVC 300 mg orally\n      in a single dose. Study visits will occur at enrollment and at days 0, 7, 9, 14 and 16. All\n      study visits will include a physical examination, blood collection and storage and in the\n      basal visit and a day 7 or 9 the participants will undergo a colonoscopy.  Ex vivo HIV\n      infectivity in rectal mucosa biopsies and plasma/mucosa MVC levels will be evaluated."
