            "textblock": "Despite recent advances in the understanding and treatment of schizophrenia, this\n      devastating disease still affects one percent of world's population. Existing antipsychotics\n      reduce psychotic symptoms but are generally not very effective in treating so called\n      negative symptoms such as blunted affect and social withdrawal or cognitive disturbances due\n      to the disease. Furthermore, a significant portion of patients is refractory to all current\n      treatments. Therefore new treatment strategies are needed.\n\n      Several studies suggest a strong association between schizophrenia and the endocannabinoid\n      system. This system mediates e.g. the pro-psychotic effects of the best-known ingredient of\n      the cannabis plant - delta-tetrahydrocannabinol (\u03949-THC). While the pro-psychotic \u03949-THC is\n      known to abet the onset of schizophrenia, another, non-psychotomimetic plant ingredient -\n      cannabidiol - has recently been shown to exert antipsychotic effects similar to those of one\n      of the most effective modern antipsychotics, amisulpride, but it induced significantly less\n      side effects.\n\n      In this phase I safety study, the investigators will evaluate the pharmacokinetics,\n      pharmacoequivalence, and drug-drug interaction profile with current antipsychotics of a new\n      tablet pharmaceutical preparation of cannabidiol in healthy volunteers."
