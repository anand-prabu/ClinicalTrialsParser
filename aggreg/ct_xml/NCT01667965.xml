  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness and acceptability of a recently
      created informative video geared for patients who have been evaluated by a radiation
      oncologist for palliative radiation therapy during a hospitalization at Memorial
      Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. Palliative radiation therapy is radiation therapy that is
      given to patients with the purpose of easing symptoms from cancer. It is not given with the
      intent to cure the cancer. The video presents basic information about palliative radiation
      and palliative care.

    <description>Questionnaires will be given before the patient watches a video educational tool to aid informed consent about palliative radiation therapy; and (2) after the patient watches the video educational tool. (3) If the patient receives PRT, a final questionnaire that assesses the patient's impression of the video will also be administered at the conclusion of radiation therapy.</description>
