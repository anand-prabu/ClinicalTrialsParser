A total of 180 patients are planned to\n      be enrolled into the study. ERCC1 protein expression in paraffin-embedding tumor tissue is\n      examined by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Patients with low ERCC1 expression (group L) will be\n      treated with XP regimen. Patients with high ERCC1 expression will be randomized into group\n      H-A or group H-B, and be treated with XP or DX regimen, respectively. The primary end point\n      is progression free survival (PFS), and the secondary end points include the median overall\n      survival, objective response rate (ORR),disease control rate(DCR), duration of response,\n      safety(number and degree of adverse events), and the quality of life (QOL)."
