            "textblock": "Azacitidine was first introduced for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia in adults in\n      1976. Azacitidine prevents the body from making DNA and RNA that cells need to grow. This\n      stops the growth of cancer cells and causes them to die.\n\n      Romidepsin (also known as Istodax) is another type of chemotherapy known as HDAC (histone\n      deacetylase) inhibitors.  This type of drug blocks the function of enzymes that help remove\n      the acetyl groups from various proteins in cells.  HDAC inhibitors help stop the growth of\n      cancer cells and can help kill the cancer cells.\n\n      This is a Phase I/II study.  Patients will be treated with oral 5-azacitidine and\n      romidepsin, administered as follows: oral 5-azacitidine from Days 1-14 or Days 1-21 (Dose\n      Cohorts 5 and 6); and romidepsin administered intravenously on Days 8, 15 (and Day 22 in\n      dose cohorts 5 and 6) of a 28 day cycle.  Cohorts of 3 patients will be enrolled\n      sequentially as outlined in the dose escalation scheme. Once the MTD is reached the Phase II\n      part of the protocol will be initiated in patients with T-Cell Lymphoma."
