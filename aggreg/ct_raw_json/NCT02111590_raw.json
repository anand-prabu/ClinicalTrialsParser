All patients will be trained in managing the\n      treatment with SCIG by a nurse from the neurological department. When the patient is able to\n      manage the treatment regimen it can be done at home.\n\n      All patients will be evaluated eight times during the study period. Four times before and\n      four times after shift of treatment.\n\n      Prior to participation the intervals will be standardized to 3 or 6 weeks giving an extra\n      infusion for those with an interval of 3 weeks, i.e. patients on 4-week interval will be\n      switched to 3-week interval while patients on 5-week interval will be switched to 6-week\n      interval. The dose will be adjusted leading to an unchanged weekly dose of IVIG. All\n      patients will be evaluated in connection to two IVIG infusions. For those receiving 3\n      infusions examinations will be executed before and 2 weeks after the first and last\n      infusion. SCIG is initiated 2 weeks after the last IVIG infusion.\n\n      Patients on maintenance therapy with Subcuvia\u00ae or Hizentra\u00ae will be shifted to treatment\n      with Gammanorm\u00ae according to guidelines from the Danish Healthcare Society, the weekly dose\n      of immunoglobulin being unaltered. They will be evaluated 3 times (once before, at the time\n      of shift of SCIG and once after).\n\n      All evaluations at each time point in both groups consist of measurement of isokinetic\n      muscle strength of four affected muscle groups and blood sampling detecting blood hemoglobin\n      and hemolytic parameters."
