Therefore, the investigators are proposing to study the effects of protein\n      supplementation in this group of babies.   The investigators will recruit 24 infants with\n      brain injury (evidence of hemorrhage, white matter injury, or gray matter injury) admitted\n      to the Cincinnati Children's Hospital Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) into the study.\n      Upon diagnosis, the investigators will obtain consent from the parents for participation in\n      the study, then randomly assign the baby to one of two groups - an increased protein group\n      and a control group. Both groups of infants will be monitored to ensure no adverse effects\n      occur due to the supplementation.\n\n      Protein supplementation will continue for the first 12 months of age.  Growth parameters,\n      such as weight, length, and head circumference, will be measured while the infant is the\n      NICU. Head circumference will be measured in the investigators outpatient clinic at three,\n      six, and 12 months of age. At 18-22 months, the infants will be tested for\n      neurodevelopmental outcomes using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development.  The\n      investigators hypothesize that infants who receive the additional protein will demonstrate\n      increased head growth and improved neurodevelopmental outcomes."
