Determine the safety and toxicity of this treatment regimen in this patient population.\n\n      OUTLINE:\n\n      Patients receive 506U78 IV over 2 hours on days 1, 3, and 5. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks\n      for at least 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n      Patients achieving complete response receive up to 8 courses of therapy.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 1 year or until\n      relapse.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 34-74 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years."
