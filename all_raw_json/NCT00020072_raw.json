Patients with\n      Sezary syndrome undergo leukapheresis. Patients with plaque/tumor stage mycosis fungoides\n      undergo skin biopsy of involved skin. Malignant T cells from blood or skin are then isolated\n      and patterns of gene expression in the malignant T cells are compared to those in normal\n      skin-homing T cells from healthy donors using a \"gene chip\" (Lymphochip).\n\n      Patients are followed annually for 5 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients (20 per disease stratum) will be accrued for this\n      study within 2 years."
