Cabozantinib is a new drug that has demonstrated\n      effectiveness against pancreatic cancer in laboratory experiments, especially when given\n      with gemcitabine. Initial studies with cabozantinib  in pancreatic cancer have shown some\n      activity against the disease. The purpose of this study is to determine the safest and\n      highest dose of cabozantinib that can be given together with standard doses of gemcitabine\n      in patients with pancreatic cancer.  This study will determine the safety and tolerability\n      of this two drug combination."

Additionally, the combination of cabozantinib and\n      gemcitabine demonstrated improved tumor control compared to either agent alone in a relevant\n      orthotopic implantation mouse model.\n\n      Combining gemcitabine with the c-Met inhibitor cabozantinib in advanced pancreatic cancer is\n      a novel strategy that takes advantage of an established cytotoxic agent with one that\n      targets a pathway known to be important for the growth, dissemination, and resistance of\n      this disease."
