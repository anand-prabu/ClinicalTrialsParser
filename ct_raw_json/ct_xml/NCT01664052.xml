    <textblock>
      This study has been designed to evaluate an investigational model of the Essure System for
      Permanent Birth Control. The investigational device is designed to offer all the advantages
      of the currently approved device. In addition, the investigational device offers immediate,
      permanent contraception without a three-month waiting period or 90-day confirmation test.
      This study has been designed to evaluate the effectiveness of the investigational device in
      causing tubal occlusion from insert placement through three months of wearing.
