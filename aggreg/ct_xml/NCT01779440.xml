  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Up to 77% of young people with severe mental illnesses smoke, a rate that is up to five
      times higher than the rate of daily smoking in other young adults.  Contrary to popular
      belief, smoking tobacco does not provide any benefit for mental illness symptom control.
      People with severe mental illnesses (SMI: schizophrenia and severe mood disorders) are
      dying, on average, 25 years earlier than those without SMI.  Much of this early mortality is
      due to higher rates of heart and lung diseases, cancers, strokes, and diabetes.

      Cessation of smoking in these transition-age young adults can prevent cancer and increase
      life expectancy to that of non-smokers.  Combination treatments are effective in this group
      and therefore key to improving outcomes, but few SMI smokers use them  despite their
      interest in quitting.  Motivational interventions for cessation increase interest in
      quitting, but public mental health clinicians do not deliver them, in part due to economic
      reasons.  Thus cost effective methods to deliver motivational interventions to engage young
      smokers with SMI into treatment are needed.

      To address this gap, we have developed an electronic decision support system (EDSS) for
      smoking cessation that is specifically tailored for smokers with SMI, who tend to have
      cognitive deficits and limited computer experience.  Similar to EDSSs developed for other
      health problems, this EDSS provides information and motivational exercises within an
      easy-to-use, web-based computer program that can be used with minimal or no staff
      assistance.  Initial piloting of the EDSS in middle-aged SMI smokers showed excellent
      usability and promising efficacy.  Pilot-testing among young patients suggested that the
      EDSS increased motivation to quit smoking and provided direction to adapt the format and
      content of the EDSS for young SMI smokers.

      The purpose of this proposal is to further develop the motivational decision support system
      and to test its ability to motivate young smokers with SMI to quit smoking with cessation
      treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The research will take place over 2 years at the Long Island Zucker Hillside Hospital
      system. In Year 1, we will adapt our electronic decision support system, a web-based
      motivational tool, for young smokers with severe mental illness. We will first identify
      beliefs of young smokers with severe mental illness that impede use of smoking cessation
      treatments. Then, the decision support system will be revised to change these beliefs,
      field-tested for usability, and improved as needed. In Year 2, we will conduct a randomized
      control trial of the newly revised version of the system among 60 young smokers with severe
      psychotic disorders.

      In the controlled trial, participants will be assessed at baseline for mental health
      symptoms and smoking behavior and history, and then randomized to use the system or a
      computerized public health pamphlet (control condition) within two weeks. Participants will
      be assessed again at 14-week follow-up for clinician-confirmed initiation of smoking
      cessation treatment (main outcome), beliefs, and smoking characteristics.  Analyses will
      assess whether use of the decision support system results in greater initiation of cessation
      treatment (main outcome), and changes in beliefs about treatment, than use of the control
      intervention.
