    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose of RX-0201, up to a
      target dose of 250 mg/m^2/day, when given in combination with everolimus (Stage 1), and to
      assess the safety and efficacy of RX-0201 plus everolimus, in subjects with metastatic renal
      cell cancer (Stage 2).

      This multi-center, open-label, randomized, parallel group study of RX-0201 in combination
      with everolimus,  versus everolimus alone to treat subjects with advanced renal cell
      carcinoma will be conducted in 2 stages. Stage 1 will be an open-label, dose-escalation
      study of RX-0201 to identify a safe and tolerable dose of RX-0201 up to a target dose of 250
      mg/m^2/day when given in combination with everolimus. Stage 2 will be a randomized,
      open-label, 2-arm study of RX-0201 in combination with everolimus versus everolimus alone.
      Subjects will receive RX-0201, at the dose identified in Stage 1, in combination with
      everolimus or everolimus alone, for up to 8 cycles to determine safety and efficacy of the
      combination.
