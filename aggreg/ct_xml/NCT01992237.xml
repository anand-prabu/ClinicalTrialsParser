  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With the perception that lung protective ventilation with regard to low tidal volume
      ventilation and limiting airway pressures improves outcome in ARDS (acute respiratory
      distress syndrome) and that the development of new technical devices of extracorporeal lung
      assist systems with lower complication rates support establishment of lung protective
      ventilation strategies these systems are more and more frequently used. All critically ill
      patients with and without ECLA (extracorporeal lung assist)/ECMO (extracorporeal membrane
      oxygenation) treatment are on high risk for muscle wasting, leading to more comorbidity and
      higher mortality risk.  Besides inflammation malnutrition is known as one of the main risk
      factors. Over and underfeeding should be prevented. However nutritional aspects of patients
      on extracorporeal lung assist are hardly investigated. Up to now changes in metabolic rates
      induced by ECLA/ECMO are poorly described. Factors like work of breathing, changes in
      cardiac output and septic state are influencing energy metabolism but until now there is no
      tool for measuring energy expenditure in clinical routine for patients on ECLA/ECMO.
      Indirect calorimetry is a simple device only for patients without ECLA/ECMO system.
      Oxygenation and CO2 (carbon dioxide) elimination by the lung assist system can be calculated
      but is not implemented to clinical routine. The combination of indirect calorimetry and
      calculation of lung assist function at the same time would give us the chance to adapt
      nutrition rates to energy expenditure. This may prevent muscle wasting and weakness. This
      pilot study will include  40 participating patients during 8 month investigating nutritional
      therapy adapted to energy expenditure calculated by O2 and CO2 turnover rates in patients on
      ECLA or ECMO systems. The investigators aim is to describe a calculation to set nutrition
      targets in ECMO patients. Second the investigators will describe level of nutritional needs
      under consideration of different mechanical ventilation states. Third O2 consumption and CO2
      elimination will be used to estimate cardiac output.
