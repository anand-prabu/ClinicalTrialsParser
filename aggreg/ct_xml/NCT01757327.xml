  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies the effects of erismodegib (LDE225) on disseminated
      tumor cells (DTCs) in patients with stage III-III estrogen receptor (ER)-negative and human
      epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative breast cancer. The presence of DTCs after
      completing treatment for breast cancer may be linked to recurrence of the disease. LDE225
      may eliminate DTCs in bone marrow and reduce the risk of recurrence.

             ductal or invasive lobular breast carcinoma, ER negative is defined as an Allred
             score of 0-2.  HER2 negative is defined as an IHC score of 0-1 and/or not-amplified
             by FISH testing.  Patients with ER negative, PR positive, and HER2 negative breast
             cancer are eligible.

          -  All surgery for breast cancer (as defined by surgical excision of the cancer with a
             negative margin or mastectomy) must be complete.

          -  Undergone axillary lymph node surgery (either sentinel lymph node biopsy or axillary
             lymph node dissection) per institutional standard.

          -  Completed all (neo) adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy as recommended by the
             treating physicians.

          -  Completed the most recent cancer therapy (surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy) no
             less than 3 and no more than 24 weeks prior to registration. Note: patients who
             received experimental neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy or surgical therapy (with the
             exception of Hh inhibitors) through participation in clinical trial are NOT excluded
             from this study as long as the other trial does not exclude patients from enrolling
             into an additional adjuvant clinical trial and enrolling into this trial will not
             compromise the endpoints (primary and secondary) of the primary clinical trial. In
             addition, patients must have completed the experimental therapy no less than 4 weeks
             or 5 half lives (whichever is longer) and no more than 24 weeks prior to
             registration.  For those patients who have enrolled into a
             neoadjuvant/adjuvant/surgical trial, all endpoints of these trials will be reviewed
             prior to consenting the patient for the LDE225 trial.

          -  Presence of bone marrow DTCs after the completion of all intended breast cancer
             therapy including surgery, (neo) adjuvant chemotherapy therapy, and radiation as
             indicated. Note: Bone marrow aspiration will be performed in consented patients to
             evaluate DTCs provided patients meet all eligibility criteria as described in this
             section.

          -  At least 18 years of age.

          -  ECOG performance status ≤ 1.

               -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) ≤ 2.5 x IULN

               -  Plasma creatine phosphokinase (CK) &lt; 1.5 x ULN

               -  Creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN OR Creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min/1.73 m2 for patients
                  with creatinine levels above institutional normal

          -  Able to swallow capsules.

          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test ≤ 7 days
             from date of registration.  Women of childbearing potential must agree to use dual
             forms of adequate contraception (barrier method of birth control, non-hormonal IUD or
             IUS, abstinence) prior to study entry duration of study participation and 6 months
             after final dose of study treatment.  Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she
             is pregnant while participating in this study, she must inform her treating physician
             immediately.

          -  Patient (or legally authorized representative if applicable) must be able to
             understand and willing to sign an IRB approved written informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence of distant metastasis present by CT scan, bone scan, or physical exam within
             one year prior to entry into the trial.

          -  Concurrent treatment with any other standard therapy (e.g. chemotherapy, targeted
             therapy or radiotherapy) or within 3 weeks of starting LDE225.

          -  Treatment with investigational anticancer agent within 4 weeks or 5 half-lives
             whichever is longer, of initializing treatments with LDE225.

          -  History of other malignancy ≤ 5 years previous with the exception of basal cell or
             squamous cell carcinoma of the skin which were treated with local resection only or
             carcinoma in situ of the cervix.

          -  Previous treatment with systemic LDE225 or with other Hh pathway inhibitors.

          -  Diagnosis of a neuromuscular disorder (e.g., inflammatory myopathies, muscular
             dystrophy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, spinal muscular atrophy) or on concomitant
             treatment with drugs that are recognized to cause rhabdomyolysis (such as HMG CoA
             inhibitors (statins), clofibrate and gemfibrozil) and that cannot be discontinued at
             least 2 weeks prior to starting LDE225 treatment.  If it is essential that the
             patient stays on a statin to control hyperlipidemia, only pravastatin may be used
             with extra caution.

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to LDE225 or other agents used in the study.

          -  Planning to embark on a new strenuous exercise regimen after initiation of study
             treatment.  Muscular activities, such as strenuous exercise, that can result in
             significant increases in plasma CK levels should be avoided while on LDE225
             treatment.

          -  Diagnosis of a medical condition that would lead to lack of physical integrity of the
             upper gastrointestinal tract or known malabsorption syndrome.

          -  Taking warfarin and Coumadin derivatives because of potential interactions with
             LDE225.

          -  Receiving treatment with medications known to be moderate or strong inhibitors or
             inducers of CYP3A4/5 or drugs metabolized by CYP2B6 or CYP2C9 that have narrow
             therapeutic indices and that cannot be discontinued before starting treatment with
             LDE225.  Medications that are strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors should be discontinued at
             least 7 days and strong CYP3A4/5 inducers at least 2 weeks prior to starting
             treatment with LDE225.

          -  Concurrent uncontrolled medical conditions that may interfere with participation in
             the study or potentially affect the interpretation of the study data.

          -  Impaired cardiac function or clinically significant heart disease, including any one
             of the following:

               -  Angina pectoris within 3 months

               -  Acute myocardial infarction within 3 months

               -  QTcF &gt; 450 msec for males and &gt; 470 msec for females on the screening ECG

               -  A past medication history of clinically significant ECG abnormalities or a
                  family history of prolonged QT-interval syndrome

               -  Other clinically significant heart disease (e.g., congestive heart failure,
                  uncontrolled hypertension, history of labile hypertension, or history of poor
                  compliance with an antihypertensive regimen)

          -  Pregnant and/or breastfeeding.  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because
             LDE225 is an Hh inhibitor with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient
             effects.  Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in
             nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with LDE225, breastfeeding
             should be discontinued if the mother is treated with LDE225.

          -  Known to be HIV-positive on combination antiretroviral therapy because of the
             potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with LDE225.  In addition, these patients
             are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive
             therapy.  Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients receiving combination
             antiretroviral therapy when indicated.
