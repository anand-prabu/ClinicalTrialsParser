  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During CPR bag-valve mask ventilation is difficult for basically skilled rescuers.
      Ventilation may be inefficient or with too high pressures result in stomach inflation and
      aspiration. Studies suggest that with a supraglottic airway device, such as the laryngeal
      tube, a basically skilled rescuer may ventilate more efficient and also safer. No
      prehospital study has been conducted comparing laryngeal tube and bag-valve mask ventilation
      during CPR. Thus, this study intends to compare ventilation with laryngeal tube and
      bag-valve mask performed by paramedics during CPR.

      performed by paramedics during CPR. This study may provide information if paramedics in an
      emergency should ventilate as they do traditionally with bag-valve mask ventilation or if
      they should ventilate with a laryngeal tube.

    <description>Does chest rise clearly during CPR? Thus efficient ventilation will be assessed during CPR, which may last on average between 20 and 60min. Therefore efficient ventilation will be assessed from starting CPR at 0min to 20min or rarely 60min or longer.</description>
