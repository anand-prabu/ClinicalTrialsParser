            "textblock": "Chronic rhinosinusitis, a common diagnosis in children, remains a poorly understood disease.\n       Adenoidectomy (surgery to take out the adenoid pads- infection fighting glands in the back\n      of the throat) is performed since the adenoid pad may trap germs that enter a child's body\n      and can get so swollen with bacteria that they become infected themselves. Functional\n      endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) and adenoidectomy are currently the most common surgeries\n      performed on children with this disease.  Another treatment is  adenoidectomy and irrigation\n      of the maxillary sinus without FESS.  New technology has emerged using a balloon catheter to\n      dilate (open) the sinus passage in addition to the adenoidectomy and irrigation.  This study\n      seeks to answer if children with chronic rhinosinusitis who undergo adenoidectomy with\n      balloon dilation of the maxillary sinus passage and irrigation experience improved quality\n      of life outcomes compared to children with chronic rhinosinusitis who undergo an\n      adenoidectomy with maxillary sinus irrigation without dilation of the sinus passage."
