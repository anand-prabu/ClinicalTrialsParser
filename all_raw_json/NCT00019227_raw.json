Treatment repeats every 6 weeks for a maximum of 9\n      courses in the absence of disease progression or circulating antibodies to humanized\n      anti-Tac.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of 90Y daclizumab until the maximum\n      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2\n      of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicities. Additional patients are treated at the\n      MTD.\n\n      Patients are followed at 4-6 weeks.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Up to 15 patients will be accrued for the phase I portion of the study. A\n      total of 30 patients will be accrued for the phase II portion of the study."
