In a large hospital in the West of Scotland, heart attack patients\n      will be invited to have at least two MRI scans and also continue with life-long follow-up.\n      The results from the MRI scans will be assessed with all of the other clinical information\n      obtained at the time of the heart attack and during follow-up. The results of our study\n      should provide new insights into heart attack injury and these results should help improve\n      how heart attack patients should be treated."

Recent advances in MRI have the potential to reveal new insights into the\n      evolution and functional significance of myocardial injury and repair.\n\n      Here, we will study at least 300 consecutive patients with acute ST elevation MI (STEMI) and\n      focus on oedema, scar and bleeding in the heart using MRI in patients managed by emergency\n      percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Cardiac MRI scans will be performed at 1.5 Tesla\n      (MAGNETOM, Siemens Healthcare). MRI will be used to assess initial heart function and\n      injury. Novel MRI methods will also be used to quantify the extent of myocardial jeopardy\n      representing the initial area-at-risk (AAR), and the nature of this injury (strain,\n      haemorrhage). The MRI methods will include T1 and T2 relaxometry (mapping). Secondly, we\n      will assess coronary artery disease severity by angiography and coronary artery function at\n      the time of the heart attack treatment using a pressure-sensitive coronary guidewire (St\n      Jude Medical). This wire can be used instead of the usual coronary wire and can provide\n      information on heart injury, which can be linked in turn to the MRI findings. All of this\n      information will be linked with health outcomes in the longer term.\n\n      We hypothesise that myocardial salvage, oedema, haemorrhage, and strain as revealed by MRI,\n      have functional and prognostic significance. In all patients MRI will be performed at\n      baseline (~day 2) and again at 6 months. In a subgroup of 30 patients, MRI will be performed\n      on days <12 hours, and days 2, 7-10 days and 6 months post-MI. A blood and urine sample and\n      quality of life will be obtained at baseline and at 6 months post-MI. Clinical outcomes\n      (e.g. rehospitalisation, death) will be assessed at 1 year and again up to 20 years by\n      electronic linkage through central National Health Service (NHS) and government health\n      records in order to determine the long-term prognostic significance of our initial\n      observations with angiography, MRI and the pressure wire."
