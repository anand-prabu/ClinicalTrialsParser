Combining calcitriol and zoledronate\n      may be an effective treatment for progressive prostate cancer.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combining calcitriol with zoledronate\n      in treating patients who have progressive prostate cancer."

The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 3\n      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year."
