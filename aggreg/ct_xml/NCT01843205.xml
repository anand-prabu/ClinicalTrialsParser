  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Methamphetamine use disorders are an unrelenting public health concern. Intensive research
      efforts have yielded behavioral interventions that reduce methamphetamine use, however,
      these interventions are not universally effective and treatment effects diminish over time.
      Development of a pharmacotherapy that enhances the efficacy of these interventions is a
      priority for the National Institute on Drug Abuse. This study proposes to determine the
      impact of buspirone maintenance on self-administration of methamphetamine. These preliminary
      data will be used to support further research developing buspirone as a pharmacotherapy for
      methamphetamine use disorders. The investigators hypothesize that buspirone will attenuate
      the reinforcing effects of methamphetamine.
