Evaluate the toxicity of this\n      combination at the MTD of paclitaxel in this patient population. III. Determine any\n      objective tumor response arising from this treatment in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of paclitaxel. Patients receive oral estramustine\n      daily on days 1-3 and paclitaxel IV over 1 hour on day 3 weekly for 6 weeks followed by 1\n      week of rest. Treatment continues for at least 2 courses in the absence of unacceptable\n      toxicity or disease progression. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of\n      paclitaxel until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the\n      dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicities.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A minimum of 18 patients will be accrued for this study within 18 months."
