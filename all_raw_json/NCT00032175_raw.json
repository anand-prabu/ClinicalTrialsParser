It is not yet known if gemcitabine is more effective with or\n      without capecitabine in treating pancreatic cancer.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of gemcitabine with or\n      without capecitabine in treating patients who have locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic\n      cancer."

Patients are stratified\n      according to disease stage (locally advanced vs metastatic) and performance status (0 and 1\n      vs 2). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15 and oral\n           capecitabine twice daily on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 6 courses in\n           the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, 36,\n           and 43 during the first course. After a 1-week rest period, patients receive\n           gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Subsequent courses repeat every 28\n           days for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, every 3 months for 1 year, and then annually\n      thereafter.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months.\n\n      Peer Reviewed and Funded or Endorsed by Cancer Research UK\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 508 patients (254 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this\n      study."
