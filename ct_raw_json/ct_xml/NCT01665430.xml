      This multicenter, open-label, single arm long term extension of study WA19926 will evaluate
      the safety and efficacy of RoActemra/Actemra (tocilizumab) in patients with early, moderate
      to severe rheumatoid arthritis who have completed the WA19926 core study. Eligible patients
      will receive RoActemra/Actemra 8 mg/kg intravenously every 4 weeks for up to 104 weeks.
