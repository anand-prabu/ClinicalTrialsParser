After completion of Part 1 an interim data review will\n      occur which will assess key comparability criteria to inform progression to Part 2 of the\n      study.\n\n      Part 2 of the study will involve single doses of GSK2862277 at a level predicted to be at or\n      close to therapeutic dose levels. Part 2 will investigate both intravenous and inhaled\n      routes of administration, in sequential manner, respectively. An interim data review will\n      also occur after completion of Part 2, where all data accumulated previously will be\n      assessed to examine appropriateness to progress to Part 3.\n\n      Part 3 of the study will involve 5 days of repeat dosing via both inhaled and intravenous\n      routes using the same dose administered in Part 2."
