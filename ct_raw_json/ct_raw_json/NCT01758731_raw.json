All patients will receive RT to a total dose of 69.3 Gy in 33 fractions over 6\u00bd weeks. Weekly C225 will be administered at 250 mg/m2 in combination with daily RT. Patients will be assigned to receive Olaparib (25, 50, 100 or 200 mg bid) in combination with RT and C225. Olaparib will be taken twice daily, beginning three days prior to first scheduled C225 infusion. A further dose level of 300mg or 400mg may be considered should the 200mg Olaparib dose be well tolerated in this C225/RT combination schedule."
