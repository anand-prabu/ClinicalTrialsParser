Patients\n      then receive fluorouracil IV over 46 hours on days 1-2. Treatment repeats every 21 days for\n      a maximum of 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, after 3 courses, and at treatment completion.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 39 patients will be accrued for this study."
