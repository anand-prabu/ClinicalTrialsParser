Smoking\n      cessation has positive effects on the miRNAs regulation, however, genomics has been little\n      explored. Smoking and aging induces changes miRNAs. Among the changes in airway epithelial\n      cells, miR-125 called attention because it is enrolled in the suppression of  ERBB7 (tirosin\n      kinase receptors), a codified sequence of the growth factor receptor (EGFR) frequently\n      expressed in cancer. The reduction of miR-125 expression may reduce cancer suppression\n      resulting in cancer development. Other miRNA changes can be observed, such as miR-218 that\n      were found in smokers airway epithelial cells as in MiR-15b that were found in lung tissue\n      of COPD smokers. These miRNAs participated in the signalling pathway of TGF-\u03b2 enrolled in\n      leukocyte migration and cell proliferation. The investigators hypothesize that smoking\n      cessation has a role in the regulation or reduction in the genetic changes smoking-induced.\n      The investigators will assess the subject genomic profile at the baseline, 6 months and 12\n      months after smoking cessation."
