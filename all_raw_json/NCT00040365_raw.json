            "textblock": "This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of a drug called amifostine in\n      reducing the bowel side effects of radiation treatment for prostate cancer. Amifostine is a\n      'radioprotector' medicine that to protects normal tissue from radiation damage. This study\n      will determine whether placing amifostine in the rectum during radiation treatment for\n      prostate cancer can decrease common side effects of treatment, including diarrhea, painful\n      bowel movements, bleeding, and gas.\n\n      Patients 18 years of age or older with prostate cancer may be eligible for this study.\n      Candidates will be screened with a medical history and physical examination, blood tests,\n      bone scan if a recent one is not available, and possibly computed tomography (CT) and\n      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the pelvis. They will also have a liquid retention\n      test, in which they are given an enema of 4 tablespoons of salt water that they must retain\n      for 20 minutes.\n\n      Participants will receive standard radiation therapy for prostate cancer-5 consecutive days\n      for 8 weeks-in the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Radiation Oncology Clinic. Amifostine\n      will be placed in the rectum by a mini-enema before each radiation treatment so that it\n      covers the lining of the rectum. To determine the side effects of the treatment, patients\n      will undergo a proctoscopic examination before beginning radiation therapy, two times during\n      therapy, and at each follow-up visit for 5 years after  treatment ends. This examination\n      involves inserting a proctoscope (a thin flexible tube with a light at the end) into the\n      rectum and taking pictures.\n\n      Patients will be followed in the clinic at visits scheduled 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, and\n      60 months after treatment for a physical examination and routine blood tests,  proctoscopic\n      examination, and review of bowel symptoms."

Amifostine is a radioprotector, an\n      agent that reduces tissue damage incurred by ionizing radiation.  It has been well studied\n      in humans and is approved for intravenous use.  Rectal administration results in a\n      preferential accumulation of Amifostine in the rectal mucosa, and neither free parent\n      compound nor free active metabolite have been detected in systemic circulation.  This trial\n      proposes to observe the rate of early and late bowel toxicity in a group of patients with\n      prostate cancer receiving standard high dose, 3D conformal external beam radiotherapy and\n      concurrent intra-rectal applications of Amifostine.  Primary measures of rectal toxicity\n      (RTOG radiation morbidity scoring) will also be compared with self-assessment measures of\n      quality of life, and rectal radiation dose as assessed by dose-volume histograms."
