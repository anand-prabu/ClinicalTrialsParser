These children are at high risk for zinc deficiency and environmental\n      enteropathy by their demographic characteristics.  Children will first have a quantitative\n      assessment of zinc homeostasis where each child is given 2 zinc stable isotopes, one by\n      mouth and another intravenously, which is followed by a stool and urine collection of 4\n      days.  Zinc isotopes are quantified in the feces and urine, and these values are used to\n      calculate the primary outcome, net zinc balance.  This is followed by an assessment of\n      environmental enteropathy quantitatively measured using the non-invasive site specific sugar\n      absorption test, where each child drinks 100 mL of a sugar solution and a urine collection\n      follows.  The quantities of non-metabolizable sugars are measured, and the ratio of two of\n      the sugars, lactulose and mannitol, is a measure of environmental enteropathy.  Then the\n      children will receive a dietary supplement, corn starch that has been modified to reduce its\n      dietary absorption, for 5 weeks, which they will add to their phala.  The RS is a standard\n      food product that has been used safely in many millions of people for several decades.\n      After taking this RS for 4 weeks both the zinc stable isotope test and the dual sugar\n      absorption test will be repeated on the children to see if they have improved.  These\n      results will offer preliminary data as to whether RS might be used effectively on a large\n      scale in the community to alleviate zinc deficiency and/or environmental enteropathy."
