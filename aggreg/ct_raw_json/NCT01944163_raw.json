            "textblock": "Rationale: Axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) is an inflammatory back pain disorder affecting\n      up to 24% of young chronic low back pain (CLBP) patients. For general practitioners (GPs) it\n      is difficult to distinguish axSpA patients in the large amount of CLBP patients. In previous\n      studies a referral rule for axSpA applicable in CLBP patients was developed and validated.\n      The next step is to investigate the impact of the referral rule in daily practice. This\n      impact analysis will test if the referral rule will be beneficial or harmful.\n\n      Objective: To evaluate the clinical impact of a referral rule in young patients presenting\n      at the general practitioners with chronic low back pain, who are at risk for axSpA, compared\n      to usual care.\n\n      Study design: A stratified prospective randomized clinical trial. Study population: Primary\n      care patients with chronic low back pain, aged 18-45 years.\n\n      Intervention (if applicable): GPs are randomized either to use or not to use the referral\n      rule. The referral rule consists out of four variables, a positive ASAS inflammatory back\n      pain questionnaire, a positive family history for spondyloarthritis, a good reaction to\n      NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) and back pain duration longer  than 5 years.\n      If at least two out of four variables are present a referral to the rheumatologist is\n      advised.\n\n      Main study parameters/endpoints: The primary outcome is a change in the Roland Morris\n      Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ) compared to baseline in the CLBP patients with or without\n      use of the referral model.\n\n      Secondary parameters: Quality of life measurements, cost-effectiveness, pain and fatigue and\n      referral to rheumatologist and diagnosis of axSpA.\n\n      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group\n      relatedness:\n\n      The burden and risks associated with participation are minimal. No medical intervention is\n      taken place. If the GP of the patients is randomized to the referral model, the patient is\n      checked for the risk of axial spondyloarthritis, by the non-invasive referral model. If the\n      referral model is positive a referral to the rheumatologist is advised. Is the GP is\n      randomized to the 'usual care' there is no difference in the treatment of low back pain than\n      nowadays. A GP is still allowed to treat the CLBP patients optimal and a referral to the\n      rheumatologist is allowed but not actively advised.\n\n      All participating CLBP patients are asked to fill several questionnaires at four different\n      time points, at baseline, after 12 months and after 24 months. In total there are 8\n      questionnaires and four separate questions. The questionnaire are designed to fill out by\n      the patient themselves. The total time to fill in the questionnaire is estimated to be 30\n      minutes.\n\n      The benefits of the study are:\n\n        -  For the CLBP patients, up to 24% of the back pain complaints are caused by axSpA, but\n           the GPs are not (yet) aware of this disease. When a CLBP patient is participating in\n           this study, the chance of having axSpA as cause for the back pain is investigated. This\n           a benefit for a CLBP patients since there is effective treatment for axSpA.\n\n        -  For the GP it is very difficult to distinguish an axSpA patients in the large amount of\n           CLBP patients. If it appears that the validated referral rule has an impact on CLBP and\n           GPs, the next step will be implementation of this referral model in daily practice and\n           it will become a helpful tool for the GP.\n\n        -  For the society, CLBP is a great socioeconomic burden for the society. When one of the\n           causes for CLBP, namely axSpA is diagnosed and treated in an earlier stage this will\n           lead to a decreased sick leave because of back pain and is therefore potentially\n           cost-effective."
