  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease that results in a chronic inflammatory
      disorder that may affect many synovial joints, and may cause serious disability. It has been
      confirmed that tripterygium extract has effects of anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressive and
      cartilage protection. This is a prospective randomized controlled study to evaluated the
      efficacy and safety of external application with compound tripterygium gel in treating of
      patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
