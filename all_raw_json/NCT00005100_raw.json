Compare growth hormone (GH) levels at baseline and after glucose suppression\n      measured with both a polyclonal radioimmunoassay and a highly sensitive immunoradiometric\n      assay (IRMA) in patients with acromegaly and normal volunteers.\n\n      II.  Measure the levels of IGF-I and its binding protein, IGFBP-3, in these cohorts.\n\n      III.  Determine any correlation between levels of IGF-I and IGFBP-3 and GH suppressibility\n      as assessed by sensitive IRMA.\n\n      IV.  Determine if patients who demonstrate biochemical features of mild GH excess are at\n      risk for progression to active disease."

Growth hormone is\n      measured at baseline and 60, 90, and 120 minutes after a 100 g glucose drink.  Serum glucose\n      is measured at baseline and at 2 hours post dextrose administration by the glucose\n      hexokinase method.\n\n      Clinical scores are determined for headache, perspiration, fatigue, joint pain, and acne.\n\n      Exams and tests may be repeated every 6 months for 2 years."
