Individuals with hearing loss and\n      poor speech discrimination often have little success with hearing aids because amplifying\n      sound improves audibility, but not clarity of the speech signal. The purpose of this study\n      is to determine the relative importance of the sensory cells of the inner ear and auditory\n      neurons on speech discrimination performance in quiet and in noise. This information may be\n      used as a predictor of hearing aid benefit. The investigators expect to find decreased\n      speech understanding ability resulting from both loss of sensory cells and the loss of\n      auditory neurons."
