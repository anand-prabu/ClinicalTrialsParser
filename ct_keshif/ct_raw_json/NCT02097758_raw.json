The investigators suggested optimal device\n      size using three-dimensional transesophageal echocardiographic image and our formula in\n      previous study.\n\n      Purpose: In this study, the investigators seek to predict the correct device size and\n      confirm the accuracy of the formula that we made before device closure in ASD patients."
