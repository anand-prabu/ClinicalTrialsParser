Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 dosing schedules.\n\n        -  Schedule 1 (closed to accrual as of 5/25/2009): Patients receive oral ABT-751 once\n           daily on days 1-7. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression\n           or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n        -  Schedule 2 (closed to accrual as of 5/25/2009): Patients receive oral ABT-751 once\n           daily on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression\n           or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      On each schedule, cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of ABT-751 until the\n      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at\n      which at least 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is\n      determined, up to 9 patients (a minimum of 3 patients age 11 and under and 3 patients age 12\n      to 18) are treated at the MTD.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 90 patients will be accrued for this study within 8 months."
