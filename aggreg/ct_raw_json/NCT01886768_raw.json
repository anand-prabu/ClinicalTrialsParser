Each patient will receive an anterior rhinoscopy to select the most patent meatus by a validated meatus scoring scale. The endoscope is preloaded with a 1.8 mm biopsy forceps to pick up a right-angled gauze strip. A preloaded biopsy forceps is protruded slowly into the middle meatus first under endoscope monitoring. The second gauze pledgetting procedure is performed two minutes after the first gauze pledgetting which serves to induce turbinate size reduction to both the INT and MNT. A gauze strip is at least brought onto the posterior end of the inferior or middle turbinate."

The investigators and in other studies have showed that nasal\n      pledgetting (or commonly termed nasal packing) is better than nasal spray in terms of\n      patient tolerance and visual capacity. Although pledgetting method to a selected meatus can\n      achieve better decongestion effect, epistaxis and nasal pain in some patients are still\n      frustrating to endoscopists.\n\n      The investigator has proposed a novel meatus scoring scale to evaluate nasal insertability\n      by anterior rhinoscopy using a transnasal endoscope. The investigator also suggest\n      endoscopic-guided gauze pledgetting can provide precise nasal anesthesia, thereby reducing\n      trauma/bleeding in the nasal cavity and increasing patient tolerance during transnasal\n      endoscopy. Endoscopic guidance to deliver a gauze strip can confirm delivering it to at\n      least the posterior end of a turbinate. We hypothesize that by using endoscopic-guided\n      method, gauze pledgetting to both the inferior nasal meatus (INM) and middle nasal meatus\n      (MNM) simultaneously is more tolerable than only gauze pledgetting to a single meatus."

            "textblock": "Nasal anesthesia is the rate-limiting step for a well tolerable unsedated transnasal\n      esophago-gastro-duodenoscopy (UT-EGD) procedure. The investigator has proposed that a simple\n      Endoscopic-Guided Gauze Pledgetting method (EGGP) is more tolerable than the \"blind\"\n      cotton-tippled applicator method to deliver a gauze strip for anesthetizing the nasal\n      cavity. The initial idea of EGGP is to anesthetize only one single selected meatus. To\n      compare patient tolerance, safety and adverse events between double pledget (DPNA, i.e. INM\n      and MNM) versus single pledget (SPNA, i.e. INM or MNM) methods of nasal anesthesia, the\n      investigator is going to conduct a prospective randomized-controlled trial. The rationale\n      for using double pledget is threefold: (1) the middle meatus is bounded by the INT and MNT;\n      (2) the inserting and exserting meatuses may be different; (3) erective spongy tissue is\n      mainly distributed in the inferior and middle turbinates and the nasal septum. Therefore,\n      the primary objective of this study is to evaluate whether DPNA is more tolerable and safer\n      than DPNA before UT-EGD."
