A safe dose of\n      topotecan that can be recommended for intrathecal administration in subsequent phase II\n      studies will be established in a limited dosage escalation schedule.  The CSF\n      pharmacokinetics of intrathecal topotecan will also be studied.  Topotecan will be\n      administered intrathecally on a bi-weekly basis for four to six weeks, followed by weekly\n      administration for 1 month, twice monthly administration for four months and then monthly IT\n      administration."
