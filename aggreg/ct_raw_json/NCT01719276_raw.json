The primary clinical outcomes will be pain,\n      assessed with the numerical pain scale and McGill Pain Questionnaire, and disability\n      assessed with Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire. Secondary outcomes will be measured\n      with Global Perceived Effect, quality of life, return to work, physical activity, functional\n      capacity and strength of the lower limbs. The program lasts for 6 weeks, and sessions happen\n      twice a week, with duration of one hour each. Evaluations will be performed\n      before(baseline), after (6weeks) and with a follow-up 3 and 6 months after treatment. Data\n      will be collected by a blinded examiner who also had made the allocation of patients to\n      groups. Significance level is established at 5%."
