      This phase II trial studies how well fluorine F 18 sodium fluoride positron emission
      tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) and whole body and axial magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI) works in finding metastases in patients with recurrent prostate cancer.
      Diagnostic procedures, such as fluorine F 18 sodium fluoride PET/CT and whole body and axial
      MRI, may help find and diagnose metastatic prostate cancer. It is not yet known whether
      standard CT and bone scan is more effective than fluorine F 18 sodium fluoride PET/CT and
      whole body and axial MRI in diagnosing metastatic prostate cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the proportion of patients with biochemically-recurrent prostate cancer (PC)
      in whom imaging with whole body (WB)/axial MRI and F-18 NaF (fluorine F 18 sodium fluoride)
      PET/CT results in detection of metastatic disease not visualized on CT scan and bone scan.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the percent of eligible patients with negative, indeterminate and positive CT
      scan/bone scan and targeted X-rays if done.

      II. To determine the proportion of patients with biochemically-recurrent PC in whom
      recurrence in the prostate bed can be visualized using MRI in the absence of detection using
      CT scan.

      III. To correlate the presence of metastatic disease detected using WB/axial MRI and/or F-18
      NaF PET/CT with the 6-year predicted probability of progression-free survival based on the
      Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center salvage radiation therapy (RT) PC nomogram, and with
      prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level at baseline.

      IV. To compare the role of axial MRI of the spine to WB/axial MRI with respect to their
      ability to identify sites of disease.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients first undergo CT scan and bone scan. Patients with negative results from the CT and
      bone scans then undergo WB MRI scan using diffusion-weighted MRI, axial MRI scan using
      3-Tesla MRI, and fluorine F 18 sodium fluoride PET/CT scan.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 4-6 months and periodically until
      week 52.
