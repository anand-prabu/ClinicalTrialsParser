The patients will treated with the\n      Haas appliance. In both the groups the periodontal clinical indices (plaque index, PI;\n      papillary bleeding index, PBI; probing pocket depth, PPD) will collected three times during\n      the treatment (before, during and at the end).  All measurements will performed by the same\n      examiner.\n\n      A descriptive statistical analysis will conducted. The paired samples Student's T test will\n      used to evaluate the intra-group differences between t1 and t2.  The unpaired samples\n      Student's T test will used to evaluate between groups differences at t1 and t2.  The\n      significance level will set at 95%."
