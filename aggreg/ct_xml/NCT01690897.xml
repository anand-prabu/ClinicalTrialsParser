    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test and determine the efficacy of an 8-session
      mindfulness-based psychoeducational intervention for women with sexual interest/ desire
      concerns when compared to a wait-list control condition.

      HYPOTHESES:

        1. Compared to baseline, the MIND group will have significantly greater improvements in
           self-report measures of: (a) subjective sexual arousal; (b) perception of genital
           arousal; (c) sexual desire; (e) sexual distress; (f) depressive symptoms; (g)
           mindfulness, and (h) genital sexual response as measured by a vaginal
           photoplethysmograph.

        2. We hypothesize no significant change in any of the endpoints listed in #1 from the
           first to the second wait-list (pre-treatment) conditions.

        3. We are interested in concordance between genital and subjective sexual arousal as
           another endpoint. It is unknown if participation in the MIND group will significantly
           increase concordance

    <description>Subjects will indicate their levels of subjective arousal while undergoing arousal testing. A device manufactured for the UBC Sexual Health Lab called the &quot;arousometer&quot;- a computer mouse mounted on a metal track divided into 10 equally spaced intervals corresponding to &quot;sexually turned off&quot; (-2) to &quot;the most sexually aroused you have ever been or could imagine being&quot; (7). This device allows continuous self-report measurement of subjective sexual arousal while viewing the erotic films.</description>

    <description>Physiological sexual arousal will be measured with a Vaginal Photoplethysmograph (VPP) during exposure to erotic films. The VPP measures vaginal pulse amplitude (VPA) which has been found to be a sensitive and specific measure of genital arousal (Laan &amp; Everaerd, 1995).</description>
