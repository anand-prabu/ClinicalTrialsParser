            "textblock": "The objectives of the study are to allow the physician to use the commercially available\n      Magellan Robotic System and Magellan Robotic Catheters to navigate to the treatment targets\n      in the peripheral vasculature to:\n\n        -  Determine the number of endovascular procedures consecutively performed with the\n           Magellan Robotic System to navigate to treatment targets in the peripheral vasculature\n           and,\n\n             -  Achieve stable and efficient system preparation and set-up times.\n\n             -  Achieve stable and efficient navigation and cannulation times of target vessels\n                during endovascular procedures.\n\n             -  Achieve stable and efficient placement of therapeutic equipment used to perform\n                endovascular procedures (guide wires, balloons, stents, etc.).\n\n             -  Achieve stable and reduced fluoroscopy time during the endovascular procedures.\n\n        -  Determine the number of cases required to reach a \"steady state,\" reduction or\n           predictable time in conducting peripheral interventional procedures using descriptive\n           (means, ranges) statistics to analyze the data.\n\n      Participation in this registry is open to all facilities with an installed commercially\n      available Magellan Robotic System over the next 5 years.  Institutional Review Board\n      (IRB)/Ethics Committee (EC) notification will be provided or approval obtained, as required\n      at each participating site.  For sites at which only IRB/EC notification is the requirement\n      for participation, written confirmation of IRB/EC receipt of the notification will be\n      required and submitted to Hansen Medical prior to patient consent.  Approval notification\n      shall also be submitted to Hansen Medical prior to patient consent.\n\n      Design\n\n      This is a prospective and retrospective, multi-center, single arm, non-blinded, sequentially\n      enrolling data collection activity (for which Hansen Medical is providing funding).  Only\n      patients scheduled to undergo endovascular procedures using the System will be approached\n      for enrollment.  Written, informed consent will be obtained (using the current and approved\n      informed consent form) from all subjects prior to any registry-related activities being\n      performed.  In view of patients having been treated using the Magellan Robotic System while\n      this protocol was undergoing preparation, retrospective procedural data (and follow-up data\n      if available) also may be collected from patients who provide written, informed consent.  Up\n      to 500 patients may be enrolled.\n\n      Methods\n\n      Registry procedures will be conducted in accordance with the labeled indication for use of\n      the Magellan\u2122 Robotic System.\n\n      Prior to the physician participating in the registry and prior to subject enrollment, all\n      participating physicians will be required to complete Hansen Medical's Magellan Robotic\n      System training and become certified in its use with an inanimate anatomical model.\n      Additionally, it is recommended that each physician practice 'driving' the System to\n      selected vessel targets of the inanimate model for a period of 5 hours, broken up into 30-60\n      minute sessions per the physician's schedule convenience.  Finally, the physician possesses\n      the endovascular interventional experience to enroll and treat subjects, as described in\n      this protocol.\n\n      Participating registry sites must have a commercially available Magellan Robotic System for\n      the treatment of patients.\n\n      Data Management\n\n      Participating sites will be assigned a specific site numeric identification code by the\n      registry sponsor.\n\n      Case data for submission to the ROVER Registry will not include patient identifiers.\n      However, patient participants will be assigned a registry identification code and sites will\n      be asked to maintain a \"key\" log (linking the registry identification code to the specific\n      patient identifying information) to facilitate patient identification, in the event it is\n      deemed necessary.  The registry sponsor will be blinded to the site \"key\" log.\n\n      The information collected into the registry will be data related to the procedure in which\n      the Magellan System was used or planned to be used and may include patient follow-up data,\n      minimally 14 days(\u00b1 5 days)post procedure but also may include 30 day follow-up to assess\n      for the resolution of a procedural or post procedure adverse event.\n\n      The study data will be submitted to a third-party host of the website (with copies submitted\n      to the registry sponsor) after the physician confirms by signature the authenticity and\n      accuracy of the data.  The data will be entered into the registry database by the\n      third-party website host, employing quality measures to ensure accurate data entry.  The\n      third-party website host will assume the responsibility of ensuring the authenticity,\n      integrity, and confidentiality of the registry database, including database access and time\n      stamped audit trails.\n\n      The database will be a repository for the collected registry data and the data will be made\n      available (in extractable format) to the physician participants.  Routine registry reports\n      will be generated on a schedule deemed appropriate and based on the volume and frequency of\n      data entered.  The reports will be reviewed by the registry sponsor's Clinical Affairs\n      Department to ensure that critical data is being reported and to review any data that does\n      not appear reasonable or appears erroneous.  Sites may be contacted to provide key data that\n      was not originally submitted for the respective case(s) and/or to clarify discrepancies.\n\n      In the event angiographic images are collected for submission to the registry, the images\n      will be de-identified.\n\n      Adverse Events\n\n      The data submitted will be reviewed on a regular basis for safety issues and complaints.\n      Safety issues will be communicated to Hansen Medical's Quality Affairs (QA) Department to\n      ensure adequate post market surveillance of the device.  Complaints will be forwarded to the\n      individuals responsible for Product Complaints within Hansen Medical's Quality Assurance\n      Department.\n\n      Adverse events and/or complaints deemed reportable will be submitted to the appropriate\n      regulatory agency/agencies by Hansen Medical, Inc."
