Effect of treatment is\n      primary seen in patients harboring a mutation in the EGFR. However, 10-15% of patients does\n      not harbor a mutation but respond as well. Identifying these patients is a problem and\n      methods are lacking.\n\n      Studies have shown that an early 18F FDG-PET might can predict response and outcome in these\n      patients, but further studies are needed to confirm these findings."
