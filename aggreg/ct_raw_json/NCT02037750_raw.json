The proposed LINKS intervention\n      marries the goals of child welfare and educational systems. The aims are: a) to determine\n      the effectiveness of the LINKS intervention on key behavioral health and school adjustment\n      outcomes, b) to examine mechanisms of action; specifically the mediating effects of\n      placement failure on outcomes, c)  to examine the moderating role of fidelity on outcomes,\n      and d) to examine cost effectiveness and cost avoidance of LINKS."

Missed sessions will be \"made up\" with an in-person visit to the foster/kin home during the week of the original session. In addition, youth in the intervention condition will receive individual skill building sessions from a Life Skills Coach to increase their competency at goal setting, refusal skills, and peer relations.",
