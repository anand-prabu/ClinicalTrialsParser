It is not yet known which chlorambucil regimen is more\n      effective in treating advanced chronic lymphocytic leukemia.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to determine the effectiveness of different regimens of\n      chlorambucil in treating patients who have advanced chronic lymphocytic leukemia."

Patients are stratified according to\n      participating center, time to complete response (before 12 weeks vs after 12 weeks vs\n      partial response), and cytopenia at diagnosis (Binet stage A+B vs C).\n\n      All patients receive induction therapy comprising high-dose oral chlorambucil daily.\n      Treatment continues until achievement of complete response or a maximum of 24 weeks in the\n      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Patients who respond to induction therapy are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms for\n      maintenance therapy.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive low-dose oral chlorambucil twice a week. Therapy continues for\n           up to 5 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. If\n           disease progression occurs, then patients may proceed to salvage therapy.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive no maintenance therapy. If disease progresses, patients\n           receive induction therapy again. If disease does not respond to re-induction therapy,\n           then patients may proceed to salvage therapy.\n\n        -  Salvage therapy: Patients with progressive disease during maintenance therapy receive\n           fludarabine IV daily and cyclophosphamide IV daily on days 1-3. Treatment repeats every\n           4 weeks for 3-6 courses.\n\n      Patients are followed monthly for 3 months, every 2 months for 6 months, and then every 3\n      months thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 470 patients will be accrued for this study within 4.7\n      years."
