The interval width, representing a measure of precision, is 31%.  The tumor biological features that will be assessed include genetic analyses performed for commonly mutated genes in kidney cancer (VHL, PBRM1, SETD2, HIF1, UTX, MLL2) and protein expression analyses performed on HIF1 and HIF2 protein expression using standard immunohistochemistry.  These genetic and protein expression analyses will be performed on tissue samples collected within four weeks of imaging from tissue removed via nephrectomy.",
