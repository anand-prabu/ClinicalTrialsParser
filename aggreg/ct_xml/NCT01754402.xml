      This study is designed as a phase I-II, open label, dose finding study.

      Study treatment will be as follows, in 28 day cycles:

        -  Pomalidomide: once daily orally (PO) dosing on days 1-21, every 28 days

        -  Bendamustine: once intravenously (IV) dosing on day 1, every 28 days

        -  Dexamethasone: weekly PO or IV dosing on days 1, 8, 15, and 22.

      After completing 6 cycles of treatment, dexamethasone will be decreased to 20mg. After
      completing 12 cycles of treatment, patients will proceed to the maintenance phase of the
      study. Patients will receive Pomalidomide 4 milligrams (mg) on day 1-21, every 28 days and
      dexamethasone 20 mg on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 every 28 days until time of progression.

If dose limiting toxicity (DLT) is observed in 2 or more of the six patients at the same dosing level while DLT is observed in only 1 or none of the 6 patients at the dosing level immediately below it, then the lower dosing level will be defined as the maximum tolerated dose (MTD).
