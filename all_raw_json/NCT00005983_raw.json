Patients are stratified according to prior\n      systemic hormonal therapy (chemotherapy with or without hormonal therapy vs hormonal therapy\n      alone), prior taxane exposure (yes vs no), and duration of chemotherapy (no chemotherapy vs\n      less than 3 months vs 3-5 months vs 6 months or more). Patients are randomized to one of two\n      treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients undergo radiotherapy 5 days a week for 5 weeks.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients are observed for disease progression. Patients are followed every 6\n           months for 2 years and then annually for 15 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 2,500 patients (1,250 per treatment arm) will be accrued for\n      this study within 5 years."
