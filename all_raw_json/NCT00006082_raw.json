Patients are stratified according to disease status\n      (sensitive vs refractory).\n\n      Patients receive oral nitrocamptothecin daily for 5 consecutive days each week for 3 weeks.\n      Treatment continues every 3 weeks for a minimum of 2 courses in the absence of disease\n      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve stable disease (SD) receive up to\n      4 additional courses past SD. Patients who achieve partial response (PR) or complete\n      response (CR) receive a minimum of 2 additional courses past CR or PR.\n\n      Patients are followed every 6 weeks until disease progression or initiation of another\n      antitumor treatment.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-25 patients will be accrued for the sensitive disease\n      stratum and a total of 19-24 patients will be accrued for the refractory disease stratum"
