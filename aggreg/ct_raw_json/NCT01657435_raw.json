The inserts secure to DePuy's Pinnacle acetabular shells by means of an interlocking mechanical taper. The Pinnacle acetabular shell is a hemispherical type acetabulum replacement prosthesis, is available in a range of outer diameter (OD) sizes, and is used with a 28mm femoral head. Pinnacle 100 shells will be used in this study. The BIOLOX\u00ae delta ceramic femoral head components are manufactured from the same ceramic material as the acetabular bearing insert components. The femoral head is secured to the femoral stem component with an interlocking taper."

This is a two-phased study consisting of a clinical follow-up\n      phase and a clinical outcomes phase.\n\n      In Phase One (0-5 years), diagnostic, demographic and operative information will be gathered\n      for each subject enrolled in this study. In addition, Harris Hip Evaluations, subjective\n      evaluations and radiographs will be completed annually.\n\n      In Phase Two (6 - 10 years), a subjective outcomes questionnaire and a SF-12 Health Survey\n      will be mailed to subjects annually."
