    <textblock>
      This Phase II study is conducted to assess the safety and efficacy of CPI-613 in patients
      with advanced and/or metastatic solid tumors for whom there there is no available therapy to
      provide clinical benefit or for those who have refused further standard therapy.  The
      primary outcome measure is Overall Survival (OS).  The secondary outcome measures are:
      Response Rate (RR), Progression-Free Survival (PFS), and safety.

    <description>This arm is for patients that have failed, or are not eligible for, all available therapies. CPI-613 drug product, provided in concentrated form at 50 mg/mL, must be diluted with D5W prior to administration.  CPI-613 is to be infused intravenously (IV) via a central venous catheter.  CPI-613 will be given 2x weekly, administered on Days 1 and 4 of each of the 3 treatment weeks, followed by a week of rest. The dose of CPI-613 will be 3,000 mg/m2 infused IV over 2 hours (this is the maximum tolerated dosing [MTD]), via a central venous catheter with D5W running at a rate of about 125-150 mL/hr.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have advanced and/or metastatic, histologically or cytologically
             documented solid tumors, for whom there is no available therapy shown to provide
             clinical benefit or for those who have refused further standard therapy

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status being 0-2

          -  Expected survival &gt;3 months

          -  18 years of age or older of both genders

          -  Women of child-bearing potential (i.e., women who are pre-menopausal or not
             surgically sterile) must use accepted contraceptive methods (abstinence, intrauterine
             device [IUD], oral contraceptive or double barrier device) during the study, and must
             have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 1 week prior to treatment
             initiation. (Note: Pregnant patients are excluded because the effects of CPI-613 on a
             fetus are unknown.)

          -  Fertile men must practice effective contraceptive methods during the study, unless
             documentation of infertility exists

          -  Mentally competent, with an ability to understand and willingness to sign the
             informed consent form

          -  No radiotherapy, treatment with cytotoxic agents (except CPI-613), or treatment with
             biologic agents within 3 weeks prior to treatment with CPI-613. At least 2 weeks must
             have elapsed from any prior surgery or hormonal therapy. Patients must have fully
             recovered from the acute toxicities of any prior treatment with any anti-cancer
             drugs, radiotherapy or other anti-cancer modalities (returned to baseline status as
             noted before most recent treatment). Patients with persisting, stable chronic
             toxicities from prior treatment ≤Grade 1 are eligible, but must be documented as
             such.

          -  Laboratory values ≤2 weeks must be:

               -  Adequate hematologic (white blood cell [WBC] ≥3500 cells/mm3 or ≥3.5 bil/L;
                  platelet count ≥150,000 cells/mm3 or ≥150 bil/L; absolute neutrophil count [ANC]
                  ≥1500 cells/mm3 or ≥1.5 bil/L; and hemoglobin (Hgb) ≥9 g/dL or ≥90 g/L).

               -  Adequate hepatic function (aspartate aminotransferase [AST/SGOT] ≤3x upper
                  normal limit [UNL], alanine aminotransferase [ALT/SGPT] ≤3x UNL (≤5x UNL if
                  liver metastases present), bilirubin ≤1.5x UNL).

               -  Adequate renal function (serum creatinine ≤2.0 mg/dL or 177 μmol/L, and blood
                  urea nitrogen [BUN] ≤25 mg/dL).

               -  Adequate coagulation (&quot;International Normalized Ratio or INR must be ≤1.5&quot;)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Serious medical illness, such as significant cardiac disease (e.g. symptomatic
             congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, myocardial infarction within the
             past 6 months, uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia, or New York Heart Association Class
             III or IV), or severe debilitating pulmonary disease, that would potentially increase
             patients' risk for toxicity.

          -  Any active uncontrolled bleeding or patients with a bleeding diathesis (e.g., active
             peptic ulcer disease)

          -  Patients with active central nervous system (CNS) or epidural tumor

          -  Pregnant women, or women of child-bearing potential not using reliable means of
             contraception (because the teratogenic potential of CPI-613 is unknown)

          -  Lactating females (Note: Lactating females are excluded because the effects of
             CPI-613 on a nursing child are unknown)

          -  Fertile men unwilling to practice contraceptive methods during the study period

          -  Life expectancy less than 3 months

          -  Unwilling or unable to follow protocol requirements

          -  Dyspnea with minimal to moderate exertion, or patients with pleural, pericardial, or
             peritoneal effusions

          -  Active heart disease including but not limited to symptomatic congestive heart
             failure, symptomatic coronary artery disease, symptomatic angina pectoris,
             symptomatic myocardial infarction, arrhythmias requiring medication, or symptomatic
             congestive heart failure.

          -  A marked baseline prolongation of QT/QTc interval (e.g., repeated exhibition of a QTc
             interval &gt;470 ms.); a history of additional risk factors for torsade de pointes
             (e.g., heart failure, hypokalemia, family history of Long QT Syndrome).

          -  Requirement for immediate palliative treatment of any kind including surgery

          -  Any condition or abnormality which may, in the opinion of the investigator,
             compromise the safety of patients

          -  Albumin &lt;2.5 g/dL or &lt;25 g/L

          -  Evidence of active infection, or serious infection, with the past month

          -  Patients with known HIV infection. (Note: Patients with known HIV infection are
             excluded because patients with an immune deficiency are at increased risk of lethal
             infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy, and because there may be
             unknown or dangerous drug interactions between CPI-613 and anti-retroviral agents
             used to treat HIV infections.)

          -  Patients receiving any other standard or investigational treatment for their cancer,
             or any other investigational agent for any indication within the past 3 weeks prior
             to initiation of CPI-613 treatment.

          -  Patients who have received immunotherapy of any type within the past 4 weeks prior to
             initiation of CPI-613 treatment

          -  Patients that have received a chemotherapy regimen with stem cell support in the
             previous 6 months

          -  Troponin I above institution limit of normal
