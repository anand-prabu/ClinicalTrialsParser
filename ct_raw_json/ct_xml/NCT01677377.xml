    <textblock>
      This will be an open-label, Phase 2A, multiple ascending dose study in 1 to 3 sites,
      designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and PK profile of multiple subcutaneous
      injections of 60mg, 90mg, and 120mg doses of risperidone in the RBP-7000 formulation, in
      subjects with clinically-stable schizophrenia who are on a once daily stable dose of 2mg,
      3mg, or 4mg of oral risperidone

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and female

                  for acute exacerbations within 3 months of screening and screening total PANSS
                  score &lt; 60

          -  Subjects who have given written informed consent
