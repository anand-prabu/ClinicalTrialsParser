  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      EZ Holdco Inc. has developed two devices for the measurement of gastric content pH.  The
      devices, EZ-NG and EZ-pH, rapidly check gastric pH by aspirating gastric contents into the
      device through a nasogastric (NG) tube and causing a color change in the device.  The color
      change is then compared to the reference indicator on the device to determine a pH value of
      the aspirate.  Currently there is no bedside rapid way to check gastric pH that protects the
      clinician from being exposed to the aspirate.

        1. Primary Objective To assess the accuracy of the pH measurement of gastric fluid on the
           devices by comparing the reading on the 2 devices to a standard clinically approved pH
           probe.

        2. Secondary Objective To determine what percentage of time the EZ-NG - RightSpot pH
           indicator could have been used to determine proper placement of the NG tube when
           initially placed.
