      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of abiraterone acetate in
      male Filipino patients with advanced metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC)
      who have received prior chemotherapy containing a taxane.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label (identity of assigned study drug will be known), observational study
      to evaluate the safety and efficacy of abiraterone acetate in male Filipino patients with
      advanced metastatic CRPC who have received prior chemotherapy containing a taxane.
      Approximately 50 patients will be enrolled. Abiraterone acetate will be administered
      according to the approved product insert with a low-dose glucocorticoid (prednisone or
      prednisolone). Patient assessments will be based on the accepted clinical practice in the
      Philippines. Patients will be monitored for 40 weeks.

          -  Received at least 1 but not more than 2 cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens for
             metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) (at least 1 regimen must have
             contained a taxane such as docetaxel; if a chemotherapy regimen containing a taxane
             is used more than once, this will be considered as 1 regimen)

          -  Laboratory values within protocol -defined parameters

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Serious or uncontrolled co-existent non-malignant disease, including active and
             uncontrolled infection

          -  Abnormal liver function

          -  Uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure &gt;=160 mmHg or diastolic blood
             pressure &gt;=95 mmHg)

          -  Active or symptomatic viral hepatitis or chronic liver disease

          -  History of pituitary or adrenal dysfunction

             ejection fraction of &lt;50% at baseline

          -  Known brain metastasis

          -  History of gastrointestinal disorders (medical disorders or extensive surgery) that
             may interfere with the absorption of the study drug

             to a NCI-CTCAE (Version 4.0) Grade of &lt;=1

          -  Prior systemic treatment with an azole drug (eg, fluconazole, itraconazole,
             ketoconazole) within 4 weeks of Cycle 1, Day 1

          -  Condition or situation which, in the investigator's opinion, may put the patient at
             significant risk, may confound the study results, or may interfere significantly with
             patient's participation in the study

          -  Participation in an investigational drug trial within 30 days prior to selection

          -  Known hypersensitivity to abiraterone acetate, or to any of the components in the
