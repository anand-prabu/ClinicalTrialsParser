The aim of this randomized study is to compare the effectiveness of open\n      technique to laparoscopic technique for the treatment of Sportsman\u00b4s hernia. The hypothesis\n      is that laparoscopic technique is less painfull than open surgery for repair of sportsman's\n      hernia."

Open hernia repair with or without mesh or laparoscopic techniques with mesh\n      have been advocated in the treatment of sportsman's hernia and associated athletic pubalgia.\n      The results of the operative treatment from single centers are reported to be good to\n      excellent in between 70 - 90% of patients with the most promising results reported using an\n      open minimal repair (OMR) technique. There are no randomized trials comparing open versus\n      laparoscopic techniques regarding time for recovery and relief of pain. The aim of this\n      randomized study is to compare the effectiveness of OMR technique in local or spinal\n      anesthesia to endoscopic Total ExtraPeritoneal (TEP) technique in general anesthesia for the\n      treatment of Sportsman\u00b4s hernia/athletic pubalgia. The primary endpoint is patient being\n      free from intractable groin pain during sports activity or daily work four weeks after\n      surgery."
