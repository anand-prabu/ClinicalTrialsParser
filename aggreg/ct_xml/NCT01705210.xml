  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The exact neuronal mechanism underlying the cognitive decline associated with diabetes
      mellitus type 2 (DM2) still remains to be elucidated. Multi-parametric functional MRI can
      potentially provide functional, micro-structural, micro-vascular, and metabolic information
      on the affected brain at an earlier stage than does conventional structural MRI. The overall
      aim of the current proposal is to obtain a better understanding in the neuronal mechanisms
      that underlie cognitive decline in DM2 and the putative prediabetic condition the metabolic
      syndrome (MetS).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2) is a common chronic metabolic disorder that affects 4.1% of
      the Dutch population. In addition to vascular disease, DM2 is associated with structural
      brain changes visible on MRI, accelerated cognitive decline, and dementia in older
      individuals. The exact pathophysiological mechanisms underlying cognitive decrements in DM2
      still remain to be elucidated. The 'metabolic syndrome' (MetS), defined as a cluster of
      cardiovascular risk factors (including obesity, hypertension, and dyslipidemia) is often
      considered a prediabetic condition. Individuals with MetS display similar cognitive
      decrements as do DM2 patients, but do not share the severity of brain injury. It has been
      indicated that in prediabetic MetS, cognitive problems precede structural brain changes, and
      that MetS and DM2 affect the brain through a shared mechanism in which vascular co-morbidity
      is essential.

      The primary objectives are defined according to a hierarchical design: i) to tailor and
      apply multi-parametric, functional MRI techniques to identify cerebral abnormalities
      (cerebral biomarkers) in DM2 and MetS; ii) to investigate which cerebral biomarkers are
      shared and differ between DM2 and MetS; iii) to assess whether these cerebral biomarkers are
      associated with cognitive decrements.
