First, the use of dacomitinib, an irreversible\n      pan-ErB kinase inhibitor, is to improve the duration of response seen by reversible, EGFR\n      only inhibitors. Inhibition of the multiple ErB kinases may interfere with receptor\n      cross-talk as a method of developing resistance; indeed, patients who have failed erlotinib\n      treatment for systemic disease have seen responses to dacomitinib. The second rationale is\n      to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of the penetration of dacomitinib into the CSF to determine\n      if adequate drug levels reach the CNS, and determine if the current dosing regimen is\n      appropriate. The third rationale is to determine if specific molecular phenotypes\n      preferentially respond to dacomitinib. As part of this study, serum and cerebrospinal fluid\n      will be collected and analyzed both for drug levels and for molecular markers to key\n      elements of the ErB signaling cascade. The objective of the marker analysis to identify a\n      distinct molecular phenotype that may preferentially respond to targeted drug therapy in the\n      future."
