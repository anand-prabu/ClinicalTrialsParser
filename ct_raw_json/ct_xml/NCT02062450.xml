      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the performance and reliability of  Tornier
      &quot;Dual Mobility Cup&quot; used during primary total hip replacement or hip replacement revision
      surgery at least 24 months post-insertion.

    <description>The primary safety criterion (dislocation rate) was assessed on an exhaustive and consecutive series of patients receiving a Tornier &quot;Dual Mobility&quot; cup between September 2010 and December 2011 in the 5 sites taking part in the study. Analysis was performed on patients who were available for the 2-year follow-up visit or at least for a phone contact within this time frame.</description>

        The global cohort: All the patients who received a Tornier Dual Mobility acetabular cup
        between October 2010 and October 2011 and who we were able to be contacted by phone.

        &quot;Primary replacement&quot; group: All the patients who received a Tornier Dual Mobility
        acetabular cup between October 2010 and October 2011 for primary hip replacement and who
        were seen for their follow-up visit at 2 years post-procedure.

        &quot;Revision&quot; group: All patients who received a Tornier Dual Mobility acetabular cup between
        October 2010 and October 2011 for revision surgery and who were seen for their follow-up
        visit at 2 years post-procedure.

        All the performance criteria were analysed for the patients in the &quot;Primary replacement&quot;
        and &quot;Revision&quot; groups
