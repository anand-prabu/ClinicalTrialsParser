Factors that contribute to sleep disturbances during\n      hospitalization include environmental, physiological, and psychological factors. Although\n      sleep interventions exist for healthy children in the community, interventions aimed at\n      hospitalized children need to be developed and piloted with rigorous evaluative methods. The\n      primary purpose of this study is to examine the feasibility and acceptability of the RELAX\n      TO SLEEP program on hospitalized children. Although this study is a pilot study, comparisons\n      will be made to examine sleep outcomes between the intervention group and the control group\n      including: total nocturnal (19h30-07h29), number of nighttime awakenings, longest stretch of\n      nocturnal sleep, and total daytime (07h30-19h29) sleep. Other comparisons include anxiety\n      levels and the development of post-hospital maladaptive behaviours."

Second, the educational booklet provides sleep hygiene info. The second component consists of of good sleep habits such as having a regular sleep-wake schedule, avoiding caffeine intake prior to sleep, avoiding stimulating activities near nighttime sleep, avoidance of naps during the day, ensuring that the child is exposed to natural light during the day, providing the child with opportunities to socialize during the day.
