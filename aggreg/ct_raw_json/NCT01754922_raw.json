Studies have reported poor air quality, but very\n      little is known about the effect that exposure to this polluted air may have on Veterans'\n      short- and long-term health. Investigators will determine whether deployment-related\n      exposures have affected respiratory and nervous system function in these Veterans - data\n      that may then be used to guide rehabilitation. Ultimately, the investigators' long-term goal\n      is to prevent the development of chronic respiratory conditions in this group of OEF/OIF/OND\n      Veterans."

            "textblock": "Evidence is clear that Veterans deployed to Operations Enduring and Iraqi Freedom and\n      Operation New Dawn (OEF/OIF/OND) have been exposed to high levels of particulate matter (PM)\n      that exceeded environmental, occupational and military exposure guidelines. PM exposure is\n      acknowledged as a risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and can increase\n      the risk of and exacerbate airway disease. The reviewed epidemiology indicates a high\n      prevalence of newly reported respiratory symptoms in OEF/OIF/OND Veterans that has\n      significantly affected their deployment duties, including their physical exertion\n      capability. Despite these retrospective data and limited air sampling reports, prospective\n      studies are lacking. This pilot study will evaluate cardiorespiratory and autonomic function\n      in OEF/OIF/OND Veterans as compared to Veterans never deployed to the region.\n\n      To evaluate cardiopulmonary function, each Veteran will undergo a standardized exercise\n      challenge and bronchodilator spirometry. To evaluate autonomic nervous system function,\n      investigators will examine indices of heart rate variability and cardiovascular reflex\n      regulation (e.g. baroreflex sensitivity and cerebral autoregulation) during a variety of\n      tasks.\n\n      Data derived from this pilot project will yield important insight on the extent and severity\n      of cardiorespiratory and/or autonomic impairments - data that may provide intervention\n      points for attenuating long-term adverse outcomes such as pulmonary and cardiovascular\n      disease. Through early identification, treatment options (e.g. exercise therapy,\n      pharmaceutical) may be implemented to enhance physiological function, with the goal of\n      helping to alleviate symptoms and reduce chronic disease risk."
