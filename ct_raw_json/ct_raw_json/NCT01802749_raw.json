In ovarian cancer,\n      the role of bevacizumab administered in both first and second-line therapies needs to be\n      defined.\n\n      This study aims to evaluate whether administering bevacizumab in combination with\n      chemotherapy in second-line therapy to patients with recurrent ovarian cancer who have\n      received first-line bevacizumab will be more effective than chemotherapy alone."
