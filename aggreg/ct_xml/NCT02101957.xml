      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of cysteamine in patients with
      symptomatic Huntington's disease by comparing two groups of patients (cysteamine vs placebo)
      on the results of the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS, Huntington study
      group 1996).
