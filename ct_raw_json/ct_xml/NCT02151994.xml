      The purpose of this study is to to assess the safety and tolerability of BIA 5 1058 after
      single and multiple oral doses

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a Phase 1, double blind, randomised, placebo-controlled combined single ascending
      dose (SAD), including food interaction (food effect, FE) analysis, and multiple ascending
      dose (MAD) study.

      The SAD part consisted of 9 groups of 8 healthy young male subjects each receiving an oral
      single dose (SD) of BIA 5-1058 or placebo (6 verum and 2 placebo); in the first group, 2
      subjects (1 verum and 1 placebo) were dosed 24 h before the remaining 6 subjects (5 verum
      and 1 placebo). If the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) had not been reached after completing
      the 8 originally planned sequential groups, additional groups could be included to a maximum
      of 12 sequential groups in total. Although the MTD was not reached, it was deemed sufficient
      by the Sponsor to include only 1 additional group. The FE part consisted of 12 healthy young
      male subjects each receiving a single dose of BIA 5 1058 in either the fed or fasted state
      in an open-label, two-way crossover design. Each treatment was separated by at least 7 days.
      The MAD part consisted of 5 groups of 8 young healthy male subjects each receiving an oral
      dose of BIA 5 1058 or placebo (6 verum and 2 placebo) once-daily (QD) for 10 days. If the
      MTD had not been reached after completing the 4 sequential groups originally planned,
      additional groups could be included to a maximum of 8 sequential groups in total. Although
      the MTD was not reached, it was deemed sufficient by the Sponsor to include only 1
      additional group.

    <description>Just before drug administration and twice daily until 72 h after (last) drug administration, subjects were asked non-leading questions to determine the occurrence of AEs. Subjects were asked in general terms about any AEs at regular intervals during each study period. In addition, all AEs reported spontaneously during the course of the study were recorded. All answers were assessed by the MI, coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA; Version 14.0) and recorded in the AEs Record. The intensity of the AEs was rated as &quot;mild&quot;, &quot;moderate&quot; or &quot;severe&quot; and the relationship between the AEs and the study medication was indicated as &quot;not related&quot;, &quot;unlikely&quot;, &quot;possible&quot;, &quot;probable&quot; or ''definite&quot;.</description>
