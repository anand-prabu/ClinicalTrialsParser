Optimizing the\n      variables which could affect fetal heart rate patterns at the time of initiation of\n      analgesia, such as fluid administration and oxytocin management, could help us provide\n      better care for our patients and their fetuses.\n\n      Hypotheses: Patients who receive a 1000 mL fluid bolus and lower rates of oxytocin\n      administration will have fewer non-reassuring fetal heart rate (FHR) changes."
