  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Concurrent chemoradiotherapy is the standard treatment for locally advanced, unresectable
      non-small cell lung cancer, but carries a risk of radiation pneumonitis of approximately
      30%, and is associated with a decline in pulmonary quality of life.

      Standard radiation planning aims to optimize dose to the anatomic lung volume, without
      consideration of the differences in regional lung function. Functional lung avoidance
      radiotherapy aims to reduce radiotherapy dose to regions of functioning lung, instead
      depositing dose in areas of lung that are not well-ventilated. Functional lung regions are
      determined using noble-gas MRI and co-registered to the radiotherapy planning CT scans.
      Functional lung avoidance radiotherapy has been demonstrated to be feasible, and this trial
      aims to compare outcomes between standard radiotherapy (with concurrent chemotherapy) vs.
      functional lung avoidance radiotherapy (with concurrent chemotherapy).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All consenting patients will undergo hyperpolarized noble gas MRI using 3-He for definition
      of functional lung volumes. Two radiotherapy treatment plans will be generated prior to
      randomization: one standard plan using anatomical lung avoidance, and one functional lung
      avoidance plan. After approval of both plans, patients will be randomized, and both patients
      and physicians will be blinded to treatment allocation.
