Our trial could suggest a unique\n      and important role for exercise in ovarian cancer care given that physical and functional\n      aspects of QOL are often the most compromised in ovarian cancer patients."

            "textblock": "Currently, the American Cancer Society recommends a physically active lifestyle for cancer\n      survivors to increase disease-free survival from cancer and other chronic diseases, and to\n      improve quality of life. Studies of a strong benefit of physical activity on improving QOL\n      following other types of cancer treatment, e.g., breast cancer, are well documented in the\n      literature; yet very few studies of physical activity and QOL after a diagnosis of ovarian\n      cancer have been published. Therefore, clinical trials of exercise on common physical and\n      psychological consequences of ovarian cancer and its treatments are warranted.\n\n      The primary aims of our study are to examine, in 230 women who have completed treatment for\n      Stage I-IV ovarian cancer, the impact of a moderate-intensity aerobic exercise intervention\n      vs. attention control on:\n\n        -  Quality of Life\n\n        -  Body Composition (weight, BMI, total and % body fat, waist and hip circumference)\n\n        -  Hormones possibly associated with physical activity and ovarian cancer prognosis\n           (insulin, IGF-I, IGF-II, IGF binding protein-3, CRP, leptin, estrone, estradiol, free\n           estradiol, and sex-hormone binding globulin, osteopontin, MIF, prolactin, and CA-125)\n\n        -  Cardiorespiratory Fitness - an objective measure of functional capacity and adherence\n           to exercise.\n\n      Hypotheses: Women randomized to exercise will experience improvements in quality of life,\n      body composition, hormone levels, and cardiorespiratory fitness compared to women randomized\n      to usual care.\n\n      Our trial could suggest a unique and important role for exercise in ovarian cancer care\n      given that physical and functional aspects of QOL are often the most compromised in ovarian\n      cancer patients."
