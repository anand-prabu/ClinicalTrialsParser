  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to test the hypothesis that Nuedexta (20/10)
      administered orally will reduce Pseudobulbar Affect (PBA) frequency and severity
      (CNS-Lability Scale and PLACS), with satisfactory safety and high tolerability in patients
      with Alzheimer's Disease (AD). The primary objective will be evaluated using a study
      endpoint at 1, 13, 26 weeks after initiation of treatment. The secondary objective of this
      study is to evaluate the benefit of treatment with Nuedexta (20/10) on cognition and
      functionality as demonstrated in the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT), Trail making
      A and B, Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS) logical memory and delayed recall, Controlled Oral Word
      Association (COWA), Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR), Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI),
      Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living Inventory (ADCSADL) and the
      11-item Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive subscore (ADAS-Cog11).
