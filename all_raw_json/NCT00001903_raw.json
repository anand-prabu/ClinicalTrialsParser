By age 5,\n      virtually everyone has been infected and developed antibodies against some strain of the\n      virus.  RSV infections happen during adulthood, leading to common cold syndromes.  In Bone\n      Marrow Transplant recipients the disease is much more severe, usually progressing to\n      pneumonia.  This phenomenon is associated with mortality rates around 60-80%.\n\n      RSV Polyclonal Immunoglobulin (Respigam\u00ae (Registered Trademark)) has been approved by the\n      Food and Drug Administration and recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics for\n      prophylaxis of RSV disease in premature babies and children born with bronchopulmonary\n      dysplasia.  Furthermore, it has been used to treat RSV pneumonia in children and Bone Marrow\n      Transplant recipients with encouraging results and no complications.\n\n      Currently, no preventive strategies are available when approaching this infection among bone\n      marrow transplant patients.  We intend to prevent our bone marrow transplant patients from\n      developing RSV pneumonia by employing the strategy already used in premature babies, i.e.,\n      by passive immunization with Respigam\u00ae (Registered Trademark).  Our goal to evaluate the\n      efficacy and safety of this strategy in such immunocompromised population.\n\n      We believe that this will be a more reasonable approach than waiting for the infection to\n      settle in and only then treating it, because optimal therapy is not currently available."
