Many studies in patients who have already experienced a coronary problem point\n      to the danger associated with plaques that are rich in cholesterol.  This study determines\n      if the near-infrared method of detection of these fatty plaques can predict future events.\n      If dangerous plaques can be identified, there are many treatments already available that\n      could be tested for their ability to prevent coronary events."

Elevated cardiac biomarkers with CK-MB or troponin greater than upper\n                       limits of normal;\n\n                    2. ST depression or ST elevation >1mm in 2 or more contiguous leads in the\n                       absence of LVH, paced rhythm, BBB or early repolarization;\n\n                    3.

Stable angina pectoris and/or a positive functional study with evidence of\n                  ischemia.\n\n        Angiographic Inclusion Criteria\n\n          -  At least one Suspected Index Culprit Lesion requiring imaging with IVUS and/or NIRS\n             for clinical indications.\n\n          -  At least two native epicardial coronary arteries (which may include the Suspected\n             Index Culprit Artery) eligible for imaging with NIRS-IVUS.\n\n        IVUS/NIRS Imaging Inclusion Criterion\n\n          -  A minimum of a total 50 mm of coronary artery not involved in a prior or Index\n             Procedure PCI (including the 5mm borders on either edge of the site receiving PCI)\n             must be scanned.    This 50mm total length may include contributions from the\n             Suspected Index Culprit Arteries and from Index Non-Culprit Arteries. This total\n             length must include contributions from two or more native imaged arteries.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  Unstable patients (STEMI within the prior 24 hours; cardiogenic shock, hypotension\n             needing inotropes, hypoxia needing intubation, and IABP) and patients that had a\n             procedural complication (coronary dissection, perforation or a complication that\n             would necessitate immediate-unplanned revascularization) during index PCI procedure.\n\n          -  History of CABG or planned CABG within 6 months following NIRS-IVUS imaging.\n\n          -  Patient has additional lesion(s) that needs a staged PCI.\n\n          -  Subject life expectancy is less than 2 years at time of index catheterization.\n\n          -  Subject with ejection fraction (EF) <30%.\n\n          -  Subject pacemaker dependent/paced rhythm.\n\n          -  Subject pregnant and lactating.\n\n          -  Any other factor that the investigator feels would put the patient at increased risk\n             or otherwise make the patient unsuitable for participation in the protocol\n\n          -  Patients undergoing performance of PCI in all three major vessels during the index\n             PCI."
