This study is\n      designed to determine the overall response rate (ORR) of oral Dabrafenib in combination with\n      oral Trametinib in subjects with rare BRAF V600E mutated cancers. Subjects will need to have\n      a fresh or frozen tumor tissue sample provided to confirm the BRAF V600E mutation status.\n      Only subjects with histologically confirmed advanced disease and no available standard\n      treatment options will be eligible for enrollment. Subjects will undergo screening\n      assessments within 14 days (up to 35 days for ophthalmology exam, echocardiogram or disease\n      assessments) prior to the start of treatment to determine their eligibility for enrollment\n      in the study."
