To carry out these analyses, we aim to establish an age-stratified\n      normative imaging database using healthy volunteers.  Additional objectives are to identify\n      abnormal networks in these patients using resting state fMRI/EEG and MEG/EEG, and to use\n      language and memory fMRI tasks to examine the effects of epileptogenic zones and surgery on\n      cognitive function and the networks associated with these functions.\n\n      Study population:\n\n      150 adults and children (age 8-65) with uncontrolled focal epilepsy, and 100 age-stratified\n      healthy volunteers.\n\n      Design: A retrospective and prospective natural history study.  Research procedures for\n      patients in this study include neuropsychological testing and 1-4 MRI sessions during\n      presurgical evaluation and an additional 1-3 MRI sessions and neuropsychological testing\n      approximately 12 months post-operatively.  Research testing (such as research\n      neuropsychological tests or MRI scanning sequences) will be done during a visit for clinical\n      testing whenever possible, likely reducing the number of required visits.  Patients will\n      also have optional MEG and 7T structural imaging.  Data will also be obtained from patients\n      who have already undergone epilepsy surgery if they had procedures as outlined in the\n      protocol and are willing to share the data.  Healthy volunteers will receive a subset of the\n      pre-operative procedures for patients, requiring at least 3 visits.  In order to ensure\n      adequate data acquisition, subjects may be re-scanned up to three times for the portions of\n      the study in which they participated, possibly requiring additional visits.\n\n      Outcome measures:\n\n      The main outcomes will be establishment of normative values for morphometric analysis\n      methods in age-stratified normal controls, and comparison of the sensitivity and specificity\n      of these measures to pre- and postsurgical localization of the epileptogenic zone.\n      Secondary outcome measures will include determination of the sensitivity and specificity of\n      source localization using MEG/EEG and resting state fMRI/EEG, and to evaluate changes in\n      activation during rest, as well as language and memory fMRI tasks in patients pre- and\n      postsurgically, to examine the effects of epileptogenic zones and surgery on cognitive\n      function and the networks underlying these functions."
