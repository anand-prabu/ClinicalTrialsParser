This includes treating\n      patients with the clot dissolving drug tPA (tissue plasminogen activator).  However, t-PA\n      does not work in some patients and others are not eligible to receive t-PA because they\n      present too late for treatment (they woke up with their stroke symptoms or their stroke was\n      not witnessed).\n\n      During endovascular revascularization the blockage in the artery is removed with the use of\n      devices called stentreivers and or by giving clot dissolving drug at the site of the\n      blockage in the artery to restore blood flow.  Stentrievers are devices that have been\n      designed by different companies to remove blood clots from arteries.\n\n      Approximately 250 people at 10-15 hospitals across Canada and other countries will\n      participate in this study."

There must be a confirmed symptomatic intracranial\n      occlusion, based on single phase, multiphase or dynamic CTA, at one or more of the following\n      locations: Carotid T/L, M1 MCA, or M1-MCA equivalent (2 or more M2-MCAs). Anterior temporal\n      artery is not considered an M2.\n\n      All patients will receive the best standard of medical care according to modern acute stroke\n      care guidelines.  Control arm subjects will receive best medical care.  In the\n      intervention/experimental arm, subjects will be treated with endovascular thrombectomy or\n      thrombolysis using currently available technology for use in the ESCAPE site for\n      thrombectomy/thrombolysis.\n\n      This study consists of one 90-day study period for each subject.   Subjects will be\n      hospitalized for care after their acute stroke according to the current standard of care.\n      Subjects are required to return to clinic on Days 30 & 90 for end-of-study procedures."

Pre-stroke (24 hours prior to stroke onset) independent functional status in\n             activities of daily living with modified Barthel Index of 90 or greater.  Patient\n             must be living in their own home, apartment or seniors lodge where no nursing care is\n             required.\n\n          6. Confirmed symptomatic intracranial occlusion, based on single phase, multiphase or\n             dynamic CTA, at one or more of the following locations: Carotid T/L, M1 MCA, or\n             M1-MCA equivalent (2 or more M2-MCAs). Anterior temporal artery is not considered an\n             M2.\n\n          7. Non-contrast CT/CTA for trial eligibility performed or repeated at ESCAPE stroke\n             center with endovascular suite on-site.\n\n          8. Endovascular treatment intended to be initiated (groin puncture) within 60 minutes of\n             CT/CTA with target CTA to first recanalization of 90 minutes.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          1. Baseline non-contrast CT reveals a moderate/large core defined as extensive early\n             ischemic changes of ASPECTS 0-5 in the territory of symptomatic intracranial\n             occlusion.\n\n          2. Other confirmation of a moderate to large core defined one of three ways:\n\n               1. On a single phase, multiphase or dynamic CTA: no or minimal collaterals in a\n                  region greater than 50% of the MCA territory when compared to pial filling on\n                  the contralateral side (multiphase/dynamic CTA preferred) OR\n\n               2. On CT perfusion (>8 cm coverage): a low CBV and very low CBF ASPECTS <6 in the\n                  symptomatic MCA territory OR\n\n               3. On CT perfusion(<8 cm coverage): a region of low CBV and very low CBF >1/3 of\n                  the CTP imaged symptomatic MCA territory.\n\n          3. Groin puncture is not possible within 60 minutes of the end of CTA acquisition\n             (please note that if CTP is performed it should be done after CTA).\n\n          4. No femoral pulses\n\n          5. Very difficult endovascular access will result in a CTA to recanalization time that\n             is longer than 90 minutes.\n\n          6. Pregnancy; if a woman is of child-bearing potential a urine or serum beta HCG test is\n             positive.\n\n          7. Severe contrast allergy or absolute contraindication to iodinated contrast.\n\n          8. Suspected intracranial dissection as a cause of stroke.\n\n          9. Clinical history, past imaging or clinical judgment suggests that the intracranial\n             occlusion is chronic.\n\n         10. Patient has a severe or fatal comorbid illness that will prevent improvement or\n             follow-up or that will render the procedure unlikely to benefit the patient.\n\n         11. Patient cannot complete follow-up treatment due to co-morbid non-fatal illness."
