    <textblock>
      Compare an over-the-counter dietary supplement (NutraStem Active速) and placebo over a 30-day
      intervention on aerobic exercise performance and fatigue.

      The hypothesis is that supplementation with NutraStem Active速 improve aerobic performance
      and reduce subjective measures of fatigue.

      Compare an over-the-counter dietary supplement (NutraStem Active速) and placebo over a 30-day
      intervention on aerobic exercise performance and fatigue.

      The hypothesis is that supplementation with NutraStem Active速 improve aerobic performance
      and reduce subjective measures of fatigue.

      The basic protocol includes baseline assessment of fitness and participation in a vigorous
      session of exercise immediately before and 30 days after consumption of the experimental
      supplement or placebo.

      The exercise task is intended to be fatiguing and demanding but is not expected to create
      failure.

      The supplement makes claims related to boosting exercise performance and reducing fatigue.

      The study design will determine if these outcomes are in fact present in a group of healthy,
      young, and active adults.

      The primary dependent measures are perceived exertion during exercise and levels of fatigue
      measured on multiple non-exercise days.
