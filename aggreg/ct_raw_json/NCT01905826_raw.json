            "textblock": "Background:\n\n      - GATA2 deficiency is a genetic disorder that can cause problems with a person   s immune\n      system and other body systems. Some people who have this disorder develop few problems from\n      it. Others can have a wide range of health problems, from skin problems, to hearing loss, to\n      cancer. These problems can happen at any age. Researchers want to study GATA2 deficiency to\n      better understand what types of health problems it can cause, and why it causes problems in\n      some people but not others, and at different ages.\n\n      Objectives:\n\n      - To improve understanding of GATA2 deficiency so there can be better diagnostic tests and\n      treatments in the future.\n\n      Eligibility:\n\n      - People 2 years of age or older who have a GATA2 gene mutation or certain health conditions\n      that are commonly seen in people with this mutation.\n\n      Design:\n\n        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood and urine\n           samples will be collected to see whether participants have the GATA2 genetic mutation.\n           Several other tests may be recommended, but participants can decline to take them.\n\n        -  Participants will be eligible to receive standard care for GATA2 deficiency through\n           this protocol. They may be eligible for other clinical trials at the National\n           Institutes of Health as well.\n\n        -  Participants will have regular study visits once a year to evaluate their GATA2\n           deficiency. Participants will take part in the study for at least 3 years and up to 15\n           years. At these follow-up visits, participants will fill out a questionnaire and take a\n           physical exam and blood tests. Other tests may be performed as needed."

            "textblock": "Mutations in GATA2, a critical hematopoietic transcription factor, underlie a complex\n      congenital disorder characterized by immunodeficiency, bone marrow failure, and\n      lymphatic/vascular dysfunction. Patients with GATA2 deficiency may suffer from a striking\n      variety of diseases including severe and recurrent infections, myelodysplasia/leukemia,\n      pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, lymphedema, sensorineural hearing loss, and possibly\n      susceptibility to other malignancies, autoimmune disorders, thrombotic events, and\n      miscarriage. Mutations in GATA2 appear to be fully penetrant, but expressivity is remarkably\n      variable, even among related individuals. Disease may also manifest at nearly any age\n      ranging from early childhood to late adulthood, the reasons for which remain poorly\n      understood.\n\n      While considerable progress has been made towards better understanding this complex\n      congenital disorder, many important questions remain unanswered: What is the full spectrum\n      of clinical disease and the associated pathophysiology? What accounts for the remarkable\n      variability in age of onset and clinical phenotype? What are the optimal strategies for\n      disease diagnosis and management? This natural history protocol is designed to further\n      characterize the clinical phenotype of GATA2 deficiency, better understand the reasons for\n      phenotypic variability, better understand disease progression over time, standardize the\n      diagnostic evaluation, and facilitate the screening of at risk relatives. Up to 300 males\n      and females greater than or equal to 2 years old with proven mutations in GATA2 or clinical\n      and laboratory characteristics strongly consistent with GATA2 deficiency will initially\n      undergo a series of baseline laboratory tests and diagnostic procedures at the NIH.\n      Follow-up laboratory testing will be conducted at yearly visits for up to 15 years;\n      additional follow-up diagnostic procedures will be conducted based on clinical need."
