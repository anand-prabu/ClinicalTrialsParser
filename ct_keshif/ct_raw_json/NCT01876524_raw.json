This gives risk to the diagnosis of Dual Pathology: an addiction and another\n      mental disorder.\n\n      Functional neuroimaging studies have shown that anterior cingulate cortex is associated with\n      substance\u00b4s dependence and craving. Transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS) stimulates\n      parts of the brain and can change it\u00b4s activity.\n\n      Researchers are interested in reduce cravings for substance dependence on patients with Dual\n      Pathology using tRNS in anterior cingulate cortex.\n\n      Aims: To determine whether tRNS in anterior cingulate cortex can reduce craving over Dual\n      Pathology patients."
