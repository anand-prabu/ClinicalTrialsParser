  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess the effect of universal preconception hypothyroidism for maternal pregnancy
      outcome, and 0-3yrs offspring neurocognitive ability and IQ score.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Epidemic evidence and animal studies suggested that hypothyroidism is related with maternal
      pregnancy outcome, offspring cognitive ability. Negro's study found improved maternal health
      in those screened in early trimester; while Lazarus et al. reported  no significant
      offspring IQ score at 3yrs in universal screening in early trimester. Currently, it lacks
      evidence of universal pre-conception screening for maternal pregnancy outcome and offspring
      cognitive development, motivation ability, attention. China Governmental Health Department
      has included thyroid function screening into preconception in 2011. The investigators
      hypothesize that pre-conception effective treatment may be helpful for decrease possible
      negative effects on maternal and offspring health, instead of early trimester.
