If people are visually impaired or have low literacy an audio CD\n      of the book will be available in place of the print copy; (3)An exercise CD with flexibility\n      and strengthening exercises at three different levels of intensity, designed for people with\n      chronic conditions; (4) A relaxation CD with three different relaxation exercises;  and  (5)\n      In addition, there will be tip sheets, one for each major tool such as managing pain,\n      managing sleep, etc.  It is expected that there will be 10-20 tip sheets in total.\n\n      The key content of the self-test and the tip sheets will be developed surveying master\n      trainers of the existing small-group Chronic Disease Self Management Program (100 active\n      trainers) and asking about 500 additional trainers to rank importance of key content items\n      generated in initial survey.  Pilot testing of the program will be by 250 people with\n      chronic diseases.  Participants will be surveyed by mailed questionnaires at baseline and\n      six-months.  A subgroup with diabetes (estimated 25-30%) will be asked to submit hemoglobin\n      A1C blood test kits at baseline and six months."
