      The overall objective of this proposal is to examine the anti-inflammatory effects of
      Colgate Total® during an experimental gingivitis model.

    <textblock>
      This will be a double-blind, parallel group study utilizing the experimental gingivitis
      model.  Subjects will be randomly assigned to an arm of the study.  Enrolled subjects will
      also be randomly assigned to either right or left side mandibular stent.

      Saliva and gingival crevicular fluid and plaque samples will be collected at Day 0, 14, 21,
      and 35 study visits. A randomization chart will be used to identify which two sites (teeth
      and tooth surface) will be used at the specific study visit for collection of gingival
      crevicular fluid(GCF)and plaque.  Gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) and plaque samples will
      not be taken from implants. If one of the posterior teeth is missing, the cuspid tooth will
      be used as a substitute tooth.  Repeat gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) samples will be taken
      at Day 14, and 21.
