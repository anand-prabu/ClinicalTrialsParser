Additionally,  the length of the\n      luteal phase will be recorded (secondary outcome) in order to detect luteal phase\n      defects/insufficiencies in the absence of luteal phase suppletion as well as luteal phase\n      prolongation in case of luteal phase support which may be a burden for the patients waiting\n      for the outcome of the treatment."
