  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Allergic rhinitis (allergic inflammation of the nose) is a common medical condition which is
      known to seriously decrease quality of life, aggravate preexisting conditions particularly
      asthma, carry significant medical treatment costs and be responsible for reduced work
      productivity and lost school days. A significant symptom of the condition, nasal blockage,
      remains difficult to treat even when using nasal corticosteroids. Decongestant medications
      act on the blood vessels in the nose and have an immediate effect in clearing a blocked nose
      but if used for more than seven days a more severe rebound congestion of the nose develops.

      In this study, the investigators aim to assess the effects of doxazosin, a drug which is
      currently used to treat high blood pressure and symptoms of prostate enlargement, to find
      out if it has an effect on nasal blockage.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female 18-70 years

          -  Able to provide informed consent

          -  Able to comply with the requirements of the protocol

          -  Diagnosis of allergic rhinitis

          -  Peak nasal inspiratory flow which is reversible to &gt;20 l/min with oxymetazoline

          -  Positive skin prick test to at least one common aeroallergen

          -  Ability to withhold antihistamines, intranasal corticosteroids for duration of the
             study

          -  Agreement for their GP to be made aware of study participation and to receive
             feedback as relevant to the participant's well being

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnancy, planned pregnancy or lactation

          -  Respiratory tract infection in the previous 2 months

          -  Nasal polyps of more than Grade I on nasal endoscopy

          -  Any known adverse reaction to the Investigational Medicinal Product or other
             quinazolines

          -  Systolic BP &lt;100mmHg

          -  Any degree of heart block

          -  Any clinically significant medical condition that may endanger the health or   safety
             of the participant or jeopardise the protocol

          -  Participation within another clinical trial of investigational medicinal product
             within the last 30 days

          -  Under the age of 18

          -  Benign hyperplasia, chronic urinary tract infections, bladder stones, overflow
             bladder, anuria or progressive renal failure

          -  History of oesophageal or gastrointestinal obstruction or decreased lumen diameter of
             the gastrointestinal tract.

          -  Concomitant use of PDE5 inhibitors (sildenafil etc.)

          -  Alpha antagonists - this is the medication under investigation.

          -  Other cardiovascular medications including but not limited to:

        ACE inhibitors, Angiotensin II antagonists, Beta blockers, calcium channel blockers,
        diuretics, nitrates, phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitors or other vasodilating medications
        - these in combination with doxazosin carry an increased risk of symptomatic hypotension.

          -  Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) - antidepressant medication that can lead to
             significant hypotension in combination with alpha antagonists.

          -  Anxiolytics and hypnotics - enhanced hypotensive and sedative effects when
             alpha-blockers given in combination with these.

          -  Methyldopa and levodopa - potential enhanced hypotensive effect with alpha
             antagonists.

          -  Nasal corticosteroid spray - would confound study outcomes

          -  Oxymetazoline - this is used as an outcome of response in the study.

          -  Antihistamines - the participants will be undergoing a histamine nasal challenge.

          -  Sympathomimetics i.e. dopamine, ephedrine, epinephrine, metaraminol, methoxamine,
             phenylephrine- may reduce the effect of doxazosin.

          -  Any other medication, which in the opinion of the Investigator may put the
             participant at risk.
