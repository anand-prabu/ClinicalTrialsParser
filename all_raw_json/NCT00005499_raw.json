The study sample consisted of two\n      successive period cohorts of elderly people, identified for each of two five-year periods,\n      1970-1974 and 1990-94.  The study tested the following hypotheses:  1) incidence of CHF had\n      decreased among the younger old (65-74 years of age); 2) incidence of CHF had increased\n      among the older old (75 years of age or above); 3) one-year survival time had increased\n      following onset of incident CHF; and 4) prevalence of hypertension had decreased and\n      prevalence of myocardial infarction and other manifestations of coronary artery disease\n      increased among incident cases of CHF."
