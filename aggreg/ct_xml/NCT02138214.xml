  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well thyroid gland removal with or without
      central lymph node dissection works in treating patients with thyroid cancer or suspected
      thyroid cancer that has not spread to the lymph nodes. Currently, the standard treatment for
      thyroid cancer is total thyroidectomy, or complete removal of the thyroid. Sometimes, the
      lymph nodes in the central part of the neck may also be surgically removed, called central
      lymph node dissection. Prophylactic removal of the lymph nodes may increase the risk of
      life-threatening complications, and may reduce post-surgery quality of life. It may also
      prevent the cancer from returning and reduce the need for additional surgery. It is not yet
      known whether recurrence rates and complication levels are lower after thyroid gland removal
      alone or with central lymph node dissection.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the rate of transient and permanent hypocalcemia.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the rate of voice and swallowing problems. II. To determine the degree to
      which quality of life (QOL) is compromised. III. To determine clinical recurrence rates.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients undergo total thyroidectomy alone.

      ARM II: Patients undergo total thyroidectomy with ipsilateral prophylactic central neck
      dissection (CND).

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at day 1, 2 and 6 weeks, and 6
      and 12 months.

    <description>Data will be analyzed using a mixed model 2-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) examining the effects of treatment group, time and factor interactions, such as radioactive iodine dose. Evaluation time periods (pre-surgery, week 2, week 6, month 6, and 1 year) will serve as between subjects factor and treatment group (prophylactic CND vs no CND) will serve as the between subjects factor. Experiment-wise error will be controlled with an appropriate adjustment to the alpha-level. Data will be transformed as necessary.
