  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of electro-acupuncture in pain processing on
      patients with fibromyalgia (FM). The investigators hypothesize that electro-acupuncture is
      effective for FM because it functions as a desensitization therapy, which when applied
      repeatedly over multiple treatment sessions, gradually habituates the nervous system to
      continuing pain and sensory signaling.

      This study design has two components: 1) a cross sectional assessment of brain chemistry,
      connectivity and response to pain in healthy controls and age- and sex-matched fibromyalgia
      patients, and 2) a longitudinal assessment of the same outcomes in fibromyalgia patients
      randomized to either electro-acupuncture or laser acupuncture.

      The investigators will evaluate 80 fibromyalgia patients who will receive acupuncture
      treatment twice a week for 4 weeks, for a total of 8 treatments.  Baseline data from these
      patients will be compared to results from 20 pain-free controls.

      Participants will undergo experimental pain assessments as well as brain neuroimaging.

        Inclusion Criteria for Fibromyalgia Participants

          -  Met the American College of Rheumatology (1990) criteria for the diagnosis of FM [2]
             for at least one year.

          -  Continued presence of pain more than 50% of days.

          -  Pain greater than 4 on a 10cm Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for pain; 7-day recall;
             [Note: The VAS is widely used in clinical pain research and as such we chose to use
             it for inclusion criteria and for clinical pain assessment below.  Within our group
             numerical ratings scales 0-100 are more commonly used in quantitative sensory
             assessment, and as such we chose to use NRS scales for evoked pain assessments
             below.]

          -  Willing to limit the introduction of any new medications or treatment modalities for
             control of FM symptoms during the study.

          -  Able to travel to the study site to receive acupuncture treatments up to two times
             weekly.
