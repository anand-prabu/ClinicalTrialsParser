Studies showed Dexmedetomidine as an adjuvant to LA\n      prolongs peripheral nerve block duration without any nerve toxicity. In the following\n      randomized, non-crossover study, the investigators test if Dexmedetomidine as an adjuvant\n      can decrease the medium effective concentration(EC50) of lidocaine for obturator nerve block\n      during transurethral resection of bladder tumor."
