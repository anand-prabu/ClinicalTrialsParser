Although WHO has developed\n      a three-stage model of cancer pain management, 80% cancer patients still suffer moderate to\n      severe pain in their daily life. When patients are with acute exacerbation or aggravate of\n      pain, they usually visit the emergency department for more help.\n\n      Acupuncture is a safe, low-invasive and economic treatment. And it has been world-wide used\n      as a complementary therapy among patients with cancer. It can not only relieve pain in\n      cancer patients, but also can reduce some of the side effects caused by some treatment.\n\n      This study is aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of acupuncture in cancer patient\n      with acute pain onset through emergency department with objective Traditional Chinese\n      Medicine assessment."
