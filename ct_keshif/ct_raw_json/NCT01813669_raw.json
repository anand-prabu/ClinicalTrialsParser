            "textblock": "Psychosomatic symptoms are physical complaints in the absence of an organic cause.  For\n      children and adolescents, psychosomatic symptoms often manifest as headaches,\n      gastrointestinal (GI) discomfort, non-specific musculoskeletal pain, and fatigue. These\n      symptoms are strongly associated with the presence of an internalizing disorder\u2014namely,\n      anxiety or depression\u2014in youth.  Thus, treatment of these symptoms has often been cached\n      within a broader intervention protocol, the overarching goal of which is to address the\n      global internalizing disorder. For children who experience intense and persistent\n      psychosomatic discomfort, however, it can be critical to specifically target these symptoms\n      through intensive intervention. Otherwise, psychosomatic complaints can be extremely\n      impairing, impeding children's attendance in school, participation in extracurricular\n      activities, and disrupting family activities. At present, there are few systematic that can\n      target a range of psychosomatic problems.\n\n      Yoga-based interventions may be a particularly valuable treatment for children with\n      psychosomatic complaints. Such interventions have been studied empirically in adults with a\n      number of psychosomatic conditions, and more recently in children with a variety of\n      psychological conditions. Indeed, there have been a small number of studies targeting\n      psychosomatic complaints in children via yogic practices. Although there is emerging\n      interest in yoga-based interventions for youth, and slowly growing evidence their efficacy,\n      at present there are no known structured interventions for youth with psychosomatic\n      complaints in the context of an internalizing disorder. Thus, the goal of the present\n      proposal is to develop a semi-structured, manualized intervention that targets impairing\n      psychosomatic symptoms in youth with a comorbid internalizing disorders. The specific aims\n      are as follows:\n\n      Specific Aim 1 Treatment Feasibility: Assess the feasibility of a novel integrative coping\n      intervention for children with somatic symptoms and anxiety.\n\n      Hypothesis:  The yoga-based intervention will be acceptable and feasible for children.\n      Acceptability will be defined as a 50% consent rate among participants approached for the\n      study; Feasibility will be defined by 75% of children completing 80% of intervention\n      sessions.\n\n      Secondary Aim 1 Treatment Efficacy: Assess the preliminary efficacy of a 12-week integrative\n      coping intervention on both somatic and psychological (e.g., anxiety, mood) symptoms\n      compared to a wait-list control condition.\n\n      Hypothesis: Children in the active intervention condition will have a significant reduction\n      in somatic and anxiety symptoms following the 12-week intervention compared to a wait-list\n      control."
