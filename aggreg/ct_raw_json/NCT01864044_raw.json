The second phase is a maintenance\n      phase which aim is to maintain as long as possible the volume reduction acheived during the\n      first phase.\n\n      These 2 phases required multi modal parameters such as bandages, lymphatic drainages,\n      physical exercises...and can be managed very differently from one site to another."
