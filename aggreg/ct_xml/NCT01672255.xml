  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Exercise is a cornerstone of diabetes management.  It helps reduce blood pressure, promote
      weight loss, lower insulin resistance and improve glucose and lipid (triglyceride and
      HDL-cholesterol) profiles.  Unfortunately, the benefits of exercise are often not embraced
      by diabetic individuals because of the fear of low blood sugar (hypoglycemia).  My
      laboratory has demonstrated that Autonomic nervous system (ANS) counterregulatory failure
      plays an important role in exercise associated hypoglycemia in Type 1 DM.  ANS responses are
      significantly reduced in Type 1 DM and are further blunted by antecedent episodes of
      hypoglycemia.  Furthermore, there is a large sexual dimorphism of reduced ANS responses
      during submaximal exercise in both Type 1 DM and healthy individuals that is unexplained.
      Accumulating data are demonstrating that serotonergic pathways can regulate ANS discharge.
      Generally, serotonergic pathways are inhibitory but both single and longer term
      administration of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI's) such as Prozac has been
      demonstrated to increase basal epinephrine levels and enhance baroreflex control of
      Sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity.  What is unknown is whether fluoxetine can also
      enhance SNS responses and also override the large ANS sexual dimorphism present during sub
      maximal exercise.  Therefore, the purpose of this study is to determine if the SSRI
      fluoxetine (Prozac) can improve SNS responses during exercise.
