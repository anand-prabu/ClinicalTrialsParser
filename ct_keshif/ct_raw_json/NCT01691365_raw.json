The\n      assessment will include markers of inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, oxidative stress,\n      antioxidants, total plasma homocysteine and risk of infections.  A fasting 15-ml of blood\n      will be taken for measurements of total plasma homocysteine concentration, markers of\n      inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, oxidative damage and vitamin concentrations.\n      Further information on clinical variables which may influence endothelial dysfunction,\n      antioxidant capacity, immunity and diabetes control status will be collected and adjusted\n      for during analysis.\n\n      Potential Significance- the study will help to clarify the temporal relationships between ,\n      markers of inflammation, endothelial dysfunction and oxidative stress and risk of infections\n      and form the basis of appropriate intervention strategies to minimise the long-term\n      complications associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus."
