Patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) SC daily\n      beginning on day 5 and continuing until blood counts recover. Treatment repeats every 21\n      days for a maximum of 2 courses.\n\n      Patients receive a transplantation preparative regimen comprising fludarabine IV over 30\n      minutes and cyclophosphamide IV over 2 hours on days -6 to -3 (beginning on day 22 of\n      immune-depleting chemotherapy) followed by allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell\n      transplantation IV on day 0. Patients receive G-CSF SC daily beginning on day 0 and\n      continuing until blood counts recover, plus cyclosporine IV over 1-2 hours every 12 hours on\n      days -1 to 14 and then orally until day 40.\n\n      Patients with persistent malignant disease and less than grade II acute graft-versus-host\n      disease receive donor lymphocytes IV on days 42, 70, and 98.\n\n      Patients are followed twice weekly until day 100, and then at 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 70 patients will be accrued for this study within 24 months."
