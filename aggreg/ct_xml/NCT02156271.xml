    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to help scientist better understand the effect of a 12-week
      single daily evening dose of ramelteon (Rozerem ©), a drug that has been approved by the U.
      S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of insomnia (trouble falling asleep
      or staying asleep). The study will measure levels of inflammation, fasting insulin and
      fasting glucose (sugar) in subjects who are taking either ramelteon (8 mg) or placebo.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        At screening visit:

          -  aged 18-65

          -  nonsmokers

          -  for women: oral contraceptive (OC) or hormone replacement therapy (HRT) nonusers

        To schedule the baseline PSG (Visit 2), subjects must meet the following inclusion
        criteria:

          -  ages 18-65 inclusive;

          -  PSQI-Component 2 (sleep latency) score of greater than 1;

          -  non-smoker (e.g., less than 20 cigarettes in the past 5 years);

          -  habitual bedtime between 8:30 pm and midnight

          -  For premenopausal women:

               -  regular menstrual cycles determined by Framingham Study criteria;

               -  not pregnant and no history of oral contraceptive (OC) usage in last 6-months.

          -  For postmenopausal women:

               -  no recent (&lt; 6 months) use of Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT)

               -  no surgical menopause

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  positive urine drug screen

          -  Potential subjects with hypersensitivity to ramelteon or any components of the
             formulation will be excluded from participation.

          -  Given that ramelteon should not be used by individuals with severe hepatic
             impairment, or in patients in combination with fluvoxamine, individuals who report
             liver problem or use of fluvox will be excluded.

          -  use of rifampin (Rifadin ©); ketoconazole (Nizora ©l); or fluconazole (Diflucan ©).

          -  Ramelteon has not been studied in children or adolescents, and the effects in these
             populations are unknown, thus only individuals above 18 years will participate.
