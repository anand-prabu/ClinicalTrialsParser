Combining chemotherapy with peripheral stem cell\n      transplantation may allow the doctor to give higher doses of drugs and kill more tumor\n      cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of high-dose topotecan and peripheral stem\n      cell transplantation in treating patients with refractory cancer."

Topotecan is given over 30 minutes daily for three days. A minimum of 3\n      patients are entered at each dose level. The MTD is defined as the dose immediately below\n      that at which 2 patients experience dose limiting toxicity.\n\n      Peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) are infused at least 24 hours after treatment with\n      topotecan is complete. Filgrastim (G-CSF) is administered subcutaneously beginning on the\n      day PBSC are infused and continuing until blood counts recover.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Not specified"
