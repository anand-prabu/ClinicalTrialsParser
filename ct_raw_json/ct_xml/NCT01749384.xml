      This phase I trial studies the side effects of and best dose of tivantinib when given
      together with bevacizumab in treating patients with solid tumors that are metastatic or
      cannot be removed by surgery. Tivantinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some
      of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block
      tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.
      Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them.
      Bevacizumab may also stop the growth of cancer by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Giving
      tivantinib together with bevacizumab may be more effective in treating tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of the vascular endothelial growth factor
      (VEGF) monoclonal antibody, bevacizumab in combination with the allosteric met
      proto-oncogene (MET) inhibitor, tivantinib, in patients with advanced solid tumors.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Describe the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and other toxicities associated with
      bevacizumab in combination with tivantinib as assessed by Common Terminology Criteria for
      Adverse Events (CTCAE) version (v) 4.0.

      II. Document anti-tumor activity of bevacizumab in combination with tivantinib in patients
      with advanced solid tumors.

      III. Determine the pharmacokinetics of tivantinib when administered in combination with
      bevacizumab in patients with advanced solid tumors.

      IV. Perform cytochrome P450 family 2, subfamily C, polypeptide 19 (CYP2C19) genotyping on
      all subjects and correlate with pharmacokinetics and toxicity.

      V. Assess the effect of bevacizumab plus tivantinib on plasma components of the
      hepatocellular growth factor (HGF)-MET signaling pathway (HGF, HGF activator [HGFA]) and
      VEGF signaling pathway (VEGF A, B, C, D and placental growth factor [PIGF]).

      VI. Assess tissue (tumor and skin) protein biomarkers before and after study treatment
      including MET, phospho-MET^tyrosine (Tyr)1349 and phosphor-focal adhesion kinase
      (FAK)^Tyr861.

      VII. Assess early therapy response by quantitative biomarker imaging fludeoxyglucose F 18
      (F-18 FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic imaging resonance (MRI) on a
      smaller sample (n up to 15) of subjects willing to participate in the imaging assessment
      through UPCI 12-096.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of tivantinib.

      Patients receive bevacizumab intravenously (IV) over 30-90 minutes on days -15, 1, and 15
      (day -15 of course 1 only) and tivantinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28.
      Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks.

          -  Known central nervous system (CNS) disease except for treated brain metastasis;
             treated brain metastases are defined as having no ongoing requirement for steroids
             and no evidence of progression or hemorrhage after treatment for at least 3 months,
             as ascertained by clinical examination and brain imaging (magnetic resonance imaging
             [MRI] or computed tomography [CT]); (stable dose of non-enzyme-inducing
             anticonvulsants are allowed); treatment for brain metastases may include whole brain

             performed within 3 months prior to day 1 will be excluded

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to tivantinib or bevacizumab, or to Chinese hamster ovary cells

          -  Tivantinib is metabolized by CYP2C19, and to a lesser extent CYP3A4; the metabolism
             and consequently overall pharmacokinetics of tivantinib could be altered by
             inhibitors and/or inducers or other substrates of CYP2C19 and CYP3A4; while
             inhibitors/inducers of these cytochrome P450 isoenzymes are not specifically
             excluded, investigators should be aware that tivantinib exposure may be altered by
             the concomitant administration of these drugs; as part of the enrollment/informed
             consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of interactions with
             other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be prescribed or if the
             patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal product

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements

          -  Patients with clinically significant cardiovascular disease, including any of the
             following, are excluded:

               -  Inadequately controlled hypertension (HTN) (systolic blood pressure [SBP] &gt; 160
                  mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure [DBP] &gt; 90 mmHg despite antihypertensive
                  medication)

               -  History of cerebrovascular accident (CVA) within 6 months of start of protocol
                  therapy

                  therapy

               -  New York heart association grade II or greater congestive heart failure

               -  Serious and inadequately controlled cardiac arrhythmia

               -  Significant vascular disease (e.g. significant aortic aneurysm, history of
                  aortic dissection)

               -  Clinically significant peripheral vascular disease

               -  Untreated deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) or DVT/PE
                  which has been treated with therapeutic anticoagulation for less than 6 weeks

             first dose of study drug

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study, and breastfeeding should be discontinued
             if the mother is treated with tivantinib; these potential risks may also apply to
             bevacizumab

          -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients on combination antiretroviral
             therapy are ineligible
