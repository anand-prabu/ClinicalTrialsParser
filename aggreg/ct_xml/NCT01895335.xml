      Primary Objective:

      To describe efficacy, tolerability and convenience of teriflunomide treatment through the
      evaluation of Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs).

      Secondary Objectives:

      To describe disease progression using Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs). To describe clinical
      outcomes (ie, treated relapses) in teriflunomide treated patients.

      To describe the change in cognition in teriflunomide treated patients. To describe safety of
      teriflunomide in patients treated (based on adverse events reporting).

      To describe adherence and persistence to teriflunomide treatment. To describe quality of
      life, activity and leisure over the period of teriflunomide treatment.

      To compare Patient Determined Disease Steps (PDDS) and Expanded Disability Status Scale
      (EDSS) in assessing Multiple Sclerosis (MS) disease progression.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The total duration of the study per patient is up to 50 or 54 weeks (if accelerated
      elimination procedure performed):

      Screening: up to 2 weeks Teriflunomide treatment: 48 weeks Accelerated elimination
      procedure: 4 weeks when performed)

      An accelerated elimination procedure at any time after discontinuation of teriflunomide
      treatment is possible and it is particularly recommended for women of child-bearing
      potential.
