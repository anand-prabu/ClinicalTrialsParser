  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Schizophrenia is a chronic psychiatric illness with periods of remission and relapse.
      Patients vary in the frequency and severity of relapse, time until relapse and time in
      remission. Discontinuation of antipsychotic medication is by far the most important reason
      for relapse. A possible method to optimize medication adherence is to treat patients with
      long-term, depot medication rather than oral medication. However, despite its apparent
      &quot;common sense&quot; this approach has neither been universally accepted by practicing
      psychiatrists nor unequivocally demonstrated in clinical trials. Therefore, in this study we
      aim to investigate possible advantages of depot medication over oral antipsychotics in an
      independently designed and conducted, randomized,  pragmatic  trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It remains unclear if depot medication can reduce relapse rates and improve clinical outcome
      when offered to all patients in need of continuation treatment with antipsychotics. Before
      we can conclude whether or not all schizophrenia patients could benefit from a switch to
      depot formulations, several questions remain to be answered. Is depot medication associated
      with better continuation rates and outcome? How are depot medications tolerated as compared
      to oral medication? In order to clarify these important issues we aim to perform a large
      multi-center trial in which schizophrenia patients in need of continuous treatment who are
      randomized 1:1:1:1 to two different depot preparations or to two different oral medications.

      In this pragmatic, randomized, open label, multicenter, multinational comparative trial,
      schizophrenic patients aged 18 years or older, having experienced the first psychosis 1-7
      years ago,with an indication (patient or physician initiated) to receive medication or to
      switch to another antipsychotic drug, will enter the study.

      The study duration will be one month for the medication switch and then a follow-up of 18
      months. Patients having refused to take part in the study will be asked to give consent and
      participate in a naturalistic follow-up, during which they will be followed with the
      Clinical Global Impression list (CGI) as closely related to the study schedule as possible,
      unless they also refuse this.

    <description>the recommended starting dose for aripiprazole is 10 or 15 mg/day with a maintenance dose of 15 mg/day administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals.Aripiprazole is effective in a dose range of 10 to 30 mg/day.</description>

    <description>The recommended starting and maintenance dose of aripiprazole depot is 400 mg. Titration of the dose of this medicinal product is not required. It should be administered once monthly as a single injection (no sooner than 26 days after the previous injection).
After the first injection, treatment with 10 mg to 20 mg oral aripiprazole should be continued for 14 consecutive days to maintain therapeutic aripiprazole concentrations during initiation of therapy.
If there are adverse reactions with the 400 mg dosage, reduction of the dose to 300 mg once monthly should be considered.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>The recommended dose of paliperidone for the treatment of schizophrenia is 6 mg once daily, administered in the morning. Initial dose titration is not required. Some patients may benefit from lower or higher doses within the recommended range of 3 mg to 12 mg once daily. Dosage adjustment, if indicated, should occur only after clinical reassessment. When dose increases are indicated, increments of 3 mg/day are recommended and generally should occur at intervals of more than 5 days.</description>

    <description>The first two administrations of paliperidone palmitate (150 mg at visit 3 and 100 mg one week later) need to be administered deep into the deltoid muscle in order to attain therapeutic concentrations rapidly. No oral supplementation with paliperidone is needed. Following the second dose, monthly maintenance doses can be administered in either the deltoid or gluteal muscle. The recommended monthly maintenance dose is 75 mg, although some patients may benefit from lower doses within the recommended range of 25 to 150 mg based on individual patient tolerability and/or efficacy.</description>
