This\n      study is a randomized study of first-time kidney transplant patients who have worsening\n      kidney function and biopsy proven grade 2 or 3 interstitial fibrosis/tubular atrophy\n      (IF/TA).  Patients must be eligible to get a second transplant. They must have completed or\n      be actively undergoing evaluation for re-listing for a second transplant.  Patients will be\n      randomized to either convert to belatacept or continue on calcineurin inhibitor-based\n      therapy."
