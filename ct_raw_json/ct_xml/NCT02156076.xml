  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of BMS-919373 on atrial fibrillation
      (AF) through its effect on AF burden (AFB), or the percent of time in AF, in subjects with
      paroxysmal AF (pAF) when administered orally at a range of doses (2 mg once daily (QD), 5 mg
      QD, 12 mg QD following a 1-week period of loading doses of 3 mg QD, 8 mg QD and 20 mg QD,
      respectively) for a total of 4 weeks. It is hypothesized that treatment with BMS-919373 will
      reduce AF burden as compared to baseline relative to placebo.

      Primary Purpose: Other: Protocol designed to assess, by the use of long term non-invasive
      beat-to-beat monitoring with the NUVANT Mobile Cardiac Telemetry (MCT) system, the effect of
      BMS-919373 on the percent change from baseline relative to placebo of atrial fibrillation
      burden in subjects with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
