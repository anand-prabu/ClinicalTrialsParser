Each participant of the active group will be paired with one of the\n      participants from the observer group. The active participant will manage individually a\n      simulated crisis scenario (pretest) while the paired observer participant will observe the\n      scenario from outside the simulation room using a video transmission system. Immediately\n      after, both participants will be debriefed by a trained instructor focused on CRM\n      principles. The same active and observer participants will then individually manage another\n      simulated crisis scenario (post-test). Two independent raters, blinded to the study design\n      and to the randomization groups, will review the videos of all scenarios in a random order\n      and rate each participant on their CRM performance using a global rating scale (GRS)."
