  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to monitor outcomes of total hip arthroplasties performed with
      E-MAX polyethylene and BIOLOX Delta Ceramic head.  Polyethylene has been used as a bearing
      surface in total joint replacements for half of a century. Radiation, the most common form
      of sterilization, unfortunately it results in the creation of free radicals (atoms or
      molecules that cause chemical reactions with other substances) within the materials which
      cause the breakdown of the polyethylene. Second generation antioxidant polyethylene, Renovis
      E-MAX, mechanically blends in Vitamin E as an antioxidant. This helps eliminate free
      radicals while maintaining mechanical strength. The theory is that E-MAX will be a safe and
      long lasting bearing surface in total hip arthroplasty that meets or exceeds current wear
      rates after being placed in a patient.

    <description>This measure's purpose it to look at the longevity of our product. Radiographs will be taken at standard checkpoints over the course of 10 years.  Radiographic analysis will be done to assess wear rates of the E-Max liner over the course of the 10 year study. Wear rates will then be compared to other products that have already been studied and published in hopes of finding that E-Max's wear rates are at least as good if not better than comparative products on the market.</description>

    <description>This measure will assess patient function and mobility preoperatively and compare this at standard checkpoints over 10 years post-operatively. This will be done through use of the Harris Hip Score and UCLA Functional Assessment with the hope of seeing improvement in both over the course of time.</description>
