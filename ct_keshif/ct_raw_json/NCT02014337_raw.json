Eribulin will be administered intravenously (IV) over 2 to 5 minutes on days 8 and 15.\n\n      Cycle 2 and beyond (21-day cycle): Mifepristone administered orally (PO) with food once\n      daily for 21 days. Eribulin will be administered intravenously (IV) over 2 to 5 minutes on\n      days 1 and 8. Enrolment in Part 2 of the study (dose expansion) will occur once the RP2D has\n      been determined. Patients in the dose expansion study must have disease that is\n      glucocorticoid (GR) receptor positive (by immunohistochemistry [IHC]). Patients will be\n      treated in repeated 21 day cycles until progression or another withdrawal criterion is met."
