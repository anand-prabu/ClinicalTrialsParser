The cohort will be recruited from the UCSF\n      Dysplasia Clinics.  The standard treatment involves treatment of the entire cervix.  Women\n      with HGCIN meeting inclusion criteria will be recruited for enrollment into the pilot study\n      of focal treatment.  Upon enrollment, they will undergo focal treatment rather than standard\n      treatment of the cervix.  Follow-up visits will be conducted at 2 weeks and 6 months to\n      assess safety, feasibility, and acceptability.  The 6-month recurrence rate of HGCIN will be\n      calculated."
