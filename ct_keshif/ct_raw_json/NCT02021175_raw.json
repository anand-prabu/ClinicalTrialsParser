            "textblock": "Cigarette smoking remains the leading preventable cause of morbidity and mortality in the\n      United States. In Los Angeles, rates of morbidities due to cigarette smoking follow\n      prevalence. While the rate of cigarette smoking in Los Angeles County among youth is at\n      historic lows, prevalence is not uniform: Cigarette smoking is pervasive among residents who\n      have significant economic disparities. Prevalence is also among the highest in the world for\n      Korean school-aged youth and substantially higher numbers of Korean American youth smoke\n      cigarettes. To date, smoking prevention efforts in Korea have had mixed results as they are\n      not interesting to youth and are not interactive.\n\n      This project will assess an interactive, culturally adapted, tailored smoking cessation\n      intervention delivered through the internet and cell phone. Using technology, the\n      investigators seek to increase the reach and access of our intervention and facilitate\n      cessation without in-person sessions, a factor that limits smoking cessation interventions\n      for youth. Youth are energetic users of electronic media, lending support to the delivery of\n      treatment through technology.\n\n      The investigators predict that subjects assigned to the intervention will demonstrate\n      statistically higher rates of smoking abstinence and longer retention in the cessation\n      program compared to those assigned to the standard of care condition. Subjects reporting\n      higher levels of smoking exposure, lower motivation, poor mental health, disadvantaged\n      neighborhoods, and lower levels of acculturation to American culture will also have lower\n      quit rates at each follow-up visit."

            "textblock": "Cigarette smoking remains the leading preventable cause of morbidity and mortality in the\n      United States. While 19% of U.S. twelfth graders smoked cigarettes in the past 30 days,\n      fewer than 10% of Californians under age 18 reported recent smoking. In Los Angeles, rates\n      of morbidities due to cigarette smoking follow prevalence. While the rate of cigarette\n      smoking in Los Angeles County among youth is at historic lows (10.4%), prevalence is not\n      uniform: Cigarette smoking is pervasive among residents who have significant economic\n      disparities. Alarming racial and ethnic disparities are noted with highest prevalence\n      reported for adult Korean males (44.8%). Prevalence of cigarette smoking is also among the\n      highest in the world for Korean school-aged youth, with 16.2% for males and 5.3% for\n      females. To date, smoking prevention efforts in Korea have had mixed results as they are not\n      interesting to youth and are not interactive.\n\n      This project will assess an interactive, culturally adapted, tailored smoking cessation\n      intervention delivered through the internet and cell phone. The evidence-based treatment,\n      \"Cognitive-Behavioral/Motivational Enhancement Therapy for Smoking Cessation\" (CBME) for\n      adolescent smokers was developed by one of the investigators. Based on input from our\n      community partners, consultants, and youth focus group participants, the treatment will be\n      culturally adapted for appropriateness and relevance to Korean youth. The refined\n      intervention will be programmed for delivery via the Web and mobile technologies. Using\n      technology, we seek to increase the reach and access of our intervention and facilitate\n      cessation without in-person sessions, a factor that limits smoking cessation interventions\n      for youth. A 2-group, randomized control trial design will assign youth either to the\n      tailored Web and cell phone based smoking cessation program or to a control condition.\n\n      The specific aim of the study is as follows:\n\n      1. To evaluate the efficacy of the tailored smoking cessation approach for Korean youth\n      seeking smoking cessation, randomly assigning 240 youth to either the experimental condition\n      or to a standard cessation approach."
