To determine the safety of maternal/fetal transfer of rCD4-IgG in\n      infants born to mothers entered into the study. To obtain a preliminary indication of the\n      antiviral and immunologic effects of rCD4-IgG in HIV seropositive pregnant women and their\n      newborns.\n\n      AMENDED: Part 2: To determine the safety profile of rCD4-IgG in HIV-1-infected women at the\n      onset of labor and in their newborns. To determine the extent of placental transfer of\n      rCD4-IgG when administered to the mother at onset of labor. To determine the\n      pharmacokinetics of rCD4-IgG in newborns. To obtain preliminary evidence of the ability of\n      rCD4-IgG to prevent intrapartum transmission of HIV-1 from mother to fetus.\n\n      An agent that can prevent HIV infection is desirable for those at risk of infection as well\n      as in the pregnant female and newborn populations. Such an agent may help prevent the\n      progression of the disease in infants and children in early stages of infections. In theory,\n      rCD4-IgG has antiviral effects."

Patients in Group A received rCD4-IgG at the onset of labor, and those in Group B\n      received rCD4-IgG twice per week, beginning 1 week before the expected date of delivery.\n      Newborns were not treated in Part 1 of the study.\n\n      AMENDED: In Part 2 of the study, a total of nine pregnant women are enrolled in Groups C, D,\n      and E and receive a higher dose of rCD4-IgG at the onset of labor. If the mother has not\n      delivered 18 hours after rCD4-IgG injection, a second injection at the same dose is\n      administered; daily injections are given thereafter until delivery. The newborns receive 1\n      of 3 doses of rCD4-IgG daily for the first 5 days of life. Infants are enrolled sequentially\n      to each dose level."
