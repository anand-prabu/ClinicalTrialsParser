Inter-relationships with\n      insulin action, blood pressure, heart and kidney function will be determined before and\n      after a 4-month weight loss and 3-month weight loss maintenance program.\n\n      It is hypothesized that the transition from normal sugar tolerance to impaired sugar\n      tolerance to type 2 diabetes will be accompanied by escalating sympathetic nervous system\n      dysfunction. Furthermore, that weight loss will favorably improve sympathetic function, with\n      greatest benefits occurring in those subjects who are insulin resistant with high blood\n      insulin concentration."
