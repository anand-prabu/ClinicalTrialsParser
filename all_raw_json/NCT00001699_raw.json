This pilot study is designed to gather preliminary data about the feasibility of\n      using several new measures with this population.  To achieve these aims, a convenience\n      sample of approximately 45 adolescents with HIV will re recruited.  The adolescents and\n      their mothers will complete a brief questionnaire about their health beliefs.  A 24-hour\n      recall interview format will be used to assess the adolescents' treatment adherence to\n      prescribed oral medication.  The adolescent will complete recall interviews on three random\n      days over a two week period.  Data analysis will be primarily descriptive, but will be used\n      to generate more specific hypotheses for future research studies.  The long-term goal of\n      this research is to better identify adolescents with HIV at risk for non-adherence and\n      design empirically derived interventions to improve their adherence levels.  The health\n      beliefs measure may also be useful in identifying irrational beliefs about the illness or\n      treatment that can then be targeted for cognitive restructing in psychological\n      interventions."
