The diameters and cross-sectional area are compared to adjacent reference vessel in order to calculate the degree of stenosis. The percentage of significant stenosis detected at various thresholds [e.g., 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, for diameter reduction, and (separately) for area reduction] with each method will be compared in a pair-wise fashion. This will be done with descriptive statistics of the detection rates for each method, and the rate of discordance between the two. In addition to the binary outcome of significant stenosis, the numeric values for diameters and cross-sectional areas will be compared.",
