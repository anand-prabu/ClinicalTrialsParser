  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although statins reduce cardiac events in hypertensive patients with cardiovascular risk
      factors, the effect of statins on coronary flow reserve (CFR) has not been examined in such
      patients. The investigators hypothesize that pitavastatin added to standard antihypertensive
      therapy will be superior to placebo in improving CFR in hypertensive patients with
      cardiovascular risk, and try to examine this hypothesis in a double-blind, randomized
      comparison study using Doppler echocardiography.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Statin treatment improves coronary flow reserve (CFR) and decreases cardiac morbidity and
      mortality in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and hypercholesterolemia.
      Endothelial dysfunction and impairment in coronary microcirculation is also observed in
      hypertensive patients with cardiovascular risk factors. However, the measurement of CFR has
      rarely been performed in hypertensive patients without CAD, because CFR could be invasively
      measured using a Doppler guide wire in a cardiac catheterization laboratory. Recent advances
      in echocardiographic imaging techniques have made it possible to measure coronary flow
      velocity and CFR, which highly correlates with the CFR measured by invasive means.

      Lipid lowering with a statin provided beneficial effects in patients with average levels of
      serum total cholesterol in the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial-Lipid Lowering Arm
      (ASCOT-LLA) study conducted in hypertensive patients at cardiovascular risk. Improvements in
      endothelial dysfunction and CFR may be related to the beneficial effects of statins in
      hypertensive patients without hypercholesterolemia, but the effect of statins on CFR has not
      been examined in such patients. Accordingly, the investigators try to examine the hypothesis
      that pitavastatin added to standard antihypertensive therapy in hypertensive patients with
      cardiovascular risk will be superior to placebo in improving CFR  in a double-blind,
      randomized comparison study using Doppler echocardiography.
