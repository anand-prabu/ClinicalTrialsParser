They lay in three French area, selected according to\n      the density of patients with alcoholic liver disease (ALD) in the area, respectively, \"high\"\n      as in Brittany-Loire, 'average' in Ile de France and \"low\" as in the Languedoc-Roussillon.\n\n      The patients included in the cohort must respond to the following criteria: having liver\n      cirrhosis of whatever origin and age over 18 years. The cirrhosis must be confirmed by the\n      morphological or histological criteria.\n\n      Structured forms and questionnaires will allow the collection of data. Information collected\n      from patients include socio demographic characteristics, medical history, history of\n      consumption of psychotropic (i.e., alcohol or drugs), clinical, biological, histological\n      characteristics and psychological. Inpatients complete a self-assessment structured\n      questionnaire \"Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale\" (HAD).\n\n      Patients are followed until they are registered or not on the national waiting list or die,\n      every 6 months after inclusion until 2 years.\n\n      Statistical analysis will focus on descriptive analysis, survival analysis by Kaplan-Meier,\n      and analytic analysis. Association with registration on the national waiting list of\n      inpatients will be searched using Cox and logistic regression models. Further analyzes will\n      be conducted for example on the differences of opinion between physicians and patients, on\n      regional differences."
