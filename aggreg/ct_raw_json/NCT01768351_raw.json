Several\n      studies show that the benefits are greater with the newer vitamin D analog paricalcitol when\n      compared with calcitriol.\n\n      A large gap exists in our knowledge between epidemiological studies in humans that\n      demonstrate improved outcomes with vitamin D use and observations in preclinical studies\n      demonstrating the pleiotropic effects of vitamin D. To explore the provenance of\n      epidemiological outcomes in patients with CKD, we conducted a pilot placebo-controlled trial\n      to determine whether the use of paricalcitol leads to improvement in anemia, a marker\n      associated with worse outcomes in chronic kidney disease, and whether this effect not only\n      reflects the hyperparathyroidism correction, but is also dependent on the direct effects of\n      paricalcitol on erythroid progenitor cells."
