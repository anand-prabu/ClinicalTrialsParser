  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective, multicenter, observational study will evaluate the sustained response in
      patients with HBeAg positive chronic hepatitis B who are treated with Pegasys according to
      standard of care and in line with the current local labeling in routine clinical practice in
      Vietnam. Eligible patients will be followed for the duration of their treatment and for up
      to 2 years thereafter.
