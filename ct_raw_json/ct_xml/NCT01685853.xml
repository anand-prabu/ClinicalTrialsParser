  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study is intended to evaluate the effectiveness, tolerability, compliance, and
      feasibility of the low volume bowel preparation, bisacodyl tablets followed by 2L
      Polyethylene glycol (PEG) with citrate and simethicone (CS) given the same day of
      colonoscopy, vs the standard 4L split PEG solution.

      Eligible patients will be informed about the aims, procedures, benefits and possible risks
      of the study prior to sign the informed consent form from day -30 to day-3. They will
      provide medical history and undergo a physical examination. Patients will be evaluated by a
      Physician other than the blind Endoscopist. The same responsible person will instruct the
      patients about administration procedures in both oral and written form. The patients will be
      assigned to receive one of the dosing schedule bowel preparation according to a computer
      generated block-randomisation list. Patients will take the study treatment at home according
      to the given instructions. Patients will return to the clinic for colonoscopy. The
      colonoscopy will be performed by an Endoscopist who will be unaware of the bowel
      dose-regimen preparation taken by the patient. Completed colonoscopic exam will be performed
      with time recorded (intubation and withdrawal from ceacum). The unblind Investigator will
      ask the patients about safety, tolerability, overall acceptance and compliance.
