Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive carcinoembryonic antigen peptide 1-6D (CAP 1-6D) emulsified in\n           Montanide ISA-51 adjuvant subcutaneously on day 1.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive CAP 1-6D dissolved in sargramostim (GM-CSF) intradermally on\n           day 1.\n\n      Treatment repeats in both arms every 3 weeks for 6 courses in the absence of disease\n      progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed at 3 weeks and then as necessary.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10-36 patients (5-18 per arm) will be accrued for this study\n      within 36 months."
