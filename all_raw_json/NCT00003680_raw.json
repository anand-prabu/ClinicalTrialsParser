Combining chemotherapy with peripheral stem cell\n      transplantation may allow the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill\n      more tumor cells. It is not yet known whether high-dose chemotherapy plus peripheral stem\n      cell transplantation is more effective than standard chemotherapy for breast cancer.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of standard chemotherapy\n      with that of high-dose chemotherapy plus peripheral stem cell transplantation in treating\n      women who have advanced breast cancer or inflammatory breast cancer."

Compare the overall survival in locally advanced, inflammatory, or operable\n      large primary breast cancer (greater than 3 cm) patients with positive axillary lymph nodes\n      at surgery following primary chemotherapy, receiving either conventional chemotherapy or\n      high dose chemotherapy as adjuvant therapy. II. Compare the relapse-free survival and\n      quality of life in these patients receiving this therapy.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter, open label study. Patients are stratified by\n      study center and number of positive axillary lymph nodes at surgery. Patients are randomized\n      to receive conventional or high dose adjuvant chemotherapy. Arm I: Patients receive\n      conventional chemotherapy consisting of cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil IV\n      administered once every 3 weeks for 8 courses. Arm II: Patients receive high dose\n      chemotherapy. Cyclophosphamide IV is administered on day 1. Patients undergo peripheral\n      blood progenitor cell (PBPC) collection, then receive cyclophosphamide and thiotepa IV for 4\n      days, 13-28 days after PBPC collection. Peripheral blood progenitor cells are then\n      reinfused. Patients undergo radiotherapy during or after chemotherapy and receive oral\n      tamoxifen for 5 years, beginning at the same time as radiotherapy. Estrogen receptor\n      negative patients may receive tamoxifen at the discretion of the treating physician. Quality\n      of life is assessed before chemotherapy, then at 6, 12, and 24 months. Patients are followed\n      at 12, 18, and 24 months, then annually for 5 years or until death.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: This study will accrue approximately 300 patients."
