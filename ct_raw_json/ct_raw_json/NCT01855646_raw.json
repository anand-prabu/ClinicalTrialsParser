The intervention will be an improved and more structured\n      face to face sign-out process using a standardized admission sign-out sheet, which is not\n      part of the official medical record.  Daytime admitting physicians will assign an acuity\n      score to their patients in which the severity of illness will be scored from 1-7, with 7\n      being the most sick / likely to have rapid response team (RRT) or adverse event.  The\n      assignment of this score would be based off of the clinician's judgment in the patient's\n      overall assessment.  All patients, age >18 years, admitted to the non-resident hospital\n      medicine general medicine service at DRH will be study eligible.  Data analysis will examine\n      aggregate hospitalist perception of sign-out practice before and after intervention, total\n      number of RRTs, unplanned transfers, and rapid responses pre and post intervention,\n      percentage of hospitalist based patients of overall rapid responses pre and post\n      intervention, percentage of hospitalists using acuity scores, and average and mean severity\n      score of patients with rapid responses compared with those admitted.  Patients have a risk\n      of loss of confidentiality."
