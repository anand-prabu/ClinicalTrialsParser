  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multi-center, non-randomized, open-label, single-dose, parallel group study to determine the
      effect of impaired hepatic function on the PK of deferiprone and its 3-O-glucuronide
      metabolite following a single oral dose of 33mg/kg Ferriprox®.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Post-marketing study to evaluate the effect of impaired hepatic function on the
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of deferiprone and its 3-O-glucuronide metabolite and on the safety of
      Ferriprox® in subjects with mild and moderate hepatic impairment as compared to healthy
      volunteers.

    <measure>From serum and urine deferiprone concentration-time profiles: Cmax, Tmax, AUC0-t,AUC0-∞ ,T½ , CL/F,,CLr, Vd/F, Ae, Fe. From serum and urine deferiprone 3-O-glucuronide concentration-time profiles: Cmax, Tmax, AUC0-t, AUC0-∞, T½, CLr, Ae.</measure>
    <time_frame>Prior to dosing and at 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.333, 1.667, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 16 and 24 hours post-dose</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Pharmacokinetic parameters will be assessed over a 24 hour interval using blood and urine samples for analyses of deferiprone and its 3-O-glucuronide metabolite in subjects with normal, mild and moderate hepatic impairment.</description>

    <time_frame>Prior to dosing until 48 hours post-dose.</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>Yes</safety_issue>
    <description>Safety and tolerability will be assessed based on changes in: physical examinations, vital signs, 12-lead ECG, clinical laboratory tests, use of concomitant medication and frequency of  adverse events (AEs) following a single dose of Ferriprox.</description>

        Main Inclusion Criteria:

        All subjects:

          1. Adult males or females, 18 - 75 years of age (inclusive);

          2. Body weight ≥ 50 kg;

          3. Body mass index (BMI) between 19 and 32 kg/mE2  (inclusive);

          4. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of &gt;1.5x10E9/L ;

        Healthy volunteers:

          1. Medically healthy with clinically insignificant screening results (e.g., laboratory
             profiles, medical history, vital signs, physical examination);

          2. Matched to hepatically impaired subjects in the study by age (+/- 10 years), sex and
             weight (+/- 15% BMI).

        Hepatically impaired subjects:

          1. Considered clinically stable in the opinion of the Investigator;

          2. Subjects with different degrees of impaired hepatic function as assessed by a
             Child-Pugh classification score: mild (Class A: 5-6 points) and moderate (Class B:
             7-9 points) impaired hepatic function.

        Main Exclusion Criteria:

          1. For subjects with hepatic impairment, fluctuating or rapidly deteriorating hepatic
             function as indicated by clinical and/or laboratory signs of hepatic impairment (e.g.
             advanced ascites, infection of ascites, fever, or active gastrointestinal bleeding).

          2. Evidence of liver impairment in healthy volunteers: hepatitis B and C; or aspartate
             aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), bilirubin, clotting factors,
             serum protein that is considered clinically significant by the Investigator;

          3. History or presence of significant clinically unstable respiratory, cardiovascular,
             pulmonary, hepatic (except for subjects assigned to one of the hepatically impaired
             groups), renal, hematologic, gastrointestinal, endocrine (except for subjects with
             hepatic impairment with clinically stable and treated diabetes, hypertension and
             thyroid disorders), immunologic, dermatologic, neurologic, or psychiatric disease;

          4. Disorders or surgery of the gastrointestinal tract which may interfere with drug
             absorption or may otherwise influence the PK of the investigational medicinal product
             (e.g. resections of the small or large intestine, febrile conditions, chronic
             diarrhea, chronic vomiting, clinically unstable endocrine disease, severe infections,
             acute inflammations, etc.);

          5. Received a pharmacological agent in another clinical trial within 28 days prior to
             the first dose of the study;
