Patients are stratified according to tumor (tumors\n      other than gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) vs GIST).\n\n      Patients receive brostallicin IV over 10 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days\n      for at least 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed every 2 months for 1 year and then every 4 months for 1 year.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 58-72 patients (40 for stratum I and 18-32 for stratum II)\n      will be accrued for this study."
