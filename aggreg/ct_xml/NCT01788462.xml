  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleep-disordered breathing is characterized primarily by partial or total upper airway
      obstruction during sleep. The most common form of sleep-disordered breathing is obstructive
      sleep apnea (OSA) due to recurrent collapse of the upper airway with the onset of sleep
      state. The major risk factors associated with the development of sleep apnea are obesity and
      male sex. The investigators have also found a high prevalence of OSA in HIV infected men and
      women, particularly among those with central lipohypertrophy, which is a common finding in
      HIV-infected persons receiving antiretroviral therapy. Currently, our overall hypothesis is
      that visceral adiposity, as seen in HIV-infected persons with central lipohypertrophy,
      alters both mechanical properties and compensatory neuromuscular responses leading to upper
      airway obstruction. Based on our most recent findings in the non-HIV population, the
      investigators demonstrate that obesity is associated with elevations in the upper airway
      load (passive Pcrit) that are counterbalanced by compensatory upper airway neural responses.
      Moreover, the investigators have found that female sex, peripheral adiposity, and younger
      age are associated with increased compensatory neuromuscular responses, while male sex,
      central adiposity, and older age are associated with blunted compensatory responses. The
      loss of the compensatory neuromuscular responses leads to obstructive sleep apnea.  Among
      HIV-infected patients with central lipohypertrophy, tesamorelin (Egrifta), a growth hormone
      releasing hormone (GHRH) analogue, is approved for the reduction of visceral adipose tissue.
       The investigators hypothesize that tesamorelin therapy  will reverse both the mechanical
      and neurocompensatory alterations associated with increased central obesity. In this project
      the investigators will determine whether tesamorelin affects sleep apnea severity and
      compensatory neuromuscular responses of the upper airway on sleep and breathing in men and
      women with HIV infection. The proposed studies are designed to elucidate the
      pathophysiologic basis for the development of obstructive sleep apnea in this population.
      The studies also provide insights into the neurohumoral regulation of upper airway function,
      and potentially new approaches to the treatment for sleep-disordered breathing.

        Men and women with HIV infection and central lipohypertrophy about to start tesamorelin
        therapy will be recruited from the Endocrinology Clinic at the Johns Hopkins Outpatient
        Center.  Physicians and members of the clinical staff will identify eligible men and
        briefly introduce the study to them. Patients will be offered a phone number for the Johns
        Hopkins Sleep Disorders Center to call if they are interested in learning more about the
        research study.
