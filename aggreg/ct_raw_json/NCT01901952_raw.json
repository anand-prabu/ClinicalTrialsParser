            "textblock": "This project is a randomized controlled trial to test an innovative lifestyle intervention\n      to achieve sustained improvements in glycemic control among low-income African American\n      diabetes patients. The LIFE (Lifestyle Improvement through Food and Exercise) program is a\n      diabetes self-management program focused on diet and exercise, informed by anthropological\n      research on models of food and health among low-income African-Americans. Pilot work\n      demonstrated that the LIFE Program is effective in improving glycemic control among\n      low-income African Americans at 6-months. The main goal of the current study is to determine\n      whether the LIFE Program can achieve sustained improvements in glycemic control for 12\n      months. The trial will randomize low-income African American adults with diabetes to a\n      control group, which receives standard diabetes education, or an intervention group, which\n      receives the LIFE Program (28 group meetings with peer support telephone calls) followed by\n      a 6-month maintenance phase (quarterly group sessions with monthly peer support phone\n      calls). The primary aim of the proposed research is to compare low-income African American\n      diabetes patients receiving the LIFE Program with those in a standard of care control group\n      on change in glycemic control at 12 months. Our primary hypothesis is that patients in the\n      intervention group will achieve a change in A1c from baseline that is less than patients in\n      the control group. Secondary aims are to compare low-income African American diabetes\n      patients receiving the LIFE Program with those in a standard of care control group on (a)\n      change in glycemic control at 18 months; (b) change in physical activity and total energy\n      intake at 12 months; (c) change in physical activity and total energy intake at 18 months;\n      and (d) to obtain estimates needed for a subsequent trial, including weight, blood pressure,\n      and diabetes-related hospitalizations. For secondary aims we hypothesize that a) the\n      intervention group will achieve a mean 18-month change in A1C that is less than the change\n      in the control group; b) at 12 months, a greater proportion of intervention patients will\n      have achieved the activity goal of 150 minutes of moderate activity per week, and the\n      intervention group will achieve a greater reduction from baseline in mean total energy\n      intake than the control group; and c) at 18 months, a greater proportion of intervention\n      patients will have achieved the activity goal of 150 minutes of moderate activity per week,\n      and the intervention group will achieve a greater reduction from baseline in mean total\n      energy intake than the control group."
