  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed clinical trial is a phase I, open-label, multi-center, dose-escalation study of
      ALT-803 in patients with surgically incurable advanced melanoma.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial will investigate the safety and immunogenicity, immunomodulatory properties, and
      clinical benefits of treatment with weekly doses of ALT-803 administered intravenously in
      patients with advanced melanoma.

    <description>Safety and effectiveness of ALT-803 on the peripheral blood white blood cell (WBC) and absolute lymphocyte (ALC) counts. Defined by the increase in the total number of peripheral lymphocytes during the first cycle. The safety endpoint is the MTD of ALT-803, defined as the dose level below that at which ≥2 of 6 patients experience a DLT. The efficacy endpoint is the OBD, defined as that which produces an ALC ≥25,000/µL and/or a total WBC ≥35,000/µL among 2/3 of patients. For safety, we have also defined an &quot;exceeding OBD&quot; as the occurrence of ALC ≥35,000/µL and/or WBC ≥50,000/µL.</description>

        ENTRY CRITERIA:

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS:

             consent to forgo FDA-approved therapies that increase median survival.

          -  At least 4 weeks from last dose of prior chemotherapy or non-antibody immunomodulator
             therapy with full recovery of acute toxicities.

          -  At least 2 weeks from last dose for patients coming off of BRAF inhibitor or other
             molecularly targeted therapy with full recovery of toxicities.
