  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of
      niraparib as maintenance in platinum sensitive ovarian cancer patients who have either
      gBRCAmut or a tumor with high-grade serous histology and who have responded to their most
      recent chemotherapy containing a platinum agent.  Niraparib is an orally active PARP
      inhibitor. Niraparib or placebo (in a 2:1 ratio) will be administered once daily
      continuously during a 28-day cycle. Health-related quality of life will be measured by the
      Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Ovarian Symptom Index (FOSI), European Quality of
      Life scale, 5-Dimensions (EQ-5D), and a neuropathy questionnaire.  Safety and tolerability
      will be assessed by clinical review of adverse events (AEs), physical examinations,
      electrocardiograms (ECGs), and safety laboratory values.

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate efficacy of niraparib as maintenance
      therapy in patients who have platinum sensitive ovarian cancer as assessed by the
      prolongation of progression free survival (PFS).
