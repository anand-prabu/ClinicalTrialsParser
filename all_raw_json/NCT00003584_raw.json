Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.\n      Prednisone may help to relieve symptoms in patients with recurrent and/or metastatic kidney\n      cancer.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy consisting of\n      vinorelbine and estramustine with or without prednisone in treating patients who have\n      recurrent and/or metastatic kidney cancer."

Obtain pilot data exploring the value\n      of anti-inflammatory treatment in the management of severe systemic symptoms and improvement\n      of treatment tolerance in this patient population.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to number of risk factors (0,1 versus 2 versus\n      3). Patients receive vinorelbine IV on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 28, and 35. Patients also receive\n      estramustine orally twice per day on days 1-7 and an increased dose on days 8-42. A tapered\n      dose of oral prednisone is given to patients with an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation\n      rate. A course of treatment consists of 6 weeks of treatment followed by 2 weeks of rest.\n      Patients with stable disease may receive up to 4 courses of treatment. Patients who achieve\n      a partial response may undergo surgical resection followed by up to 2 additional courses of\n      treatment or an interleukin-2 treatment regimen. Patients with a complete response receive 1\n      additional course of treatment. Patients are followed until death.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 35 patients will be accrued for this study."
