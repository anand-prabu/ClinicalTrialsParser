In a natural cycle another hormone takes part in the process\n      (FSH). To induce a natural-like ovulation surge that includes LH and FSH , GnRH agonist can\n      be given.\n\n      The purpose of this study is to find out which approach may work better in IVF patients who\n      experienced 4 IVF failures."
