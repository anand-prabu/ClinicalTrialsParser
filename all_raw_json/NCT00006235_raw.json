Determine the maximum tolerated dose of doxorubicin HCl liposome (Doxil) when\n      combined with carboplatin in patients with recurrent ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary\n      peritoneal cancer. II. Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients. III.\n      Determine the rate of response in patients treated with this regimen.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation, multicenter study of doxorubicin HCl liposome (Doxil).\n      Patients receive Doxil IV over 1 hour and carboplatin IV on day 1. Treatment continues every\n      4 weeks for a minimum of 6 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease\n      progression. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of Doxil until the maximum\n      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the highest dose at which 0 or 1\n      of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2\n      years, then every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter until recurrence or\n      death.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 24 patients will be accrued for this study over 1 year."
