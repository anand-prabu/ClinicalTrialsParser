The KCCQ summary score independently predicts clinical outcomes such as hospitalization and mortality in outpatients with HF, including those recently hospitalized for acute decompensation. It is a reliable and valid measure in HF patients that is more sensitive to change than other measures of QOL, and is especially responsive in patients with multiple comorbidities.
