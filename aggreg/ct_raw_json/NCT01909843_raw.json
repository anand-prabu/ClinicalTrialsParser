The study is an open label\n      trial with a sequential administration regimen of placebo and verum in all planned study\n      subjects. Each subject will start the treatment with a single dose of ALX-0171 placebo (=\n      formulation buffer) followed by escalating doses of ALX-0171 verum.\n\n      Eventually a second administration of ALX-0171 placebo may take place at the end of the\n      study (as defined per protocol)."
