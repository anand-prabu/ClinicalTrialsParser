  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Standard method of colonoscopy is to insert the colonoscope rapidly to reach the cecum, with
      careful inspection and polypectomy during the withdrawal phase. However, small polyps (e.g.
      &lt;1cm) seen during insertion phase are difficult to find during withdrawal phase. Also, colon
      is in different conformation during insertion and withdrawal phases. We think careful
      inspection and polypectomy during both insertion and withdrawal can improve adenoma
      detection rate.
