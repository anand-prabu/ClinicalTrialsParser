  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients who are admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) commonly suffer from shock, a
      condition that causes life-threatening low blood pressure.  Low blood pressure makes it
      difficult for the body to deliver blood to all of its organs.  The standard treatment
      doctors in the ICU use for their patients is to give medications that help increase blood
      pressure.  These medications are called vasopressors.  There can be side effects related to
      using vasopressors.  The purpose of this research study is to determine if it is better to
      give vasopressors to patients to maintain a higher blood pressure target versus a lower
      blood pressure target.  This study is important because the information we find out will
      help us know how best to administer vasopressors in patients with shock in the ICU.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Who are older than 16 years of age at the time of eligibility.

          2. Who are under the direct care of the ICU team regardless of location.

          3. Who have received a minimum of 30 mL/kg of intravenous fluids (2100 mL for a 70 kg
             patient) before enrolment OR the most responsible physician has good reasons to
             believe that more fluid resuscitation is no longer required and could be harmful.

          4. Who the treating physician believes will need vasopressors for at least 6 hours once
             enrolled.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Have received vasopressors for more than 24 consecutive hours; if vasopressors are
             discontinued for &gt;= 2 hours then restarting vasopressors will constitute a distinct
             vasopressor episode and the clock will be reset.

          2. Are judged by the treating physician to be in obvious cardiogenic shock after an
             acute myocardial infarction (based on new ST segment elevations on ECG or obvious
             echocardiographic findings).

          3. Have obvious haemorrhagic shock as a consequence of a clearly identified source of
             blood loss.

          4. Require vasopressors after cardiac surgery as a result of cardiopulmonary
             bypass-induced hypotension.

          5. Who have a specific indication for catecholamine therapy other than shock (i.e.
             angioedema or intracranial hypertension).

          6. If the attending team has agreed to withhold or withdraw life sustaining care.

          7. Concurrent enrollment in interventional trials that do not meet guidelines (see
             ccctg.ca) for co-enrollment (co-enrollment is permissible if there is no potential
             interaction between the protocols; this will be addressed case by case).

          8. Prior randomization in this study.
