  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess a relatively new PET (Positron emission tomography)
      radiotracer called FACBC in the assessment of head and neck cancer. FDG (Flourine
      Deoxyglucose) is currently used for PET imaging, but has limitations in head and neck
      cancer. These limitations include problems with specificity, high background uptake from
      normal structures, difficulty delineating intracranial invasion, and the need to wait
      several weeks after chemotherapy and radiation before imaging. As an amino acid radiotracer,
      rather than a glucose radiotracer, FACBC overcomes some of these limitations. FACBC does not
      yet have FDA (Food and Drug Administration) approval, but does show promise in initial work
      in patients with prostate cancer and brain tumors. Dosimetry work on FACBC has been
      performed at Emory.

      Our study is a pilot study looking at 10 patients with a new diagnosis of biopsy proven
      squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity who will be able to go on to definitive surgical
      resection (ie, surgery without preceding chemotherapy or radiation). Patients must have
      pre-surgical imaging, either with a contrast enhanced CT, FDG PET, or MRI. Patients who
      consent to participate will receive one FACBC PET/CT of the neck, which will require a low
      dose &quot;transmission&quot; CT of the neck, an intravenous injection of the radiotracer, and imaging
      of the neck that will last up to 1 hour. Patients will have to lie still during the imaging
      time. Total participation time including set up should be less than 90 minutes. Imaging
      results will be analyzed and compared with conventional imaging as well as the surgical
      pathology results

          2. Prior history of carcinoma.

          3. Not a candidate for surgical resection based upon clinical condition or discovery of
             metastatic disease which would preclude surgical therapy.
