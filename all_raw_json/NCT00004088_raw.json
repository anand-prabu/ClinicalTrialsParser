            "textblock": "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop cancer cells from\n      dividing so they stop growing or die. Peripheral stem cell transplantation may allow doctors\n      to give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill more cancer cells. Biological therapies,\n      such as interferon alfa, use different ways to stimulate the immune system and stop cancer\n      cells from growing. Thalidomide may stop the growth of cancer cells by stopping blood flow\n      to the tumor. Pamidronate may help to reduce the side effects of treatment for multiple\n      myeloma.\n\n      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying combination chemotherapy, peripheral stem cell\n      transplantation, biological therapy, pamidronate, and thalidomide to see how well they work\n      in treating patients with stage I, stage II, or stage III multiple myeloma."

PBSCs are collected beginning on day 10.\n\n      Patients receive high-dose melphalan IV on day -1. PBSCs are reinfused on day 0. G-CSF is\n      administered IV or SC daily beginning on day 1 and continuing until blood counts recover.\n      Between 8 and 14 weeks later, patients receive high-dose busulfan IV every 6 hours on days\n      -7 to -4 and cyclophosphamide IV over 2 hours on days -3 and -2. PBSCs are reinfused on day\n      0 and G-CSF is administered IV or SC daily until blood counts recover.\n\n      Patients with responding or stable disease after chemotherapy receive maintenance therapy\n      with interferon alfa beginning 14-20 weeks after day 0 of the second course of chemotherapy.\n      Interferon alfa is administered SC 3 times a week for 3 years. Patients also receive\n      pamidronate IV every 4 weeks until disease progression. Patients who are not in complete\n      remission (CR) 6 months after completing the second course of chemotherapy receive oral\n      thalidomide daily for a maximum of 1 year or for 3 months after achieving CR.\n\n      Patients are followed monthly for 1 year, every 3 months for 1 year, and then periodically\n      thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 70 patients will be accrued for this study within\n      approximately 2.5 years."
