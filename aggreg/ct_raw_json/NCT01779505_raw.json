We have generated a Tarmogen expressing well conserved\n      regions of the HBV X, S, and core antigens (GS-4774).  GS-4774 is immunogenic in murine\n      models and has also been used to stimulate human immune cell samples ex vivo to elicit HBV\n      specific T cell responses which could predict the immune responses in patients dosed with\n      GS-4774.  GS-4774 will be evaluated in this healthy volunteer study to assess its safety,\n      tolerability, and ability to elicit HBV specific T cell responses.  In the future GS-4774\n      could be used in combination with HBV antivirals, such as tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, in\n      an attempt to improve HBsAg seroconversion (cure) rates in patients with chronic HBV\n      infection."
