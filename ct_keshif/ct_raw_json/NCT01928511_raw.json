While HBeAg seroconversion is a more achievable endpoint, only\n      20-25% of patients develop this after one year of oral antiviral therapy. HBsAg\n      seroclearance is universally infrequent. Strategies to improve these endpoints such as\n      combination oral antiviral therapy have not been generally successful and recently studies\n      have examined the possibility of switching or adding peginterferon therapy. However these\n      have not been tested adequately in the group of patients that have been on long term oral\n      antiviral therapy. Consequently this study was conceived to evaluate whether switching or\n      adding peginterferon compared to continuing oral antiviral therapy are more efficacious\n      strategies. HBeAg positive and HBeAg negative patients (n=310)will be randomised to continue\n      oral antiviral therapy, switch or add pegylated interferon for 48 weeks in a ratio of 1:2:2\n      respectively. The study endpoints are HBsAg seroclearance, reduction of qHBsAg >1 log,\n      qHBsAg<200 IU/ml, HBeAg loss and seroconversion, and HBV DNA suppression, all at week 72."
