For a design with P0=0.40, P1=0.60; \u03b1=0.1\n      and \u03b2=0.1.

At the second stage, another 28 patients (total\n      46 patients) would be enrolled into the study. To reject the null hypothesis for the SFT\n      stratum 23 responses or more (Choi criteria), out of the 46 patients, are needed.\n\n      To estimate the simple size for stratum 2 (EMC), a Simon's optimal 2-stage phase II design\n      has been used, having considered the very scarce published information on response rate\n      based on RECIST criteria. For a design with P0= 0.05, P1= 0.25, \u03b1=0.1 and \u03b2=0.1. At the\n      first stage, 9 patients should be enrolled into the study, if there are not responses the\n      trial will be terminated and it will be concluded that pazopanib is not sufficiently active.\n      If there is at least 1 response in this first stage, the trial will be continued and at the\n      second stage, another 15 patients (total 24 patients) would be enrolled into the study. To\n      reject the null hypothesis for the EMC stratum 3 responses or more (RECIST criteria), out of\n      the 24 patients, are needed.\n\n      For variables that follow binomial distributions (e.g. response rate) frequency and\n      percentages will be calculated, together with their corresponding exact 95% confidence\n      intervals. For time-to-event variables (e.g. PFS or OS) Kaplan-Meier estimations will be\n      used. To analyze the reduction of risk and the influence of other variables on time-to-event\n      variables Cox Regression will be applied. To correlate pharmacodynamics markers and\n      biomarkers with clinical response standard methods for bivariate and multivariate regression\n      and correlation will be used."
