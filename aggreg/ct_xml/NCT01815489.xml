  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Necrotizing pancreatitis is a severe form of inflammation of the pancreas with subsequent
      destruction of the pancreas (necrosis).  Often, this condition manifests in patients as an
      overwhelming systemic inflammatory response and multisystem organ failure.  Many times the
      pancreas can become superinfected with bacteria and other organisms as a result of this
      process.  Clinicians may decide to sample fluid from the pancreas or pancreatic tissue to
      determine the presence of infection. This can be done through surgery with a concurrent
      debridement and drainage of the pancreas or by a radiologist using an ultrasound or CT
      guided method to sample the pancreatic fluid.  These samples are then sent for culture in
      the microbiology laboratory.  Culture results often reveal 1-2 types of infecting bacteria
      that originate from the gastrointestinal tract.  The investigators hypothesize that in
      actuality, many different kinds of bacteria may infect the pancreas.  This project uses
      molecular DNA techniques to help identify bacteria present in the pancreas of patients with
      severe necrotizing pancreatitis.

      In this study, patients with severe necrotizing pancreatitis will be followed prospectively
      throughout their hospital course (anticipated duration of hospitalization ranging between
      4-8 weeks).  If patients are suspected to have infection of pancreatic necrosis, they will
      be consented for enrollment.  Patients will be determined by their attending physician to
      require either operative intervention or radiologic guided drainage of pancreatic necrosis
      and infected peripancreatic fluid.  At the time of drainage procedure or intervention, one
      sample of peripancreatic fluid will be sent to the hospital's microbiology department for
      standard gram stain and bacterial culture identification and a second sample will be frozen
      for bacterial DNA analysis.  Patients will be followed for the duration of their
      hospitalization for in hospital outcomes, mortality and final microbiology culture results.
      Samples will then be processed at six months and one year following sample collection for
      bacterial DNA deep sequencing analysis and will be compared to bacteria identified using
      standard culture technique.
