After 48 hours of SAGE-547 treatment, the continuous IV\n      AED (third-line agent) will be weaned while continuing SAGE-547 at the maintenance infusion\n      for the remainder of the treatment period. After 96 hours (4 days) of therapy with SAGE-547,\n      the dose will be tapered and discontinued over 24 hours.\n\n      The subjects will have routine continuous EEG monitoring during the Screening period, and\n      continuing until 48 hours after SAGE-547 treatment has completed. Subjects will then have\n      follow-up examinations weekly for the next 3 weeks (Days 8, 15, 22, and 29), during which\n      safety and functional assessments will be obtained. Apart from treatment with SAGE-547, all\n      subjects will receive the standard of care for adults in SRSE along with ongoing treatment\n      for all underlying medical conditions."
