Evidence from human intervention studies suggests\n      that both whey and casein may be effective in blood pressure-lowering, however there is\n      limited data on the impact of milk proteins on vascular function. This research aims to\n      compare the potential acute and chronic impacts of the two main milk proteins (whey and\n      casein) with maltodextrin on blood pressure and vascular function. Furthermore, the effects\n      of these proteins on the markers of insulin resistance, lipid metabolism and inflammatory\n      status will also be investigated in 'at-risk' individuals."
