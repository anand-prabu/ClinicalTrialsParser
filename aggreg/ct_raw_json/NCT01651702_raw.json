            "textblock": "Background:\n\n      Three dimensional anatomical mapping is an established method facilitating ablation of\n      cardiac arrhythmias. It is nowadays an excepted method especially for complex arrhythmias\n      such as atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia.\n\n      The most commonly used systems are CARTO\u00ae System (Biosense Webster, Inc., Diamond Bar, CA,\n      USA) and EnSite NavX\u2122 (St. Jude Medical, Inc., St. Paul, MN, USA). These mapping systems\n      have helped to decrease procedural complexity, procedure time, and improve safety. The\n      EnSite NavX system uses impedance measurements between the individual catheter electrodes\n      and the patches placed on the patient's chest and abdomen. The CARTO system utilizes\n      magnetic location technology to provide accurate visualization of the magnet sensor-equipped\n      catheter tip.\n\n      These two systems has been compared in only a few studies. Different results have been found\n      in simple  ablations versus more complex ablation of atrial fibrillation. Recent technical\n      advances resulted in the development of new versions of both systems. Carto Express version\n      allows quicker mapping and reconstruction of heart cavities and great vessels geometry as\n      compared to previous versions of Carto XP. EnSite Velocity system incorporates more precise\n      catheter visualization, and allows quicker mapping as compared to previous version of\n      EnSite.\n\n      To the best of the investigators knowledge no studies have been performed for direct\n      comparison of the newer versions of these two systems.\n\n      Study design Prospective single-center non-randomized open label comparison study. Primary\n      objective Comparison of Carto Express system vs. EnSite Velocity system for ablation of\n      complex arrhythmias.\n\n      End points:\n\n        1. Procedure duration.\n\n        2. Fluoroscopy time\n\n        3. Procedure success -will be measured in terms of the 1-year recurrent arrhythmia rate\n           Study population Patients planned for ablation of complex arrhythmia."
