Medications: Daily doses of medication, which in the opinion of the investigator,\n             might interfere with the perception of pain, are being taken. Examples of such\n             medications include analgesics, anticonvulsants, antihistamines that cause marked or\n             moderate sedation, sedatives, tranquilizers, mood-altering and anti-inflammatory\n             drugs.\n\n          5. Dentition Exclusions: a) Sensitive teeth not expected to respond to treatment with an\n             over-the- counter dentifrice in the opinion of the investigator. b) Teeth with\n             exposed dentine but with deep, defective or facial restorations, teeth used as\n             abutments for fixed or removable partial dentures, teeth with full crowns,\n             orthodontic bands, extensive caries or cracked enamel. Sensitive teeth with\n             contributing etiologies other than erosion, abrasion or recession of exposed dentine.\n             c) Dental professional hygiene (includes dental prophylaxis, irrigation, and\n             intensive anti-microbial/anti-biotic therapy) within 14 days of the screening visit.\n             d) Presence of dental implants. e) Lip or tongue piercings. f) Periodontal surgical\n             history within the past 6 months or have been scaled /root planed within the past 3\n             months.\n\n          6. Allergy/Intolerance: Known or suspected intolerance or hypersensitivity to the study\n             materials (or closely related compounds) or any of their stated ingredients.\n\n          7. Clinical Study/Experimental Medication: a) Participation in another clinical study or\n             receipt of an investigational drug within 30 days of the screening visit b) Previous\n             participation in this study.\n\n          8. Other: Any subject who in the opinion of the investigator, should not participate in\n             the study."
