For corticosteroids, this will mean prednisone\n             \u2265 0.5 mg/kg/day, or equivalent. Inhaled and topical steroids are allowed.\n\n          -  Administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol within the period\n             starting 30 days before and ending 30 days after the study vaccine dose, with the\n             exception of a licensed inactivated influenza vaccine which can be administered at\n             any time during the study according to the local recommendations.\n\n          -  Concurrently participating in another clinical study, at any time during the study\n             period, in which the subject has been or will be exposed to an investigational or a\n             non-investigational vaccine/product.\n\n          -  Previous vaccination with meningococcal vaccine except the meningococcal vaccination\n             received in the Hib-MenC-TT-016 study.\n\n          -  History of meningococcal disease.\n\n          -  Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition (congenital\n             or secondary), including Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)infection, based on\n             medical history and physical examination (no laboratory testing required).\n\n          -  Family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency.\n\n          -  History of any reaction or hypersensitivity likely to be exacerbated by any component\n             of the vaccine, and history of serious allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) following the\n             administration of vaccine(s).\n\n          -  Major congenital defects or serious chronic illness.\n\n          -  History of any neurological disorders or seizures, including GBS. History of a\n             simple, single febrile seizure is permitted.\n\n          -  Acute disease and/or fever at the time of enrollment.\n\n               -  Fever is defined as temperature \u2265 37.5\u00b0C for oral, axillary or tympanic route,\n                  or \u2265 38.0\u00b0C for rectal route. The preferred route for recording temperature in\n                  this study will be oral.\n\n               -  Subjects with a minor illness (such as mild diarrhoea, mild upper respiratory\n                  infection) without fever may be enrolled at the discretion of the investigator.\n\n          -  Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the 3 months\n             preceding the study vaccination or planned administration during the booster\n             vaccination phase of the study (i.e. between Visit 1 and Visit 2) and within 3 months\n             preceding the blood sampling at Visit 3 and Visit 4.\n\n        The following criteria should be checked for the long-term persistence phase at two and\n        four years after booster vaccination (Visit 3 and Visit 4):\n\n        In case an exclusion criterion becomes applicable, the subject will not enter the\n        long-term follow-up of that particular year and the reason will be documented.\n\n          -  Previous administration of a meningococcal vaccine with the exception of the\n             meningococcal vaccination given in the primary study and the booster vaccination in\n             this particular study.\n\n          -  History of meningococcal disease."
