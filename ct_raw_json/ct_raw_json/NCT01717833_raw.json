NEMS has also been used as a preventive tool\n      for intensive care unit (ICU) acquired weakness (ICUAW). Its role as a tool for post ICU\n      rehabilitation has not been evaluated so far.\n\n      A randomized intervention study was designed to assess the efficacy of NEMS, as a\n      rehabilitative tool for critical illness survivors. The first day that patients are\n      discharged from the ICU after stratified randomization are assigned to the NEMS group or to\n      the control group.  In the NEMS group, NEMS will be applied to both lower extremities of the\n      NEMS -group simultaneously (quadriceps femoris muscle and peroneus longus) on a daily basis,\n      along with a personalized exercise program. NEMS sessions will continue until patient\n      discharge from hospital. In the control group, sham NEMS will be applied along with standard\n      care when it comes to physiotherapy. At hospital discharge patients of both groups of will\n      receive a rehabilitation booklet. Patients on the NEMS group that have significant muscle\n      weakness will  have NEMS sessions at home for a period of 2 months. Patients are evaluated\n      at 3 and 6 months after hospital discharge"
