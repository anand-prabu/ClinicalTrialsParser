(If they wish to have a larger breast size increase, then they\n             must understand a secondary procedure may be required to achieve that size increase).\n\n          -  Patients must have a normal physical exam with no breast masses, no nipple discharge,\n             no fibrocystic disease, no axillary adenopathy and/or history of abnormal bleeding.\n\n          -  Patients must not be pregnant or lactating when enrolled in the study and must agree\n             to have a pregnancy test (urine or blood) prior to the surgical procedure.  - The\n             patient should also not be trying to get pregnant during the course of the study.\n\n          -  Patients must have a stable weight and not be fluctuating in their weight (otherwise\n             this will distort volumetric measurements of breast size post operatively, making it\n             impossible to determine true augmentation volume from SVF-enriched AFG).\n\n          -  Patients must also consent to be photographed before and after the procedure and at\n             the end of the study.\n\n          -  All patients in the level I (randomized) and level II (nonrandomized) part of the\n             study must also consent to undergo ultrasound imaging of the breast prior to the\n             procedure and after the procedure to evaluate and treat any oil-filled cysts that may\n             arise due to the procedure.\n\n          -  All patients in the level I (randomized) and level II (nonrandomized) part of the\n             study must also consent to allow their results to be included in any scientific\n             research, scientific publication, or presentations at scientific meetings.\n\n          -  All patients in the level I and level II part of the study must also consent to allow\n             their photos to be used for publication in scientific journals, internet website, and\n             patient educational material such as brochures, before and after photos, and patient\n             education videos.\n\n          -  All patients in the study must also agree to have mammography done when indicated\n             after the procedure.\n\n          -  All patients in the study must agree to have a biopsy of any suspicious abnormality\n             seen on mammography, ultrasound, or MRI during the study.\n\n          -  Patients must not be anemic at the time of the procedure (Hg < 10).  If they are\n             anemic at the time of enrollment, they can still be included in the study if the\n             anemia is corrected pre-operatively with iron supplementation.

If a UTI is present, the patient may still enroll if this\n             is treated pre-operatively\n\n          -  If a multigenerational family history of breast cancer or ovarian cancer is present,\n             a surgical or medical oncologist must evaluate the patient to obtain pre-operative\n             clearance and to provide reassurance that they do not need BRCA testing.\n\n          -  Patients with prior radiation to the chest wall (for Hodgkin's disease) may not be\n             included in the study.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  Patients with a positive pregnancy test\n\n          -  Patients with an abnormal breast exam\n\n          -  Patients with a bleeding disorder who are on anticoagulants\n\n          -  Patients with a known positive BRACA1 or BRCA2 gene mutation\n\n          -  Patients who are anemic despite iron supplementation and treatment of the underlying\n             cause of the anemia.\n\n          -  Patients unwilling to have mammographic testing done before and after the procedure\n\n          -  Patients with Fibromyalgia, regional pain syndrome, or chronic fatigue.\n\n          -  Patients with positive human immunodeficiency (HIV), hepatitis B (HBV) or hepatitis C\n             (HCV) at screening indicative of current of pass infection.\n\n          -  Patients with a bleeding diathesis\n\n          -  Patients with a positive urinalysis for pregnancy or UTI.\n\n          -  Patients whose diabetes is not adequately controlled (HgA1c > 7).\n\n          -  Patients with a history of local anesthetic allergy.\n\n          -  History, diagnosis, or signs and symptoms of clinically significant psychiatric\n             disorder, including but not limited to\n\n          -  Severe psychological disease (e.g. schizophrenia, manic-depressive disorder, severe\n             depression, etc).\n\n          -  Body dysmorphia syndromes, i.e., anorexia, bulimia, etc.\n\n          -  Somatoform disorders\n             \n             \n                                            .\n\n          -  Potential research participants with a substance abuse (e.g. alcoholism, medical\n             narcotics (morphine, Vicodin, codeine, Percodan, etc.) illicit drug, prescription\n             medications without a valid prescription, etc.) within 2 years of screening, and\n             tobacco habit.\n\n          -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) \u2265 3.0 times the\n             upper limit of normal, or creatinine exceeding 1.7 mg/dL (150 micromol/L) in men or\n             1.5 mg/dL (133 micromol/L) in women, hemoglobin ALC \u2265 10% at screening.\n\n          -  Research participants who are or have been receiving immunosuppressants such as\n             Cyclosporin A or azathioprine within the past six weeks\n\n          -  Research participants on anticoagulants that cannot be stopped or corrected.
