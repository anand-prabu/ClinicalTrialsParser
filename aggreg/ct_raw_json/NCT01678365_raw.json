            "textblock": "The study was conducted at the Pediatric Surgery Department at HaEmek Medical Center, Afula,\n      Israel. Included were children age 1-14 years with complicated appendicitis that was defined\n      by  one of  the  followings: 1. Demonstration by abdominal ultrasound and/or computed\n      tomography of appendix perforation and/or peri-appendicular abscess 2. Demonstration by\n      abdominal ultrasound of free fluid, and signs of diffuse peritoneal irritation in the right\n      lower quadrant of the abdomen 3. At surgery performed for suspected non complicated\n      appendicitis. In a patient with perforate appendicitis that was diagnosed at surgery,\n      appendectomy was performed by one of the 4 senior pediatric surgeons on call at the time of\n      the child's admission. Exclusion criteria were: documented allergy to any of the study\n      medications, acute or renal insufficiency at admission, and severe septic shock at\n      admission.\n\n      Therapeutic approach: After the diagnosis of complicated appendicitis was established,\n      patients were randomly assigned to therapy with either once daily of ceftriaxone and\n      metronidazole or ampicillin, gentamicin and metronidazole.  Therapy was change to\n      piperacillin/tazobactam in patients who were still febrile at day 7-10 of the admission (if\n      not  given before), based on the clinical  situation,  and in all febrile patients at 11 day\n      of the admission . All patients had also been treats after inclusion with pain control\n      medications, no oral food or  fluid , and intravenous hydration as necessary. Nasogastric\n      tubes were not used routinely. On the fifth admission day patients who were stable, a\n      febrile, could tolerate diet and had Complete blood count  within normal limits were\n      discharged home with oral amoxicillin/clavulanate  therapy for further 7 days.\n\n      Follow-up at the admission: CBC and renal and liver function tests were obtained before\n      starting the antibiotic treatment and repeated on day 4 in all patients. In the group\n      treated with AGM, serum trough gentamicin concentration was drawn before the fourth dose\n      with normal level considered as < 2 mcg/ml. Other blood studies were performed based on the\n      discretion of  the attending physician based on the patient's clinical  status. For patients\n      who were either febrile or had leukocytosis, at day 5 of therapy abdominal ultrasound was\n      obtained to assess for the presence of an abscess. Patients in whom abscesses were\n      delectated undergone per coetaneous drainage (when possible). The original antibiotic\n      regimen was either continued or changed to piperacillin/tazobactam based on the clinical\n      situation. Patients, in whom appendectomy had not been done at admission, were readmitted\n      for appendectomy at 6 weeks.  All patients had been followed for a year since the admission\n      for signs of intra abdominal complication such: repeat abscess formation, repeat admission,\n      obstruction etc.\n\n      Data collection: Data were recorded were: patient's age, weight, gender, maximum daily\n      temperature, duration of  fever, results of complete blood  count, renal and liver function\n      tests, gentamicin levels (where applicable), intra abdominal complications and duration of\n      hospitalization. The outcome variables included maximum daily temperatures for each of the\n      first 10 postoperative days, time to initial oral intake, length of hospitalization, length\n      of antibiotic therapy, abscess formation rate, need to  change antibiotic regimen, wound\n      infection rate, and any abnormal findings during the follow-up visits.\n\n      Statistical analysis:  Since data in the  literature show that there is  no difference of\n      the  length of  stay in  between the 2  regimens (in  children with complicated appendicitis\n      following operation),  and most  studies included relatively  low  number of  patients,  no\n      power analysis was calculated. The difference between various parameters in the two\n      treatment groups were assessed by 2 independent sample T  tests or Fisher exact tests for\n      categorical data and 2 independent sample t test or the Mann Whitney test for continuous\n      data.  Descriptive statistics were calculated as mean \u00b1 SD."
