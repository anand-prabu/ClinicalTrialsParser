Treatment repeats every 21 days for\n      at least 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of XK469 until the maximum tolerated dose\n      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of the first 6\n      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n      Once the MTD is determined, up to 15 patients are treated at that dose. Patients in the\n      expanded MTD cohort also receive oral NovaSoy\u00ae soybean extract twice daily for the study\n      duration.\n\n      Patients are followed every 4 weeks.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 25-40 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-15\n      months."
