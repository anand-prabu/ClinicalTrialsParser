Determine the treatment-related toxicity of this drug in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

Treatment repeats every 21 days for a\n      maximum of 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 72 patients will be accrued for this study within 2-3 years."
