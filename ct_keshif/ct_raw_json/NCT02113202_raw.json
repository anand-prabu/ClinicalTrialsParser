Optical molecular imaging of adenoma\n      associated biomarkers is a promising technique to accommodate this need. The biomarker\n      Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) is overexpressed in adenomatous colon tissue\n      versus normal tissue and has proven to be a valid target for molecular imaging. The\n      University Medical Center Groningen (UMCG) developed a fluorescent tracer by labeling the\n      VEGF-targeting humanized monoclonal antibody bevacizumab, currently used in anti-cancer\n      therapy, with the fluorescent dye IRDye800CW. The investigators hypothesize that when\n      bevacizumab-IRDye800CW is administered to patients, it accumulates in VEGF expressing\n      adenomas, enabling adenoma visualization using a newly developed near-infrared (NIR)\n      fluorescence endoscopy platform (NL43407.042.13). This hypothesis will be tested in this\n      feasibility study, next to the determination of the best time interval between tracer\n      administration and endoscopic imaging."
