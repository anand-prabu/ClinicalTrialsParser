            "textblock": "New approaches addressing intradermal (ID) and transcutaneous (TC) routes of immunization\n      have been developed over the past few years and have brought novel insight in quality and\n      efficacy of the immune response. Indeed, compared to the muscular tissue widely used for\n      vaccination, the skin is particularly rich in antigen presenting cells. Our recent works\n      show that penetration of vaccine compounds into the hair follicular ducts surrounded by\n      Langerhans cells induces potent cellular immunity in contrast to the intra-muscular\n      immunization. Our results also suggest that differential targeting of epidermal Langerhans\n      cells (by TC route) or dermal dendritic cells (by ID route) could modulate the intensity and\n      quality of the immune response to vaccine.\n\n      The aim of this study is to evaluate the immune response to a seasonal influenza vaccine\n      when administrated byTC (hair follicular targeting needle-free method), ID (micro-needle\n      injection) and IM (conventional intramuscular injection) routes of immunization. Along with\n      our previous pre-clinical and clinical studies, here we hypothesize that differential\n      targeting of epidermis or dermis antigen-presenting cells will have a differential impact on\n      the cellular and humoral immune responses to Influenza vaccine.\n\n      Objectives:\n\n      We will conduct a phase I/II clinical trials on 60 healthy volunteers to compare TC and ID\n      routes of immunization to the conventional intramuscular (IM) vaccination. The impact of\n      these routes on cellular and humoral immune responses to seasonal influenza vaccine will be\n      assessed at baseline, day 21 (effector phase) and month 5 (memory phase) after vaccination.\n\n      Outcomes:\n\n      Using the seasonal Influenza vaccine as an example of conventional vaccine, this study will\n      evaluate and compare the efficacy ofTC, ID and IMroutes of immunization to induce cellular\n      responses at day 21 and memory responses at month 5 phases. The generation and maintenance\n      of Flu specific and neutralizing antibodies will be measured by Haemagglutination Inhibition\n      and microneutralization assays.Moreover, safety and tolerance to each vaccination methods\n      will be evaluated as well as inflammation and innate immune response induced at day 1 after\n      vaccination.\n\n      Addressing innovative skin routes of immunization, this study represents an essential step\n      to move forward in the development of new vaccination strategies. These results will have an\n      important impact on the amelioration of vaccine efficacy and less invasive method of\n      immunization."
