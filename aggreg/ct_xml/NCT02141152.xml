  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The next generation of personalized medical treatment according to the type of personal
      genetic information are evolving rapidly. The genome analysis needs systematic infra and
      database based on personal genetic information Therefore, a big data of genome-clinical
      information is important.

      To determine the feasibility of the use of tumor's molecular profiling and targeted
      therapies in the treatment of advanced cancer and to determine the clinical outcome(PFS,
      duration of response and overall survival) of patients with advanced cancer, the
      investigators are going to take a fresh tissue of patients and process molecular profiling
      and receive molecular profile directed treatments.
