Treatment repeats every 6 weeks for a maximum of 6 courses in the\n      absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.\n\n      Cohorts of 6-12 patients receive escalating doses of RSR13 until the maximum tolerated dose\n      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 3 of 6 or 5 of\n      12 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, additional\n      patients are accrued to receive treatment with RSR13 and carmustine at the recommended phase\n      II dose.\n\n      Patients are followed at 6 weeks and then every 2 months thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 48 patients will be accrued for the phase I portion of this\n      study. A maximum of 47 patients will be accrued for the phase II portion of this study."
