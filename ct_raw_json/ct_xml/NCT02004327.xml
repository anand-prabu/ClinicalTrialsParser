      Healthy volunteers for clinical trials targeting drug administration date (1d) within 3
      weeks from the (-21d ~-1d) in the interview, physical examination and laboratory tests ,
      including through the screening is performed.

      Through screening deems appropriate in this clinical trial is intended for the final
      subjects randomized to three groups to order .

      The first phase one clinical trial subjects performed one day before (the -1 ) 18:00 Chonbuk
      National University Hospital, convened as a physical examination and perform hwalryeong
      signs .

      One person to dinner , except for the drinking water should be fasting . One clinical trials
      (the first day) 20:00 subjects randomly assigned to groups according to the order in which
      the test is administered in a single oral medication .

      The subjects for clinical trials with 240 mL water, medicines and swallow whole , chew
      before swallowing drugs should .

      Blood according to the schedule after the clinical trial , including vital signs and
      physical examination is performed. The subjects that had a fixed schedule and is discharged
      on the morning of the second .

      Is at least one week washout period . Since the two groups according to the order group and
      three creeping dose , except for the one the same tiles to proceed.

      After a period of three clinical trials, three day period from taking drugs for clinical
      trials after 3-5 days to perform the post-study visit .
