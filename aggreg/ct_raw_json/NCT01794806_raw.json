Clinical linear\n      measurements of the ridge (horizontal and vertical) will be obtained using a tooth-supported\n      stent. Following extraction, primary closure of the socket will not be attempted. Subjects\n      will be re-evaluated at 1 and 4 weeks. Implant placement surgery will be performed at 16\n      weeks. Clinical measurements will be repeated upon surgical re-entry. Cone beam computed\n      tomographic (CBCT) scans will be obtained at baseline (after tooth extraction) and at 14\n      weeks (prior to implant placement) to assess alveolar ridge volumetric changes (primary\n      outcome). Secondary outcome measures include changes in bucco-lingual and apico-coronal\n      clinical measurements of the ridge and changes in modified wound healing index changes\n      overtime. The influence of the thickness of the facial and lingual bone of the alveolar\n      ridge and the width of the keratinized tissue on the remodeling of the ridge will be\n      evaluated."
