            "textblock": "Depressive elderly individuals have showed higher basal level of cortisol and lower level of\n      dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA). Moreover, changes on these hormone levels have also observed\n      in reactivity of an acute stress, such as physical exercise. On the other hand, physical\n      training can modulate the release of these hormones. Therefore, depressive elderly\n      individuals physically actives might show attenuated reactivity of an acute physical\n      stressor compared to sedentary elderly individuals. The aim of these study is to compare the\n      effect of an acute physical stressor on cortisol levels in depressive and healthy\n      individuals, physically actives and sedentaries. Additionally, the sulfated form of DHEA\n      (DHEAS) serves as a reservoir for DHEA, because of that it is expected that DHEAS levels\n      might reduce after the acute physical exercise."
