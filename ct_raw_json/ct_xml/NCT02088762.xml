      Objective: To investigated the impact of the excision of melanoma 2mm≤  in  thickness with
      1cm surgical margins on survival of the patients  compared with 2 cm surgical margins.

      Background: Early recognition and appropriate excision play a crucial role  in management of
      malignant melanoma, while the size of surrounding normal skin that should be excised is area
      of controversies.

      Methods: The investigators will conduct a retrospective population-based survey in patients
      with primary melanoma 2 mm≤  in  thickness undergoing tumor excision with 1 cm and 2 cm
      margins in the investigators center. For both groups,  the patients' charts reviewed for
      data including patient gender, age, tumor location, tumor type, Clark's level, Breslow
      thickness, tumor type, presence of ulceration, findings of sentinel nodes, local
      recurrences, locoregional metastases, disease free survival and overall survival were
      calculated for both groups.
