Thalidomide may stop the growth of cancer by stopping blood\n      flow to the tumor. Combining temozolomide with thalidomide may kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining temozolomide with\n      thalidomide in treating patients who have metastatic, locally advanced, or unresectable\n      leiomyosarcoma."

Treatment continues for up to 26 weeks in the absence of disease\n      progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-25 patients will be accrued for this study within 7.5-25\n      months."
