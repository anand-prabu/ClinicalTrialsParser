      The purpose of this study is to determine whether raltegravir is effective in preventing
      progression of relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis as determined by gadolinium- enhanced
      MRI.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is accumulating research evidence that Human Endogenous Retrovirus (HERV) and herpes
      viruses (in particular Epstein-Barr Virus) are involved in the pathogenesis of multiple
      sclerosis. People with active MS have higher levels of HERVs than people either without MS
      or who have other neurological conditions. It has been shown that HERVs may produce
      neurotoxic proteins/antigens associated with MS activity and disease progression. This is
      the first clinical trial investigating the hypothesis that the antiretroviral drug
      raltegravir may suppress HERV activity and ameliorate progression of relapsing remitting MS.
      Raltegravir is an integrase inhibitor which blocks retroviral replication. A recent
      experimental study suggests that raltegravir may also be active against herpes viruses.

      Eligible participants (see Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria) will be observed for 3 months
      having monthly brain Gadolinium enhanced MRIs and blood/urine/saliva sampling (baseline).
      Then they will be treated with raltegravir (one 400mg pill  taken twice a day) for 3 months.
      During treatment period participants will continue to have monthly MRIs and
      blood/saliva/urine sampling. Participants will have monthly clinical and neurological
      examinations and they will complete questionnaires assessing response to treatment.
      Participants will have screening and study visits at The Royal London Hospital, Whitechapel.
      Monthly MRIs will be performed at the Institute of Neurology at Queens Square, London.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  EDSS score of 0-6.0 inclusive.

          -  Documented at least one relapse within the past 12 months or at least one Gd-enhanced
             lesion on the brain MRI detected within 3 months prior to screening date
