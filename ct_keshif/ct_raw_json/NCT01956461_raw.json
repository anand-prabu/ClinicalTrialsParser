The participants are treated in the investigators hospital, who are\n      under severe osteoporotic condition.\n\n      Several determinants were reported to be related to subsequent BMD increase, such as\n      baseline bone turnover markers (BTMs), low BMD at baseline, age, prior treatment, but\n      comprehensive discussion is lacking. Specifically, there analyses were performed\n      fragmentarily.\n\n      The main objective of this study is to reveal the determinants of subsequent BMD increase\n      and fracture preventing effect by teriparatide.\n\n      Next, in Japan, as the baby boom generation retires, aging and depopulation occur rapidly.\n      As a result, there is a lot of nursing home. But there are few reports concerning to the\n      efficacy of teriparatide treatment in nursing home patients. The second objective is to\n      reveal the efficacy of teriparatide for patients living nursing home, especially BMD\n      changes, bone turnover makers change, and adverse events."

We also investigate determinants related to fracture prevention effects by teriparatide treatment, such as baseline age, gender, body mass index, BMD, BTMs, history of fracture, prior treatment, walking ability, dementia,and site of living.\nTo determine the response variables of BMD changes and fracture prevention effects, initially univariate analyses are performed by Spearman correlation coefficients and Mann-Whitney U test. Data are further analyzed with a multiple regression. To estimate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) of each determinants, logistic regression analyses are performed.",
