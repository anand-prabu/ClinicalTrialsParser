Assess if TS may detect additional cancers in dense breast that approximate US\n           detection capability but with less false positive findings than US.\n\n        2. If TS detects new cancers in dense breast similarly to US (approximate rate or\n           marginally lower rate), evaluate the the true positive/false positive ratio.\n\n        3. Cost-analysis. In case of less false positives detected by TS, the true-positive /\n           false positive trade-off might be strongly in favour of TS with a great potential of\n           costs reduction."
