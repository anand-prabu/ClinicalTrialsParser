      Study aiming to evaluate the efficacy of a 2-month pre-seasonal treatment with an AllerT 50
      µg or 100 µg maintenance dose administered in previous study AN004T in reducing symptoms of
      allergic rhinoconjunctivitis during the 2nd following birch pollen season.

      Multicenter, international, parallel-group follow-up study of subjects randomized and
      treated in Study AN004T (AllerT 100 µg, AllerT 50 µg, placebo) and followed over the 2nd,
      and if appropriate, the 3rd and 4th birch pollen seasons in this study (still double-blind
      during the 1st year, open-label in the 2nd and 3rd years).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Average of the combined Rhinoconjunctivitis Symptom and Medication Score (RSMS) obtained daily during the birch pollen season</measure>
    <time_frame>from the first of 3 consecutive days with a regional pollen count &gt; 10 grains/m3 to the earliest between the 42nd day after the start of the season and the last day in the last occurrence of 3 consecutive days with a regional pollen count ≥ 10 grains/m3</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The Rhinoconjunctivitis Symptom Score (RSS) comprises 6 different symptoms from the nose and eyes. The sum of the 6 symptom scores divided by 6 will be used as the RSS (scale of 0 to 3).
The daily Rhinoconjunctivitis Medication Score (RMS) will be determined by assigning daily scores as follows:
0 = no medication
= subject took topical antihistamine
= subject took oral antihistamine
= subject took oral corticosteroids The RSMS is calculated as the sum of the RSS and the RMS divided by 2</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Average of the total score of the validated Mini Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality-of-life Questionnaire© (Mini RQLQ) obtained weekly during the birch pollen season</measure>
    <time_frame>between the 42nd day after the start of the season and the last day in the last occurrence of 3 consecutive days with a regional pollen count ≥ 10 grains/m3</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The Mini-RQLQ will be used. This evaluation tool includes 14 questions assessing 5 domains (activity limitation, practical problems, nose symptoms, eye symptoms, and non-nose/eye symptoms).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Bet v 1 specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) and immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) and AllerT specific IgE and IgG4. Changes will be also compared to values obtained in the AN004T trial.</measure>
    <time_frame>at Visit 1 (25-35 days prior to the expected peak of the birch pollen season) and Visit 3 (within 2 weeks from the actual end of the birch pollen season)</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
