In spite of that, there are no studies that have investigated the role of this\n      molecule in chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy yet.\n\n      In this project, our objective is to demonstrate the potential role of syndecan-4 in the\n      prognosis of chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy, seeking a better fitting of the treatment\n      through the identification of patients with the worse prognosis.\n\n      The patients included in the study must at first sign the written consent. They shall be\n      accompanied in the specialized outpatient clinics for Chagas disease - Hospital S\u00e3o Rafael -\n      Centro de Biotecnologia e Terapia Celular. They will be submitted to several tests,\n      including:\n\n        -  Collection of Blood samples for biochemical analysis;\n\n        -  Electrocardiogram;\n\n        -  Holter Electrocardiogram;\n\n        -  Echocardiogram;\n\n        -  Treadmill Test;\n\n        -  X-Ray Imaging;\n\n        -  Magnetic Resonance Imaging;\n\n        -  Evaluation of the quality of life through the application of questionnaires (SF 36 and\n           the Minnesota Living With Heart Failure Questionnaire)."
