            "textblock": "Tremor is the most common of all movement disorders.  Patients with essential tremor (ET) or\n      Parkinsonian tremor (PT) may be severely disabled by their tremor.  When the tremor is\n      inadequately controlled by medications, surgical options are often offered.  However, some\n      patients may prefer a noninvasive treatment approach and some patients are not surgical\n      candidates for medical reasons.\n\n      Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is a treatment that uses high-energy highly-focused\n      radiation (X-rays) to destroy a tiny region in the brain that causes tremor to occur.  This\n      region is known as the ventral intermedius nucleus of the thalamus and is the same area\n      targeted by surgical deep brain stimulator (DBS) treatment or neurosurgical operation\n      (thalamotomy).  Multiple case series publications using Gamma Knife stereotactic radiation\n      have been reported that show stereotactic radiosurgery is safe and effective treatment for\n      ET and PT, making it a standard treatment for inoperable and inadequately controlled tremor\n      patients.  However, radiation treatment by linear accelerator machines are much more common\n      than Gamma Knife treatment machines in the United States, and there are no reports of large\n      series of ET and PT patients treated using linear accelerator-based SRS using a noninvasive\n      mask-based targeting system.\n\n      This clinical trial asks the question of whether linear accelerator-based SRS is as safe and\n      effective as that reported for Gamma Knife procedures, and whether it is a valid alternative\n      to surgical thalamotomy or implantation of a deep brain stimulator (DBS) device.  The\n      primary measurements are quality of life related to tremor before and after stereotactic\n      radiosurgery treatment, and secondary measurements are degree of tremor severity and usage\n      of tremor-related medications.\n\n      Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS) is a standard-of-care treatment for patients with severe\n      tremor.  This clinical trial is a questionnaire-based trial that only involves completion of\n      2 questionnaires at the consultation appointments with neurology and radiation oncology.\n      The questionnaires only take a few minutes and will provide us with valuable information\n      about how severe the patient's tremor is before and after SRS treatment at 3-month intervals\n      for 1 year.  Patients can receive this treatment without participating in the clinical trial\n      questionnaires.  All associated steps listed below are considered the Standard of Care and\n      are billed to the patient's insurance per the usual routine.\n\n      What to expect:\n\n        1. All patients interested in SRS treatment for tremor must be evaluated by a movement\n           disorder neurologist, Dr. Peter Hedera or Dr. Fenna Phibbs.  The neurologist will\n           assess the severity of the tremor.  For clinical trial participation a questionnaire\n           will be completed as a baseline measurement (this takes a few minutes).  If the patient\n           is an appropriate candidate for SRS and there may be additional evaluations and\n           discussion with the entire Movement Disorder group at monthly meetings.\n\n           ** Please note: for Parkinson's disease patients, please come to the neurology\n           evaluation \"functionally off medication\", which means do NOT take the morning dose of\n           Parkinson's related medications.\n\n        2. Patients referred for SRS treatment will be evaluated by a radiation oncologist, Dr.\n           Anthony Cmelak.  At this appointment, discussion will include descriptions of the\n           procedure in detail and review of the risks and benefits of treatment.  For clinical\n           trial participation, a questionnaire will be completed as a baseline assessment of the\n           patient's tremor-related quality of life (this takes a few minutes).\n\n        3. If the patient chooses to proceed with SRS, in the department of radiation oncology a\n           tight-fitting thermal plastic mask will be custom made to fit around the patient's head\n           and a CT scan of the head will be performed in radiation oncology.  This step takes\n           about 45 minutes.\n\n        4. A specialized MRI of the brain will be obtained for treatment planning.  This step\n           takes about 1 hour.\n\n        5. The patient will meet with a neurosurgeon, Dr. Joseph Neimat, who will be involved in\n           the SRS planning and procedure.\n\n        6. The patient will undergo a neuropsychological evaluation prior to SRS treatment, which\n           is the standard of care for patients considering DBS.\n\n        7. Approximately 1-2 weeks after completing all the consultation appointments and\n           obtaining the imaging for planning, the single stereotactic radiation treatment will be\n           performed.  The SRS procedure takes approximately 2.5 hours.  It is entirely outpatient\n           and does not require anesthesia.  The procedure is noninvasive and painless (X-ray\n           treatment).  During the entire treatment, the head is held tightly in the plastic mask.\n            Oral anti-anxiety medication may be given to relax the patient.\n\n           Follow-up:\n\n        8. At 3 month intervals for 1 year, the patient will have follow-up appointments with\n           radiation oncology and neurology.  A brain MRI may be performed at some of these\n           intervals to document the treatment effect on the brain tissue. For participation in\n           the clinical trial, at these follow-up appointments the quality of life questionnaire\n           will be completed at the radiation oncology visit and the severity of tremor\n           questionnaire will be completed at the neurology visit .\n\n        9. At 6 months after SRS treatment, a neuropsychological evaluation will be performed.\n\n      All patients interested in stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) or participating in this\n      questionnaire-based clinical trial should feel free to call the contact phone numbers listed\n      below or have their physician refer the patient for consultation with Dr. Peter Hedera or\n      Dr. Fenna Phibbs in the neurology department at Vanderbilt or with Dr. Anthony Cmelak in the\n      radiation oncology department at Vanderbilt."
