This study will recruit 45 youth ages 8-20\n      diagnosed with clinically significant OCD who have demonstrated no more than minimal\n      response to SRI treatment and are currently on a stable dose of SRI medication for at least\n      12 weeks. Participants will be randomized to receive either 12 weeks of minocycline\n      treatment or  pill placebo. Randomization will be 2:1 so that 2 of 3 participants receive\n      minocycline. Screening for eligibility will take place for 1-4 weeks. Participants will\n      undergo MRS scans to measure striatal Glu levels prior to randomization, and again\n      immediately following the treatment period. During the treatment period, participants will\n      meet initially weekly and then every other week with the study psychiatrist. All\n      participants will be offered three months of open medication treatment following\n      participation. The clinical trial will only be conducted at NYSPI and the MRS scans may be\n      conducted at Weill Cornell Medical Center or NYSPI."
