When the drug is active, cancer cells are killed. This\n      may be effective during surgery against non-small cell lung cancer."

Initial assessment of efficacy (i.e., 2-year disease free survival). II. To investigate\n      the relationship between signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) levels,\n      measured light dose and the clinical outcome.\n\n      III. Correlate the serum concentrations of vitamin D metabolites (25-hydroxyvitamin D3 and\n      1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3) with the presence of lymph node (LN) metastasis at the time of\n      surgical resection.\n\n      IV. To measure temoporfin uptake in malignant and normal tissue.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of photodynamic therapy with temoporfin.\n\n      Subjects will receive tempoforin as outpatients but PDT will occur following outpatient\n      surgery.\n\n      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for 2 years."
