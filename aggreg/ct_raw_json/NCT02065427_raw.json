Study participants: Primary informal\n      caregivers of patients receiving home health care from participating PHCTs.\n\n      Sample: Required sample size is 282 caregivers (141 from PHCTs randomized to the\n      intervention group and 141 from PHCTs randomized to the control group.\n\n      Intervention: a) PHCT professionals: standardized training to implement caregivers\n      intervention. b) Caregivers: 1 individualized counselling session, 1 family session, and 4\n      educational group sessions conducted by participating PHCT professionals; in addition to\n      usual home health care visits, periodic telephone follow-up contact and unlimited telephone\n      support.\n\n      Control: Caregivers and dependent patients: usual home health care, consisting of bimonthly\n      scheduled visits, follow-up as needed, and additional attention upon request.\n\n      Data Analysis. Dependent variables: Caregiver burden (short-form Zarit test), caregivers\n      social support (Medical Outcomes Study), and caregiver reported quality of life (SF-12)\n      Independent variables: a) Caregiver: sociodemographic data, Goldberg Scale, Apgar family\n      questionnaire, Holmes and Rahe Psychosocial Stress Scale, number of chronic diseases.  b)\n      Dependent patient: sociodemographic data, level of dependency (Barthel Index), cognitive\n      impairment (Pfeiffer test)\n\n      Discussion:\n\n      If the intervention intended to improve social and family support is effective in reducing\n      the burden on primary informal caregivers of dependent patients, this model can be readily\n      applied throughout usual PHCT clinical practice."
