Combining more than one drug and combining chemotherapy with\n      autologous bone marrow transplantation or peripheral stem cell transplantation may allow\n      doctors to give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy plus bone\n      marrow transplantation or peripheral stem cell transplantation in treating patients who have\n      oligodendroglioma."

Treatment repeats every 42 days in the absence of progressive disease or\n           unacceptable toxicity. Patients with prior complete resections receive 3 courses of PCV\n           then proceed to high-dose chemotherapy and transplantation as described below, provided\n           tumor has not recurred. Patients with prior partial resections or biopsies receive 2\n           courses of PCV and are assessed for response; those who achieve complete response (CR)\n           or major partial response (PR) receive 1 more course of PCV. Patients who achieve\n           partial response or have stable disease receive 2 more courses of PCV and are\n           reassessed.\n\n        -  High-dose chemotherapy and transplantation: Patients who achieve CR or PR receive\n           thiotepa IV on days -8 to -6 and busulfan IV over 2 hours on day -5 to -3. Patients\n           undergo autologous BM or PBSC transplantation on day 0.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then\n      annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients will be accrued for this study within 3-5 years."
