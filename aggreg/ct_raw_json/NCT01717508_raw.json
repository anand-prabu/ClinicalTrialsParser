Depressed adolescents will\n      complete an initial assessment consisting of an interview, questionnaires, computer tasks,\n      and an EEG recording. EEG (electroencephalography) measures brain activity by recording the\n      electrical activity along the scalp caused by the firing of neurons within the brain. They\n      will then complete 12 sessions of cognitive behavioral therapy, which will be 50 minutes\n      long and held once a week for 12 weeks. Before their third therapy session, participants\n      will complete a computer task while EEG data are recorded. After completing the treatment,\n      the participants will complete a final assessment, which will include questionnaires,\n      computer tasks, and an EEG recording. They will also complete follow-up assessments over the\n      phone 1, 3, and 6 months after completing the treatment.\n\n      This study will also include healthy control participants. They will complete an initial\n      assessment consisting of an interview, questionnaires, computer tasks, and an EEG recording.\n      Three weeks later, they will return to complete a behavioral task while EEG data are\n      recorded. Twelve weeks after the initial assessment, they will complete a final assessment,\n      which will include questionnaires, computer tasks, and an EEG recording."

Specifically, the study will utilize\n      Brent and Poling's (1997) cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) manual (Cognitive Therapy\n      Treatment Manual for Depressed and Suicidal Youth), and investigators will examine pre- to\n      post- neural activity patterns for children and adolescents who receive individual CBT for\n      depression. Electroencephalography (EEG) techniques will be utilized to assess\n      treatment-related effects on brain activity (i.e., anterior cingulate cortex and\n      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex functioning). Neural activity patterns will also be compared\n      to non-depressed, healthy controls."
