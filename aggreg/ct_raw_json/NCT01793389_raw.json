If the platelet rich fibrin will\n      prove to be similarly effective as subepithelial connective tissue graft, it will be\n      possible to avoid a donor site and to decrease patient discomfort after operation."

The secondary\n      outcome variables included keratinized tissue and gingival thickness gain.\n\n      Sample size has been estimated in 22 subjects per treatment groups. Random allocation of the\n      treatment sites to test (CAF+ PRF) and control (CAF + SCTG) groups will be performed using a\n      computerized selection of random numbers for allocation of the study groups.\n\n      Periodontal parameters including plaque index (25) (PI), gingival index (26) (GI), probing\n      depth (PD), clinical attachment level (CAL), and gingival recession parameters including\n      recession depth (RD), recession width (RW), recession area (RA), keratinized tissue width\n      (KTW), gingival thickness (GT) were assessed by a calibrated examiner. At baseline and 1, 3\n      and 6 months, RD, RW, RA, KTW were evaluated by means of both clinical and digital\n      assessment. GI and PI were recorded at baseline and 1, 3 and 6 months, however PD, CAL, and\n      GT were evaluated at baseline and 6 months. PD and CAL were recorded by a Williams probe\n      accurate to the nearest 0.5 mm. GT was evaluated at baseline and 6 months using #15\n      endodontic reamer attached to a rubber stopper inserted perpendicularly into the gingival\n      tissue 2 mm below the gingival margin; thickness was measured to the nearest 0.1 mm using a\n      caliper.\n\n      Clinical images obtained at baseline and 1, 3 and 6 months after surgery from each treatment\n      site and digitized in a computer image analysis system. Using a 4-mm length wire was used to\n      check the reproducibility of the pictures. RD was measured from the cement-enamel junction\n      (CEJ) to the gingival margin, RW was measured tangentially at the mid-facial CEJ, RA was\n      calculated as the area within the contour of denuded root. KTW recorded as the distance from\n      the mucogingival junction (MGJ) to the gingival margin. Duplicate measurements were made for\n      RD, RW, RA and KTW. Percent root coverage and complete root coverage was calculated RA\n      according to the following standard formulae.\n\n      Follow-up of subjects will be 6 months."
