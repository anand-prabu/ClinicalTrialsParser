However, visual\n      estimation of postpartum hemorrhage often leads to underestimation of blood loss and\n      subsequent delays in the seeking or provision of appropriate treatment.  In recent years,\n      researchers have employed several different methods to measure blood loss in hospital and\n      community-based birth settings.

Upon admission in the labor ward, study staff\n      will approach all delivering women about participation in the study and seek informed\n      consent.  Blood loss will be measured for all consenting women with vaginal deliveries.\n\n      Women who agree to participate will be randomized to one of two blood collection techniques:\n       a modified version of the WHO blood measurement protocol or the Excellent BRASSS-V Drape\u2122.\n      Blood loss will be measured from immediately after delivery and cord clamping for a period\n      of at least one hour or until active bleeding stops. The blood loss will then be quantified\n      by the study staff and recorded on the study form.  Women will receive the facility's\n      standard care for the management of the third stage of labor and, if applicable, treatment\n      of PPH.\n\n      Measures of postpartum hemoglobin levels will be taken at admission for delivery and\n      twenty-four hours post-delivery for a randomly selected sub-set of study participants.\n      Besides the measurement of blood loss and the regular measurement of hemoglobin for a\n      sub-sample of participants, there will be no change to the hospital's standard procedures\n      for labor and delivery."
