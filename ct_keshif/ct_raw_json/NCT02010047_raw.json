            "textblock": "The anaplastic lymphoma kinase gene(ALK) is mutated approximately 5% of non-small cell lung\n      cancers. Testing for this gene is important because there are drugs known as ALK inhibitors\n      that have been shown to significantly delay the progression of ALK-mutated lung cancers.\n      There are a number of ways to test for the presence of the ALK gene in lung cancer biopsy\n      tissue. One method involves making slides and staining them to detect the ALK protein. This\n      is called immunohistochemistry. Another method called fluorescence in situ\n      hybridization(FISH)is used to detect rearrangements of the ALK gene associated with lung\n      cancer. Although both these tests are widely used to test for ALK gene abnormalities, the\n      techniques may not always find the ALK gene mutation because they are not sensitive enough\n      or not enough cancer cells are present in the lung biopsy.\n\n      This study is being performed to determine if a technique called quantitation polymerase\n      chain reaction (qPCR) is as accurate or better at finding the ALK gene mutation in lung\n      cancer biopsy tissue."
