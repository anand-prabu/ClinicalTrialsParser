However bone mineral\n      density (BMD) which is the most commonly used measure of fracture risk seems to be\n      insensitive in diabetes, thus BMD is lowered in type 1 diabetes but not enough to explain an\n      almost seven fold in fracture risk. BMD is increased in type 2 diabetes although they still\n      have an increased fracture risk.\n\n      The investigators investigate this paradox in diabetes by assessing type 1 and type 2\n      diabetes patients bone status by blood- and urine samples (assessing markers of bone- and\n      glycemic state) and two types of bone scans comprising of DXA and HRpQCT scan.\n\n      The diabetes mellitus patients are recruited from outpatients clinics in the three study\n      sites (Aalborg, Aarhus and Odense) as well as general practitioners and by flyers and adds."
