Treatment repeats every 6 weeks for up to\n      4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed at 4 weeks and then every 3 months thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-18\n      months."
