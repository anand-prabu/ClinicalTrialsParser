      The purpose of this research study is to better understand what causes dysautonomia and how
      this affects blood pressure and pulse. Dysautonomia is a condition of the autonomic nervous
      system.  It is associated with fluctuations in blood pressure and pulse and may cause
      symptoms of nausea and belly pain, fatigue, excessive thirst, lightheadedness, dizziness,
      feelings of anxiety or panic, and fainting. A common example of dysautonomia is postural
      orthostatic tachycardia syndrome or POTS. Sometimes symptoms worsen when people move from
      lying down to standing, called orthostatic intolerance.  We would like to learn more about
      the link between orthostatic intolerance and nausea. While medications currently used to
      treat orthostatic intolerance and nausea have proven to be effective in some patients, this
      may not be the best treatment for everyone as long term use could pose certain risks
      including high blood pressure. In order to provide a more focused and safer treatment for
      patients suffering from nausea and orthostatic intolerance, we have looked at how the blood
      pressure, pulse, and certain blood tests change during a tilt table test.  This test helps
      to create the same circumstances that patients with orthostatic intolerance experience when
      they stand.   To better understand if some of these problems are associated with the brain,
      we will study MRI in patients with dysautonomia compared to children without dysautonomia.
      This information may allow us to use alternative and safer treatments in the future.

    <description>The first objective of the proposed project is to study central transmitter/metabolite profiles using in vivo 1H Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) in children with dysautonomia diagnosed by tilt table testing compared to healthy children without symptoms of dysautonomia. The second objective will be to determine whether dysautonomia associated with nausea and cardiovascular instability shares common alterations in brain networks. We will be using cognitive and sensory processing tasks based on our prior experience with both traditional fMRI and network analyses.</description>
