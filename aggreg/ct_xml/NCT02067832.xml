  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) can be hard to diagnose, difficult to manage and
      contributes significantly to morbidity and mortality in stem cell transplantation patients.

      The research will look into identifying and validating cGVHD biological indicators
      (=bio-markers) which will be evaluated whether they can predict a future development of the
      disease.

      The study hypothesis is that a number of previously reported cGVHD bio-markers, known to be
      present at the time of cGVHD diagnosis, will also be present at earlier time points, before
      cGVHD develops.

      Following validation, the bio-markers will be beneficial for finding those patients who are
      in higher risk to develop cGVHD.

      By identifying the higher-risk group, which is more likely to develop cGVHD, a pre-emptive
      therapy might be applied in order to prevent or reduce the prevalence of the disease.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for any malignant or non-malignant
             disease.

          2. Age 0-17.99 years at the time of transplantation.

          3. Bone marrow, peripheral blood stem cell and umbilical cord blood (including single or
             double cord blood) as the graft source.

          4. Conditioning regimen must meet standard criteria.

          5. Use of serotherapy is permitted.

          6. Any graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis is permitted, including post-HSCT
             cyclophosphamide.

          7. If participant weighs between 0-20 kg, participant must be able to provide a minimum
             of 20 ml of whole blood at each time point.

          8. If participant weighs between 20-30 kg, participant must be able to provide 1ml/kg of
             whole blood, up to a maximum of 30 ml at each time point

          9. If participant weighs over 30kg, participant must be able to provide 1 ml/kg of whole
             blood, up to a maximum of 53 ml at each time point.

         10. Written informed consent from parents.

         11. Assent from study participant when appropriate.

         12. Participation on other clinical trials is acceptable.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Autologous HSCT.

          2. Patients referred to a Bone Marrow Transplant (BMT) center from a non-BMT center,
             where it is anticipated (at the discretion of the center PI) that adequate follow up
             according to the rules of this protocol can not be met, including the requirement for
             a reassessment by the BMT center at the time of cGVHD diagnosis.

          3. Ex-vivo T-cell depletion of graft source (e.g. CD34 selection).

          4. Haploidentical transplants.

          5. Second (or greater) allogeneic transplants (first allogeneic transplant where a
             previous autologous transplant was performed is permitted).

          6. Syngeneic transplants.
