To define the efficacy of maintenance chemotherapy by a low-dose metronomic (LDM)\n           regimen, in metastatic CRC patients responding under FOLFIRI + bevacizumab.\n\n        2. To discover predictive factors for response to this LDM regimen.\n\n      Hypothesis:\n\n        1. The re-growth of residual metastases can be slowed by the anti-angiogenic effects of\n           LDM chemotherapy.\n\n        2. Serial measurements of angiogenic/ inflammatory factors in the plasma and/or evaluation\n           of certain enzymes in the tumor may discover predictive factors of response to LDM\n           chemotherapy in metastatic CRC patients."
