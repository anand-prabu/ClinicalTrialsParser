            "textblock": "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy such as fludarabine use different ways to stop tumor\n      cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays\n      to damage tumor cells. Peripheral stem cell transplantation may be able to replace immune\n      cells that were destroyed by chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Sometimes the transplanted\n      cells can reject the body's normal tissues. Donor lymphocytes that have been treated in the\n      laboratory may prevent this.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of chemotherapy, total-body irradiation,\n      peripheral stem cell transplantation, and lymphocyte infusion in treating patients who have\n      stage IV melanoma."

Allogeneic peripheral blood stem cells are infused on\n      day 0.\n\n      Patients receive oral cyclosporine twice a day on days -3 to 35 and tapered until day 56 and\n      oral mycophenolate mofetil 3 times a day on days 0-40.\n\n      Patients with mixed chimerism and no graft-versus-host disease on day 56 receive donor\n      lymphocyte infusion (DLI) over 30 minutes on day 65 unless there is evidence of increasing\n      donor chimerism. DLI may be repeated every 65 days for up to 4 doses.\n\n      Patients are followed weekly for 3 months, monthly for 6 months, every 6 months through year\n      2, and then annually through year 5.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 4 years."
