  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a phase IV post registration prospective observational feasibility study in
      patients with metastatic soft tissue sarcoma. Pazopanib is the registered treatment for
      patients with advanced soft tissue sarcoma after chemotherapy with doxorubicin or
      ifosfamide.

        -  This study looks at the possibility of using 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose
           fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography PET scans as an early biomarker
           of pazopanib treatment effect in patients.

        -  It also studies pazopanib pharmacokinetics to see if there are differences between
           elderly and younger patients.

      The primary objectives are:

        -  To evaluate whether early metabolic response is correlated to clinical benefit.

        -  To evaluate the effect of age (≥ 70 years) on pazopanib pharmacokinetics.

      The secondary objectives are:

        -  To evaluate whether early metabolic response (% decrease in FDG uptake due to pazopanib
           therapy) is correlated with pazopanib exposure.

        -  To evaluate whether early metabolic response (% decrease in FDG uptake due to pazopanib
           therapy) is correlated with the histological subtypes.

        Inclusion Criteria:

             procedures or assessments and must be willing to comply with treatment and follow-up.

          2. Age ≥ 18 years. Patients aged 66-69 are eligible for the imaging arm of the study,
             however they are excluded from the assessment of altered pharmacokinetic behavior in
             elderly.

          3. Histological confirmed diagnosis of selective subtypes of advanced soft tissue
             sarcoma (STS) who have received prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease or who have
