  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronary artery disease (CAD) remains the leading cause of mortality in the UK with an
      estimated 80,000 fatalities in 2010. Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is associated with
      atherosclerotic plaque burden and cardiovascular mortality. Mechanisms underlying isolated
      CAC have not been as yet been fully explained. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), known to act as
      regulators of gene expression, have also emerged as powerful biomarkers in the diagnosis and
      prognosis of cardiovascular disorders and may be used in the detection of CAC. We aim to
      investigate the potential for a &quot;microRNA-signature&quot; in patients with CAC by performing a
      prospective, case-controlled study to identify pathways associated with CAC in humans.
      Previous research has demonstrated an inverse relationship between CAC and bone mineral
      density (BMD), suggesting that these processes may be linked. In a further substudy we plan
      to define the relationship between CAC and BMD as well as a number of markers of bone
      metabolism.

      Patients will be prospectively enrolled whilst attending for elective coronary CT (computed
      tomography) angiography including a coronary calcium score, at the Royal Surrey County
      Hospital. Data regarding demographic and clinical characteristics of patients will be
      collected. Peripheral venous blood sampling will take place on this occasion. Coronary
      artery calcification scores will be estimated by a Radiologist using default software.
      Patients eligible for the bone metabolism substudy will be required to attend the University
      of Surrey for peripheral Quantitative Computed Tomography (pQCT) of bone mineral composition
      of the radius. In the intervening period we will ask them to complete a 4-day food diary and
      wear a UV dosimeter, the latter to assess typical UV exposure, for one week.
