In adults the disease occurs\n      predominantly in young smokers from both genders, with a peak incidence at 20-40 yrs of age,\n      although female may be slightly older. High resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of the\n      lung has provided a considerable input for the diagnosis of pulmonary LCH.\n\n      We conducted a multicenter retrospective study on patients with pulmonary LCH who were\n      sequentially evaluated by concomitant lung HRCT and lung function testing. The objectives of\n      this study were: 1) to determine the changes over time of lung function parameters in\n      patients with pulmonary LCH; 2) to compare the variations of HRCT and lung function results\n      during follow-up; 3) to address the respective interest of these investigations for\n      identifying the patients who eventually will experience a progression of their disease.\n      Results of this study may help to improve the management of patients with adult pulmonary\n      LCH."
