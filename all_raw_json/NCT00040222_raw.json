Cancer outcomes are documented through review of medical, vital, and\n      pathology records. Selected individuals and family members are asked to complete\n      questionnaires to assess etiologic risk factors and to undergo clinical evaluations\n      specifically tailored to the relevant familial syndrome. Study participants are monitored\n      prospectively for the development of outcomes of interest, typically by means of periodic\n      mail or telephone contact. In selected instances, subjects may return to the Clinical Center\n      periodically for study-specific follow-up examinations. Study participants are asked to\n      donate biologic specimens to be used in the laboratory search for cancer etiology and\n      mechanisms of carcinogenesis. DNA and serial serum samples will be collected. Tumor tissue\n      will be obtained whenever feasible.\n\n      Clinical genetic testing for tumor susceptibility gene(s) mutations and risk notification\n      will be offered consistent with ASCO guidelines when reasonable individual cancer risk\n      estimates can be delivered, and only to those participants who choose to know their\n      individual genetic status after appropriate education and counseling. The testing will be\n      conducted exclusively in Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-licensed\n      laboratories. Clinical genetic testing and risk notification are entirely optional and do\n      not affect subject eligibility for other aspects of the protocol. A separate consent\n      procedure and consent form will be used for genetic testing and risk notification.\n\n      This protocol, developed in response to recommendations developed by the Clinical Center\n      IRB, is intended to:\n\n        1. Provide a mechanism under which the Clinical Genetics Branch can honor the commitment\n           made to the members of over 60 hereditary breast/ovarian cancer families which have\n           been participated in various Human Genetics Program research studies conducted over the\n           past 3 decades to provide genetic counseling,\n\n           clinical germline mutation testing, and consultative services now that several of the\n           major breast/ovarian cancer susceptibility genes have been identified;\n\n        2. Provide a mechanism through which new families with various familial syndromes\n           associated with an increased risk of breast and ovarian cancer can be studied, as\n           research interests in these syndromes evolve over time; and\n\n        3. Create a resource of well-characterized, carefully documented high-risk families to\n           facilitate the development of new etiologic and translational research studies in the\n           future.\n\n      While we do not offer specific anti-cancer therapy as part of this protocol, we provide\n      assistance to ensure that study participants who require treatment for problems that develop\n      during the course of the study are referred to appropriate health providers. We\n\n      remain available to provide advice and consultation related to the management of the\n      familial cancer syndrome to study participants and their health care providers."

For known or suspected familial\n        syndromes in which no gene has been identified, two or more living affected cases among\n        family members are required for participation. The types of familial syndromes under\n        active accrual and study are predominantly investigator-and hypothesis-driven. This\n        approach permits CGB investigators to remain alert to the opportunities afforded by\n        unexpected clusters of rare tumors in families and individuals, and to tailor the accrual\n        of families with specific types of syndromes to meet programmatic goals. This requires\n        that CGB investigators remain abreast of both general knowledge and state-of the-art\n        developments in clinical oncology, genetics, epidemiology and molecular biology, so that\n        critical research opportunities can be recognized when they present, and so that\n        thoughtful decisions can be made regarding the commitment of the resources needed to\n        conduct such studies.\n\n        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:\n\n        Individuals and families referred for evaluation in whom reported diagnoses are not\n        verifiable.\n\n        Inability to provide informed consent."
