            "textblock": "The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of vandetanib, in\n      patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer harboring RET gene rearrangement. In 2011,\n      gene rearrangement between RET and KIF5B gene (fusion) was discovered in a young, male lung\n      cancer patient. The following studies showed that this gene rearrangement was critical for\n      tumor initiation and maintenance. Of note, the growth and signaling properties mediated by\n      KIF5B-RET were diminished after treatment with vandetanib.\n\n      Until now, RET rearrangements have been known in thyroid cancers. Vandetanib, a multi-kinase\n      inhibitors with anti-RET activity, is an FDA-approved drug for the treatments of adults with\n      metastatic medullary thyroid cancers who are ineligible for surgery and who have progressive\n      or symptomatic disease. This study aimed to examine the efficacy and safety of this drug,\n      for the treatment of advanced lung cancer harboring RET rearrangement."

Treatment will be continued\n      till progression, unacceptable toxicity, or till 1 year. Vandetanib can be administered\n      after 1 year to the patients with benefit from vandetanib.\n\n      During the administration of vandetanib, vital signs, physical examination, ECOG performance\n      status, height, weight, hematology and chemistry test, ECG, adverse events and concomitant\n      drugs will be evaluated every four weeks (one cycle, for the first 6 months) or eight weeks\n      (two cycles, from 6 months to 1 year) and, if necessary, chest X-ray and pregnancy test will\n      also be performed. CT for tumor assessment will be performed once every 8 weeks for 1 year.\n      If the disease progression is suspected, the test can be additionally conducted at the\n      investigator's discretion."
