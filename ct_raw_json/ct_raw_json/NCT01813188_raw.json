For this reason, its treatment remains a challenge for the orthopedic\n      surgeon.\n\n      Recent advances in knowledge of cellular and molecular biology related to the mechanism of\n      bone repair and biomaterials science have been joined in a new discipline called tissue\n      engineering, its implementation in clinical practice is being done so progressive.\n\n      Cell therapy based on the use of adult stem cells (MSCs) derived from autologous bone\n      marrow, introduces new applications for the repair of fractures including pseudoarthrosis\n      and avascular bone necrosis.\n\n      Its mechanism of action does not focus only on their local action, but also in the release\n      of signaling molecules with autocrine and paracrine action through recruitment and\n      activation of endogenous MSCs to osteoblastic differentiation and bone tissue regeneration.\n\n      On the other hand, the seeding of  MSCs on biomaterials (natural or synthetic) is more\n      effective, to facilitate adherence, proliferation and extracellular matrix production in the\n      area where implanted.\n\n      Today, the investigators can say that there are experimental and clinical evidence\n      supporting the effectiveness of the method.\n\n      The investigators have designed a phase II clinical trial to check the feasibility of this\n      approach."
