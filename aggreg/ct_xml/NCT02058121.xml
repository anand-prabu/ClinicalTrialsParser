      enhances recovery and reduces relapse in patients treated at a specialised eating disorder
      unit.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a RCT in which the ACT-intervention is being compared to treatment as usual.
      The trial started in 2010, and randomisation of patients will continue until 2014, and
      follow-ups will be completed in 2016.

      According to analysis of power, a total of 120 patients needs to be included, 60 in each
      arm. Patients eligible for the interventions are offered to participate after their
      clinician has reported them to the head investigator. The head investigator sends a letter
      to the patients with information on the study. The clinician then asks the patient if the
      letter has been read. If the patient chooses to participate, he/she will be summoned to a
      information and assessment meeting. The head investigator checks that the patient
      understands the information, and what each study arm can mean for the patient when
      participating. Consent to participate is collected both verbally and written. At this
      meeting the patient receives an envelope which contains the randomization outcome. The
      patient then receives information regarding the continued treatment according to which
      research arm he/she is to participate in.

      The treatment intervention is planned to start within 6 weeks from the first letter of
      information has been sent. The goal is to start treatment four weeks after randomization, to
      enable a positive termination of previous treatment. The participants randomized to
      treatment as usual continues with the treatment as planned before enrollment. Thus, they
      might end treatment during the study period, or continue treatment after study
      participation, all according to the treatment plan with the clinician.

      Participants in the intervention arm start the group intervention consisting of 12 session
      over a period of three to four months, and an individual meeting with the group-leaders
      before and after the intervention. The intervention is a manualized application of the book
      &quot;Lev med din kropp&quot; [Live with your body]. Participants in need of further care after the
      intervention are offered continued treatment accordingly at the clinic.

      If a participant chooses to terminate the intervention, or deteriorate during the
      intervention to the point that other treatment is needed, further treatment is agreed upon
      in dialogue with the patient. If needed, further assessment and physical examination is
      conducted in accordance to the clinics standard procedures.

      Data is being collected at four times for all participants. At treatment start and end, and
      follow-up at 12 and 24 months after inclusion. At each time, the participants are prompted
      to fill in five different self-assessment forms, all well used and validated.
