      This trial evaluates surgeon-modified fenestrated-branched stent-grafts (sm-FBSG) for
      Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms (AAA) that are custom-made intra-operatively with no waiting
      period by a qualified vascular surgeon.  In addition, aims to examine the alternative
      sm-FBSG for patients with restricted access to centers performing clinical trials with
      commercially available devices and those patients with aortic emergencies.

    <textblock>
      Complex aortic aneurysms are those involving the renal, and visceral, arteries that require
      more extensive dissection, aortic clamping above the renal or mesenteric arteries, and
      possible reconstruction of aortic branches. Complex aortic aneurysms comprise two major
      entities, pararenal and thoracoabdominal aneurysms.

      Pararenal aneurysms represent the simplest form of complex aortic aneurysms that have no
      adequate neck between the renal arteries and the aneurysm and would require suprarenal
      clamping for open repair.

      Thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (TAAAs) involve dilatation of the descending thoracic
      aorta into the abdomen. The aneurysms may extend from the left subclavian artery to the
      iliac arteries. The most common etiology is from spontaneous degeneration of the aortic wall
      adventitia, but other causes of accelerated or secondary dilatation of the aortic wall
      include spontaneous aortic dissection, infection, trauma, and disorders of connective
      tissue, such as Marfan's, Turner's, and Ehlers-Danlos syndromes.

      Population studies have documented approximately 5.9 to 10.4 new TAAAs per 100,000
      person-years with nearly equal incidence in the sexes (males, 44%).The mean age at diagnosis
      is 63 to 65 years for men and 75 to 77 years for women. A study of deaths associated with
      TAAA captured by the Swedish National Bureau of Statistics and Swedish hospital records
      found that almost three quarters of TAAA ruptures occurred in women, mostly aged 70 to 84
      years. This dramatic difference in gender-associated rupture rates does not correlate with
      the incidence of TAAAs reported from single-center reports of treated TAAAs.

      The number of patients needed to treat thoracoabdominal aneurysms (TAAA) is estimated at
      two, making the benefit for patients undergoing repair of their TAAA obvious.
      Surgeon-modified fenestrated-branched stent-grafts (sm-FBSG) with branches for the visceral
      vessels in patients with complex aortic conditions could represent a therapeutic option for
      high-risk patients unfit for open surgery.  Open surgery for complex aneurysms of the
      abdominal aorta (AAA) including thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (TAAA) has greatly
      developed over the past decades to provide patients adequate management with good functional
      results and reduced perioperative morbidity and mortality.  However, despite much
      advancement in preoperative evaluation and perioperative care of patients with
      thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (TAAA), open surgical repair of TAAAs remains a formidable
      challenge for the vascular surgeon.  In a recent meta-analysis by Piazza and Ricotta of
      7,833 patients who underwent open surgical repair of TAAA between the years 2000 and 2010,
      the overall risk of death within 30 days was 7%, while in-hospital mortality was 10%. The
      30-day mortality was 5% for elective cases, with significant associated morbidity ranging
      from a 7.5% incidence of spinal cord ischemia, to 19% rate of renal failure and 36% rate of
      pulmonary dysfunction. The 30-day mortality for open repair of ruptured TAAA has been
      reported as high as 40%, with an average of 19% in this meta-analysis.

      Many high-risk patients with aneurysms of the abdominal aorta (AAA) and who have significant
      co-morbidities will not be good candidates for elective open surgery.  Endovascular aneurysm
      repair has been shown to be an effective alternative in treating uncomplicated infrarenal
      and thoracic aneurysms in both the elective and urgent setting, yet there is limited
      experience with this technology in complex conditions.  Fenestrated grafts have been
      developed as a minimally invasive treatment for patients with complex aortic aneurysms who
      are unfit for traditional open surgery. However, construction of these fenestrated grafts
      requires that they are custom-made to fit the specific anatomical requirements of each
      patient, and can take up to 12 weeks to manufacture. Restricted access to investigational
      devices and delays for device customization limit the treatment with these endografts to a
      small group of patients with relatively stable aneurysms.    Particularly in urgent cases,
      this time frame is not acceptable.

        General exclusion criteria

          -  Active infection

          -  Pregnancy

          -  Known allergy to stainless steel, polyester, or gold

          -  History of anaphylactic reaction to contrast material with an inability to properly
             prophylax the patient appropriately

          -  Morbid Obesity with inability to visualize the aorta with available intraoperative
             imaging techniques

          -  Patient has other medical, social or psychological conditions that, in the opinion of
             the investigator, preclude them from receiving the pre-treatment, required treatment,
             and post-treatment procedures and evaluations

          -  Patient is currently participating in another investigational device or drug clinical
             trial

        Anatomic exclusion criteria

          -  Aortic diameter of true lumen that cannot accommodate a fenestrated endograft

          -  Angulation of &gt;90Â° in the paravisceral aorta

          -  Highly calcified and/or stenosed iliac arteries with a diameter &lt;6mm and concomitant
             contraindication to perform iliac conduit.

          -  Highly torturous iliac arteries and concomitant contraindication to perform iliac
             conduit.

        Comments on exclusion criteria:

          -  Patients with connective tissue disorder are not automatically excluded from the
             study, since the outcome of open repair in the setting of high-risk patients with
             complex aneurysm is as bad or even worse as for patients without connective tissue
             disorders.

          -  Patients with hypersensitivity or contraindication to anticoagulation such as
             patients with Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT) are not automatically excluded
             from the study. Alternative forms of anticoagulation such as Argatroban or
             Bivalrudin, direct thrombin inhibitors, will be used in such cases.
