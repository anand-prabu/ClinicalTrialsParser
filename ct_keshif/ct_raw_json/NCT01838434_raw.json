Others find cancer cells and help kill them or\n      carry cancer-killing substances to them. Idelalisib may stop the growth of cancer cells by\n      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. It is not yet known whether\n      lenalidomide and rituximab is more effective with or without idelalisib in treating mantle\n      cell lymphoma."

Lenalidomide will be tested at sequential dose levels in a standard 3+3 design.\n\n             1. Dose Level 0 = 15mg/day for days 1-21 every 28 days\n\n             2. Dose Level 1 = 20mg/day for days 1-21 every 28 days and\n\n             3. Dose Level 2 = 25mg/day for days 1-21 every 28 days.\n\n           Patients can continue lenalidomide for up to 48 weeks (12 cycles) of treatment.\n\n        2. Idelalisib will be orally administered starting at Dose Level 1 (150 mg twice daily)\n           for continuous 28-day cycles until progression, intolerence, or patient/physician\n           discretion.\n\n        3. Rituximab will be administered intravenously at 375 mg/m2 for cycle 1 (ie, cycle 1, day\n           1, day 8, day 15, day 22) and then on day 1 of cycles 4,6,8,10. There will be no dose\n           reductions or escalations of rituximab.\n\n      Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms in the Phase II treatment plan described in\n      the \"Arms\" section. The primary and secondary objectives for this study are:\n\n        1. Phase I Primary Objective: To determine the safety and tolerability of the combination\n           of lenalidomide and rituximab with idelalisib in sequential dose cohorts.\n\n        2. Phase II Primary Objective: To determine the progression-free survival (PFS) of the\n           combination of lenalidomide and rituximab, with or without idelalisib in a randomized\n           phase II design.\n\n        3. Phase II Secondary Objectives:\n\n             1. To determine the overall response rate (ORR), complete response rate (CR), and\n                overall survival (OS) of the combination of lenalidomide and rituximab, with or\n                without idelalisib in a randomized phase II design.\n\n             2. To determine the prognostic and/or predictive significance of proliferation\n                markers and cell cycle components in patients with relapsed/refractory mantle cell\n                lymphoma (MCL) treated with idelalisib and lenalidomide.\n\n             3. To determine whether phosphorylated protein kinase B (pAKT) expression levels are\n                correlated with response to idelalisib plus lenalidomide.\n\n             4. To determine whether notch homolog 1, translocation-association (NOTCH1)\n                intracellular domain (ICD) immunohistochemistry (IHC) correlates with mutation and\n                outcome in MCL patients treated with idelalisib and lenalidomide.\n\n             5. To determine whether sex determining region Y-box 11 (SOX11) expression correlates\n                with response in patients with relapsed/refractory MCL treated with idelalisib and\n                lenalidomide.\n\n             6. To correlate cereblon (CRBN) expression with response in patients with\n                relapsed/refractory MCL treated with idelalisib and lenalidomide.\n\n             7. To evaluate several plasma cytokines and correlate observed changes to objective\n                response rates."
