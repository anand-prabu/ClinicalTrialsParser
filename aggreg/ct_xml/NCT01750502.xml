  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a pleiotropic cytokine that promote the
      inflammatory response.In animal studies, it has been found that MIF is released in the
      ischaemic heart, promoting glucose uptake and protecting the heart from
      ischaemia-reperfusion injury.The MIF concentration, influenced by age and myocardial
      ischemia, have different impact on myocardial functional recovery after ischemia.Therefore,
      the purpose of this experiment is to study the clinical significance of MIF in patients with
      coronary heart disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      MIF is a pleiotropic cytokine that promote the inflammatory response. MIF is expressed in
      several cell types,including monocytes/macrophages, vascular smooth muscle and
      cardiomyocytes, and is released on stimulation from pre-formed storage pools. A foreign
      study reported that MIF had demonstrated to offer protection from I/R-injury by activating
      adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and inhibiting c-Jun Nterminal
      kinase (JNK)-induced apoptosis of cardiomyocytes. In addition, animal experiments showed
      that MIF was reduced in aged heart compared with young heart. Coronary heart disease is a
      chronic ischemic disease, in which MIF may play as a protective factor during the whole
      procedure.

      We observed individuals who will be taking coronary angiography during the hospitalization.
      Individuals will be assigned to coronary-artery-disease group, which included acute coronary
      syndromes and stable ischemic heart disease, or non-coronary-artery-disease group, according
      to coronary angiography. All participants will be extracted 3ml blood sample 5 minutes
      before coronary angiography. Coronary-artery-disease group will be taken another two blood
      samples, 5 minutes after the opening of the balloon and 5 minutes after the stents have been
      implanted, respectively.
