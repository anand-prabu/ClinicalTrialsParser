The P300 component are accepted as electro-physiological\n      markers of neuropsychiatric disorders like alcoholism or drug addiction.\n\n      Recent scientific data suggest that eating disorders, leading to weight gain and obesity,\n      will be similar of those of drug addiction: it is the incentive sensitization theory that\n      implicates the dopaminergic reward system.\n\n      The aim of this cross-sectional study is to investigate the alteration of P300 auditory ERP\n      in obese women with eating disorders in comparison with obese and lean women without eating\n      disorders."
