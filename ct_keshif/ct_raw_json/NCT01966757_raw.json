The diagnosis\n      is determined by gene testing and skin biopsy findings although genetic testing has\n      supplanted skin biopsy in most cases.  Numberous studies have confirmed the presence of\n      sleep disorder in patients with NCL but these cases were documented over a decade ago.  The\n      investigators would like to study the prevalence of sleep disorders in this group of\n      patients. The investigators will distribute a Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ)\n      to the family of the patient to complete and provide a information regarding the patient's\n      sleep. In addition to the validated sleep questionnaire a separate demographic questionnaire\n      will be given to the family to identify the type of NCL, presence or absence of blindness,\n      presence or absence of seizures, interventions tried to treat sleep disturbance.  The last\n      questions of the study are asking for the presence or absence of Restless Leg Syndrome\n      symptoms."
