    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, multicenter, open-label Phase II, proof-of-mechanism study to evaluate
      the efficacy, safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of losmapimod in approximately 21
      subjects with primary (idiopathic) FSGS. FSGS patients with nephrotic range proteinuria
      (urinary protein/creatinine [Up/c] ratio &gt;3) and a history of steroid or calcineurin
      inhibitor resistance, including relapse of proteinuria after steroid or calcineurin
      inhibitor treatment will be included. Losmapimod will be orally administered twice daily
      over a 24-week treatment phase followed by a 12-week follow-up for safety and relapse
      assessments.

          -  Subject is between 18 and 65 years of age inclusive and has a body mass index (BMI)
             less than 35 kilograms(kg)/meter(m)^2.

          -  Subject has a clinical diagnosis of primary (idiopathic) FSGS made in the last 36
             months or less as verified by renal biopsy (light microscopy, immuno-fluorescence,
             and/or by electron microscope). This must be confirmed by independent review of the
             histopathology report and/or biopsy specimen(s) by the study central pathologist.

          -  Subject has FSGS resistant to corticosteroids or calcineurin inhibitors as defined by
             the Investigator and/or by guidelines and has not utilized a second FSGS-directed
             agent.  Resistance includes the inability to obtain sustained remission (i.e.
             occurrence of relapse). Up to approximately 5 subjects will be enrolled in whom the
             investigator considers corticosteroids to be contraindicated (Subjects who are obese,
             pre-diabetic, elderly, have prior intolerance to corticosteroids and/or are
             anticipated to have a poor response to corticosteroids).

          -  Subjects will have nephrotic range proteinuria, as indicated by a spot Up/c or 24
             hour urine total protein measure &gt; 3.0.  The Up/c will be assessed by the average of
             triplicate measures from first morning voids separated by a minimum of 24 hours and
             differing by =&lt;50%. Furthermore subjects must have had active disease with nephrotic
             proteinuria (i.e.:24 hour or spot Up/c &gt;3.0) for at least 2 months prior to
             screening, despite background therapy.

          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of non-childbearing potential;
             criteria to be considered of 'non-childbearing potential' as described in the

          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of child-bearing potential.
             Females of child-bearing potential must agree to use two of the approved
             contraception methods listed in the protocol from 14 days before the first dose of
             study drug until 30 days after the last dose of study drug.  Only females of
             child-bearing potential with negative pregnancy test, as determined by serum human
             chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) test at screening and urine hCG test prior to dosing at
             baseline visit and during the study at the indicated times, will be administered
             losmapimod.

          -  Subject is capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with
             the requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form and is willing and able
             to return for all study visits.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinically significant systemic illness or infection within the last 28 days (e.g.
             chronic persistent or acute infection) that is likely to result in deterioration of
             the subject's condition or affect the subject's safety during the study.

          -  Any condition or situation, including clinically significant abnormalities in
             screening laboratory assessments (not related to the disease), which in the opinion
             of the Investigator could confound the results of the study or put the subject at
             undue risk.

          -  History of sensitivity or intolerance to the study treatment (i.e. losmapimod), or a
             history of drug or other allergy that in the opinion of the Investigator or GSK

             recording period: QTc &gt;=450 milliseconds (msec) (machine or manual overread); or QTc
             &gt;=480 msec in subjects with Bundle Branch Block. If a single QTc is abnormal, then
             the averaged QTc values of triplicate electrocardiograms (ECGs) obtained (each
             separated by at least 5 min) will be utilize to determine eligibility.

          -  Hypertensive as defined as blood pressure (BP) &gt;140/90 millimetres of mercury (mmHg)
             at the end of screening: If the single BP measurement is above 140 mmHg systolic or
             90 mmHg diastolic, then the BP measurement can be repeated.  The subject must have 3
             consecutive BP readings that are less than 140 mmHg systolic and 90 mmHg diastolic,
             and each measurement must be separated by at least 15 minutes, to be eligible for

             for Hepatitis C antibody confirmed by HCV RNA.  If HCV RNA is not available, then the
             positive test for Hepatitis C antibody alone would be exclusionary.

             period prior to the first dose of the current study.

          -  The subject has participated in a clinical trial where they previously received
             losmapimod.

          -  The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational
