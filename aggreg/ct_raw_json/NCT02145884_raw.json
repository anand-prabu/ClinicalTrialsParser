Subjects are expected to use the study drug as directed every day for a 4 month\n      period.\n\n      Subjects will be assessed at baseline, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and every 4 weeks thereafter for a\n      total of 5 months. Physical exam, photographs to compare size and color intensity, and a\n      scale of improvement will be completed at each visit. Parents will complete a quality of\n      life questionnaire regarding their child's hemangioma and its impact on quality of life.\n\n      Subjects will be transferred to active timolol if there is evidence of significant worsening\n      at 4 weeks follow-up and beyond, as long as the patient is not at risk of imminent\n      ulceration. Patients who are crossed over to the active timolol arm will be removed from\n      study treatment at that time, but remain on study for follow-up."
