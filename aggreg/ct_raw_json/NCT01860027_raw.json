The reliability of the\n      clinical eye movement tests and the efficacy of the eye movement therapies have not been\n      determined.\n\n      Saccades are the fast eye movements that move our eyes from one word to the next when we\n      read. The eye movement recordings from patients diagnosed with reading disorders, extra\n      ocular muscle imbalances and control patients (no learning disability or eye movement\n      disorder) will be analyzed and compared. The sensitivity and specificity of detecting\n      reading disorders will be determined for the Visagraph III and the Readalyzer. Although\n      these clinical tests are frequently used to diagnose saccadic inaccuracies and diagnose\n      dyslexia in school aged children, the validity of these clinical screening tests has not\n      been determined."
