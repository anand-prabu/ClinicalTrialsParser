To determine how variation in gut microbial community composition and in steroid hormone\n      and xenobiotic metabolizing genes affects the metabolism of mammalian lignans and steroid\n      hormones after exposure to a lignan-rich food (flaxseed).\n\n      III. To determine how these associations differ by race (i.e., African American and European\n      American women).\n\n      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment groups.\n\n      GROUP I: Participants receive flaxseed orally (PO) daily for 6 weeks. After a usual diet\n      \"washout\" period of 8 weeks, patients crossover to Group II.\n\n      GROUP II: Participants maintain a usual diet for 6 weeks. After a usual diet \"washout\"\n      period of 8 weeks, patients crossover to Group I.\n\n      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up for 30 days."
