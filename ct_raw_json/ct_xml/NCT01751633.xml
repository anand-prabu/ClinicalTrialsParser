  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thoracolumbar fractures are the most common spinal fractures with an average annual
      incidence between 18 and 30 per 100'000 inhabitants. The majority of these fractures are AO
      type A3 (&quot;burst fractures&quot;). Although patients with burst fractures report a reduced quality
      of life and chronic pain, there is no clear evidence whether surgical or conservative
      treatment offer better functional and back-pain related outcomes. The indications for the
      selection of an ideal treatment for these fractures without neurological deficits remain
      controversial. The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether patients with thoracolumbar
      fractures without neurological deficit being surgically treated show faster recovery and
      better improvement of function than patients being conservatively treated.

        140 subjects patients with thoracolumbar fractures will be assigned to ei-ther
        conservative or surgical treatment depending on the surgeon's decision. Patients will be
        treated at each institution per standard of care. Surgeons will use their expertise and
        preferences to determine the method of surgical or conservative intervention.
