            "textblock": "Lung cancer is the most common cancer type worldwide, with more than 1.1 million annual\n      deaths. There are two types of the disease, namely non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and\n      small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), with the first accounting for 85% of the total number of\n      cases. The 5-year survival across stages remains disappointingly low, around 10% in most\n      countries, due to a high incidence of both loco-regional and distant failure [3]. However,\n      during the last decade improved radiotherapy techniques allowed an increase of the radiation\n      dose, while at the same time more effective chemo radiation schemes are being applied. These\n      developments have lead to improved outcome in terms of survival. As the TNM staging system\n      is highly inaccurate for the prediction of survival outcome for non-surgical patients,\n      attempts have been made to develop a more accurate risk stratification for these patients\n      [1,2]. A model based on clinical variables yielded an AUC of 0.74, which was encouraging,\n      but also left room for improvement [2]. An extended model, which included clinical as well\n      as biomarker variables, reached a higher AUC, but the limited number of patients included in\n      this study made it impossible to draw definitive conclusions [1].\n\n      New prognostic parameters can be retrieved from several sources, which include anatomic,\n      molecular and functional imaging, genomics, proteomics and clinical analysis of patients.\n      The unlimited amount of information is expected to lead to more accurate predictions of\n      individual treatment outcome [4].\n\n      The analysis of biomarkers, including proteins, is a fast developing, promising and\n      challenging area of research. Biomarkers can measure or evaluate normal biological\n      processes, pathogenic processes, or pharmacological responses to a therapeutic intervention.\n       Oncoproteins are produced by, or in response to tumor cells, and may be secreted in the\n      circulation of patients. As tissue sampling is often not possible in lung cancer patients,\n      blood sample collection by venepuncture offers an attractive alternative, which is safe and\n      easy to implement. A number of studies described the prognostic and predictive value of\n      blood biomarkers for NSCLC [5-7]. In this study we will investigate the prognostic value of\n      blood biomarkers related to 1) hypoxia: Osteopontin (OPN), carbonic anhydrase IX (CA-9), and\n      lactate dehydrogenase (LDH); 2) inflammation - interleukin 6 (IL-6), IL-8, and C-reactive\n      protein (CRP), and \u03b1-2-macroglobulin (\u03b1-2M); and 3) tumor load: Carcinoembryonic antigen\n      (CEA) and cytokeratin fragment (CYFRA 21-1).\n\n        1.
