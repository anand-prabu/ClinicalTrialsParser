  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I/randomized phase II study of the combination of SGI-110 and previously
      treated metastatic colorectal cancer patients. This study will be conducted in two
      components.  First, patients will be enrolled in a phase I study of SGI-110 combined with
      irinotecan in a standard 3+3 design. After the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined,
      patients will subsequently be enrolled in a 2:1 randomized phase II study of SGI-110 and
      irinotecan versus the standard of care regorafenib.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants must have histologically or cytologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of
             the colon or rectum

          -  Patients in the phase I cohort must have biopsiable disease and be amenable to having
             two research biopsies

          -  Archival tissue must be procured if available

          -  Participants must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be
             accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as &gt;
             20 mm with conventional techniques or as &gt; 10 mm with spiral CT scan. See section 10
             for the evaluation of measureable disease.

          -  Patients must have received irinotecan therapy in the metastatic setting.  There are
             no limitation on number of prior therapies in the metastatic setting.

          -  Age minimum of 18 years.

          -  Life expectancy of greater than 12 weeks.

          -  ECOG performance status &lt;1

          -  Participants must have normal organ and marrow function

          -  The effects of SGI-110 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason and
             because oncological agents are known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing
             potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier
             method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of
             study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while
             participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent
             document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not
             recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.

          -  Participants may not be receiving any other study agents.

          -  Participants with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse
             events.

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to irinotecan, decitabine or SGI-110.

          -  Subjects who have received prior therapy with any hypomethylating agents.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because SGI-110 is a/an hypomethylating
             agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is
             an unknown but potential risk of adverse events in nursing infants secondary to
             treatment of the mother with SGI-110, breastfeeding should be discontinued. These
             potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study.

          -  Individuals with a history of a different malignancy are ineligible except for the
             following circumstances. Individuals with a history of other malignancies are
             eligible if they have been disease-free for at least 5 years and are deemed by the
             investigator to be at low risk for recurrence of that malignancy. Individuals with
             the following cancers are eligible if diagnosed and treated within the past 5 years:
             cervical cancer in situ, and basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.

          -  HIV-positive individuals on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because
             of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with SGI-110. In addition, as these
             individuals are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with
             marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in participants
             receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.

          -  Previous treatment with regorafenib
