II. Determine\n      survival in these patients. III. Describe the toxicity of TAX/TOPO/G-CSF. IV. Evaluate tumor\n      p53 expression in relation to response to TAX/TOPO/G-CSF.\n\n      OUTLINE: All patients receive paclitaxel, topotecan, and G-CSF every 3 weeks for at least 2\n      courses and until 2 courses beyond maximum response. Patients are followed every 3 months\n      for 2 years, then every 6 months for relapse and survival.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 35 patients will be entered if there are 1-3 responses in the\n      first 20 patients."
