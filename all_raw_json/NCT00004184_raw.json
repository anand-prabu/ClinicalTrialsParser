Determine the toxicity of the human anti-idiotypic monoclonal antibody\n      vaccine (4B5) plus adjuvant sargramostim (GM-CSF) or alum in patients with stage III or IV\n      melanoma at high risk for recurrence following surgical resection. II. Determine whether 4B5\n      is associated with the development of humoral and/or cellular anti-anti-idiotypic immune\n      response in these patients. III. Determine whether the immune response generated against 4B5\n      is also directed against the melanoma-associated GD2 antigen in these patients. IV.\n      Determine whether the 4B5 plus adjuvant GM-CSF or alum can elicit an immune response to GD2\n      in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned sequentially to one of two treatment arms. Arm I: Patients\n      receive human anti-idiotypic monoclonal antibody vaccine (4B5) in sargramostim (GM-CSF)\n      subcutaneously (SQ) on days 0, 14, 28, and 42. Patients receive GM-CSF alone SQ at\n      vaccination site on days 2, 3, and 4 following immunization. Arm II: Patients receive 4B5\n      plus alum SQ on days 0, 14, 28, and 42. Cohorts of 5 patients receive treatment every 2\n      weeks for up to 4 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 50 patients (25 per arm) will be accrued for this study."
