            "textblock": "-  In a US nation-wide survey, lower urinary tract symptoms are one of the strongest\n           predictors that patients will seek complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) care.\n           In comparison to general gynecological patients, urogynecological patients are\n           particularly prone to seek help in CAM. Moreover out of the different CAM options,\n           herbal medication is one of the most preferred treatments. However, the effectiveness\n           of CAM regarding OAB has not yet been adequately and objectively evaluated. Therefore,\n           it is timely and essential to elucidate the mode of action as well as to prove efficacy\n           of herbal treatments by a translational approach including comprehensive in vitro\n           experimentation and randomized controlled clinical trials. Bryophyllum pinnatum and\n           specially the flavonoid components have shown a muscle relaxing effect on porcine\n           bladder strips.\n\n        -  Study Design: Multicenter, prospective, double-blind randomized, placebo-controlled\n           cross-over study, phase III to test the superiority of Bryophyllum pinnatum (BP) over\n           placebo in the treatment of overactive bladder.\n\n        -  In this cross-over trial a total of 30 patients is needed to proof the superiority of\n           BP over placebo (5 randomization blocs, each 6 patients). Each patient gets each of the\n           three study drugs (BP, Solifenacin, Placebo) in a double-blind randomization. The\n           number of patients was calculated in a post-hoc analysis based on the primary endpoint\n           of a previous study (reduction of micturition rates/24hours; 9.5 (SD2.2) before and 7.8\n           (SD1.2) after Bryophyllum versus 9.3 (SD1.8) before and 9.1(SD1.6) after placebo),\n           under the assumption of a normal data distribution and a power of 80% a patient number\n           of 2x20. Plus 10% for non-parametric tests in the case of a non-normal distribution\n           (Wilcoxon) were added, what generated a number of 2x22 patients.\n\n        -  In order to facilitate an equality in the randomization, the investigator choose a\n           cross-over design. Due to the length of the study time, the drop-out rate was risen\n           from 10 to 20% what yielded under the assumption of a equal block randomization the\n           number of 30 patients. Additionally, an explorative arm containing the standard\n           medication Vesicare was inserted, as this is of great clinical interest. For this\n           explorative comparative arm are no existing data that would allow to do a power\n           calculation.\n\n        -  This follow-up study will give a compelling answer on the efficacy or non-efficacy of\n           BP as well as the safety of BP in respect to placebo and possible answers of its\n           position regarding the standard medication Vesicare."
