  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are at increased risk for cardiovascular
      events (for example, heart attack) and the risk is related to one's overall control of blood
      glucose levels.  In this study the investigators will measure the effects of saxagliptin,
      compared to placebo, before, during, and after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.
      The investigators will use samples of the patients' blood and tissue to measure and evaluate
      indicators of the body's response to the treatment.  This study is being done to evaluate
      the effect of saxagliptin on biomarkers of the heart to help us understand whether reducing
      or controlling a person's blood glucose levels during and after CABG surgery will produce
      better clinical outcomes (for example, better heart health).

      This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the
      effect of saxagliptin on cardiac biomarkers of myocardial necrosis, cardiac function,
      inflammation, and apoptosis in subjects with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) undergoing CABG
      surgery (on pump, via a median sternotomy approach) as an integrated measure of the
      potential mechanistic effects of saxagliptin on prevention of CV outcomes. Approximately 74
      subjects will be randomized and complete the study.
