Cecal intubation may be difficult\n      for different reasons, and features of the colonoscope and the use of imaging devices may\n      influence the success rate. We want to compare the performance of a new colonoscope with\n      novel features including gradual stiffness with that of a colonoscope supplied with a\n      magnetic endoscope imaging (MEI) device. The hypothesis is that the performance of the new\n      instrument is non-inferior to the MEI system."

The MEI\n      system allows real time monitoring of the colonoscope position within the colon and is\n      considered to be a useful supplement to achieve cecal intubation. However, the MEI system is\n      costly, and trial results are equivocal regarding the actual benefits. A newly designed\n      colonoscope (ColoAssist) with gradual stiffness throughout the colonoscope shaft has been\n      developed to improve insertability. We want to investigate if we can achieve equal\n      performance results with the ColoAssist instrument as with the MEI system in CRC screening.\n      The study is designed as a two-center, single-blinded, randomized, controlled\n      non-inferiority trial."
