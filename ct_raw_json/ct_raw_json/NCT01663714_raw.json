Bulky Stage II is defined as a mediastinal mass greater than one-third of\n             the maximum chest diameter, or any other mass greater than or equal to 10 cm in\n             maximum diameter.\n\n          -  Subjects must have evidence that their tumor tissue expresses the CD20 antigen.\n             Immunoperoxidase stains of paraffin-embedded tissue showing positive reactivity with\n             L26 antibody or immunoperoxidase stains of frozen tissue showing positive reactivity\n             with Anti B1 Antibody (Coulter Clone\u00ae) or similar commercially available CD20\n             antibody or evidence of CD20 positivity by flow cytometry are acceptable evidence of\n             CD20 positivity.
