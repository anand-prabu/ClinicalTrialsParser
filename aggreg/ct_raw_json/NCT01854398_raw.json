However, more detailed analysis of diastolic function\n      by supine bicycle exercise echocardiography is lacking. The investigators hypothesized that\n      3 months of CPAP therapy in OSA patients will significantly improve diastolic functional\n      parameters measured by exercise stress echocardiography. Patients with severe OSA\n      (Apnea-hypopnea index > 30) will be included in this study, and randomized to CPAP versus\n      sham-CPAP group by 1:1 ratio. Supine bicycle exercise echocardiography, pulse wave velocity,\n      24 hours ambulatory blood pressure (BP), central BP will be checked before and after CPAP\n      therapy and parameters will be compared."
