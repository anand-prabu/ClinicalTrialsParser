            "textblock": "Lactobacillus GG (LGG) is able to exert long lasting effects in children with atopic\n      disorders.  We have shown that Nutramigen LGG accelerates tolerance acquisition in infants\n      with cow's milk allergy (CMA). The mechanisms of these effects are still largely undefined.\n      The effect of LGG could be related at least in part by the immunoregulatory role played by\n      LGG. This probiotic can balance the generation of cytokines possibly involved in IgE- or\n      non-IgE-mediated CMA (i.e., IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, IFN-\u03b3 , TGF-beta, and TNF-alfa), which can\n      contribute to modulation of in\ufb02ammatory processes. We have demonstrated that children with\n      IgE-mediated CMA produce significantly higher level of IL-4 and IL-13 in response to cow's\n      milk protein, and  that tolerance is associated with a marked reduction of IL-13 production\n      and a concomitant increased frequency of IFN-\u03b3 releasing cells.\n\n      Epigenetics  studies the heritable (and potentially reversible) changes of the genome\n      inherited from one cell generation to the next which alter gene expression but do not\n      involve changes in primary DNA sequences, highlighting the complexity of the\n      inter-relationship between genetics and nutrition. There are three distinct, but closely\n      interacting, epigenetic mechanisms (histone acetylation, DNA methylation, and non-coding\n      microRNAs) that are responsible for modifying the expression of critical genes associated\n      with physiologic and pathologic processes. The profile of epigenetic modifications\n      associated with Th lineage commitment, coupled with the sensitivity of the early\n      developmental period, has led to speculation that factors that disrupt these pathways may\n      increase the risk of allergic diseases. Specifically, effects on DNA methylation and\n      endogenous histone deacetylase inhibitors acting on specific pathways (Th1 and T regulatory\n      cell differentiation)  may favour Th2-associated allergic differentiation.  MicroRNAs are\n      another structural components of an epigenetic mechanism of post-transcriptional regulation\n      of messenger RNA translation. It has been recently identified a specific Th2-associated\n      miRNA (miR-21) that is critical for the regulation of Th cell polarization."
