Children that are born with hearing loss have to undergo several\n      hearing tests to diagnose the condition and many families are delayed in receiving this\n      testing or never obtain the needed testing. This research employs a new method for helping\n      children with hearing loss receive timely care by using a patient navigator, who is someone\n      who teaches and provides emotional/social support for the families of these children. The\n      hypothesis of this study is that a patient navigator will hasten the timing of pediatric\n      audiological testing, improve compliance with scheduled appointments, and expand parental\n      knowledge of pediatric hearing loss."

We will compare the failure to follow-up for\n      testing rates between groups. Of those enrolled subjects, the age of the children when they\n      obtain diagnostic testing will be assessed and compared between the patient navigator group\n      and the standard practice group. This arm will further quantify the effect of the navigator\n      on diagnostic testing timing.\n\n      The second arm strives to continue and build upon the first assessment by evaluating hearing\n      follow up in children up to six months of age who are diagnosed with hearing loss.  Parents\n      of children born at the University of Kentucky and at other hospitals who are following up\n      as outpatients at UK who are diagnosed with hearing loss will be approached for enrollment.\n      Parents of children in this arm of the study are also randomized from the age of enrollment\n      until one year old to a patient navigator group or standard practice group.  This group of\n      subjects will be assessed to find what follow up is conducted once the child is diagnosed\n      with hearing loss.   As in the first arm, the navigator group will have regular phone follow\n      ups with the patient navigator and the standard practice group will not have contact.  Both\n      groups will be given or mailed questionnaires, asking them about where they obtained\n      services for the child with regard to hearing follow up and intervention. This will assess\n      the effect of a navigator on parental education and support, timing of diagnostic services,\n      and implementation of interventions with regard to pediatric hearing loss."
