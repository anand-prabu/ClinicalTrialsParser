The\n      study will involve a six month trial of continuous subcutaneous Remodulin therapy, with\n      assessments conducted prior to initiation of therapy and at 1 and 6 months following\n      initiation of therapy. A separate initiation visit will be scheduled after the baseline\n      visit in order to provide subjects with comprehensive training in the use and care of the\n      Remodulin drug delivery system.\n\n      Baseline and post-treatment (6 month) assessments will include a history and physical\n      examination, cardiopulmonary exercise test, six minute walking distance, serum brain\n      natriuretic peptide (BNP), a Cambridge Pulmonary Hypertension Outcome Review (CAMPHOR)\n      quality of life survey, and subjective assessment of functional capacity (New York Heart\n      Association (NYHA) scale). The interim (1 month) follow-up visit will include a thorough\n      review of adverse events associated with Remodulin therapy, functional class assessment, six\n      minute walk distance, and serum BNP.\n\n      Remodulin will be initiated at 1.25 ng/kg/min and increased by 2-6 ng/kg/min weekly to a\n      target dose of 40 ng/kg/min. If the initial infusion rate cannot be tolerated it will be\n      reduced to 0.625 ng/kg/min. Changes in drug dose will be at the discretion of the\n      investigators following review of interim events. If necessary, the dose may be decreased by\n      2 ng/kg/min every two days as tolerated."
