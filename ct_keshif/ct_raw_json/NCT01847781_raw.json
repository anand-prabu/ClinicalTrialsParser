Peripheral blood monocytic cells (PBMCs) will be isolated, frozen and later\n      analyzed for all time-points simultaneously. PBMCs will be stimulated with vaccine-antigens\n      for 3-5 days and cellular activation markers will be measured together with cytokines\n      (Interferon-gamma, Interleukin (IL)-5, IL-13, IL-10, IL-17, IL-22). In addition, levels of\n      antimicrobial peptides in nasal fluid will be measured at baseline and after 4 weeks\n      post-vaccination."
