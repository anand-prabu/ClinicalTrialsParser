Immediate treatment consists of intravitreal ISIS 2922 every 7 days\n      for 3 injections (Induction) then every 14 days for 18 weeks (Maintenance). Patients in the\n      delayed treatment group receive no immediate anti-CMV treatment but are monitored  weekly\n      for disease progression. If disease progresses, patient receives ISIS 2922 on an identical\n      dosage regimen as those on immediate treatment. Patients may continue ISIS 2922 on a\n      biweekly extended maintenance schedule if dose is considered safe and the CMV retinitis is\n      clinically controlled.
