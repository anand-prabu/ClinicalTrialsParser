  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that there may exist different quantitative sensory profiles
      between radicular pain patients who respond and those who do not respond to standard therapy
      of epidural steroid injections (ESI).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are comparing warm/cold sensation, heat/cold pain threshold, heat/cold
      pain tolerance, wind-up, and diffuse noxious inhibitory control (DNIC) as measured by
      Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST) between subjects with a radicular pain condition.  The
      investigators are comparing those who respond and those who do not respond to standard
      therapy (ESI) before and after the treatment.
