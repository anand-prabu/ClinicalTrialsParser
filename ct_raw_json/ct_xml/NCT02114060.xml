  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, factorial study to compare the reduction in viral
      shedding among 6 different combinations of GEN-003, a therapeutic HSV-2 vaccine and
      Matrix-M2 adjuvant.

      Secondary objectives of the study include:

        -  Evaluation of the safety and tolerability of GEN-003 in combination with Matrix-M2.

        -  Comparison of the impact on clinical Herpes Simplex Virus type-2 (HSV-2) disease among
           the 6 different combinations of GEN-003 antigens and Matrix-M2 adjuvant measured by:

             -  Time to first clinical and/or virologic recurrence,

             -  Proportion of subjects who are recurrence free at 6 and 12 months after the last
                dose of vaccine,

             -  Lesion rate (percent of days with genital lesions present) during the
                post-vaccination swabbing periods.

        -  Evaluation of cellular and humoral responses to GEN-003 antigens.

      Additional objectives include:

        -  Assessment of the correlation between immune responses and change in viral shedding or
           impact on clinical disease as defined above.

        -  Determination of the recurrence rate in a subset of subjects not receiving suppressive
           antivirals throughout the study.

      Eligible subjects will enter a baseline period to collect anogenital swabs for 28
      consecutive days prior to randomization.  Each subject will receive up to 3 doses at 21 day
      intervals. Subjects will be followed for safety and immunologic response for 12 months
      following their last dose.
