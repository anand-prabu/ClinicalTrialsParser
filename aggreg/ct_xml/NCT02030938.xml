      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Negative nicotine test at screening visit

          -  Previous augmentation with silicone-filled or saline-filled breast implants requiring
             Revision Augmentation surgery for increased nipple:inframmary fold distance

          -  Well vascularized skin flaps that can be approximated without tension

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  BMI (Body Mass Index) that is ≥ 30 kg/m2

          -  Active smoker or have smoked within 6 weeks prior to screening visit

          -  Pregnant or nursing

          -  Advanced fibrocystic disease considered to be premalignant without accompanying
             subcutaneous mastectomy

          -  Carcinoma of the breast

          -  Previous mastectomy or lumpectomy

          -  Abscess or infection in the body at the time of enrollment

          -  Had any disease, including uncontrolled diabetes (e.g., HbAIc &gt; 8%), that is
             clinically known to impact wound healing ability. For example: collagen-vascular,
             connective tissue or autoimmune disorders (e.g., Systemic Lupus, Rheumatoid
             Arthritis, Scleroderma)

          -  Subjects with diagnosed diabetes must have HbAIc ≤ 8% within 3 months of enrollment

          -  Showed tissue characteristics that were clinically incompatible with mammaplasty,
             such as tissue damage resulting from radiation, inadequate tissue, compromised
             vascularity or ulceration

          -  Had, or was under treatment for, any condition that may have constituted an
             unwarranted surgical risk (e.g., unstable cardiac or pulmonary problems)

          -  History of prior implantation of any surgical scaffold (e.g., synthetic mesh,
             acellular dermal matrix, or biologic mesh) in the breast

          -  Implantation of any non-SERI® surgical scaffold (e.g., synthetic mesh, acellular
             dermal matrix, or biologic mesh) during the study period

          -  Product contraindications for use of SERI® Surgical Scaffold per the supplied package
             insert (e.g., hypersensitivity to silk)
