The use of fenretinide and tamoxifen before surgery may\n      be an effective way to prevent the recurrence of or further development of breast cancer.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to study the effectiveness of fenretinide and tamoxifen\n      given before surgery in treating women with breast cancer."

Determine the feasibility of identifying surrogate endpoint biomarkers in\n      women with breast ductal carcinoma in situ and associated neoplastic and preneoplastic\n      lesions. II. Determine whether treatment with fenretinide and tamoxifen administered daily\n      will cause significant modulation of proposed surrogate endpoint biomarkers in this patient\n      population.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, placebo controlled study. Patients are stratified according\n      to histological diagnosis (hyperplasia vs carcinoma). All patients undergo a core biopsy and\n      fine needle aspiration of the index lesion and are then assigned randomly to a treatment\n      arm. Arm I receives tamoxifen and fenretinide daily. Arm II receives a placebo daily. Both\n      arms continue for 14-28 days, until definitive surgery or a second biopsy is performed.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 100 patients will be accrued for this study, 50 patients per\n      arm."
