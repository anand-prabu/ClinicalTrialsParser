Intervention-group participants will receive four automated assessment and self-management support calls over a 3-month period (at baseline, 1-month, 2-month, 3-months).

Therefore, survivors randomized to the control condition will receive written material at the time of enrollment designed to educate them about PC symptoms and symptom management. Material will be approximately six pages in length, also written at or below an 8th grade reading level, and will include a summary of common symptoms experienced by prostate cancer survivors."

Our pilot data suggests that VA prostate\n      cancer survivors experience similar or worse symptom burden to that of the general\n      population of survivors. To address the need to improve patient-centered survivorship care\n      management for Veterans with prostate cancer, we propose a 4 year study with two aims: 1) to\n      conduct a randomized controlled trial to compare a personally tailored automated telephone\n      symptom management intervention for improving symptoms and symptom self-management to usual\n      care. We expect that those intervention group will have more confidence in symptom\n      self-management and better symptom self-management and prostate cancer quality of life\n      following the intervention, and that these outcomes will translate to more efficient use of\n      services for these Veterans, and 2) to compare utilization of services among those in the\n      intervention group to those in the control group."
