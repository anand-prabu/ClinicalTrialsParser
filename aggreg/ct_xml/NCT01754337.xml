  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Closed-loop strategy is composed of three components: glucose sensor to read glucose levels,
      insulin pump to infuse insulin and a dosing mathematical algorithm to decide on the required
      insulin dosages based on the sensor's readings. A dual-hormone closed-loop system would
      regulate glucose levels through the infusion of two hormone: insulin and glucagon.

      The main objective of this project is to compare the efficacy of single-hormone closed-loop
      strategy, dual-hormone closed-loop strategy and pump therapy to regulate glucose levels in a
      24-hours in-patient study with standardized conditions in adults and adolescents with type 1
      diabetes.

      The investigators hypothesized that dual-hormone closed-loop strategy is more effective in
      regulating glucose levels in adults and adolescents with type 1 diabetes compared to
      single-hormone closed-loop strategy, which in turn is more effective than the conventional
      pump therapy.

      Closed-loop strategy is composed of three components: glucose sensor to read glucose levels,
      insulin pump to infuse insulin and a dosing mathematical algorithm to decide on the required
      insulin dosages based on the sensor's readings. A dual-hormone closed-loop system would
      regulate glucose levels through the infusion of two hormone: insulin and glucagon.

      We aim to conduct the 1st randomized three-way cross-over trial comparing single hormone
      closed-loop strategy, dual-hormone closed-loop strategy and the conventional pump therapy.
      We aim to compare the three interventions for 24 hours in adults and adolescents with type 1
      diabetes. Each 24 hours will include a 60-min exercise session, three meals characterizing a
      full day, activities that mimick real-life conditions and an overnight stay. This study will
      also allow for multiple comparisons and evaluating the benefits of each component separately
      (i.e. the benefits of merely closing the loop with insulin alone vs. adding glucagon to the
      closed-loop strategy).

             surgery.

          3. A recent injury to body or limb, muscular disorder, use of any medication or other
             significant medical disorder if that injury, medication or disease in the judgment of
             the investigator will affect the completion of the exercise protocol.

          4. Pregnancy.

          5. Severe hypoglycemic episode within two weeks of screening.

          6. Current use of glucocorticoid medication (except low stable dose).

             the ability to complete the trial by the judgment of the investigator.

          9. Anticipating a significant change in exercise regimen between admissions (i.e.
             starting or stopping an organized sport).

         10. Failure to comply with team's recommendations (e.g. not willing to eat meals/snacks,
