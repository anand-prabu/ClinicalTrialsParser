  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical study, funded by the National Institutes of Health, will evaluate the
      safety and metabolic responses to a licensed inactivated seasonal influenza vaccine (TIV).
      This single arm study will consist of two cohorts: MELAS syndrome volunteers (a specific
      identified disorder of mitochondrial dysfunction: mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic
      acidosis, and stroke-like episodes) between 13-60 years for OR adult control volunteers
      between 18-65 years of age. Both cohorts will receive the same treatment: a single
      vaccination with an FDA-licensed intramuscular seasonal trivalent inactivated influenza
      vaccine (TIV).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mitochondrial disease constitutes the most common neurometabolic disease of childhood with
      an estimated minimal lifetime risk of developing this disorder of 1 in 5000 live births.

      This pilot study will for the first time prospectively assess the safety of seasonal flu
      immunization in a subgroup of patients with MELAS syndrome. Comparing their responses to
      those of healthy young control volunteers will provide new information about the safety and
      immunogenicity of flu vaccination in this important sub-population and help guide the design
      of future studies that can be carried out in younger children.

      All participants will receive a single administration of a licensed influenza vaccine.
      Prior to vaccination, participants will provide information regarding health history and
      responses to health questionnaires.  Vital signs will be assessed.  A blood sample and urine
      specimen will be collected prior to vaccination, and at 6 hours, 5-7 days and 26-30 days
      post-immunization.  Volunteers will be asked to keep a diary of symptoms post-vaccination.

    <description>The single arm of the study will consist of two cohorts: MELAS volunteers between 13-60 years for  OR  adult control volunteers between 18-65 years of age. Control volunteers will be age-matched +/-5 years to enrolled MELAS volunteers. If the MELAS volunteer has diabetes and uses insulin daily, their control will be an adult with diabetes who uses insulin daily.
Both cohorts will receive the same treatment: a single vaccination with FDA-licensed intramuscular seasonal trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:Inclusion criteria include:

          -  Age between 13-60 years for MELAS volunteers OR age between 18-65 years for adult
             control volunteers. Control volunteers will be age-matched +/-5 years to enrolled
             MELAS volunteers. If the MELAS volunteer has diabetes and uses insulin daily, their
             control will be an adult with diabetes who uses insulin daily.
