The researchers suspect that\n      individuals with alcoholic hepatitis have certain abnormalities in how their body handles\n      bile acids (a product made by the liver on a daily basis) produced by the liver.\n      Obeticholic acid has been shown to affect bile acid abnormalities and thus it is possible\n      that obeticholic acid may improve liver condition in individuals with alcoholic hepatitis."
