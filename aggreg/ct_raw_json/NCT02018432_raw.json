They occurred mainly at the beginning of therapy and mostly resolved with\n      continued treatment around for two weeks according to experiences of clinicians. These\n      adverse events occur more often in Roflumilast 500 \u03bcg than 250 \u03bcg, having negative impact on\n      compliance of patients at the early stage of treatments.\n\n      Thus, investigators aim to compare the drop-out rates between the usual dosage (Roflumilast\n      500 \u03bcg once daily) and the dose escalation (Roflumilast 250 \u03bcg  once daily for 4 weeks and\n      then escalating dose of 500 \u03bcg once daily)."
