      The goal of this research plan is to test the effectiveness of a brief, cognitive behavioral
      (CB) intervention to promote behavioral health treatment engagement among at-risk Veterans
      who call the Crisis Line but are resistant to behavioral health services.  This randomized
      controlled trial will recruit 80 Veterans who report current suicidal ideation at the time
      of the Crisis Line call and are resistant to seeking behavioral health treatment.  Half of
      the participants will receive the brief, individualized CB intervention and half will
      receive standardized procedures from VA's Crisis Line (i.e., usual care).  The effectiveness
      of the intervention will be tested on 1) attitudes toward behavioral health treatment rates,
      and 2) initiation of and adherence to treatment (assessed by the number of sessions
      attended).  We will also assess the impact of the intervention on suicidal ideation (SI) and
      explore the impact on the most common symptoms observed in Veteran suicide decedents (e.g.,
      depression).

    <description>The Cognitive Behavioral (CB) intervention is a brief, manualized, tailored one-on-one single session lasting 45-60 minutes and administered by phone. An individual format was chosen to reduce the potential discomfort of stigma of individual concerns in the presence of others. The intervention targets a change in the beliefs that influence whether or not someone enters mental health or substance use treatment. During the session, participants will be given a brief introduction to CBT and informed that CBT is based on the theory that cognitions (i.e., thoughts/beliefs), feelings and behaviors all interact with each other;101, 102 therefore, thoughts about certain situations or things influence behavior. Since thoughts are modifiable, changing thoughts about situations may change behavior.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Inclusion criteria for the study are as follows:

          -  individuals 18 and older who call the Veteran Crisis Line

          -  have a phone number where they can be reached, be it a land line or a cell phone

          -  deemed by the Crisis Line responder to be at risk for suicide, but not imminent risk

          -  refuse a referral to the SPC or to a behavioral health treatment provider during the
             call

          -  report current suicidal ideation (SI) during the call based on administration of a
             standard item

          -  have not been in behavioral health treatment in the past.  Presence of SI will be
             subsequently confirmed by the research assistant using the Columbia Suicide Severity
             Rating Scale, a validated instrument.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Exclusion criteria are being judged by the Crisis Line responder to show:

          -  debilitating cognitive impairment

          -  active psychosis or mania
