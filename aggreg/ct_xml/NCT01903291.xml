  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to estimate the annualized relapse rate (ARR) over a
      12-month period in patients with relapsing forms of MS who are treated with dimethyl
      fumarate (DMF) after suboptimal response to glatiramer acetate (GA).  The secondary
      objectives of this study in this study population are to assess the impact of DMF over a
      12-month period on patient-reported outcomes (PROs) and health economic-related outcomes and
      to evaluate additional clinical outcomes at Month 12.

        This study will be conducted in male and female patients with relapsing forms of MS who
        satisfy the therapeutic indication for dimethyl fumarate (DMF) per the United States
        Prescribing Information, and who are suboptimal responders to glatiramer acetate (GA), as
        determined by the Prescribing Physician.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have the ability to understand the purpose and risks of the study and provide signed
             and dated informed consent and authorization to use Protected Health Information in
             accordance with national and local patient privacy regulations.

          -  Have the ability to read and understand written English.

          -  Have access to the internet and are able to complete online assessments on a computer

          -  Have a relapsing form of Multiple Sclerosis and satisfy the approved therapeutic
             indication for dimethyl fumarate (DMF) per the United States Prescribing Information
             (USPI).

          -  Are being treated for relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS) with glatiramer
             acetate (GA) but, per the Prescribing Physician, have a suboptimal response (e.g.,
             suboptimal efficacy, intolerance, or poor adherence) to GA or have stopped treatment
             with GA for relapsing forms of MS as a result of suboptimal response within 30 days
             of enrollment.

          -  Have decided to initiate treatment with dimethyl fumarate (DMF) under routine
             clinical care. The decision to initiate treatment with DMF must precede enrollment.

          -  Have a complete blood count (CBC) available within 6 months of initiation of
             treatment with dimethyl fumarate (DMF).

          -  Are aged ≥18 years.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Are unwilling or unable to comply with study requirements, or, are deemed unsuitable
             for study participation at the discretion of the Prescribing Physician.

          -  Have major comorbid conditions that would preclude their participation in the study
             as determined by the Prescribing Physician.

          -  Have a history of malignancy. (Patients with basal cell carcinoma that has been
             completely excised prior to study entry remain eligible.)

          -  Have a history of and/or current serious infections.

          -  Are pregnant or breastfeeding, or are planning to become pregnant or breastfeed.

          -  Are receiving concomitant disease modifying therapies other than glatiramer acetate
             (GA) or have initiated treatment with a new disease-modifying therapy since
             discontinuation of glatiramer acetate (GA).

          -  Are currently enrolled in any other clinical studies, with the exception of the
             dimethyl fumarate (DMF) Pregnancy Registry.

          -  Have received prior treatment with dimethyl fumarate (DMF).
