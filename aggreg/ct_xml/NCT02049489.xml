    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate a type of immunotherapy in which the patient's immune response will
      be stimulated to kill tumor cells. ICT-121 dendritic cell vaccine is made from patient's
      white blood cells. This vaccine will be tested in patients with recurrent glioblastoma to
      assess safety, tolerability and clinical response. Patient's white blood cells (WBC) will be
      collected from blood and cultured to yield autologous DC. The DC will be mixed with purified
      peptides from the CD133 antigen. The DC vaccine will be given back to the patient over
      several months. The goal is to stimulate the patient's immune response to CD133 to kill the
      patient's glioblastoma tumor cells.

      Immunotherapy holds promise in oncology for the potential to provide targeted anti-tumor
      therapy with minimal adverse events. The goal of this study is to assess immunotherapy
      directed to CD133 in an autologous dendritic cell product called ICT-121. CD133 antigen is
      overexpressed on many types of cancer cells and is associated with shortened survival. CD133
      positive cancer stem cells are resistant to chemotherapy. Patients with recurrent
      glioblastoma who have the HLA A2 phenotype will receive autologous vaccine of DC pulsed with
      purified peptides from CD133.

      Approximately 20 patients with first recurrence of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) who have
      had gross tumor resection will be treated.  After screening and informed consent, patients
      will undergo apheresis to collect peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Monocytes will
      be purified and cultured into dendritic cells (DC) that are pulsed with purified peptides
      from CD133 antigen. The pulsed dendritic cells will then be aliquoted and frozen. Patients
      will have the autologous DCs reinfused intradermally. Patients will receive at least four
      intradermal injections of the autologous DC vaccine and additional vaccines during a
      maintenance phase. The goal is to induce a cytotoxic T cell response to CD133 positive
      cells. The primary objective of the study is to assess safety and tolerability. Clinical
      response rates will be monitored as well as the immune responses to CD133.
