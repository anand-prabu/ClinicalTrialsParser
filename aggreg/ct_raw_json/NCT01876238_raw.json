            "textblock": "The new communication practice (T-PAT) is a team approach for discussing prognosis and\n      treatment goals. T-PAT is specifically designed to a) increase understanding of the\n      prognosis and treatment goal, b) decrease illness uncertainty, and c) help the patient\n      preserve hope for the future.This dedicated clinical visit features a structured discussion\n      of prognosis, treatment goals and options, and end of life concerns. The planned team\n      discussion will include information contributions for the treating medical oncologist, an\n      oncology nurse and social worker who currently work together to provide breast cancer care.\n\n      Primary Objectives:\n\n        1. Assess the feasibility of implementing the T-PAT prognosis discussion intervention.\n\n        2. Compare the effects of T-PAT vs. usual care on pertinent patient reported outcomes\n           including: a) understanding of the prognosis and treatment goal, b) illness\n           uncertainty, and c) hope.\n\n             -  First, a survey will be administered to patients in the waiting room before the\n                next office visit. This should take 15-20 minutes.\n\n             -  The second part involves participating in a scheduled appointment that will be\n                audio-recorded and focus on sharing information about the patient's illness.\n                Patients will be randomized to either participate in an appointment featuring new\n                communication practices (T-PAT)or a regular care appointment.\n\n             -  The third part involves a 20 minute survey, after the appointment, with a member\n                of the study staff. This will take place over the telephone one or two days after\n                the appointment.\n\n             -  The fourth part is completion of a written reflection on the patients\n                participation in the study, which will be returned in a pre-addressed, stamped\n                envelope. Generally, this should take about 15 minutes."
