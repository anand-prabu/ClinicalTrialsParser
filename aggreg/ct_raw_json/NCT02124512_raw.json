            "textblock": "Metabolic syndrome is a condition involving elevated levels of fat in the blood, a tendency\n      towards diabetes, hypertension, and too much fat around the abdomen (an increased\n      waistline). Individuals with metabolic syndrome often have impaired glucose tolerance, which\n      is a condition where blood sugar is normal when fasting (before eating), but is too high\n      after drinking a sugary drink. This is due to an abnormality in the body's sensitivity to\n      insulin (insulin resistance), which is due in part to an inability of the muscle to take up\n      glucose.\n\n      People with metabolic syndrome have inflammation in their fat tissue and in their blood\n      stream, and the changes in the level of inflammatory chemicals produced by cells in your fat\n      tissues will be studied.  One possible source of the inflammation may be the bacteria in the\n      intestine.  When individuals eat fatty foods, some of the bacterial products become attached\n      to the fat in their blood and then get directed to fat tissue.  The investigators wish to\n      determine whether individuals have an excessive amount of inflammation in their fat tissues,\n      and whether this inflammation comes from the bacteria in their intestines.  To determine\n      this, the investigators wish to treat individuals with an antibiotic that reduces the\n      bacteria in their intestines and in their blood, and determine whether this reduces their\n      overall level of inflammation."

Following their successful\n      completion of those procedures subjects will be randomized to study treatment.  That\n      treatment will involve receiving the investigational drug,80 mg per day of  rifaximin\n      soluable solid dispersion (SDD), or placebo for 8 weeks.  All procedures will be performed\n      on the Clinical Services Core of the CCTS.  The initial visit will involve informed consent,\n      and routine labs (comprehensive metabolic panel, lipid panel, TSH, CBC with platelets).\n      These routine labs are for safety purposes and to rule out exclusionary disorders.  A stool\n      sample will also be collected and frozen for possible future analysis of bacterial\n      microflora.\n\n      Subjects will be asked to allow the principal investigator to bank blood and tissue samples\n      collected during this study that are not used for other study related tests.  No additional\n      blood or tissue samples will be collected.  If the subject agrees to the banking of their\n      blood and tissue samples they will be stored in the Principal Investigator's laboratory at\n      the University of Kentucky for an indefinite period of time or until they are used up.\n      Stored samples will be used for future research testing to learn about how to prevent,\n      detect, or treat insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, diabetes or other health problems.\n\n      Each subject will undergo total body composition testing using a total body dual-energy\n      x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan.
