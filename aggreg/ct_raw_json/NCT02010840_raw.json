            "textblock": "Background: Having a first child is a key marker of the transition into parenthood that\n      requires substantial adjustment of couples' life. A recent meta-analysis published in the\n      Journal of American Medical Association reports that both women (23.8%) and men (10.4%)\n      suffer from perinatal depression [1]. The father's involvement during pregnancy can\n      positively influence health outcomes not only for the man, but his partner, and their\n      children [1,2]. However, the effectiveness of father's involvement in prenatal care in\n      preventing paternal and maternal depression, is still unknown.\n\n      Aims: This study seeks to: (1) evaluate the effect of a father inclusive psychoeducation\n      program for first-time Chinese mothers and fathers on depressive symptoms (primary outcome),\n      marital relationships and quality of life at 6 weeks, 6 months and one year postpartum; and\n      (2) explore fathers' involvement, their perceived benefits of participating in the program\n      and factors influencing the effectiveness of the program.\n\n      Methods: This study employs a longitudinal, randomized, pre and post-test design. A\n      convenience sample of 576 couples will be recruited at antenatal clinics and randomly\n      assigned to one of three groups: (1) the experimental group with both couples receives the\n      intervention on top of usual perinatal care; (2) the comparison group with only the women\n      receives the intervention on top of usual perinatal care; and (3) the control group receives\n      usual perinatal care only. The intervention consists of a single 3-hour session during\n      pregnancy and two telephone follow-up at postpartum week one and week two. Primary outcome\n      on postnatal depression will be assessed by Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. Secondary\n      outcomes on marital relationship and quality of life will be assessed by Dyadic Adjustment\n      Scale and Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 12-item Health Survey, respectively, at\n      baseline, 6 weeks, 6 months and one year postpartum. Process evaluation will be conducted at\n      6 weeks postpartum using individual telephone interview on 20 couples randomly selected from\n      the experimental group."
