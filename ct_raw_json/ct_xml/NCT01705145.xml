      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and
      pharmacodynamics (PD), of ivacaftor in children with CF who are 2 through 5 years of age and
      have a CFTR gating mutation in at least 1 allele.

      This is an open-label study designed to evaluate the safety, PK, PD, and efficacy of
      ivacaftor in subjects with CF who are 2 through 5 years of age and have a CFTR gating
      mutation in at least 1 allele. Part A is designed to evaluate the safety and PK of
      multiple-dose administration of ivacaftor in subjects 2 through 5 years of age and to
      confirm the doses for Part B. Part B is designed to evaluate the safety, PK, PD, and
      efficacy of ivacaftor in subjects 2 through 5 years of age.

      Ivacaftor is currently approved by the US FDA and the EMA under the trade name Kalydeco® for
      the treatment of cystic fibrosis in patients 6 years of age and older who have the
      G551D-CFTR mutation

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of any illness or condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, might
             confound the results of the study or pose an additional risk in administering study
             drug to the subject

          -  An acute upper or lower respiratory infection, or pulmonary exacerbation, or changes
             in therapy for pulmonary disease within 4 weeks before Day 1

          -  Abnormal liver function, at screening

          -  History of solid organ or hematological transplantation

             Day 1

          -  Participation in a clinical study involving administration of either an
             investigational or a marketed drug within 30 days or 5 terminal half-lives before
             screening
