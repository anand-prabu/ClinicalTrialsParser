Subjects will be followed closely for up to 6 months and a subgroup\n      of volunteers will be followed up to 3 years in order to evaluate the duration of immunity\n      following vaccination.  Another cohort will enroll 100 vaccinia-experienced volunteers and\n      randomly assign them to receive either CCSV (50 volunteers) or Dryvax\u00ae (50 volunteers) and a\n      sub group will be followed up to 3 years.  A fifth cohort will enroll 100 vaccinia-naive\n      volunteers and randomly assign them to receive different dilutions of CCSV (1:1, 1:5, 1:25,\n      and 1:50)."
