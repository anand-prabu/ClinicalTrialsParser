Data\n      collection is based on EMA theory; participant burden is low, and the Food Image App\n      decreases participant and staff burden even further. Data management and analysis are\n      semi-automated and relies on advanced computer algorithms. A strength of this approach is\n      its semi-automation, which allows us to leverage the strengths of human operators and\n      computer automation."

The RFPM, Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA). and the Food Photography\n      Application\u00a9 will be used to estimate the energy and nutrient intake of preschoolers. The\n      accuracy of the RFPM will be examined by determining the energy and nutrient intake\n      (collectively referred to as food intake [FI]) to established methods: 1) actual gram (g)\n      weights of laboratory-based test meals and 2) doubly labeled water (DLW) in a natural\n      environment."
