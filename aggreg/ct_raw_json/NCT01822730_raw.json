Both paliperidone and risperidone are\n      second generation antipsychotics\uff0cbut have same pharmacological effects of antipsychotic\n      treatment and paliperidone may have more efficacy and safty.This study was designed to\n      examine the acute efficacy, safety, and tolerability of paliperidone and risperidone for\n      patients with MAP."
