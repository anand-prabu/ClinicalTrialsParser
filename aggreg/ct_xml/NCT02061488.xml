      The purpose of the study is to assess a new closed-loop algorithm in type 1 diabetes (Saddle
      Point Model Predictive Control : SP-MPC)
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ten patients will be assessed during a closed-loop night and an open-loop night in random
      order.

      The primary objective is to assess the ability of SP-MPC controler to maintain euglycemia
      and avoid hypoglycaemia during the night, compared to open loop in type 1 diabetic patients
      treated by insulin pump.
