    <textblock>
      People who are infected with HIV and tuberculosis (TB) need to receive medications that
      treat both diseases safely and effectively. This study will enroll children infected with
      HIV and TB and evaluate the safety and tolerance of an antiretroviral (ARV) treatment
      regimen for HIV that contains raltegravir when administered with a TB treatment regimen that
      includes rifampicin. Study researchers will also determine the most effective dose of
      raltegravir for children when it is taken with rifampicin.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      People who are infected with HIV are also at risk for becoming infected with TB,
      particularly in many resource-limited settings, including Sub-Saharan Africa. Rifampicin is
      a medication commonly used to treat TB. There is a need for HIV treatment regimens that
      contain newer ARV medications that are well-tolerated and have minimal interactions with
      rifampicin-containing TB medication regimens. This study will enroll HIV-infected children
      who have never taken any ARV medications and who are infected with TB and are taking or will
      be starting a TB medication regimen that includes rifampicin. The purpose of this study is
      to evaluate the safety and tolerance of raltegravir-containing ARV regimens to treat HIV
      when administered with a rifampicin-containing regimen to treat TB in children. Study
      researchers will also evaluate the pharmacokinetics of the medications (i.e., how medication
      is absorbed and processed in the body) and determine the most effective dose of raltegravir
      when it is administered with a TB regimen that contains rifampicin.

      During the study, researchers will continuously monitor participant data for safety and
      other factors. Researchers may adjust the dose of raltegravir given to participants prior to
      enrolling additional participants.

      At study entry, participants will undergo a medical and medication history review, physical
      examination, medication adherence assessment, blood collection, and urine collection.
      Participants will receive chewable raltegravir tablets twice daily, and they will also take
      their TB medications, including rifampicin, and two nucleoside reverse transcriptase
      inhibitor (NRTI) ARV medications that will be chosen by participants' doctors. This study
      will provide raltegravir to participants; all other medications will be prescribed by
      participants' own doctors.

      At study visits at Days 5 to 8 and at Week 4, participants will remain in the clinic for
      about 12 hours. During these two visits, participants will take part in the same study
      procedures that occurred at the entry visit, but they will also have small amounts of blood
      collected several times throughout the 12 hours to measure the amount of medication in the
      blood. After the Day 5 to 8 visit, participants will begin receiving efavirenz, which is an
      ARV medication, in addition to the other medications. Participants will continue receiving
      raltegravir until they stop taking their TB medications. They will continue to take
      efavirenz and the other two ARV medications for 3 months after they stop receiving
      raltegravir and the TB medications.

      Additional study visits will occur at Week 8, every 4 weeks until the participant stops
      receiving raltegravir and the TB medications, and 4 and 12 weeks after stopping raltegravir
      and the TB medications. These study visits will include the same study procedures that
      occurred at study entry. Participants will be enrolled in the study for a total of about 4
      to 9 months.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Weight greater than or equal to 10 kg at entry

          -  Documentation of HIV-1 infection is defined as positive results from two samples
             collected at different time points. All samples tested must be whole blood, serum, or
             plasma. For studies conducted under an Investigational New Drug (IND), all test
             methods should be Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved if available. If
             FDA-approved methods are not available, test methods should be verified according to
             good clinical laboratory practice (GCLP) and approved by the IMPAACT central
             laboratory. More information on this criterion can be found in the protocol.

          -  ARV treatment naive, except for exposure to prevention of mother-to-child
             transmission (PMTCT); nevirapine (NVP) use for PMTCT cannot have extended beyond the
             first week of life

          -  ARV treatment eligible as defined by:

               1. Country-specific guidelines OR

               2. World Health Organization (WHO) pediatric treatment algorithm
                  (http://www.who.int/hiv/pub/guidelines/art/en/index.html)

          -  Diagnosis of pulmonary TB or TB adenitis. More information on this criterion can be
             found in the protocol.

          -  Initiated at least a 3-drug TB regimen containing rifampicin and has tolerated at
             least 1 week of TB drug regimen prior to initiation of raltegravir. Note: TB
             treatment may be started after being diagnosed by the site investigator. Treatment
             regimens may include isoniazid, pyrazinamide, ethambutol, and streptomycin in
             addition to rifampicin.

          -  Parent, legal guardian, or designated guardian according to country-specific
             guidelines able and willing to provide signed informed consent and to have the
             participant followed at the clinical site

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Greater than or equal to Grade 2 aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine
             aminotransferase (ALT) at screening, which must be within 30 days of entry. Note:
             Participants can be re-screened provided that they will have at least 4 weeks of TB
             treatment remaining at the time of entry.

          -  Any greater than Grade 3 clinical toxicity at screening except fever, chills, fatigue
             or malaise, unintentional weight loss, and dyspnea or respiratory distress that could
             be associated with TB

          -  Acute, serious infections other than TB requiring active treatment (e.g.,
             Pneumocystis jirovecii [previously Pneumocystis carinii] pneumonia [PCP],
             cryptococcal meningitis, etc.). Children diagnosed with acute bacterial pneumonia at
             time of diagnosis of TB may be included. Prophylaxis against opportunistic infections
             will be allowed.

          -  Diagnosis of kwashiorkor (less than 80% expected weight-for-age with the presence of
             edema and hypoalbuminemia)

          -  Current chemotherapy for active malignancy and history of chemotherapy discontinued
             within 1 year of entry

          -  Rifampicin therapy of greater than 20 weeks duration immediately prior to enrollment

          -  Known or suspected MDR or XDR TB, including contact with a documented MDR or XDR TB
             source case, as these may require longer duration of therapy or non-rifampicin
             containing regimen. Note: Participants found to have MDR or XDR TB before or during
             the study will be informed of their illness and referred for appropriate care as
             determined by local guidelines.

             significant findings during the screening medical history or physical examination
             that, in the investigator's opinion, would compromise the outcome of this study

          -  Sexually active, pregnant, or breastfeeding

          -  Unlikely to adhere to the study procedures or keep appointments

          -  Planning to relocate during the study to a non-IMPAACT study site
