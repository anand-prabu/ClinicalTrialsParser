This study is\n      conducted in normal Japanese volunteers. The main goal of the study is to provide the range\n      of these structural parameters in normal eyes. The study will include at least 224\n      (enrollment target: 249) normal volunteers; each study site will recruit 32 to 40 subjects\n      with an age range of 18 to 90 years and an approximately equal number of females and males.\n      All subjects will undergo Spectralis OCT imaging, biometric and ophthalmoscopic examination,\n      disc photography and visual field testing in one single visit. All examinations performed on\n      the subjects are non-significant risk procedures because the medical devices are cleared for\n      marketing in Europe and in the U.S."
