    <textblock>
      This Phase III pivotal efficacy study will assess efficacy and onset of pain relief of
      MFC51123 gel vs. placebo and MFC51123 gel vs. 1% diclofenac gel and 3% menthol gel in
      participants with an ankle sprain to support topical MFC51123 gel registration.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, repeat-dose, placebo-controlled,
      parallel-group trial in participants with ankle sprain. Eligible participants will be
      randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups (1% diclofenac plus 3% menthol gel, 1%
      diclofenac plus 0.09% menthol gel, 3% menthol gel or placebo gel with 0.09% menthol).
      Treatment will be self-administered by participants four times daily on an out-patient
      basis. Participants will rate pain intensity score (NRS) at rest and on movement, pain
      relief score (PRS) and cooling and soothing sensations. After leaving the clinic,
      participants will continue to complete scheduled pain intensity and pain relief assessments
      and answer questions about cooling sensation by answering questions in a paper diary card.
      The investigator (or designee) will measure the ankle swelling via the 'figure-of-eight'
      method on treatment Days 1 (at Baseline), 3, 7 and 10.

      Participants will continue treatment until they are pain free or for up to 10 days,
      whichever occurs first. At the end of the treatment, participants will be assessed for
      function of the injured joint by the investigator. In addition, the participants will
      evaluate treatment satisfaction, sensory features of the gel and provide a global assessment
      of the treatment by using a questionnaire.

    <description>AUC of pain intensity (PI) on movement measured by a numerical rating scale (NRS) during the 48 hour time interval from Day 1 to 3. AUC1-3 day will be calculated based on trapezoidal method. Pain intensity will be measured in NRS scale from 0 (no pain) to 10 (extreme pain).
