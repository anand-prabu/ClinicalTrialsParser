      menstrual cycle in a home setting by female volunteers seeking to get pregnant.

      The Clearblue Fertility Monitor is a personal monitor designed to be used with disposable
      test sticks for the semi-quantitative measurement of estrone-3-glucuronide (E3G) and
      luteinising hormone (LH) in women's urine.  This personal information allows women to
      identify their fertile window and appropriately time intercourse in order to maximise their
      chances of conception.  A new version of this monitor (Clearblue Advanced Fertility Monitor)
      has been developed with additional functionality including the option to test for pregnancy.

      This study will assess the volunteer ease of use of the new Clearblue Advanced Fertility
      Monitor and the understanding and interpretation of the results by the user.  This is a
      single centre clinical study which will be conducted by volunteers at their residence and
      co-ordinated by the clinical department at SPD Development Company Ltd.

      A minimum of 100 female volunteers representing the target consumer will be required to use
      the new Clearblue Advanced Fertility Monitor at home as per the instructions for use.  This
      will involve them setting up the monitor, using the monitor for one full cycle and then
      setting up the monitor for their next cycle unless they test for pregnancy and get a
      pregnant result.

      At the end of one full cycle, all volunteers will complete a study questionnaire which
      includes sections on comprehension of the instructions for use, ease of use and
      interpretation of test results.
