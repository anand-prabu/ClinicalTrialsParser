  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is being conducted to evaluate the effect of rifampin (a strong CYP3A4 inducer)
      and rabeprazole (a pH elevating agent) on the PK of dabrafenib (a CYP3A4/CYP2C8 substrate).
      The study will be conducted in subjects with BRAF V600 mutation-positive tumors. Data
      collected from this study will be used to inform recommendations regarding use of
      concomitant medications with dabrafenib and future clinical pharmacologic evaluation of
      dabrafenib.
