    <textblock>
      This multicenter, open-label study will evaluate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and
      dose-limiting toxicities of onartuzumab as single agent and in combination with sorafenib in
      patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. Patients in Cohort 1 will receive
      onartuzumab as single agent on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle. Patients in Cohorts 2 and 3 will
      receive onartuzumab on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle in combination with sorafenib 400 mg
      orally daily or twice daily. Anticipated time on study treatment is until disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs.
