  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to find out whether the combination of chemotherapy drugs that
      are routinely used in children with ALL, will be safe and effective in treating adult
      patients with ALL. The standard treatment for adults with ALL consists of many chemotherapy
      drugs that are given in different combinations and in several steps. In adult ALL there is
      no standard which drugs to give and how to combine them. Some leukemias have a chromosome
      abnormality called Philadelphia chromosome (also called Ph Positive) and some leukemias do
      not (called Ph Negative). In this study we want to see whether this combination of
      chemotherapy drugs will be safe and effective in treating adult patients with Ph Negative
      ALL.

    <description>The treatment plan has 6 treatment cycles. The cycle names are listed in the following order:
Induction Phase I - Induction Phase II - Intensification I - Re-induction I - Intensification II - Re-induction II Each cycle is given over a period of 4-6 weeks and the interval between them can range between 1-3 weeks. Based the patients medical condition, the doctor may decide to change the timing of the drugs, the interval between the drugs in a cycle, or the interval between the cycles. After receiving all cycles you will continue with a 36 months treatment part that is called Maintenance.</description>
