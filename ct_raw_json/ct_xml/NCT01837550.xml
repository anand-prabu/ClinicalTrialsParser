    <textblock>
      Audiologic rehabilitation aims to improve communication for people with hearing impairment.
      Education is widely regarded as an integral part of rehabilitation, but the effect of the
      delivery method of an educational program on the experience of hearing problems has rarely
      been investigated in controlled trials. Internet as a complement to audiological
      rehabilitation has been tested in different studies with promising results. Though, until
      now not applied clinically as a part of an audiological rehabilitation, focused on hearing
      aid users with persistent self- reported activity limitation and participation restriction.

      The purpose of this study was to examine the short-term effects of complementing an
      educational program for hearing aid users with Internet support.

      Hearing aid users will randomly be assigned to an intervention group or a control group. The
      intervention group is going to have access to a book and to a prepared compendium about
      communication strategies via the Internet and will receive weekly topic-based reading
      instructions related to the different chapters of the book or the compendium. The group will
      also have access to online and telephone support and access to an online discussion forum
      where new discussion topics will be posted each week. The project leader will evaluate the
      weekly data via the Internet. The control group will only have access to the book's content
      via the Internet and will be asked to read and evaluate the content.

      The Hearing Handicap Inventory for the Elderly, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale,
      and the International Outcome Inventory for Hearing Aids will be used to measure the
      outcomes of this study.
