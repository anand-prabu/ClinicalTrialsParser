Implement a multi-level HPV vaccine educational intervention directed at 3 levels within\n      participating 12 Ohio Appalachia counties that includes information about cervical cancer,\n      cervical cancer screening, HPV, the HPV vaccine, communication skills training to improve\n      parent-health care provider conversations about the HPV vaccine, and organizational level\n      components.\n\n      II. Evaluate the effectiveness of the multi-level HPV vaccine educational intervention in a\n      group randomized controlled trial in 12 Ohio Appalachia counties.\n\n      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\n\n      ARM I: Parents and health care providers receive educational materials about HPV vaccination\n      by mail or in-person review with project staff including a culturally tailored HPV and\n      cervical cancer educational video and brochures, a question and answer (Q & A) fact sheet,\n      and a HPV and cervical cancer resource list. Clinics receive waiting and exam room posters\n      and brochures, tabletop cards, reminder cards to mail to participants, an information\n      resource list, newsletter, vaccine tracking system, and \"invitation to be vaccinated\" letter\n      to mail to parents.\n\n      ARM II: Parents and health care providers receive educational materials about influenza\n      vaccination by mail or in-person review with project staff.\n\n      After completion of study, participants are followed up at 3 and 6 months."
