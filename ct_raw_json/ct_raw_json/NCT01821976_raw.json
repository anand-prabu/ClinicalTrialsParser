            "textblock": "High-energy open fractures, blast, gunshot wound and crush injuries to the distal tibia,\n      ankle, hind foot and midfoot are common challenges to military and civilian trauma surgeons\n      (Brown, 2009; Covey, 2002; Ficke, 2007; McGuigan, 2007; Hansen, 2001). Many surgeons believe\n      that an early transtibial amputation provides a better long term functional outcome than\n      limb salvage for these injuries (Hansen, 2001; Myerson, 1994; Sanders, 1992; Turchin,1999;\n      Shawen, 2010;Ellington 2012).  If a transtibial amputation is selected as the treatment for\n      the patient, a controversy remains regarding the appropriate amputation technique. Many\n      surgeons advocate for an amputation with a tibia-fibula synostosis technique (Ertl\n      procedure) in young and active patients, believing that this procedure provides a better\n      prosthetic interface, an end bearing capacity and soft tissue stability that improves\n      performance and functional outcomes. (Pinto 2004; Pinzur 2006; Commuri 2010). Others\n      strongly advocate for a standard posterior flap (Burgess procedure) without the synostosis,\n      arguing that patients have similar outcomes with fewer complications and lower costs.\n      (Pinzur 2008; Tindle 2011) To date, the outcomes of the transtibial amputation techniques\n      have not been subjected to an appropriately powered prospective randomized clinical trial.\n\n      The primary study objective is to compare functional outcomes and number of revision\n      surgeries to the amputated limb after first amputation for patients undergoing a transtibial\n      amputation and randomized to receive a tibia-fibula synostosis (Ertl procedure) versus a\n      standard posterior flap procedure (Burgess procedure).\n\n      The secondary study objectives are to compare levels of impairment for patients undergoing a\n      transtibial amputation and randomized to receive a tibia-fibula synostosis (Ertl procedure)\n      versus a standard posterior flap procedure (Burgess procedure); to compare levels of pain\n      for patients undergoing a transtibial amputation and randomized to receive a tibia-fibula\n      synostosis (Ertl procedure) versus a standard posterior flap procedure (Burgess procedure);\n      and to compare initial hospitalization and overall treatment costs (through the 18 month\n      follow-up) for patients undergoing a transtibial amputation and are randomized to receive a\n      tibia-fibula synostosis (Ertl procedure) versus a standard posterior flap procedure (Burgess\n      procedure)."
