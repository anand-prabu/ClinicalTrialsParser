Compare changes in imaging measures to tissue measures of response, in particular antigen\n      identified by proliferation-related Ki-67 antigen (Ki-67), in the pre-therapy biopsy versus\n      the post-therapy surgical specimen.\n\n      II. Correlate imaging measures to measures of gene expression from pre and post therapy\n      assays to determine if there are molecular changes associated with early response to\n      therapy.\n\n      OUTLINE:\n\n      Patients undergo FLT PET at baseline and 1-6 weeks after the start of treatment."
