The first group of patients (N=247) received thoracic epidural\n      analgesia (TEA) during ERCP procedures, the patients of the second group (N=244) received a\n      narcotic analgesic. To detect statistically significant differences between research groups\n      adjusted odds ratios (OR) and their 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated."
