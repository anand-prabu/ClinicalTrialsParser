The objectives of this project are: - to validate the\n      radiosynthesis of 68Ga-DOTATOC on their site with a new synthetizer - and clinically\n      evaluate, through a prospective preliminary study, the diagnostic accuracy of PET-CT with\n      68Ga-DOTATOC in comparison with other standard imaging examinations."
