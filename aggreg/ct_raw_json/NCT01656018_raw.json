In treatment phase, enrolled\n      participants will be divided in to 2 arms, ie, Arm A (female participants) which will be\n      further divided in to Arm 1A, Arm 2A, Arm 3A, Arm 4A, and Arm 5A with 12 female participants\n      per arm; and Arm B (male participants) which will be  further divided in to Arm 1B, Arm 2B,\n      Arm 3B, Arm 4B, and Arm 5B with 6 male participants per arm. Safety evaluations will include\n      assessment of adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, electrocardiogram, physical\n      examination, and vital signs which will be monitored throughout the study.
