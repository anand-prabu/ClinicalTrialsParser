  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this project, investigators examine the impact of a mood treatment enhanced diabetes
      self-care intervention for depressed, low-income Latino diabetics. The investigators
      hypothesize that the mood treatment enhancement will lead to significant improvement in both
      diabetes and depression outcomes as compared with the self-care intervention alone.

    <textblock>
      The Phase I pilot recruited older Latinos from Dr. Mangione's previous study (who agreed to
      participate in future research) and 10 participants from a community settings. Those with
      low mood and poor glycemic control were offered a 12-week intervention combining cognitive
      behavioral therapy mood management techniques and diabetes self-care into one seamless
      intervention. Drs. Mangione and Miranda supervised and reviewed (through audiotapes)
      well-trained health educators conducting the intervention sessions. The study manuals were
      modified following this Phase I pilot intervention.

      The final intervention manual was tested in a randomized trial in Phase II, compared the
      Mood and Diabetes Empowerment and Improvement Training intervention with enhanced care as
      usual (providing participants with a letter regarding their mood and hemoglobin (Hb)A1c with
      recommendations for improving care for their provider). The target population was low-income
      Latinos with depression and poor glycemic control. Both mood and diabetes outcomes are
      evaluated.

    <description>Participants in the Wait-listed Control Group will receive augmented access and communication with a primary care provider. The augmentation would consist of providing the participant with a letter to be shared with their primary care doctor indicating their Hb A1c level and depression score at the time of eligibility screening. The research team will also attach a list of local mental health service providers to the letter.  The participants randomized to the wait-listed control group will also be offered access to the intervention after the trial is completed in the event that the randomized controlled trial (RCT) has significant results.</description>

    <description>Participants will attend weekly 2-hour group Empowerment and CBT classes for 12 weeks led by two trained health educators.  Participants will learn cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) techniques to manage their mood. After CBT, participants will  learn a diabetes education format that is grounded in empowerment theory that employs group problem solving, individualized goal setting, and personal behavioral change &quot;experiments&quot; designed to help patients set priorities and to become better self-managers of both diabetes and their mood. As part of the intervention activities, group members will be advised to monitor their blood sugar levels, blood pressure, and mood on a daily basis.</description>

CBT Module 1 covers &quot;Understanding Depression and Diabetes&quot;, Module 2 &quot;How Thoughts Affect Your Mood and Diabetes Care&quot;, Module 3 &quot;How Activities Affect Your Mood and Diabetes Care&quot;. The Diabetes Empowerment Module covers topics including the following: food, exercise, medicine, diabetes and your health, social support, communication skills, and community resources.</description>
