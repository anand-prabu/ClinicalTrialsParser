It is also commonly done in cases where there is significant cervical spine\n      pathology i.e. cervical myelopathy or instability.  The anesthetic technique used for the\n      awake intubation is crucial to the patient's safety.  One of the most important aspects of\n      the anesthetic technique is airway anesthesia prior to placement of an endotracheal tube.\n      The  superior laryngeal nerve is responsible for mediating the cough reflex around the vocal\n      cords.  The investigators have developed an approach to reliably block the superior\n      laryngeal nerve by injecting local anesthetic near the nerve in a unique approach. Injecting\n      local anesthetic into or through the thyrohyoid membrane will effectively block the superior\n      laryngeal nerve"
