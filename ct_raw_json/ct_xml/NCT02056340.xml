  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Influenza (the 'flu') is a common virus infecting approximately 5-20% of the population in
      the United States and causing as many as 500,000 deaths worldwide each year. Currently,
      there are only a few treatments for influenza infection and none of these target
      inflammation that can be caused by the virus.  This study will test whether the
      anti-inflammatory effects of statins, a class of drugs most often used to treat high
      cholesterol, will decrease the severity of illness in patients who are infected with
      influenza by testing markers of inflammation in the blood and recording resolution of
      influenza illness.
