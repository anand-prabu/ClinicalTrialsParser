Protocol had been developed\n      containing 20 suspected emergency incidences in respiratory care. The nursing staffs are\n      instructed about the study and how to complete the protocol. The protocol was placed at each\n      patient and every time an emergency occurred, the nursing staff registered the incidence. If\n      an emergency fulfils more than one criterion in the protocol, every applicable criterion was\n      marked. The data will be analyzed using non-parametric descriptive statistics."
