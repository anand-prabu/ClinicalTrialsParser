  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be an open-label uncontrolled trial to evaluate the safety and tolerability of
      aripiprazole IM depot administered every 4 weeks for 52 weeks to patients with bipolar I
      disorder.  The trial will enroll subjects who completed either Trial 31-08-250 or Trial
      31-08-251 and de novo subjects not participating in Trials 31-08-250 or 31-08- 251.

      This will be an open-label, uncontrolled study which will enroll completers from Study
      31-08-250 and Study 31-08-251 and new subjects not participating in Studies 250/251.  The
      treatment history of subjects prior to enrolment in the open-label study will vary according
      to the design of the pivotal double-blind study (i.e 31-08-250 or 31-08-251).

      This open-label study will be comprised of phases similar to the pivotal double-blind
      studies (i.e. Studies 250/251): a screening phase (if applicable), a conversion phase (Phase
      A, if applicable), an oral stabilization phase (Phase B, if applicable), and an IM depot
      open-label maintenance phase (Phase C).  Phase C will be a 52-week treatment period with a 4
      week follow up period.

      During Phase C (the open-label maintenance phase) rescue medication will be allowed for
      subjects who do not meet stability criteria.
