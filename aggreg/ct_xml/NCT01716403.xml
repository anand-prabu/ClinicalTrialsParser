  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The risk of severe anemia is increased in patients treated by tri-therapy compared to
      patients treated by bitherapy. The underlying mechanisms involved in this toxicity remain
      unexplored but could also depend on the global exposure of telaprevir. The trough
      concentration or AUC of telaprevir could therefore be a predictive factor of the onset of
      anemia in patients treated by ribavirin/PEG-INF/telaprevir. The early measurement of
      telaprevir and ribavirin concentrations could help to manage HCV tri-therapy to improve
      tolerance and SVR.
