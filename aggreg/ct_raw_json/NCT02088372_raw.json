In vitro research and development studies\n      have shown that this material has improved wear performance, retention of mechanical\n      properties, and a high resistance to oxidation due to the anti-oxidative properties of\n      Vitamin E.  Biomet Inc, has received FDA clearance to market tibial polyethylene components\n      made of E1\u2122 for use in the Vanguard total knee replacement system.\n\n      Vanguard Total Knee System\u2122 The Vanguard\u2122 Knee System was designed to incorporate features\n      from prior designs, including: ACG, Maxim, & Ascent.  The Vanguard Knee includes a\n      streamlined design, rounded sagittal profile, and a deeper trochlear groove.  The femoral\n      component is available in Cruciate Retaining (CR), Posterior Stabilizing (PS), and Super\n      Stabilized (SSK).  Tibial Bearings are available in various levels of constraint required by\n      the surgeon (CR, PS, AS, etc.).\n\n      For this study, ONLY Vanguard with PS Bearing will be used.\n\n      The purpose of the study is to evaluate clinical performance of Vanguard Knee with E1\n      Bearing in TKA in Korean patient population. The clinical performance will be evaluated\n      based on patient outcomes, radiographic assessment and survivorship."
