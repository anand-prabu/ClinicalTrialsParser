    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine the mechanisms of stroke in patients with
      Intracranial Atherosclerotic Disease (IAD) by specifically evaluating limitations of
      antegrade flow through the stenotic artery, distal tissue perfusion to the affected
      territory, and artery-to-artery embolism. The hypothesis is that non-invasive imaging
      biomarkers that stratify stroke risk and distinguish mechanisms of IADThis prospective
      multicenter study will enroll 175 patients with recently symptomatic (&lt;7 days) high-grade
      IAD. Patients will be studied within 14 days of the index event (allowing appropriate time
      to arrange for diverse imaging modalities), with the following advanced neuroimaging
      techniques to elucidate mechanisms of recurrent ischemia:

        -  Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (QMRA) to assess volumetric flow rate through
           the stenotic artery.

        -  Magnetic resonance perfusion weighted imaging (PWI-MRI) to determine distal tissue
           perfusion.

        -  Vasomotor reactivity by transcranial Doppler using the breath-holding technique
           (BHI-TCD) to assess compensatory flow characteristics to the territory distal to the
           affected artery;

        -  Transcranial Doppler with embolic signal monitoring to evaluate artery-to-artery
           embolism that reflects plaque instability.

      Patients will receive standardized medical management and its effectiveness on blood
      pressure, lipid, and glycemic control will be monitored.

      The primary outcome is recurrent stroke in the territory of the stenotic artery during a
      1-year follow-up period; secondary outcomes are: a) new asymptomatic ischemic lesions on MRI
      in the distribution of the stenotic artery at 4-6 weeks, and b) transient ischemic attack
      (TIA) in the distribution of the stenotic artery during a 1-year follow-up period.

      Patients will be recruited at various sites that will be trained and certified on the
      imaging techniques employed. Raw imaging data will be interpreted centrally.
