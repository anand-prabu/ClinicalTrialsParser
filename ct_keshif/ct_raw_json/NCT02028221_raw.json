            "textblock": "Overweight and obesity are well established risk factors for breast cancer that develop\n      after menopause. The increased postmenopausal breast cancer risk in women who are overweight\n      or obese is likely to be attributed to multiple metabolic disturbances. Metformin is a\n      commonly used medication in diabetics to stabilize blood sugar. Association studies and\n      laboratory studies have shown its potential to reduce the risk for development of cancer,\n      including breast cancer. Recent pilot clinical studies in breast cancer patients suggest\n      that metformin may only be effective in overweight or obese women with metabolic\n      disturbances. We propose to conduct a clinical study of metformin in overweight or obese\n      premenopausal women with metabolic disturbances. Study participants will be randomly\n      assigned to receive metformin or placebo for 12 months. The study will evaluate whether\n      metformin can result in favorable changes in risk features that have been associated with\n      increased breast cancer risk. The risk features that will be examined in our study include\n      breast density, certain proteins and hormones, products of body metabolism, and body weight\n      and composition.  The study should help determine the potential breast cancer preventive\n      activity of metformin in a growing population at risk for multiple diseases."

            "textblock": "High adiposity is a major risk factor for a number of chronic diseases, including type 2\n      diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and certain types of cancer, including postmenopausal\n      breast cancer. The increased postmenopausal breast cancer risk in women with high adiposity\n      is likely to be attributed to multiple metabolic disturbances including altered circulating\n      sex steroid hormones, hyperinsulinemic insulin resistance, altered expression and secretion\n      of adipokines from adipose tissue, increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and\n      increased oxidative stress.\n\n      Metformin, a widely used antidiabetic drug, exerts favorable effects on multiple metabolic\n      disturbances which may lead to reduction of breast cancer risk in women with high adiposity.\n      In addition, metformin may exert a direct effect in mammary tissue through the activation of\n      the AMP-activated protein kinase signaling pathway, leading to an antiproliferative effect\n      and induction of apoptosis. Recent case control and cohort studies found that treatment with\n      metformin appears to substantially reduce the risk for development of cancer in diabetics,\n      including breast cancer.  There are a number of ongoing clinical trials of metformin in\n      breast cancer patients. However, applicability of these trials to at risk healthy women\n      requires further research and the concurrent or prior cancer treatments in these trials\n      hinder the evaluation of metformin as a single agent for breast cancer risk reduction. In\n      addition, recent clinical and animal studies suggest that metformin may only exert tumor\n      suppressive effects in metabolic phenotypes of high adiposity and metabolic disturbances.\n\n      We propose to conduct a Phase II randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of\n      metformin in overweight/obese premenopausal women who have metabolic syndrome. This study\n      population is at increased risk for postmenopausal breast cancer and has a high prevalence\n      of metabolic disturbances. The overall objective of this study is to determine its potential\n      effects on reduction of obesity-associated breast cancer risk."
