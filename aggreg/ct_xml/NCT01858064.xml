  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to assess the predictability of treatment response to
      stimulants in adults with ADHD using functional magnetic resonance

      This study will be a six-week, open-label study including adults ranging from age 18-55 with
      ADHD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Certain brain characteristics have been identified in individuals with persistent and
      remitted ADHD.  We predict that neural functional connectivity; specifically decreases in
      connectivity between the posterior cingulated cortex and medial prefrontal cortex, as well
      as decreases in anticorrelations between the medial prefrontal cortex and dorsolateral
      prefrontal cortex, will predict greater response to stimulant treatment.
