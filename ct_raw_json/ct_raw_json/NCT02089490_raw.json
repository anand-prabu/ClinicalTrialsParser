Its porosity and the\n      speed of degradation allow the act of recolonization by the fibroblasts and initiation of\n      the vascularization process within 3 weeks. The application procedure requires removement of\n      the silicone layer and wound covering with an ultra-thin epidermal graft, possibly meshed.\n      This surgical procedure is well-known and permits an ultra-thin epidermal graft.\n\n      All the patients will be treated with NEVELIA\u00ae, prior to autologous skin grafting within 3\n      weeks after its application. Then, three follow-up visits will be planned: post operatively,\n      at 6 and 12 months.\n\n      The objectives are:\n\n        -  Primary objective: To assess the type and frequency of complications\n\n        -  Secondary objectives:\n\n             -  To assess the take rate of NEVELIA\u00ae\n\n             -  To assess the take rate of skin graft\n\n             -  To assess the satisfaction rate of physician and patient,\n\n             -  To assess the quality of the healed skin,\n\n             -  To assess the rate of re-operation at 12 months."
