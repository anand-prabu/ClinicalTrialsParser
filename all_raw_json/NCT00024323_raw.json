Treatment repeats every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable\n      toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of cisplatin until the maximum tolerated\n      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6\n      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-25 patients will be accrued for this study."
