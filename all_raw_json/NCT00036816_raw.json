Patients are stratified according to tumor\n      size (medium vs large), prior treatment of primary tumor (surgery vs radiotherapy), and\n      participating center. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive vaccination with NA17-A and melanoma differentiation peptides\n           (e.g., tyrosinase, Melan-A, and gp100 antigens) subcutaneously and intradermally on\n           days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Patients then receive a vaccination once every 14 days for 4\n           doses, once every 28 days for 4 doses, once every 56 days for 4 doses, and then once\n           every 3 months for a total of 4 years.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients undergo observation only every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6\n           months for 2 years.\n\n      All patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 600 patients (300 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this\n      study within 2 years."
