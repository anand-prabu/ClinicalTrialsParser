            "textblock": "Background: Persistent nonspecific low back pain (PNSLBP) is one of the most common low back\n      pains worldwide. Many interventions were tried including wet cupping which is commonly used\n      for pain conditions in Saudi Arabia and other parts in the world but without solid\n      scientific evidence.\n\n      Aims:  This study aims at determining safety and efficacy of wet cupping for treating\n      PNSLBP.\n\n      Methods: This is a randomized wait-listed controlled clinical trial. Eligible patients with\n      history of at least 3 months of PNSLBP will be randomized in to two groups, 45 patients\n      each. The first group will be  given wet-cupping treatment at two acupuncture points of\n      urinary Bladder (BL) meridians  among the  BL23, BL24 and BL25, 6 times within 2 weeks. The\n      second group will serve as a control group. Usual care, including providing brochures for\n      exercise, general advice for PNSLBP and acetaminophen, will be allowed in both groups.\n      Separate assessors participated in the outcome assessment. Investigators will use the 0\n      to100 numerical rating scale (NRS) for pain, the McGill Pain questionnaire for pain\n      intensity (PPI) and the Oswestry Disability Questionnaire (ODQ), and to assess acetaminophen\n      use and safety issues.\n\n      Expected Results: To provide data on the safety and effectiveness of wet cupping in treating\n      PNSLBP and open the way for integrative medicine in Saudi Arabia"

Secondary objectives :\n\n      I-To compare Functioning (Oswestry Disability Questionnaire) from the base to the end of the\n      two weeks of wet cupping sessions& two weeks later in the two groups II-To compare NRS from\n      base to two weeks after the end of cupping III-To compare Number of Acetaminophen tables\n      taken at the end of two weeks.
