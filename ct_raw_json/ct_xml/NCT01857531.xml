  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate whether the investigational drug
      ganaxolone can help smokers quit smoking. Ganaxolone is a drug that has been investigated
      (in other research studies) for the treatment of seizures and migraines.  This drug is
      considered investigational in the US.

      The purpose of this proof-of-concept study is to evaluate whether expired air carbon
      monoxide (CO) will be reduced and smoking cessation success rates enhanced for smokers who
      receive the neurosteroid analog ganaxolone. The trial will be seeking preliminary
      indications of efficacy and tolerability in the smoking population and allow us to estimate
      effect sizes for future controlled trials.
