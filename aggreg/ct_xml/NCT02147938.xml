  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Assessment in a real situation of the conversion conditions, the efficacy and the safety of
      the treatment with tacrolimus in renal transplant patients converted from the tacrolimus
      twice per day form (Prograf®) to the tacrolimus once per day form (Advagraf®) with follow-up
      at one year.

      Analysis of two groups of patients: patients converted from Prograf® to Advagraf® early
      (during the first 6 months post-transplantation) or late (between 6 and 12 months
      post-transplantation).
