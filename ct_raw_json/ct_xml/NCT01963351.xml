          -  Urine dipstick for proteinuria &lt;2+. Patients discovered to have ≥2+ proteinuria on
             dipstick urinalysis at baseline should undergo a 24 hour urine collection and must

             local radiologist must exclude evidence of tumour that is fully contiguous with,
             surrounding, or extending into the lumen of a major blood vessel (e.g. pulmonary
             artery or superior vena cava)

          4. Evidence of CNS metastases, even if previously treated. If suspected, the patient
             should be scanned within 28 days prior to enrolment to rule out CNS metastases

          5. Neoadjuvant/adjuvant chemotherapy within 6 months prior to enrolment

          6. Radical radiotherapy with curative intent within 28 days prior to enrolment.
             Palliative radiotherapy for relief of bone pain not involving the thoracic region is
             allowed prior to enrolment

          7. Major surgery (including open biopsy), significant traumatic injury within 28 days
             prior to enrolment or anticipation of the need for major surgery during study
             treatment

          8. Minor surgery, including insertion of an indwelling catheter, within 24 hours prior
             to the first bevacizumab infusion

          9. Current or recent (within 10 days of first dose of bevacizumab) use of aspirin (&gt;
             325mg/day)

             mmHg)

         13. Clinically significant (i.e. active) cardiovascular disease for example CVA (≤6
             months before enrolment), myocardial infarction (≤6 months before enrolment),
             unstable angina, congestive heart failure NYHA Class ≥II, serious cardiac arrhythmia

             device, barrier method of contraception in conjunction with spermicidal jelly or
             surgically sterile) during the study and for a period of 6 months following the last
             administration of bevacizumab. Men who do not agree to use effective contraception
             during the study and for a period of 90 days following the last administration of
             bevacizumab. Men who do not agree to use effective contraception during the study and

             trial within 28 days prior to enrolment

         19. Evidence of ongoing or active infection, any other disease, neurological or metabolic
             dysfunction, physical examination finding or laboratory finding giving reasonable
             suspicion of a disease or condition that contraindicates the use of an
             investigational drug or puts the patient at high risk for treatment-related
             complications

         20. Patients diagnosed with a tracheo-oesophageal fistula

         21. Prior chemotherapy or treatment with another systemic anti-cancer agent (for example

             current stage of disease (stage IIIB with pleural or pericardial effusion, stage IV
             or recurrent disease). NOTE: prior surgery and irradiation is permitted provided that
             the criteria outlined in the protocol for both treatments are met

         22. Malignancies other than NSCLC within 5 years prior to randomization, except for
             adequately treated carcinoma in situ of the cervix, basal or squamous cell skin
             cancer, localized prostate cancer treated surgically with curative intent, DCIS
             treated surgically with curative intent
