    <measure>Mean change from baseline in investigator rated lid papillae maximum score at Day 90.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0), Day 90</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Lid Papillae (palpebral roughness) will be assessed by the investigator using slit-lamp biomicroscopy.  Papillae will be classified independently for the four palpebral zones (upper lid=1-3; lower lid=4) on a scale from 0-4, where 0=None and 4=Severe (giant papillae).  The maximum of the four zones will be selected for the analysis.</description>

    <time_frame>Day 90</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>As interpreted and reported by the subject on a questionnaire. A 5-point Likert scale will be used, where 1=strongly disagree, 2=disagree; 3=undecided; 4=agree; 5=strongly agree. The Top-2-box response (agree, strongly agree) will be calculated and reported as a percentage of all responses.</description>

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>As reported and interpreted by the subject on a questionnaire.  The subject will be asked, &quot;During a typical day in the past 2 weeks, how often did your eyes feel gritty and/or scratchy while wearing your contact lenses?&quot; and will respond on a 5-point scale (1=Never and 5=Constantly).</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Current biweekly or monthly silicone hydrogel contact lens wearer (excluding Air
             Optix® brand) and have worn these lenses bilaterally for at least three (3) months
             prior to Visit 1 (daily wear use only).

          -  Vision correctable to 20/30 Snellen (feet) or better in each eye at distance.

          -  Willing to wear study lenses on a daily wear schedule for at least 5 days a week and
             a minimum of 6 hours on these days, and attend all study visits.

          -  Symptoms of contact lens discomfort as defined by the protocol.

          -  Habitual use of a biguanide-preserved multi-purpose solution for at least 30 days
             prior to Visit 1.

          -  Mild to severe (grade 2-4) Investigator rated palpebral roughness in one or more
             zones of either eye.

          -  Other protocol-specified inclusion criteria may apply.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Extended (over-night) contact lens wearer.

          -  Any systemic or ocular disease or disorder (refractive disorder allowed and mild dry
             eye with successful contact lens wear is permitted), complicating factors or
             structural abnormality that would negatively affect the conduct or outcome of the
             study.

          -  History of ocular surgery/trauma within the last 6 months.

          -  Topical ocular over the counter (OTC) or prescribed medications, with the exception
             of contact lens rewetting drops, within 7 days of enrollment.

          -  Systemic medications which have known or expected ocular or systemic side effects
             (i.e., antihistamines, dermatologic agents, or antidepressants), that in the clinical
             judgment of the Investigator, could affect the subject's participation in this study
             unless they have been on a stable dosing regimen for a minimum of 30 days prior to
             Visit 1.

          -  Unwilling to discontinue mechanical eyelid therapy or eyelid scrubs within 14 days of
             enrollment and continuing during the study.

          -  Use of rewetting drops during the study other than Bausch and Lomb Sensitive Eyes®
             Rewetting Drops.

          -  Participation in any other ophthalmic drug or device clinical trial within 30 days of
             enrollment.

          -  Other protocol-specified exclusion criteria may apply.
