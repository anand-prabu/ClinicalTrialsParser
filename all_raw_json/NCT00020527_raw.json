Patients are stratified according to\n      age (2 to 11 vs 12 to 17).\n\n      Patients receive caspofungin acetate IV over 1 hour once daily for 4 to 28 days in the\n      absence of the need to start standard empirical antifungal therapy, a breakthrough fungal\n      infection, any deterioration of patient condition, or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 16 patients (8 per stratum) receive caspofungin acetate at 1 of 2 dose levels.\n      Caspofungin acetate is escalated to dose level 2 if no more than 1 of 8 patients experiences\n      dose-limiting toxicity at dose level 1.\n\n      Patients are followed at 14 days.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 32-64 patients (16 per dose level (cohort), 8 per stratum)\n      will be accrued for this study."
