        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Men and women between the age of 23 to 70 years old at screening, inclusive

          -  GHD subjects as defined in the Consensus guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment
             of adults with GH deficiency II (2007).

          -  No r-hGH replacement therapy or use of GH secretagogues for at least 9 months with
             any registered or investigational r-hGH or GH secretagogue product.

          -  The IGF-I level at screening â‰¤-1 SDS of the age and sex normal ranges according to
             the central laboratory measurements

          -  Subjects who are on a stable diet and exercise regime and do not have plans to modify
             their diet or exercise for at least 12 months

          -  Subject had a DXA screening and the results are interpretable according to the study
             plan.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Women who are pregnant or breast-feeding (at least 6 months delay from childbirth or
             lactation)

          -  Evidence of growth benign intracranial tumor within the last 12 months (determined by
             comparing a previous MRI to a new one obtained no more than 6 months prior to study
             entry to clarify dynamics of growth).

          -  History of any cancer. Exceptions to this exclusion criterion include resected in
             situ carcinoma  of the cervix and squamous cell or basal cell carcinoma of the skin
             with complete local excision. Patients with GHD attributed to treatment of
             intracranial malignant lesions in childhood or adulthood (or, tumors) or leukemia may
             also be enrolled into the study provided that a recurrence-free survival period of at
             least 5 years is well documented in the study record.

          -  Signs of intracranial hypertension at screening

          -  Heart insufficiency, NYHA class &gt; 2 (Appendix B)

          -  History of overt diabetes mellitus (including currently treated, well-controlled DM)
             defined according to the American Diabetes Association (ADA) Criteriaa. A history of
             gestational diabetes, resolved after childbirth, is not exclusionary.

          -  History of Acromegaly
