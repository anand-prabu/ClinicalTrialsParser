  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to detail the (mechanisms underlying the) actions of the GLP-1
      receptor agonists and DPP-4 inhibitors on the cardiovascular, renal and gastrointestinal
      systems in patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      GLP-1 receptors are present in most organ systems of the human body, and pharmacological
      interventions enhancing GLP-1 activity may influence the function of these organs. The use
      of GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA) and DPP-4 inhibitors (DPP-4i) has been associated with
      an increased heart rate, acute pancreatitis and acute renal failure. To date, studies in
      humans detailing the effects of these drugs on these organ systems, biological processes and
      underlying mechanisms, which could explain these associations, are lacking.

      Therefore, as part of the EU-FP7 SAFEGUARD program, the present study will aim to detail the
      (mechanisms underlying the) actions of GLP-1RA and DPP-4i on the cardiovascular, renal and
      gastrointestinal system patients with T2DM.

      Sixty patients with type 2 diabetes will undergo two interventions within the same protocol
      in order to assess changes in the outcome parameters:

        -  acute study = acute infusion with exenatide or placebo

        -  long-term study = 12 weeks of treatment with liraglutide, sitagliptin or placebo
