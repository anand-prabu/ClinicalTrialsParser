The current standard therapy (corticosteroids) is theme\n      of debate and unsatisfactory in many patients (year mortality: 30%). One of the main causes\n      of death is bacterial infections, which affect 40-50% of patients at 90 days. Intestinal\n      decontamination with rifaximin (a nonabsorbable antibiotic) reduces endotoxemia, improves\n      liver function and reduces the complications of decompensated alcoholic cirrhosis.\n\n      The Hypothesis/Objective: To assess whether oral decontamination with rifaximin prevents the\n      development of infections associated with AAH and analyze its consequences."
