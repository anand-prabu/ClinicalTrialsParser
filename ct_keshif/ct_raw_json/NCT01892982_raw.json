            "textblock": "Preterm infants are born at biological risk for poor health and developmental outcomes; and\n      those born to low-income families face additional social risks known to further interfere\n      with healthy child development.  In its 2006 report, Preterm Birth, the Institute of\n      Medicine (IOM) stated the public health importance of optimizing the developmental outcomes\n      of preterm infants, and specifically called for novel postnatal intervention strategies to\n      accomplish this goal.  Our proposed strategy is based on the premise that preventing\n      maternal depression - and optimizing maternal functioning in specific domains that mediate\n      the relationship between maternal depression and adverse child effects - will ultimately\n      improve the developmental outcomes of this vulnerable child population.\n\n      Problem Solving Education (PSE) is a cognitive behavioral strategy that aims to impart\n      recipients with skills to reduce the impact of stress on personal functioning, and thereby\n      prevent depression.  The present project is a randomized trial of a 6-session intervention\n      based on PSE.  the investigators aim to enroll 325 mother-infant dyads in four NICUs -\n      Boston Medical Center, Tufts Medical Center, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, and\n      Brigham and Womens Hospital.  Over 12-months of follow-up, the investigators will assess the\n      effects of PSE on a series of outcome measures for mothers, a series of measures that\n      represent risk mechanisms by which maternal depression is theorized to impact young\n      children, and a series of child functioning measures.\n\n        1. Primary aims.  Regarding outcomes for mothers, the investigators aim to:\n\n             1. Decrease the incidence of major depressive episode (MDE) and improve depressive\n                symptom trajectories during the first postpartum year; and\n\n             2. Improve general and parental functioning, as measured by valid and reliable\n                scales.\n\n        2. Secondary aims.  Regarding risk mechanisms and child outcomes, the investigators aim\n           to:\n\n             1. Improve mothers' sense of mastery, and decrease their caregiver burden and social\n                isolation;\n\n             2. Improve adherence to evidence-based quality indicators for NICU follow-up care;\n\n             3. Improve maternal sensitivity and mother-child interaction patterns; and\n\n             4. Improve infant social engagement, emotionality, and cognitive functioning.\n\n        3. Exploratory aims.  the investigators will explore the role of a brief set of potential\n           intervention moderators:\n\n             1. On the infant level:  severity of infant illness.\n\n             2. On the maternal and family level:  maternal trauma history, extended family\n                functioning, and intervention adherence."
