Loss of bone mineral and bone fragility is especially prevalent in\n      postmenopausal women. Of all osteoporotic fractures, hip fractures are the most traumatic.\n      Creatine monohydrate is a nutritional supplement that is often combined with strength\n      training to increase strength and muscle mass. The investigators recently completed a pilot\n      study in a small number of postmenopausal women (n=33) that showed that creatine monohydrate\n      significantly improved hip bone mineral density during a 1-year resistance training program.\n      In our current proposal the investigators want to determine whether creatine combined with\n      strength training can have an even larger effect on bone mineral density at the hip if given\n      over 2 years in a large group of postmenopausal women (n=240). The investigators also want\n      to determine whether this leads to reduced fractures in these women for up to a year after\n      completing the creatine and strength training program."

            "textblock": "Age-related bone and muscle loss is a major risk factor for falls, injuries, and fracture\n      and, as Canada's population is aging, prevalence of such health concerns is escalating.\n      Osteoporosis alone is estimated to cost the Canadian health care system $2.3 billion per\n      year or 1.3%, of Canada's total healthcare budget. Postmenopausal women are at high risk of\n      osteoporosis and experience the highest rate of hip fracture, resulting in disability, loss\n      of physical function and premature death. The investigators' study aims to improve bone mass\n      and bone strength at the most clinically relevant bone site, the femoral neck, in order to\n      reduce the risk of hip fracture. Specifically, it will determine the effects of a\n      nutritional supplement (creatine monohydrate) combined with exercise training on bone\n      mineral density (BMD) at the proximal femur in postmenopausal women.  .\n\n      Creatine monohydrate is found in small amounts in meats and fish and, when taken as a\n      nutritional supplement, increases muscle mass and strength. The investigators have conducted\n      a number of preliminary studies showing that when a creatine supplement is taken during a\n      resistance training program, urinary markers of bone resorption (i.e. bone catabolism) are\n      reduced compared to placebo. The investigators recently completed a small 12-month\n      randomized controlled trial in 33 postmenopausal women who either supplemented with creatine\n      monohydrate (10 g/d) or placebo during a resistance training program. Bone mineral density\n      of the femoral neck decreased by 0.5% in the creatine group, and 3.9% in the placebo group\n      (p<0.05 between groups). This proposed randomized controlled trial will replicate the\n      investigators' pilot design for longer duration (i.e. 2 years) to determine if sustained\n      supplementation with creatine monohydrate combined with exercise training can induce a\n      clinically significant difference in bone mineral density at the femoral neck (the\n      investigators estimate a 5% difference between creatine and placebo groups capable of\n      predicting a significant reduction in fracture risk).\n\n      This trial will use a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, parallel group, repeated\n      measures design, performed at the Universities of Saskatchewan and Regina. Post-menopausal\n      women (n=240) will be randomized to creatine (10g/d) or placebo groups while participating\n      in an exercise program (resistance training and walking) three times per week for 24 months.\n      The investigators' main dependent variable is femoral neck bone mineral density, which will\n      be assessed at baseline, 12, and 24 months. Secondary variables to be assessed at the same\n      time points include geometric properties of the proximal femur (predictors of bone\n      strength), lumbar spine bone mineral density, ultrasound measurements of bone at the distal\n      radius and tibia (predictive of the architectural integrity of bone), lean tissue mass,\n      muscular strength, dynamic balance, and gait speed. The investigators will assess incidence\n      of falls and fractures at the same time points and also at 12 months post-intervention (i.e.\n      at 36 months). The results of this study have clinical potential, providing physicians and\n      health-care professionals evidence-based advice to give to postmenopausal women interested\n      in taking creatine as a novel strategy to increase bone mineral density and prevent\n      osteoporosis."
