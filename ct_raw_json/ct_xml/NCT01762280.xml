    <textblock>
      Famitinib is a novel oral multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor with antitumor and
      antiangiogenic activities. This study is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of
      Famitinib in patients with solid tumor
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      1. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of Famitinib, and the maximum tolerated dose
           (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicity (DLT).

        2. To determine the pharmacokinetic profile of Famitinib and its metabolites .

        3. To assess preliminary antitumor activity .

        4. To determine preliminary dose and regimen for phase II study .
