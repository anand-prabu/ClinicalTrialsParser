Activation of the eCB system increases food intake and vice\n      versa. The mechanism behind this effect is still unknown and the current study aims at\n      clarifying why sweet food intake increases. It is hypothesized that sweet taste intensity\n      increases and that sweet taste is experienced as more pleasant."
