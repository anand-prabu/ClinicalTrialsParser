            "textblock": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is considered to be an autoimmune disease that is caused by the\n      immune system attacking the central nervous system (CNS) leading to myelin loss and axonal\n      damage, resulting in long-term disability. The pathophysiology of MS is complex with\n      involvement of genetic and environmental factors that define the susceptibility to generate\n      the autoimmune attack. MS is caused by damage to the myelin sheath, the protective covering\n      that surrounds nerve cells. When this nerve covering is damaged, nerve signals slow down or\n      stop.The nerve damage is caused by inflammation. Inflammation occurs when the body's own\n      immune cells attack the nervous system. Currently, treatment of MS relays mainly on\n      immunosuppression combined with monoclonal antibodies and steroid therapies.The most\n      advanced application for  MSCs in the  neurological clinical arena is in multiple\n      sclerosis.This clinical study time period is for 1 year. This study is carried out to see\n      the role of Mesenchymal Stem cell Therapy in Multiple sclerosis, and  to control symptoms\n      and help to maintain a normal quality of life of suffering patients."
