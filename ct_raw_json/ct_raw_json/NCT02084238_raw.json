            "textblock": "Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune syndrome affecting various\n      organs. While available therapies, such as corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents have\n      improved the outcome of patients, there remains a significant unmet need for safe and more\n      effective treatments. Dysfunction of regulatory T (Treg) cells has been detected in diverse\n      autoimmune diseases, which can be promoted by interleukin-2 (IL-2). We hypothesized that\n      low-dose IL-2 could be a novel therapy in active SLE patients.\n\n      This is a single center, uncontrolled, open-label study to assess the efficacy/safety of low\n      dose IL-2 plus standard therapy in active SLE.\n\n      Methods: Each SLE patients (n=40) with Scores>=8 on the Safety of Estrogens in Lupus\n      Erythematosus National Assessment (AELENA) version of the SLE Disease Activity Index\n      (SLEDAI) that was refractory or relaps to glucocorticoid therapy received low-dose IL-2 (1\n      million units every other day subcutaneously (HrIL-2 1X 106, ip, Qod) for a period of 14\n      days. After a 14-day rest, another cycle started) for 3-6 cycles according to the situation\n      of the disease. The end points were safety and clinical and immunologic response.\n\n      Expected Results: This trail will define low-dose IL-2 plus standard therapy is efficacy and\n      safety with active lupus patients, which could be relevant to the amelioration the abnormity\n      of T help cells in SLE patients."
