The first lunch was a control session. For the CC situation (week 2),\n      thirty minutes before the lunch children were offered a preload (137 kcal). For the EAH\n      situation (week 3), ten minutes after lunch children were exposed to palatable foods (430\n      kcal). Food intake was measured at the individual level. Parental eating behaviour and\n      feeding practices were measured by questionnaires. Child's height and weight were measured\n      by a medical doctor."
