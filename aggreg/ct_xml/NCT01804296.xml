  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research proposal aims to better understand the neurobiology of depression in
      adolescents and how repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) may therapeutically
      impact brain function and mood. This investigation also proposes the first study to examine
      the efficacy of rTMS maintenance therapy in adolescents who have met clinical criteria
      following acute rTMS treatment.  The magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy pattern of rTMS
      response will be analyzed according to previously established protocols.

      Part 2 of the study aims to:

        -  Evaluate the benefit of daily, active, open-label rTMS in Part 1 non-responders.

        -  Evaluate the benefits of bi-weekly, active, open-label maintenance rTMS treatment for
           Part 1 responders over the course of 12 months post acute treatment.

        -  Evaluate, by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) at 3 Tesla(3T),
           neurometabolic biomarkers at the beginning and end of each study phase.

             -  Define regional specificity [anterior cingulate (AC) and left dorsolateral
                prefrontal cortex (L-DLPFC)] of cerebral metabolites (i.e. glutamate and
                glutamine) in adolescent depression.

             -  Study whether specific neurochemical resonances are associated with response,
                remission, and/or maintenance of improvement of clinical depressive symptoms when
                rTMS is used to treat adolescent depression.
