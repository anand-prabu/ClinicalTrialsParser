By interfering with this protein's function,\n      STA-9090 may help kill tumor cells.  This drug has been used in other research studies and\n      information from those studies suggests that this agent may help to slow tumor growth in\n      HCC.\n\n      The purpose of this research study is to find the highest dose of STA-9090 that can safely\n      be given to participants with advanced HCC.  The investigators will also get more\n      information about the safety of STA-9090 and perform tests to learn more about how STA-9090\n      affects the body."
