One of these methods (the set-back technique) was recently described in 2010 and\n      has been reported to be technically easier and reduces the chance of spitting sutures (deep\n      sutures that are pushed to the surface of the skin as the wound heals). The other method\n      (the vertical mattress technique) has been used for many years with good results. However,\n      no controlled studies have been performed to clearly demonstrate a difference between the\n      two methods. We hope to find differences in the height of the wound edges immediately after\n      surgery(5 minutes following the procedure) as well as the appearance of the scar and\n      symptoms associated with the scar 3 months after surgery."
