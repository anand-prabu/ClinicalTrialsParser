      The primary objective is to demonstrate efficacy on epicardial and myocardial reperfusion of
      fibrinolytic treatment with alteplase  followed by early routine catheterisation or rescue
      coronary intervention in Chinese population and to evaluate safety of alteplase
      fibrinolytic therapy followed by routine catheterisation or rescue coronary intervention in
      Chinese population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is the preferred reperfusion therapy for
      patients with acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). However, most patients
      cannot receive it in a timely fashion as a result of delays associated with patient transfer
      or catheterization team mobilization. In China, many hospitals still lack PCI facilities
      nowadays. Even in some large cities, patients have a high chance of presenting to hospitals
      not providing around-the-clock staffing.In contrast, intravenous thrombolysis is
      administered to many eligible patients. The advantages of fibrinolysis include easy
      administration, wide-spread availability and early patency of the infarct-related artery
      (IRA).According to an investigation carried out from 2001 to 2004, 52.5% of patients with
      STEMI received thrombolytic therapy as the initial treatment in China.

      In previous trial, full-dose tenecteplase followed by angioplasty is safe and produces
      better and earlier myocardial perfusion than primary angioplasty, as demonstrated by the
      presence of higher rate ST-segment normalization immediately after coronary
      revascularization and better angiographic reperfusion parameters in this group.Pilot
      study(EARLY-PCI) of early routine PCI after alteplase  fibrinolysis in acute myocardial
      infarction patients performed by investigator also demonstrated that the therapy of early
      routine PCI after recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rtPA) thrombolysis was a
      safe and effective treatment method for Chinese STEMI patients.

      Based on the results of these two studies, it implies that early routine PCI after rtPA
      thrombolysis may be an alternative choice for those patients who would have a time delay
      from medical contact to PCI. And to date, there is no evidence which compare the efficacy
      and safety of early PCI after alteplase fibrinolysis with primary PCI for these patients in
      China.For these reasons, we plan to carry out an open, controlled, randomized trial in
      patients with STEMI to assess whether routine early post alteplase fibrinolysis angioplasty
      leads to great degree of myocardial salvage and clinical outcomes compared with primary
      angioplasty among  chinese patients with expected time delay of  primary PCI.

    <description>TMPFC is a novel method to standardize and quantify myocardial perfusion by timing the filling and washout of contrast in the myocardium using cine-angiographic frame-counting. Briefly, the first frame of TMPFC was defined as the frame that clearly demonstrated the first appearance of myocardial blush beyond the IRA (F1). The last frame of TMPFC was then defined as the frame where contrast or myocardial blush disappeared (F2). TMPFC is F2-F1 frame counts at a filming rate of 15 frames/sec, or (F2-F1)×2 frame counts at the corrected filming rate of 30 frames/sec.</description>
