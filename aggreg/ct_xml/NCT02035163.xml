  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation after coronary artery bypass graft is a common complication.

      The investigators have thought that the mechanism of temporarily postoperative atrial
      fibrillation is closely related to the autonomic nervous system imbalance.

      In a last several years, cryoablation was substituted for atrial incision in many reports to
      simplify the maze procedure.

      However, there has been no comparative study to delineate the feasibility of the use of
      cryoablation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Modified maze procedures that use energy sources for the ablation of atrial fibrillation
      concomitant with cardiac surgery have been shown to improve outcomes in patients with atrial
      fibrillation. Cryoablation of atrial fibrillation recently has been shown to lead to
      outcomes that were at least equivalent to those reported for other energy modalities over
      both short- and medium-term follow-up times.
