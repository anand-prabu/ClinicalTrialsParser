  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study was to compare the efficacy and safety of single injection peribulbar
      anaesthesia against the classic double injection technique.

      This was a double blind randomized controlled trial involving two groups of consenting,
      adult Nigerian subjects with operable age-related cataract. An anaesthetic nurse who
      allocated the subjects to the two groups administered all the injections. The same surgeon
      operated on all the subjects while the principal investigator and a research assistant
      measured the outcome variables. All others were blinded as to subject allocation.

    <measure>Akinesia score for movements of the upper eyelid and globe after local anaesthetic injection</measure>

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Upward movement of the upper eyelid and movement of the eyeball in four directions (up, down, right and left).  A 3-point scoring system was used to assess this thus: 0- no movement, 1- reduced movement, 2- normal/full movement. Maximum  obtainable score was 10.</description>
