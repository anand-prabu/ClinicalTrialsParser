  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine Isoflurane's dose-dependent effect on left
      ventricular (LV) function in cardiac surgery. The change of tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) of
      lateral mitral valve annular velocity at three different isoflurane concentrations would be
      analyzed by using intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) in cardiac surgery
      patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) of mitral annular velocity during the cardiac cycle has been
      introduced as a reliable method for analysis of systolic and diastolic LV ling-axix
      function, efficacy of diastolic TDI profile, including early early relaxation (E')and atrial
      contraction (A') and has been suggested to be useful in predicting the postoperative
      clinical outcomes and the impact of isoflurane on LV diastolic function.

      Isoflurane is widely used in cardiac surgery patients due to its beneficial effects, but
      many studies have shown that isoflurane reduces myocardial contractility in a dose-dependent
      manner, and compromises left ventricular (LV) function.

      The investigators hypothesized that isoflurane, even at a clinical dosage, would affects
      intraoperative LV systolic function in a dose-dependent manner and thus produce significant
      changes int the TDI profiles of mitral annular velocity.

      So the investigators planned to study the changes in TDI profiles of lateral mitral annular
      velocity at the clinical isoflurane dosage during remifentanil based anesthesia for cardiac
      surgery.
