            "textblock": "The rationale for this phase-1 trial is to find an appropriate dose of omega-3 for future\n      phase-2 studies. The investigators aim at defining a dose that can safely be given to\n      children previously treated for cancer, and that does not cause unacceptable side effects.\n      In a longer perspective, randomized control trials are planned where the supplement is given\n      for longer periods of time, and in combination with conventional cancer treatment. In\n      preparation for these trials, this dose finding study was designed that also evaluates\n      compliance. Subsequently the investigators hope that this supplementation can be beneficial\n      for children during both cancer treatment and after remission.\n\n      The study population consists of children judged to be in complete clinical remission from\n      cancer. In a phase 1 trial, one usually uses healthy individuals as study subjects, but in\n      pediatric studies this is not allowed. Therefore patients who are in full remission were\n      chosen as study objects, but who still come to the clinic for regular follow-ups. This group\n      of patients is relevant for this study since it represents all ages and base-line diets, all\n      kinds of childhood cancers, and because they have suffered from cancer and in many cases\n      still live with the severe consequences of it.\n\n      The study is designed to give five groups of eight individuals each different doses of\n      omega-3 adjusted to body surface area. The first group starts out on a dose of omega-3 fatty\n      acids that is similar to the generally recommended daily intake for adults (200-400 mg). A\n      dose escalation is then done performed group wise. The highest possible dose in this study\n      (2 x 3000mg/day at dose level 3000 mg/m2 to a child at 1.55 m2, 3871 mg/m2) is still lower\n      than what has previously been given as maximum to children in other studies. The\n      investigators will keep escalating the dose level within the study only as long as no\n      unacceptable side effects are reported.\n\n      The administration is done orally by drinking 200 mL of omega-3 supplemented fruit juice\n      daily. It has a good fruity taste, low amounts of sugar, and no fish flavour. This should\n      facilitate treatment compliance for the children in particular compared to when omega-3 is\n      given in capsules - the commonest choice in other studies, but less suitable for children.\n      Compliance is important and not further jeopardized by trying to divide the fruit juice in\n      less amounts than the whole package, but the individually prescribed dose as well as the\n      actual amount ingested will be recorded and exact calculations used in the analysis of the\n      study.\n\n      All study results are primarily evaluated on an intention-to-treat basis, but will also be\n      calculated as treated per protocol and further calculated on the exact dose consumed over 90\n      days given the compliance in terms of consumed number of fruit juice packages."
