    <textblock>
      Trimetazidine (1-[2,3,4-trimethoxybenzyl] piperazine dihydrochloride) is a clinically
      effective antianginal agent. Despite these clinical successes, the understanding of
      trimetazidine's mechanism of action remains incomplete, particularly influence of
      trimetazidine on mitochondrial function in isolated human cardiomyocytes. The investigators
      will perform this study to seek possible differences in mitochondrial respiration related to
      standard preoperative enrolled trimetazidine therapy.

      Background:

      Different types of medication are used for treatment of ischemic heart disease. One of
      recently developed drugs is trimetazidine. Although it clinical benefits are clear,
      mechanism by which this occurs is as yet undefined. In few animal studies authors try to
      define what effects trimetazidine  has on both fatty acid and glucose metabolism in  heart.
      Data collected from human cardiomyocytes are rare. Available data suggest that trimetazidine
      may act  as a potent inhibitor of beta oxidation, with  no significant effect on glucose
      oxidation.

      Objective:

      Primary objective: collection of mitochondrial respiration data using human heart
      ventricular samples. Secondary objective: define possible differences in mitochondrial
      respiration depending on preoperative trimetazidine usage.

      Methods:

      Regularly scheduled patients for coronary artery bypass grafting surgery who accept to
      participate in study will be enrolled in further protocol. Patients with inclusion criteria
      and without exclusion criteria will be enrolled in the study. At the end of operation,
      surgeon will take biopsy sample of left ventricle for mitochondrial function and metabolic
      activity analysis.

    <description>Investigators will obtain left ventricular biopsy samples from patients suffering from ischemic heart disease. Samples will be prepared in the laboratory for the purpose of assessment of mitochondrial respiration. Using the specific substrates from either fatty acid or carbohydrate metabolic pathways will enable investigation of the effect of trimetazidine on cardiac tissue metabolism.</description>
