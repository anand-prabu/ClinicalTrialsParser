  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Faecal elastase is an enzyme test used to identify the presence of pancreatic exocrine
      insufficiency. This condition manifests with symptoms of diarrhea, weight loss, causing
      potential impairment on an individual's quality of life. Creon, a pancreatic enzyme
      supplement, marketed by Abbott Laboratories, Inc. is currently the standard treatment for
      this condition. However, there has been limited work evaluating the merits of this
      medication in this condition. This study aims to evaluate the benefits that Creon may have
      in coeliac patients with low faecal pancreatic elastase by randomising patients with low
      faecal pancreatic elastase (&lt;200 ug/g) to either treatment with Creon or placebo. Outcome
      measures that we aim to assess to determine the benefits of Creon include evaluation of
      stool frequency, abdominal pain, body mass index (BMI) and quality of life.

    <description>Creon is a licensed product, manufactured by Abbott Laboratories, Inc. used for the therapeutic indication of pancreatic exocrine insufficiency. The route of administration is oral, with capsules being taken with main meals without chewing. The most commonly reported adverse reactions to Creon are gastrointestinal disorders of mild or moderate severity (up to 10% of patients). These include nausea, vomiting, constipation, diarrhoea and abdominal distension. An uncommon reaction (&lt;0.01%) of patients may develop skin reactions such as a rash or itching. No additional adverse drug reactions have been identified.</description>
