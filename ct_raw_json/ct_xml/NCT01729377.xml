      The purpose of the proposed study is to examine the phenomenon of suicidality in old age and
      its unique characteristics. This will be performed through observing the multigenerational
      aging family from the life-course perspective, which enables the researchers to address life
      transitions, including crises leading to suicidal tendencies.
