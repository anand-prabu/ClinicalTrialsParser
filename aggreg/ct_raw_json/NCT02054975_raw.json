Evaluate effect sizes for relationships between serum 25OH-vitD and omega-fatty acid\n           (FA) biomarkers, before and after supplementation with lower or higher dose vitamin D,\n           on immune function, and asthma severity.\n\n        2. Characterize changes in innate and adaptive immune function and inflammatory responses\n           in asthmatic D-deficient youth at baseline and after vitD supplements, by dietary\n           O6:O3FA status and vitD dose."
