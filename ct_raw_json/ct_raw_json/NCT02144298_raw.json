Three steady images of 6\n      seconds were acquired and recorded on a device controller based on a powerful medical grade\n      computer which is used for image storage and analysis.\n\n      Additionally macrocirculatory measurements were obtained at the same timepoints. Hemodynamic\n      variables, temperature, blood gas, INVOS, StO2, laboratory findings and standart therapy\n      were recorded. Additionally intubation time, ICU stay, hospital stay, ICU readmission,\n      morbidity and mortality were studied."
