To test the hypothesis that 6 months treatment with glatiramer acetate (GA) improves\n           respiratory dysfunction.\n\n        2. To evaluate the effect of GA treatment on general behaviour communication, hand\n           stereotyping, feeding, sleep and other autonomic symptoms: gastrointestinal and\n           cardiac.\n\n        3. To assess the effect of GA treatment on bodily development.\n\n      Primary Endpoint:Improvement of epileptiform activity as recorded in a 24-hours EEG.\n\n      Primary Safety Endpoint:Frequency and severity of treatment-related AEs (including safety\n      lab parameters).\n\n      Secondary Endpoints:\n\n        1. Improvement in the scoring of breath holds and hyperventilation, as measured with\n           non-invasive respiratory inductance plethysmography (NoxT3 device) and parents'\n           diaries.\n\n        2. Changes in general behaviour, communication, feeding and motor skills as assessed by\n           the investigator (based on Kerr and Naidu validated severity scores) and recorded in\n           parents' diary.\n\n        3. Decrease in seizure frequency as reported in parents' diary.\n\n        4. Improvement in sleep schedule as recorded in a sleep diary.\n\n        5. Change in height and weight. Population:Ten girls, 6 to 15 years old, diagnosed with\n           Rett syndrome (RTT) Study Design:This is a single - center, exploratory, open-label,\n           study in 10 girls diagnosed with RTT. The study will consist of four parts: Screening\n           and baseline assessments, initial and final dose-setting period, treatment period and\n           end-of study follow-up.\n\n      Investigational Product:Glatiramer Acetate  (Copaxone\u00ae , Teva Pharmaceutical Industries\n      Ltd.) Sample Size Consideration: The planned sample size of 10 patients was considered\n      adequate by the investigator for this phase I exploratory proof-of-concept study. The study\n      is not expected to show statistical significance or statistical power, only a trend for the\n      study endpoints. Each patient will serve as her own control.\n\n      Duration of Study: Approximately 8 months per patient (including up to 2 weeks pre-treatment\n      assessment, 6 months initial dose and treatment periods and end-of study visit).\n\n      Overall study duration: the study is expected to be completed within 12 months (dependent on\n      rate of recruitment)."
