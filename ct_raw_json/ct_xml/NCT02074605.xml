  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Interferon alpha is the only approved adjuvant biologic therapy for individuals diagnosed
      with high risk malignant melanoma (stage 2 or 3).  There is evidence that interferon has
      some adverse cognitive effects on patients, but there are limited data.  The investigators
      hypothesis is that compared to patients with melanoma who do not receive interferon,
      patients who have melanoma and are treated with interferon will show an objective decrease
      in performance on neurocognitive assessment.

      This study will enroll patients with melanoma who qualify for interferon, and either decide
      to undergo interferon treatment or choose watchful waiting instead.  All patients will be
      assessed with a cognitive testing battery twice.  Observation patients will undergo testing
      at their first appointment in which they consent to the study, as well as at their next
      physician visit, approximately 3 months from the first visit.  Interferon patients will be
      tested immediately prior to starting interferon, as well as immediately after completing
      high dose interferon.

        Patients in one of these categories:

          1. Are to receive adjuvant treatment with interferon alpha-2b after complete surgical
             resection of high risk melanoma.

          2. Have had a complete surgical resection of high risk melanoma, but have elected not to
             receive interferon alpha-2b and will be observed for disease progression only.

          -  Fluent English speaker.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of neurologic or psychiatric disease that will affect patient's ability to
             complete protocol tests.

          -  Clinical or radiological evidence of brain metastasis.

          -  Any condition, which in the opinion of the investigator makes the subject unsuitable
