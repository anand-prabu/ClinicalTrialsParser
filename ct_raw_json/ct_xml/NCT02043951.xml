    <textblock>
      The registry will enroll patients with claudication or critical limb ischemia and
      angiographically significant lesion(s) in arteries of the lower extremity.  Subjects will be
      treated with the Lutonix® Drug Coated Balloon Catheter for approved indications according to
      the current country-specific Instructions for Use (IFU) and followed clinically for 2 years.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This post-market registry is intended to assess the clinical use and safety of the Lutonix®
      Drug Coated Balloon Catheter in a heterogeneous patient population in real world clinical
      practice. Up to 500 patients will be enrolled in order to allow identification and
      assessment of rare adverse events (AEs) as well as outcomes in subpopulations defined by
      subject and lesion characteristics. All subjects will be followed for 2 years.

      This registry is performed with marketed devices within the indications for use. There are
      no additional treatments or exams that will take place within this registry.

    <description>Device success is defined as, a per device basis, the achievement of successful delivery and deployment of the registry device(s) as intended at the intended target lesion, without balloon rupture or inflation/deflation abnormalities and a successful withdrawal of the registry system. If a device is inserted into the subject but not used due to user error (e.g. inappropriate balloon length or transit time too long) this device will not be included in the device success assessment.</description>
