Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor\n      cells. It is not yet known whether surgery is more effective with or without chemotherapy\n      and radiation therapy for cancer of the esophagus.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of surgery with or without\n      combination chemotherapy and radiation therapy in treating patients who have cancer of the\n      esophagus that can be surgically removed."

Compare overall five-year survival rates and treatment failures in patients\n      receiving neoadjuvant cisplatin (CDDP) plus fluorouracil (5-FU) with concomitant\n      radiotherapy followed by surgical resection versus patients receiving surgery alone. II.\n      Assess and compare the toxicities of each approach. III. Compare the incidence and pattern\n      of local (gastric or esophageal bed or regional lymph nodes) and distant (supraclavicular\n      lymph node, liver, peritoneal carcinomatosis, or lung, brain, etc.) recurrence. IV. Evaluate\n      the prognostic ability of noninvasive and minimally invasive pretreatment staging with\n      regard to survival and recurrence. V. Evaluate the ability of preresection adjuvant\n      chemotherapy with concomitant radiation therapy to render tumors to lower stages. VI.\n      Evaluate the impact of lymph nodes on survival and recurrence.\n\n      OUTLINE: This a two arm, randomized study. Patients are stratified by: cell type of cancer\n      (squamous cell vs adenocarcinoma); lymph nodes (positive vs negative); and stage (invasive\n      vs noninvasive). Patients in arm I undergo chemotherapy and radiotherapy within 24 hours of\n      each other. Chemotherapy consists of cisplatin (CDDP) by bolus IV infusion over 30 minutes\n      on day 1 and again on day 29. Fluorouracil (5-FU) is administered by continuous IV infusion\n      for 4 days (on days 1-4 and 29-32) after completion of cisplatin. Radiotherapy is\n      administered on days 1-5, 8-12, 15-19, 22-26, and 29-33, with a boost on days 36-38. If\n      there is no disease progression or unresectable disease, surgery is performed within 3-8\n      weeks following completion of therapy. Patients in arm II undergo surgery alone no later\n      than 6 weeks postrandomization. Patients are followed at least every 3 months for two years,\n      then every 6 months for the next two years, and annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: There will be 500 patients accrued into this study within 5 years."
