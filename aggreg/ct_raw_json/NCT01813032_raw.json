            "textblock": "Emergency Service Professionals have an increased risk of death from heart attacks when\n      compared to the general public. All the emergency professions share similar responsibilities\n      such as emergency call-outs and shift work. Heart disease is the commonest cause of on-duty\n      death amongst fire-fighters accounting for 45% and compared with 22% in police officers and\n      15% in the general population. The unique risk to fire-fighters is likely to reflect a\n      combination of factors including extreme physical exertion, mental stress, heat and\n      pollutant exposure.\n\n      In this study the investigators will assess healthy career fire-fighters and age-matched\n      healthy police officer control subjects following a sedentary period. The investigators will\n      take blood samples to measure platelet activity (platelets are the particles in blood that\n      help blood clot) and will examine how blood clots outside of the body. The investigators\n      will then perform studies placing small needles in the arm to assess how the blood vessels\n      respond following these duties. The investigators hypothesise that fire-fighters do not have\n      pre-existing impairment of heart, blood or blood vessel function as a cumulative effect of\n      their occupation, but rather these are acute and transitory effects following distinct\n      fire-fighter duties. We therefore expect similar results in both occupational groups."
