Study BMN 165-301 is a Phase 3,\n      open-label, randomized study designed to further characterize the safety of BMN 165 during\n      two induction, titration, and maintenance dose regimens in adults with PKU who have not had\n      previous exposure to BMN 165 (naive). Subjects will be randomized (1:1) to titrate up to one\n      of two dose regimens. Other key features of this study are the dose regimens chosen for\n      induction and titration; the study duration; self administration of study drug; and the\n      chosen tertiary objectives."
