In any eye not designated as a study\n             eye, the IOP should be able to be controlled on no pharmacologic therapy or on the\n             study medicine alone.\n\n          -  Willing to discontinue the use of all other ocular hypotensive medication(s) prior to\n             receiving the study medication for the entire course of the study.\n\n          -  Able to follow instructions and willing and able to attend all study visits.\n\n          -  Have best corrected visual acuity of 6/60 (20/200 Snellen, 1.0 LogMAR) or better in\n             each eye.\n\n          -  Read, sign, and date an Ethics Committee reviewed and approved informed consent form.\n\n          -  Other protocol-defined inclusion criteria may apply.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  Known medical history of allergy, hypersensitivity or poor tolerance to any component\n             of DuoTrav\u00ae that is deemed clinically significant in the opinion of the Principal\n             Investigator.\n\n          -  Any abnormality preventing reliable applanation tonometry in either eye.\n\n          -  Corneal dystrophies in either eye.\n\n          -  Any opacity or subject uncooperativeness that restricts adequate examination of the\n             anterior chamber of either eye.\n\n          -  Concurrent infectious/noninfectious conjunctivitis, keratitis or uveitis in either\n             eye. Blepharitis or non-clinically significant conjunctival injection is allowed.\n\n          -  History of ocular herpes simplex infection.\n\n          -  Intraocular conventional surgery or laser surgery in either eye that is less than\n             three months prior to the Screening Visit.\n\n          -  Risk of visual field or visual acuity worsening as a consequence of participation in\n             the study, in the investigator's best judgment.\n\n          -  Progressive retinal or optic nerve disease from any cause apart from glaucoma.\n\n          -  Use of systemic medications known to affect IOP (e.g., oral beta-adrenergic blockers,\n             alpha-agonists and blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium\n             channel blockers), which have not been on a stable course for 7 days prior to\n             Screening Visit or an anticipated change in the dosage during the course of the\n             study.\n\n          -  Bronchial asthma, a history of bronchial asthma, or severe chronic obstructive\n             pulmonary disease that would preclude the safe administration of a topical\n             beta-blocker.\n\n          -  History of severe allergic rhinitis.\n\n          -  Unwillingness to risk the possibility of darkened iris or eyelash changes.\n\n          -  Women of childbearing potential not using reliable means of birth control for at\n             least one month prior to the Screening/Baseline Visit.\n\n          -  Women who are pregnant or lactating.\n\n          -  Participation in any other investigational study within 30 days prior to the\n             Screening Visit.\n\n          -  Other protocol-defined exclusion criteria may apply."
