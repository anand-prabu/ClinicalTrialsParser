  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pectus excavatum (PE) is a common chest wall deformity where the sternum is displaced
      posteriorly.  In severe cases, surgery is performed to correct the defect (1).  In recent
      years, minimally invasive surgery with the placement of stainless steel support bars has
      been increasingly performed in patients over the age of 17 years (1-9).  Because of the
      decreased malleability and tremendous pressure required to hold the chest wall in the
      corrected position, post-operative pain control has been a significant problem in this
      patient population (2,6,9-12).  Thoracic epidurals are commonly employed however mean
      hospitalizations of up to 7 days have been required before adequate pain control on oral
      analgesics is obtained (3-5, 13) and patients are suitable for discharge.

      It is hypothesized that using the ONQ system (I-Flow Corporation, Lake Forest CA) with
      bilateral intercostal catheter infusion would provide adequate post operative pain control
      with a significantly shorter hospital length-of-stay than thoracic epidural. Total use of
      narcotics for 1 week following surgery would also be less with the ONQ system versus
      epidural.

    <description>ON-Q soaker catheter system with Ropivicaine at 7 cc per hour placed by a single surgeon (DJ) in the operating room.  7.5&quot; catheters will be tunneled subcutaneously in the anterior axilla bilateral and secured with steri-strips and dressing.  ON-Q systems will be primed with 750 cc and refilled accordingly to provide for 6 days of analgesia.  Catheters will be removed by the surgeon in the hospital or clinic on the 6th post operative day.  Patients may request removal of the catheter prior to the 6th day and this will not be considered a withdrawal from the study or complication and will be included in overall analysis but noted accordingly.</description>
