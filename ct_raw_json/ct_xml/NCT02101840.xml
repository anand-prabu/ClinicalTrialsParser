  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to examine the abuse liability of a single 40mg dose of 3
      controlled release oxycodone formulations (Apo-Oxycodone CR®, OxyNEO®, and the original
      OxyContin®) in non-dependent recreational opioid users by assessing the self-reported acute
      effects of the drugs and taking blood samples to measure drug concentrations. The
      investigators think there may be differences in how well these drugs are liked when
      swallowed whole due to differences in how the products are formulated.

      This is a single-center, single-dose, semi-double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized,
      crossover, abuse liability study to be conducted in healthy subjects who are non-dependent
      recreational opioid users. The study will consist of 4 study days during which each subject
      will take one tablet of either 40mg OxyContin®, 40mg OxyNEO®, 40mg Apo-Oxycodone CR® or
      placebo. The participants will be assessed for both pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic
      outcomes.
