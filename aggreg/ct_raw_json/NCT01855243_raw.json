Glargine was given using Solostar Flex-Pen\u00ae once daily in the evening around 8:00 pm. Glulisine was given using the Solostar Flex-Pen\u00ae three times just before the meals for BG > 150 mg/dL according to hospital sliding scale. To avoid hypoglycemia, if for any reason, a subject missed a meal, the dose of glulisine will be held."
