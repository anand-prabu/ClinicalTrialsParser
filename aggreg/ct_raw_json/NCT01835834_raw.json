The core is veneered with dental porcelain at the dental laboratory.\nIntended use and indications:\nNobelProceraTM Bridge Shaded Zirconia consists of an individualized, supporting substructure in a ceramic bridge construction for tooth/teeth replacement.\nNobelProceraTM Bridge Zirconia is intended for patients in need of prosthetic oral reconstruction in order to restore chewing function. Zirconia bridges for natural tooth restorations are customized, designed, and milled from pre-sintered blanks of zirconia. The multi-unit restorations can be placed in all positions in the mouth."
