            "textblock": "After discharge from inpatient treatment, 30-50% of patients with Anorexia Nervosa require\n      re-hospitalization within 4-12 months. So far, high relapse rates are mostly considered as\n      lack of the patient's compliance and motivation to recover. However in studies,\n      psychological relapse predictors explain only a minor part of the variance in relapse risk.\n      Metabolic phenotyping has clinical value to predict weight course in obese patients and we\n      assume that it could also be clinically relevant in patients with AN. We hypothesize that in\n      patients with a dissipative but not with the thrifty phenotype, positive energy balance\n      during refeeding causes an over proportional rise in energy expenditure, counteracts\n      continuous weight gain during inpatient treatment, and increases relapse risk within one\n      year after discharge. Thus we believe that metabolic phenotype as a biological parameter has\n      prognostic value for the disease course in AN."
