This can range from mild disease to extreme conditions, such as\n      multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and acute respiratory distress (ARDS). In marked\n      contrast to adaptive immunity which is very sensitive to immune modulators such as steroids,\n      the innate immune system cannot be sufficiently targeted by currently available\n      anti-inflammatory drugs.\n\n      The investigators hypothesize that pre-treatment with C1-esterase inhibitor in a human\n      endotoxemia model can modulate the innate immune response.\n\n      In this study, human endotoxemia will be used as a model for inflammation. Subjects will,\n      prior to endotoxin administration, receive C1 esterase inhibitor or placebo. Blood will be\n      sampled to determine the levels of markers of the innate immune response."
