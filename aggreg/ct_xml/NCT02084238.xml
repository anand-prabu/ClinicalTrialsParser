    <textblock>
      Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune syndrome affecting various
      organs. While available therapies, such as corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents have
      improved the outcome of patients, there remains a significant unmet need for safe and more
      effective treatments. Dysfunction of regulatory T (Treg) cells has been detected in diverse
      autoimmune diseases, which can be promoted by interleukin-2 (IL-2). We hypothesized that
      low-dose IL-2 could be a novel therapy in active SLE patients.

      This is a single center, uncontrolled, open-label study to assess the efficacy/safety of low
      dose IL-2 plus standard therapy in active SLE.

      Methods: Each SLE patients (n=40) with Scores&gt;=8 on the Safety of Estrogens in Lupus
      Erythematosus National Assessment (AELENA) version of the SLE Disease Activity Index
      (SLEDAI) that was refractory or relaps to glucocorticoid therapy received low-dose IL-2 (1
      million units every other day subcutaneously (HrIL-2 1X 106, ip, Qod) for a period of 14
      days. After a 14-day rest, another cycle started) for 3-6 cycles according to the situation
      of the disease. The end points were safety and clinical and immunologic response.

      Expected Results: This trail will define low-dose IL-2 plus standard therapy is efficacy and
      safety with active lupus patients, which could be relevant to the amelioration the abnormity
      of T help cells in SLE patients.
