Women\n      within 1-5 years after first delivery who did not have an internal delivery will be\n      included. The total number of subjects is forty. This will include ten primiparous subjects\n      who have undergone vacuum delivery, ten who have undergone forceps delivery, ten who had\n      spontaneous vaginal delivery and ten who have undergone primary elective cesarean section."
