      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, dose-response and safety of udenafil
      25 mg, 50 mg and 75 mg every day (q.d.) for 12 weeks in the treatment of lower urinary tract
      symptoms (LUTS) associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH and for the treatment of
      erectile dysfunction (ED).

      The drug being tested in this study is called Udenafil. Udenafil is being tested to treat
      lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and
      for the treatment of erectile dysfunction (ED). This study will look at the change in lower
      urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and in
      erectile dysfunction (ED) in people who take Udenafil.

      The study will enroll approximately 950 patients. Participants taking BPH or ED medication
      will enter a 4-week wash out period. Patients not previously treated and those who
      accomplished the wash out period will enter a placebo (dummy inactive pill) lead-in period
      of another 4 weeks. Participants will then be randomly assigned (by chance, like flipping a
      coin) to one of the four treatment groups—which will remain undisclosed to the patient and
      study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent medical need):

        -  Udenafil 25 mg

        -  Udenafil 50 mg

        -  Udenafil 75 mg

        -  Placebo (dummy inactive pill) - this is a tablet that looks like the study drug but has
           no active ingredient

      All participants will be asked to take one tablet at the same time each day throughout the
      study, and will be asked to keep a Sexual Encounter Profile (SEP) diary.

      This multi-centre trial will be conducted in Mexico. The overall time to participate in this
      study is up to 20 weeks. Participants will make 6 visits to the clinic.

    <description>The IPSS is an 8 question (7 symptom questions + 1 quality of life question) tool used to screen for, rapidly diagnose, track the symptoms of, and suggest management of the symptoms of the disease benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). The 7 symptoms questions include feeling of incomplete bladder emptying, frequency, intermittency, urgency, weak stream, straining and nocturia, each referring to during the last month, and each involving assignment of a score from 1 to 5 for a total of maximum 35 points. The 8th question of quality of life is assigned a score of 1 to 6. The total score correlates as follows: 0-7 mildly symptomatic; 8-19 moderately symptomatic; 20-35 severely symptomatic.</description>

    <description>The IIEF is a standardised and validated 15-item self-evaluation scale that provides pre-post treatment clinic evaluations of erectile function, orgasmic function, sexual desire, satisfaction in sexual intercourse and general satisfaction. The Erectile Function domain (6-item) provides pre-post treatment evaluations of erectile function.</description>
