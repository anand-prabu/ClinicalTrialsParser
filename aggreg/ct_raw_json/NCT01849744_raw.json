This\n      clinical study is comprised of 2 parts: Part 1 (Dose Escalation) and Part 2 (Expansion).\n      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety (including the recommended Phase II\n      dose), pharmacokinetics (the amount of VS-4718 in your blood) and the anti-cancer activity\n      of VS-4718.  The pharmacodynamic effects (genes or proteins that may predict or show how\n      your body may respond to VS-4718) will also be examined in tumor biopsies and blood samples."
