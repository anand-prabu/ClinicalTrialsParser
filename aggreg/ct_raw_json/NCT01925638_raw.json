Once daily dosing of ketoconazole 400 mg will be initiated on Day 5 and will continue until Day 12 with 10 mg of refametinib administered concomitantly on Day 8 \u2022Part B: Fifteen subjects will be enrolled and will receive refametinib doses of 10 mg, 20 mg or 30 mg on Days 1 and 8 with the same dose administered on both days. Refametinib dose for Part B will be based on safety and refametinib pharmacokinetics in Part A. Ketoconazole 400 mg will be administered once daily on Days 5 to 12.
