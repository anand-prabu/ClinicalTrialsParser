  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary hypothesis is that patients with HFREF (heart failure with reduced ejection
      fraction) will demonstrate a markedly expanded intravascular volume which will correlate
      with elevated right heart hemodynamics and increased venous capacitance parameters, whereas
      patients with HFPEF(heart failure with preserved ejection fraction) will demonstrate
      euvolemia to mild volume expansion and a lack of correlation with hemodynamic and venous
      compliance parameters.

      The purpose of this study is to learn more about how the heart, blood vessels and blood
      volume interact in patients with heart failure and how measuring blood volume and vein
      capacity may help us develop better ways of treating and managing heart failure patients.
      This study will use two tests to measure blood volume and test the capacity of your veins
      and arteries in your limbs.

      The blood volume test (also called a plasma volume test or a red cell mass test) is a
      standard clinical nuclear lab procedure used to measure the volume (amount) of blood in the
      body. The test also measures the volume of plasma and of red cells in the blood.

      The other test is called a venous plethysmography, which is a non-invasive test to measure
      how well your veins and arteries in your forearm and calf work. Venous plethysmography
      measures the changes in the dimensions of your limbs by the use of strain gauges placed on
      the skin.

    <description>Patient Prior to clinically ordered right heart catheterization identified patients will have a blood volume measurement completed in the nuclear medicine laboratory. Patients will receive an intravenous administration of low dose iodinated I-131 labeled albumin. Blood specimens (6 cc each) will be drawn at 6 minute intervals times 6. The analysis will be completed following the testing.
Venous plethysmography will be completed on eligible patients prior to the clinically indicated right heart catheterization. Calf and forearm venous compliance will be measured.
Measurements form the right heart catheterization will be recorded for analysis.</description>

    <description>Patients will drink a solution 30 minutes prior to the test. They will need to lie still on a flat surface for 15 minutes.  During the blood volume analysis portion of the test, a small amount of a radioactive isotope or tracer is injected.Blood samples are taken at 6 time points during the test.  The blood volume test is used to measure the amount of blood in the patients body.
A hematocrit measurement is done on the blood samples taken. This blood test calculates the percentage of red blood cells in the bloodstream.</description>
