            "textblock": "NU-AGE is a large multidisciplinary consortium (31 partners, from 17 EU countries) involving\n      nutritionists, bio-gerontologists, immunologists and molecular biologists from the most\n      prestigious institutions in Europe, 5 large food industries, 8 traditional food companies\n      and 1 biotech SME, SPES GEIE and CIAA, covering the SME Food Industrial Associations of 13\n      European countries and the European Confederation the food and drink industry. NU-AGE aims\n      are: 1. to counteract the physical/cognitive decline occurring in the elderly as a\n      consequence of the progressive alteration of different organs/systems (immune and\n      cardiovascular systems, bone, brain, muscle and intestine) by one year elderly-tailored\n      whole diet intervention on 1250 healthy elderly men and women aged 65-79 years (half diet,\n      half control) from 5 different EU regions; 2. to assess the effect of the newly designed\n      food pyramid specific for 65+ EU citizens on the different organs/systems using a large set\n      of biomarkers related to nutrition and aging, with particular attention to the low grade,\n      chronic, systemic inflammatory status named inflammageing, a major risk factor for common\n      age-related diseases; 3. to perform in a subgroup of 120 subjects in depth studies and high\n      throughput \"omics\" to identify cellular/molecular targets/mechanisms responsible for whole\n      diet effect; 4. to perform genetic and epigenetic studies to assess the role of individual\n      variability on the response to diet; 5. to adopt an integrative comprehensive approach\n      (systems biology) to analyze the whole set of data. The results of dietary intervention will\n      be used to develop elderly-tailored prototypes of functional foods and to improve\n      traditional foods. The research activity will be accompanied and followed by a strong\n      activity of dissemination and industrial exploitation to support EU strategies on\n      nutritional recommendations, thus contributing to the implementation of legislation related\n      to nutritional and health claims for elderly in Europe."
