Acute attacks can be treated successfully with infusions of human plasma, and some\n      patients also receive regular plasma therapy for prevention of acute attacks. A small group\n      of patients receive preventive plasma infusions twice or more weekly, indicating a much\n      higher need for plasma than what is otherwise recommended for preventive therapy. Do these\n      patients have an ongoing activity of their disease despite a stimulus? Or a higher turn-over\n      of transfused ADAMTS13? Have these patients developed antibodies against transfused\n      ADAMTS13? Are any symptoms correlated with signs of disease activity?"
