  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A minimum of 450 healthy individuals (62-70 years old) will be recruited.

      Each individual will be randomized into one of three groups stratified according to gender
      (M/F), BMI (≤28/&gt;28), and 30 sec chair stand (≤11/&gt;11). The three groups are Heavy
      resistance training (n=150), moderate intensity training (n=150), and control (n=150, no
      training).

      Assessments will be performed at baseline, after 12 months of intervention. Furthermore,
      follow up will be performed after 2,3,5, and 10 years.

      The primary outcome is change in quadriceps muscle power after the intervention and during
      follow up.

      The primary hypothesis is that by applying the intention-to-treat analysis, the moderate
      intensity training group will increase quadriceps muscle power just as much as the heavy
      resistance training group. The two training groups will increase muscle power more than the
      control group.
