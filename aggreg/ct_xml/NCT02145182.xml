        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject male or female, 18 years or older

          -  Subject with dialysis dependent renal failure (initiated more than 2      months
             prior to transplant)

          -  Subject is to receive a first kidney transplant from a SCD or ECD deceased donor with
             a DGF risk score using the Irish scale of  ≥ 25% (to be determined prior to surgery
             and before randomization)

          -  Subject able to provide written informed consent

          -  Subject must be willing and able to comply with the requirements of the study
             protocol

          -  Female subjects of child-bearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test
             (serum beta-hCG) and must be practicing an effective, reliable, and medically
             approved contraceptive regimen at the time of consent and for up to 5 months
             following discontinuation of treatment

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject to receive a multi-organ transplant

          -  Subject to receive kidney(s) from donors &lt; 6 years of age

          -  Subject to receive a dual kidney transplant (from same donor, including en bloc)

          -  Subject to receive a living donor kidney

          -  Subject is highly sensitized to the donor (as determined by local center
             practice-examples of such testing may be but not required or limited to T or B flow
             cytometry, or lymphocytotoxicity).

          -  Subject has received a previous transplant

          -  Subject is participating in another investigational study

          -  Subject has a body mass index (BMI) &gt;40 kg/m2 at screening

          -  Subject will be the recipient of an A, B, O Blood Glycoproteins (ABO)(blood type)
             incompatible kidney (A2 donors to B and O recipients will be allowed if the site has
             the ability to confirm A2 subtype)

          -  Subject will receive a kidney from a donation after cardiac death (DCD) donor

          -  Subject has a predicted Irish model risk of DGF &lt; 25%

          -  Female subjects who are pregnant or breast feeding

          -  Female subjects of child bearing potential who are unable or unwilling to use a
             medically acceptable form of contraception

          -  Subjects with a history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), or active hepatitis C
             virus (HCV) or hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection

             the opinion of the Investigator

          -  Subjects with a history of splenectomy

          -  Subjects with  unresolved meningococcal disease

          -  Subjects with an unresolved systemic bacterial or fungal infection

          -  Subjects with known or suspected hereditary complement deficiency

          -  Subject has a current malignancy or a history of any malignancy (within the past 5
             years), except non-metastatic basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or in situ
             carcinoma of the cervix that has been treated appropriately

          -  Subject has a history of or is believed by the Investigator to have used an illicit
             drug(s) and/or abused alcohol within 3 months prior to screening

          -  Subject has a psychiatric or physical illness that in the opinion of the Investigator
             would interfere with the ability of the subject to participate in the study
