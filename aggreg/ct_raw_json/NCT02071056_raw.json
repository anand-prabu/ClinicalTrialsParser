Patient must have a previously diagnosed solid tumor malignancy originating from a\n             visceral organ (i.e., outside of the CNS), and present with signs and/or symptoms\n             consistent with carcinomatous meningitis (headache, vision dysfunction, hearing loss,\n             cranial nerve deficit, cognitive dysfunction, focal weakness or numbness suggestive\n             of cranial neuropathy or radiculopathy, cauda equine syndrome, meningismus, and/or\n             bowel or bladder dysfunction).\n\n          2. Age \u2265 18 years.\n\n          3. Patients will meet accepted standard of care and follow FDA guidance for low\n             molecular weight heparin use prior to lumbar puncture, specifically INR < 1.4 and PT\n             within normal range for DHMC laboratory, and platelet count >50,000. For enoxaparin\n             use, delay of Lumbar puncture to allow at least 12 hours after administration of\n             prophylactic doses, such as those used for prevention of deep vein thrombosis. Longer\n             delays (24 hours) are appropriate to consider for patients receiving higher\n             therapeutic doses of enoxaparin (1 mg/kg twice daily or 1.5 mg/kg once daily). A\n             postprocedure dose of enoxaparin should usually be given no sooner than 4 hours after\n             lumbar puncture. Aspirin and other anti-platelet therapy is permitted without timing\n             constraints prior to or after lumbar puncture.\n\n          4. Tissue from primary or metastatic tumor available at DHMC to be used for genetic\n             analysis. The most recent specimen will be used.\n\n          5. Patient must consent to provide additional CSF (10 mL) and blood (10 mL) when these\n             fluids are drawn as part of clinically indicated procedures.\n\n          6. Patient must consent to permit genetic analysis of their cancer.\n\n          7. Patient capable of giving informed consent.\n\n          8. Brain MRI within the last 3 months.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          1. Evidence of a CNS mass creating mass-effect or midline shift such that lumbar\n             puncture is contraindicated.\n\n          2. Previous or current hematological malignancy.\n\n          3. Previous or current primary CNS malignancy.\n\n          4. Prior treatment for CNS metastasis.\n\n          5. Known CNS autoimmune or inflammatory disease (i.e., Multiple Sclerosis,\n             neurosarcoidosis, chronic fungal, rickettsial or bacterial meningitis).\n\n          6. Patient is currently receiving treatment for LM.\n\n          7. Patient was previously diagnosed with LM."
