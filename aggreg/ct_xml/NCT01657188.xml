  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prospective, follow-up registry of heart failure patients with or without sleep-disordered
      breathing (SDB). To test the hypothesis that treatment of nocturnal central sleep apnea with
      Cheyne-Stokes respiration by adaptive servoventilation (ASV) improves symptoms, cardiac
      performance and event-free survival.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is intended to investigate therapeutic effects of adaptive servoventilation in
      patients with sleep-disordered breathing and chronic heart failure. These effects include
      short-/long-term effects on

        -  symptoms and quality of life

        -  physical and cardiac performance (6min walking test, cardiopulmonary exercise testing)

        -  echocardiographic parameters

        -  arrhythmias

        -  NT-proBNP

        -  Respiratory stability (blood gases, rebreathing test, VE/VCO2-slope in cardiopulmonary
           exercise testing)

        -  Compliance with ASV therapy

        -  Event free survival (death, heart transplantation, assist device implantation)

      All of these data are also obtained in patients who basically meet the inclusion criteria
      but in whom sleep-disordered breathing was excluded by means of cardiorespiratory polygraphy
      or polysomnography and in patients with sleep-disordered breathing who do not undergo
      adaptive servoventilation for various reasons.
