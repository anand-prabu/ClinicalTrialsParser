More than four weeks must have elapsed since any prior systemic therapy at the time\n             the patient receives the preparative regimen, and patients    toxicities must have\n             recovered to a grade 1 or less (except for toxicities such as alopecia or vitiligo).\n             Patients must have progressing disease after prior treatment.\n\n         16.

Women of child-bearing potential who are pregnant or breastfeeding because of the\n             potentially dangerous effects of the treatment on the fetus or infant.\n\n          2. Active systemic infections, coagulation disorders or other active major medical\n             illnesses of the cardiovascular, respiratory or immune system, as evidenced by a\n             positive stress thallium or comparable test, myocardial infarction, cardiac\n             arrhythmias, obstructive or restrictive pulmonary disease.\n\n          3. Any form of primary immunodeficiency (such as Severe Combined Immunodeficiency\n             Disease).\n\n          4. Concurrent opportunistic infections (The experimental treatment being evaluated in\n             this protocol depends on an intact immune system. Patients who have decreased immune\n             competence may be less responsive to the experimental treatment and more susceptible\n             to its toxicities).\n\n          5.
