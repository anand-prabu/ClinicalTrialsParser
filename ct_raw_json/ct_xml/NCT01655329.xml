  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to determine whether or not a new type of software is, or is not, of
      benefit. The software, ClearRead Confirm, is designed to enhance the ability of radiologists
      to detect tubes, lines and wires that may be placed within a patients chest. These types of
      devices are commonly used for very sick patients in intensive care units and are also used
      following surgery and in the treatment of cancer. This study will test radiologists
      detection of the tips of these devices comparing the results with standard chest radiographs
      and the the modified chest radiographs.

        There are two populations: the radiologists and the cases they will review. For cases,
        these are sequential cases selected by database search using defined search criteria.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  For the radiologists, they must in in active practice of community radiology
             (non-university sites).

          -  For the cases, they must be patients who have a tube, line, or wire in their chest. A
             small number of completely normal bedside chest radiographs will be included.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  For radiologists: Not in active practice. Working in a university hospital.

          -  For cases: children. Do not meet image quality criteria.
