  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this randomized prospective study is to compare two single-use laryngeal mask
      airways the LMA Unique and the LMA Supreme, in pediatric patients. The investigators
      hypothesize that airway leak pressures with the LMA Supreme will be superior to the LMA
      Unique.

    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to compare the LMA Unique and LMA-Supreme in children undergoing
      anesthesia. The investigators hypothesize that airway leak pressures with the LMA Supreme
      will be superior when compared with the LMA Unique at two different standardized intracuff
      pressures (40 and 60 cm H20). Airway leak pressures will be measured by recording the
      circuit pressure at which equilibrium is reached. The ease of placement, fiberoptic grade of
      laryngeal view, feasibility of use, and complications will also be assessed.
