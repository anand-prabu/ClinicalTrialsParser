The randomization employs a 1:1 ratio of mechanical embolectomy with the\n      CE MARK approved stentriever Solitaire FR\u00ae versus medical management alone.  Randomization\n      will be done under a minimization process using age, baseline NIHSS, therapeutic window and\n      vessel occlusion site. For the primary endpoint, subjects will be followed for 90 days\n      post-randomization.\n\n      Interim analysis will be performed as preplanned and interpreted by the Data Safety\n      Monitoring Board (DSMB) after the first 174, 346 and 518 patients representing 25%, 50% and\n      75% of the planned sample size have completed their 90-day follow-up. The DSMB will advise\n      the executive committee (EC) on recommendations to stop the trial early either for reasons\n      of safety, efficacy, futility or to adjust the sample size. The latter may be necessary as\n      given the paucity of data regarding natural history of the non-treated patients assumptions\n      regarding rates of favorable outcomes in this group of patients may be incorrect. Of note,\n      sample size adjustment based on different than expected outcomes rates is permitted, but it\n      is not permitted to adjust the sample size based on change in the pre-specified treatment\n      effect which is set at 10%.\n\n      Subject population: Subjects presenting with acute ischemic stroke within 8 hours from\n      symptom onset and whose strokes are attributable to an occlusion of the internal carotid or\n      proximal MCA (M1) arteries.
