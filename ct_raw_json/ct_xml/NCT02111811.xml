      The purpose of this research study is to test the effectiveness of a new telephone
      counseling program for employed veterans with depression called the Veterans Work and Health
      Initiative (V-WHI). 250 participants will be recruited and randomly assigned to one of two
      groups: the V-WHI experimental group or usual mental health care. The V-WHI counselors will
      address mental health and job-related issues that interfere with working. This counseling is
      provided solely over the phone with sessions every 2 weeks for 4 months (eight sessions
      total). At 8 months post-baseline, the V-WHI group is provided with a booster session.
      Participants in both groups are administered follow-up questionnaires at two time-points:
      month five and month nine.

      With the goal of helping employed veterans with depression to participate fully in the labor
      market, this randomized controlled trial has two objectives: 1) test the effectiveness of a
      new evidence-based, vocationally-focused telephonic counseling program for employed veterans
      with depression, the Veterans Work and Health Initiative (V-WHI), which was developed by
      this study's research partners from the Tufts Medical Center; and 2) if the V-WHI is
      effective, quantify its return on investment.  This study will test the impact of the V-WHI
      in combination with the Philadelphia VA's Primary Care Mental Health Integration program,
      the Behavioral Health Lab (BHL).

      The primary endpoints are pre/post changes in at-work performance and productivity scores
      based on the validated Work Limitation Questionnaire (WLQ). Secondary endpoints include
      changes in depression symptom severity (measured with the validated PHQ-9). An ROI analysis
      will assess costs and benefits. For practical reasons, neither subjects nor the intervention
      providers will be blinded to subject assignment.

      After informed consent and eligibility screening, subjects are randomized to one of two
      groups: the V-WHI intervention group or to the usual care group (BHL). 250 employed veterans
      with depression and work limitations will be enrolled (half per group). The &quot;usual care&quot;
      group participants are assigned to standard behavioral health care. The second group,
      assigned to V-WHI services, is the experimental group. Participants in this group are
      assigned to an innovative program designed explicitly to address mental health and
      vocational issues that interfere with working (V-WHI) in addition to standard care. V-WHI
      counselors offer work coaching and modification strategies and work-focused cognitive
      behavioral therapy (CBT). This counseling is provided solely over the phone with sessions
      every 2 weeks for 4 months (eight sessions total). At 8 months post-baseline, the V-WHI
      group is provided with a booster session. Participants in both groups are administered
      follow-up questionnaires at two time-points: month five (post-intervention) and month nine.
