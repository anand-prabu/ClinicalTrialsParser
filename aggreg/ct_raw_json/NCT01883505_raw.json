The aim of the study is to determine the safety, tolerability, the levodopa\n      pharmacokinetics, the need for oral LD dose adjustment and the usability of the ambulatory\n      drug delivery pump following repeated dosing of ND0612 in a conventional home setting in\n      Parkinson's disease patients. Safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetic profile of levodopa\n      and carbidopa, pump usability and the potential clinical effect of ND0612 will be explored\n      in subjects with PD and motor fluctuations."
