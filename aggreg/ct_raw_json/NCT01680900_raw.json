An additional exploratory aim\n      is to identify improvement in menopause-related quality of life. Healthy, perimenopausal\n      women ages 45-60 with an average of 4 or more moderate or severe hot flashes/night sweats\n      per day for 3 screening weeks will be randomized to 8 weeks of treatment in a 2:1 ratio of\n      vilazodone or matching placebo pills. Flexible dosing of vilazodone will start at 10 mg\n      once/day for 7 days, increase to 20 mg/day for 1 more week and increase to 40 mg once/day at\n      week 3 if unimproved.  The primary outcome assessments are the frequency and severity of hot\n      flashes at week 4 and week 8 as assessed by prospective daily diaries (using 7-day mean\n      scores from the daily diaries).  The secondary outcome is clinical improvement, defined as\n      hot flash frequency >=50% decrease from baseline.   Treatment-emergent adverse events will\n      be monitored and patient ratings of tolerability will be obtained."
