The investigators will also investigate the difference between anticipated and\n      actual pain perception. The investigators will test the null hypothesis that there is no\n      difference in patients\u00b4 pain perception between outpatient cystoscopy and urodynamic\n      testing. The secondary hypothesis will be that there is no difference between patients\u00b4\n      anticipated amount of pain and the actually experienced pain during cystoscopy and\n      urodynamic testing.\n\n      According to power calculation, a sample size of 52 patients per group will be needed to\n      detect a 2 cm difference in pain scores on the VAS - judged as a clinically significant\n      difference - with 95% power and a two-sided significance level of 0.05.\n\n      Exclusion criteria are: age \u2264 18 years, insufficient ability to understand German, pregnancy\n      and the participation in another clinical study at the same time."
