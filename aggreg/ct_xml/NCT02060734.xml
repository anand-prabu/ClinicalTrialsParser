      This is a double-blind, randomized controlled trial to determine the efficacy of lidocaine
      injection of trigger points versus placebo in patients with subacute whiplash associated
      disorder following injury.  Outcomes include pain, objective assessment, self-report
      function recovery, impact on work performance and globe perceived effects which will be
      assessed 5 minutes, 2 and 6 weeks following injection.
