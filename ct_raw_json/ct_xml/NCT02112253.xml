  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The motor tics associated with Tourette's syndrome may be reduced with deep brain
      stimulation of the anterior globus pallidus. The best area within this brain region and the
      best stimulation device settings are currently unknown. This is a study in which deep versus
      superficial electrode contact positions and two different amplitudes of stimulation are
      compared under scientific conditions. The hypothesis is that one contact
      position/stimulation amplitude combination will provide a better outcome than the others.
      Each study participant receives each of four different anatomical position/stimulation
      amplitude setting combinations over a 12 month period in randomized order followed by a
      6-month period of trial-and-error device programming to optimize control of motor tics.
      Motor tics, potential side effects, daily functioning and quality of life are assessed at
      the end of each trial stimulation period. At the end of the study, the study participant
      continues to have long-term deep brain stimulation treatment with whatever settings provide
      the most relief.
