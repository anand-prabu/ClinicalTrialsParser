      Aim 1 - The primary aim of our study is to assess whether group counseling is a non-inferior
      intervention compared to the usual care of individual counseling in the management of
      childhood obesity.  In order to achieve this aim, the investigators will compare the mean
      change in BMI after 6 months of intervention in the two study arms.

      Aim 2 - The secondary aim of our study is to determine if the change in BMI is associated
      with changes in the dietary composition, physical activity and metabolic profile.

      This is a non-inferiority study to determine the sample size needed for a larger study to
      explore an intervention strategy focused on nutrition counseling to maximize weight loss and
      minimize cardiovascular risk factors in obese children and adolescents. In this prospective
      parallel arm, randomized trial, we will study the impact of nutritional counseling in an
      individual vs. group setting.  We will enroll 80 patients, ages 9-17 years over a 6 month
      period. There will be a total of four groups. Obese pre-adolescents (ages 9-12) and
      adolescents (ages 13-17) will be randomized into two interventions: individual nutrition
      counseling or group nutrition counseling.  Subjects will receive the same information in
      both interventions.  All content will be developed prior to starting the intervention.  Each
      group session will have a maximum of 7 children with 1 parent/caregiver per child and a
      minimum of 5 children with a caregiver.  Group sessions will be one time a month for 60
      minutes (30 minutes for dietetic session and 30 minutes for discussion/questions) and
      individual sessions will be one time a month for 30 minutes.  There will be 6 sessions for
      each group.

      All groups will receive our standard of care for physical fitness counseling which includes
      recommending 1 hour of physical activity a day and limiting screen time to less than 2 hours
      a day.  All groups will be evaluated for depression and appropriately referred if found to
      be depressed.  Behavioral strategies, like mindful eating, will be included in the nutrition
      education.

    <description>The primary aim of our study is to assess whether group counseling is a non-inferior intervention compared to the usual care of individual counseling in the management of childhood obesity.  In order to achieve this aim, we will compare the mean change in BMI after 6 months of intervention in the two study arms. As per previous studies, we expect the group intervention arm to achieve a mean BMI reduction of 0.8 +/- 1.4 greater than the control arm. We also posit that a difference in mean BMI change as low as 0.1 would be clinically equivalent.</description>
