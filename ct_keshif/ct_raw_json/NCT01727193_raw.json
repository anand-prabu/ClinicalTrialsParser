Evaluation of short-term and long-term efficacy of thymectomized myasthenia gravis\n      patients in the different group prove that what kind of   treatment can improve the cure\n      rate. The investigators will evaluate the acute toxicity (gastrointestinal side effects,\n      liver and kidney dysfunction) and long-term toxicity (immune dysfunction, gonadal\n      suppression) when  the investigators  apply these therapy in the treatment of different\n      clinical types of MG."
