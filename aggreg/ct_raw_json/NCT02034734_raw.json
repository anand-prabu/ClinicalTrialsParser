Subjects fast for 10h before the morning dose on Days 5 to 9 and they are\n      served the first standard meal 1h after the morning dose.\n\n      A spinal tap is used to collect cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) on Day 1 and Day 10. A plasma\n      sample for PK sample is obtained before first dosing on Day 5. To confirm steady-state\n      concentrations of ASP3652 in plasma, blood samples are obtained before the morning dose on\n      Days 7, 9 and 10, and before the evening dose on Days 5, 7 and 9. On Day 10, a PK profile of\n      ASP3652 in plasma is obtained for up to 48h after the morning dose and for up to 24h in CSF.\n\n      Profiles of several enzyme substrates in plasma and seminal fluid (exploratory) are obtained\n      on Day 1 and Day 10 up to 24h in CSF and up to 48h in plasma, before the morning and evening\n      dose on Days 5, 7 and 9 in plasma.\n\n      Vital signs, 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs), safety laboratory assessments, adverse\n      events (AEs) and concomitant medication are monitored throughout the investigational period\n      until the ESV."
