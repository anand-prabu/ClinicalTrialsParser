  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical trial is to study an experimental drug called PTP-01 that is
      being used as an imaging agent to diagnosis pancreatic cancer.  Currently, pancreatic cancer
      is diagnosed using CT or MRI scans which miss small pancreatic cancers, particularly early
      stage disease. Researchers at the University of Virginia have identified a biomarker for
      pancreatic cancer called plectin, which is very specific for pancreatic cancer and not
      other, non-cancerous conditions involving the pancreas. These researchers have also
      developed PTP-01, an  experimental drug that may be used with SPECT imaging to detect
      pancreatic cancer cells in humans.
