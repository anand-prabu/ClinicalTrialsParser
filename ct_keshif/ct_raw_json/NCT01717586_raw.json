            "textblock": "Preeclampsia shares pathogenic similarities with adult cardiovascular diseases as well as\n      many risk factors. Endothelial dysfunction and inflammation are fundamental for the\n      initiation and progression of both. There is strong evidence that\n      3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) are\n      beneficial in primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular mortality and other\n      cardiovascular events. Biological plausibility as well as animal data supports a similar\n      role for statins in preeclampsia.\n\n      Currently, there are no clinically available agents to prevent preeclampsia. However because\n      of the below properties of statins, this class of medications could substantially contribute\n      to preeclampsia prevention.\n\n        1. Statins pleiotropic actions on various mechanisms: reversing the angiogenic imbalance\n           by upregulating vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and placental growth factor\n           (PlGF), and reducing the antiangiogenic factors such as soluble fms-like tyrosine\n           kinase-1 (sFlt-1) and soluble endoglin (sEng).\n\n        2. Statins up regulation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase, leading to improved nitric\n           oxide production in the vasculature and to activate the heme oxygenase-1/carbon\n           monoxide (HO-1/CO) pathway, protecting the endothelium and reducing the inflammatory\n           and oxidative insults.\n\n      The purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate the maternal-fetal safety and pharmacokinetic\n      (PK) profiles of pravastatin when used in pregnant women at high-risk of developing\n      preeclampsia."
