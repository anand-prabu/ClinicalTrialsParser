It is not yet known if transcendental meditation\n      is more effective than basic breast cancer education in improving quality of life.\n\n      PURPOSE: This randomized clinical trialstudies stress reduction in improvingquality of life\n      in older women with stage II, stage III, or stage IV breast cancer."

Patients\n      are stratified according to age and participation in support groups. Patients with stage IV\n      disease are also stratified according to type of metastases (visceral vs non-visceral) and\n      timing of metastases (first diagnosis vs recurrence). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2\n      treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive usual medical care and instruction on stress reduction using\n           transcendental meditation (TM), which involves a standard 7-step course. Patients\n           attend training for approximately 1-1.5 hours per session for a total of 6 sessions\n           over 1 week, while receiving usual medical care. Patients then practice TM twice a day\n           for 20 minutes. Patients attend group meetings for approximately 90 minutes once or\n           twice monthly for 6 months to ensure proper technique and understanding.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive usual medical care and basic literature on breast cancer.\n\n      Quality of life is assessed at baseline and then every 6 months for up to 3 years.\n\n      Patients are followed monthly for up to 2.5 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 166 patients (83 per treatment arm) will be accrued for\n      this study within 6 months."
