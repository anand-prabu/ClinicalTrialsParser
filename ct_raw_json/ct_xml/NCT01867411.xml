      Background:

      - Smoking is a difficult habit to quit, and some people find it more difficult to quit than
      others do. Nicotine is the substance in cigarettes that makes smoking so addictive. Nicotine
      changes some patterns of brain activity, and smokers have differences in brain activity when
      compared to non-smokers. Some genes make it more likely that a person will become addicted
      to smoking. Researchers want to study how nicotine interacts with genes and brain activity.
      This may help develop better treatments to help people quit smoking.

      Objectives:

      - To develop a test of nicotine dependence, using brain activity and genetic analysis, which
      may be useful in predicting success in smoking cessation and in the development of new
      smoking cessation treatment targets.

      Eligibility:

        -  Main group: Current smokers between 18 and 55 years of age who are seeking treatment to
           quit.

        -  Comparison group: Current smokers between 18 and 55 years of age who are not seeking to
           quit.

        -  Comparison group: Healthy former smokers between 18 and 55 years of age.

        -  Comparison group: Healthy nonsmoking volunteers between 18 and 55 years of age.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood samples
           will be collected.

        -  The three comparison groups will have one magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan
           session. They will have tests of thinking, concentration, and memory both inside the
           scanner, and while sitting in front of a computer.

        -  Current smokers who are trying to quit must be willing to undergo a course of nicotine
           treatment that includes weekly counseling (for 12 weeks) and e-cigarettes. Participants
           will attempt smoking abstinence and will have a total of 6 MRI scanning sessions. They
           will do thinking, concentration, and memory tasks inside and outside of the scanner.

        -  For smokers, the first scanning session will take place before they attempt to quit.
           This will be a baseline scan. The second scanning session will take place 48 hours
           after having their last real cigarette. After this scan, they will use electronic
           cigarettes to help quit their habit.

        -  After using e-cigarettes for two weeks, smokers will have a third scan session.. They
           will then gradually taper their use of the electronic cigarettes over the course of
           three weeks, at which point they will be nicotine abstinent.

        -  After about 5 weeks of abstinence, they will have the fourth scan. The fifth scan will
           be approximately 6 months after start of the study, and the final scan will take place
           at about 1 year from the study start.

        -  Smokers will continue to receive support on quitting smoking until the study ends at
           about 1 year.

      Objective: To develop a neuroimaging/genetic/epigenetic biomarker of nicotine dependence
      severity that may be useful in predicting success in smoking cessation and in development of
      new smoking cessation treatment targets.

      Study population: Four groups will be studied: target group of treatment seeking smokers;
      nontreatment seeking current smokers; never smokers and former smokers. We estimate that we
      will need n=50/group completers to have sufficient power to develop the brain/genetics
      biomarkers.

      Design: This study consists of a 4 group between/within subject design. The experimental
      group will proceed in 4 phases: Baseline (scan 1), peak withdrawal (scan 2), stable on
      e-cigarettes (scan 3), and complete abstinence (scans 4-6). Counseling will start after the
      first scan session and will generally continue weekly until scan 4 (about 12 weeks). After
      scan 4, therapeutic support will be provided at least monthly via phone until completion of
      the protocol. The three comparison groups will be recruited and scanned once. Genetic and
      epigenetic markers will be obtained in all groups.

      Outcome measures: Network and multivariate pattern analysis, behavior on a decision making
      task and task based and resting state blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) activation in
      neural circuits relevant to nicotine addiction during fMRI scanning. Secondary outcomes
      include efficacy of e-cigarettes to substitute for cigarette smoking, BOLD response
      comparisons between e-cigarettes and smoking and genetic markers of nicotine addiction and
      relapse susceptibility.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        All participants must:

          1. Be between the ages of 18-55. Be right-handed.

          2. Be in good health.

          3. Be free of active DSM-IV abuse/dependence, or dependence in partial remission, on
             alcohol or any drug except nicotine. Past active dependence is acceptable provided it
             is at least five years in the past and total time of active dependence did not exceed
             4 years. Those with past dependence on substances other than alcohol or marijuana may
             not have any current use (past 6 months) of the substance on which they were
             dependent. Individuals with past dependence on either alcohol or marijuana who report
             current use of the previously dependent substance may be included, provided they do
             not currently meet any criteria for dependence, with the exception of tolerance.

          4. Be able to abstain from alcohol 24hrs before each of the imaging sessions and able to
             abstain from caffeine 24hrs before each session.

          5. For the treatment and non-treatment seeking smoker groups, must have a urine cotinine
             level of greater than or equal to 4 and have been smoking consistently for at least
             one year. For lighter smokers (less than 10 cpd), this is defined as smoking at their
             current level or more for at least the past year (excluding any quit attempts in the
             last year). For heavier smokers (more than 10 cpd), they must have been smoking at
             least an average of 10 cpd for at least the past year (excluding quit attempts).
             Based on the correlation between self-reported cpd/FTND and urine cotinine levels
             [85a, 85b], a single inclusion criterion will be easier to manage and provide
             adequate characterization of dependent smokers.  Urine cotinine level provides a
             biomarker that does not rely on self-report/memory. Quit attempts will be assessed
             via clinical interview and judgment.

          6. For the treatment seeking group, be actively seeking treatment for smoking cessation
             and willing to engage in 12-weeks of treatment involving nicotine substitution
             (e-cigarettes) and weekly counseling sessions, as well as follow-up imaging and
             behavioral assessments following treatment onset.

          7. For the ex-smoker group, must have smoked approximately 8 cigarettes per day for at
             least 1 year, and have remained abstinent continuously for at least the last 12
             months..

          8. For the non-smoking control group, less than 20 cigarettes lifetime, none in past
             year and no history of daily smoking.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. are not suitable to undergo an fMRI experiment due to certain implanted devices
             (cardiac pacemaker or neurostimulator, some artificial joints, metal pins, surgical
             clips or other implanted metal parts), body morphology, or claustrophobia.

          2. have coagulopathies, history of, current superficial, or deep vein thrombosis,
             musculoskeletal abnormalities restricting an individual   s ability to lie flat for
             extended periods of time.

          3. have HIV or Syphilis.

          4. regularly use any prescription (e.g., antidepressants, benzodiazepines,
             antipsychotics, anticonvulsants, barbiturates), over-the-counter (e.g., cold
             medicine) or herbal medication (e.g., Kava, Gingko biloba, St. John   s wort) that
             may alter CNS function, cardiovascular function, or neuronal-vascular coupling.

          5. have any current neurological illnesses including, but not limited to, seizure
             disorders, frequent migraines or on prophylaxis, multiple sclerosis, movement
             disorders, history of significant head trauma, or CNS tumor.

          6. have any current major psychiatric disorders to include, but not limited to, mood,
             anxiety, psychotic disorders, or substance-induced psychiatric disorders, or any
             current suicidal ideations or currently under antidepressant or antipsychotic
             medication treatment. The MAI will reserve the right to exclude on the basis of
             psychiatric history not explicitly described in this criterion.

          7. Are cognitively impaired or learning disabled.

          8. have significant cardiovascular or cerebrovascular conditions.

          9. have any other major medical condition that in the view of the investigators would
             compromise the safety of an individual during participation. The following lab values
             will result in exclusion from the study:

               -  Hemoglobin less than 10 g/dl

               -  White Blood Cell Count less than 2400/microl
