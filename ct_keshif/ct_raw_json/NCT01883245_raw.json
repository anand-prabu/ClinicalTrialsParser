In most cases these strategies together allow the control of the\n      symptoms, even though they aren't completely resolutive.\n\n      In these patients is frequent chronic pain and ineffectiveness of common drugs used.\n\n      It has been demonstrated how transcranial electrical brain stimulation with direct current\n      (tDCS) is able to reduce the intensity and  the duration of chronic pain.\n\n      Stimulating the motor cortex can reduce pain by modulating brain activities in the areas\n      involved in cerebral circuits controlling pain, such as thalamus, facilitating the\n      descendant inhibitory mechanisms and enhancing the number of opiates receptors.\n\n      This clinical trial is based on the evaluation of the effects of tDCS on pain and on\n      activities daily living (ADL) participation patients with chronic orofacial pain that don't\n      respond to other treatments."
