  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The colonic microbiome is essential in health and disease, and is highly dynamic during the
      first several years of life.  Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are widely used in children, but
      the effects of PPIs on the pediatric colonic microbiome are unknown.  This study will
      determine whether PPIs affect the microbiome of otherwise healthy children who are
      prescribed PPIs for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and determine the duration and
      magnitude of PPI-related microbiome changes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Otherwise healthy children age 1-4 years old who are being considered for PPI therapy for
      GERD will be eligible for this study.  Once enrolled in the study, subjects will donate a
      stool sample.  Subjects will then be treated for 4 weeks with lifestyle modification, and
      will bring a stool sample at the end of this time period.  Those who respond to lifestyle
      modification will continue on this management.  Those who do not respond to lifestyle
      modification will start omeprazole 1 mg/kg/day for a planned course of 8 weeks.  We will
      perform stratified 1:1 enrollment within each study arm, and enroll children until there are
      8 children in each arm (16 total).  Both study arms will donate stools every 4 weeks during
      a study of 20 weeks duration (at weeks 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20).  The primary outcome will be a
      significant change in the overall diversity of the colonic microbiome after 4 weeks of PPIs
      (i.e., from week 8 to week 4), compared to after 4 weeks of lifestyle management.
