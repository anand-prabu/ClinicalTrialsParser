The\n      aim of this study is to assess the stickiness of the blood (global thrombotic status) in\n      patients with CAD and AF at baseline and after clinical stabilisation to see how disease\n      state and clinical treatments affect the stickiness of the blood (thrombotic status). This\n      will be a single centre study. Patients diagnosed with CAD or AF will have a blood sample\n      taken at baseline and after clinical stabilisation. Blood stickiness will be tested with the\n      Global Thrombosis Test. The results will be evaluated to assess the effect of disease\n      process and clinical state on blood stickiness to gain further understanding of this\n      condition and form the basis for future studies aimed at identifying patients who are at\n      high risk of future cardiovascular events, based on increased blood stickiness."
