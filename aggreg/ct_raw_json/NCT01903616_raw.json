Knowledge of\n      these developmental patterns in movement and participation in life activities MPLA may be\n      helpful in understanding, anticipating, and managing the problems of these children. We\n      hypothesize that the course of developmental patterns in MPLA of young children with CP\n      evolves with their age. This study investigates the longitudinal course of developmental\n      patterns in MPLA of young children with CP in Taiwan. This study includes a validity and\n      reliability study and a prospective longitudinal study of young children with CP over\n      one-year. This study will be executed in 4 years and a validity and reliability study in the\n      first year."
