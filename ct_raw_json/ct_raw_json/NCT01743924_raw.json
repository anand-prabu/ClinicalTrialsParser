No information has been reported\n      about the metabolic fate of ITC in the kailan-hybrid broccoli, which physicochemical\n      characteristics could greatly influence that metabolic fate. Previous studies have shown\n      that cooking process of vegetables may vary the human absorption of the correspondent\n      nutritional and bioactive compounds.\n\n      Research Methods & Procedures A cross-over-design study of 7 subjects after ingestion of\n      200-g raw or microwaved kailan-hybrid broccoli was conducted. Total ITC equivalents in the\n      vegetable, urine and blood samples were determined by HPLC as the cyclocondensation product\n      of 1,2-benzenedithiol."
