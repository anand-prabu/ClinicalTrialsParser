            "textblock": "A number of studies have documented an average of 47% greater weight gain in preterm\n      neonates  following massage therapy. Our currently funded study suggests that massage\n      therapy increases vagal activity, oxytocin, and IGF-1. In the proposed continuation of this\n      study preemies would be provided daily massages three times a day for 10 days, as in our\n      previously successful protocol. To determine potential mechanisms that may underlie the\n      massage therapy/weight gain relationship we will continue to assess vagal activity and assay\n      insulin, oxytocin, IGF-1 and cortisol as well as gastric motility. We have added an\n      alternative potential pathway for the massage therapy/weight gain relationship. In this\n      expanded model, activity level and the related measures of heart rate, oxygen consumption\n      (based on a formula calculated from heart rate) and temperature mediate the effects of\n      massage therapy on weight gain. A larger sample will be recruited so that we can have the\n      power needed to test our model of the potential mechanisms underlying the weight gain from\n      preterm infant massage. For the current application, 120 preterm infants with common medical\n      complications of prematurity, who are medically stable and residing in the intermediate care\n      (\"grower\") nursery, will be assigned to groups based on a random stratification on the\n      following variables: gender, gestational age, birthweight, days in the NICU, and study entry\n      weight.  One hundred twenty infants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: 1) ten\n      days of massage therapy (n=60), or 2) standard treatment (n=60).  Within-subjects and\n      between-groups analyses will focus on physiological (heart rate, vagal tone, gastric\n      motility, and temperature), biochemical  (insulin, oxytocin, IGF-1 and cortisol) and\n      behavioral variables (activity level)."
