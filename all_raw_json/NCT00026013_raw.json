St. John's Wort has recently been shown\n      to increase metabolism of some drugs. If it could increase metabolism of oral contraceptives\n      as well, it may increase the risk of contraceptive failure and unintended pregnancy. Study\n      participants will be evaluated for risk of ovulation on oral contraceptives before and\n      during simultaneous therapy with St. John's Wort."
