  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to look at how snacking during exercise may help prevent low blood
      sugars while subjects are on the &quot;closed loop artificial pancreas.&quot;  This system uses a
      continuous glucose sensor, an insulin pump, and a computer program that automatically
      determines how much insulin to give based on the sensor glucose level.

    <textblock>
      This study will be a randomized cross-over study as subjects will be studied under both
      study conditions - Closed Loop (CL) alone vs. CL + proactive snacking protocol). Differences
      in the nadir blood glucose levels during exercise between the two study conditions will be
      the primary outcome measure.

    <description>The Medtronic MiniMed closed loop system is an investigational system that uses some commercially available products.  An investigational Enlite 2 glucose sensor measures the sensor glucose.  The glucose sensor signal is sent to the insulin pump.  From the insulin pump the sensor glucose is sent through the translator, which then relays the signal on to a controller.  An Android Mobile Device (off the shelf) has the control algorithm installed.  This device is known as the controller.  The controller serves as the control center for the Android system, receiving data from the sensor and pump components, feeding the data to its control algorithm, issuing delivery commands to the pump to apply the algorithm's recommend therapy, and providing a means to monitor the system.</description>

             required)

          3. Duration of T1D ≥ 1 year

          4. HbA1c ≤ 9 %

          5. Treated with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (pump) for at least 3 months

          6. Body weight &gt; 40 kg (to accommodate phlebotomy)

          7. Able to tolerate a 75-minute exercise period of moderate intensity

          8. Be willing to wear 2 subcutaneous glucose sensors (placed under the skin like a pump
             site) simultaneously during the inpatient portions of this study.

          9. Be in good general health without other acute or chronic illness that in the judgment
             of the investigator could interfere with the study or jeopardize subject safety

         10. Normal hematocrit

         11. Able to give consent (for children &lt;18 years, permission from parents and subject
             assent will be required)

         12. Female subjects of reproductive potential must be abstinent or consistently using
             appropriate family planning methods.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Insulin resistant (defined as requiring &gt; 1.5 units/kg/day at time of study
             enrollment)

          2. Presence of any medical or psychiatric disorder that may interfere with subject
             safety or study conduct

          3. Use of any medications (besides insulin) known to effect blood glucose levels,
             including oral or other systemic glucocorticoid therapy. Inhaled, intranasal, or
             rectal corticosteroid use is allowed along as not given within 2 weeks of the closed
             loop admissions. Use of topical glucocorticoids is allowable as long as affected skin
             area does not overlap with study device sites.

          4. Subjects using herbal supplements will be excluded, due to the unknown effects of
             these supplements on glucose control

          5. History of hypoglycemic seizure within last 3 months

          6. Female subjects who are pregnant, lactating, or unwilling to be tested for pregnancy
