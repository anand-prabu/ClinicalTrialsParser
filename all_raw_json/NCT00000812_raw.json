All 12 patients at a dose level must receive treatment\n      for at least 2 weeks before dose escalation in subsequent patients occurs. The MTD is\n      defined as the dose level immediately below that at which 3 or more of 9 patients receiving\n      thalidomide experience dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed for a total of 16\n      weeks.\n\n      PER 6/20/95 AMENDMENT: Patients in cohort 1 should discontinue the previous 50 mg\n      formulation of thalidomide once the new formulation is available. Those patients may either\n      wash out for 4 weeks and recommence the study or discontinue the study."
