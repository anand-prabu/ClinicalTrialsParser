In vitro studies suggest that progressive increase in\n      lithotripter energy output voltage could produce the best overall stone comminution in\n      comparison with constant or deescalating energy output. However, it is possible that the\n      beneficial impact of slow rate SWL on comminution of stones and stone free rates has masked\n      any marginal benefits for energy output escalation. The Escalating SW method adds the\n      benefit of less renal tissue injury.\n\n      Research Significance:The present study will signifies and evaluates the stone free rates of\n      three groups of patients with renal stones treated with different SWL energy outputs\n      (Escalating, Constant and Reduction energy output).\n\n      Research Objectives: The aim of this research project is to study the effect of dose\n      adjustment strategies on success rate of Shock Wave Lithotripsy in the clinical setting and\n      to optimize the conditions for successful Shock Wave Lithotripsy.\n\n      Research Methodology: This clinical trial will be conducted at a tertiary care university\n      hospital. 150 patients referred to the Shock wave lithotripsy unit will be evaluated for\n      eligibility to be randomized into three groups (Dose Escalation, Dose reduction and constant\n      dose). Parameter of the three groups will be compared to detect the treatment difference."
