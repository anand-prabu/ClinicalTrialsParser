Mood altering and psychomotor effects will be tested on non-drug\n      abusers and preference procedures will be used to assess reinforcing effects.  Comparisons\n      between nitrous oxide, opiates, and benzodiazepine antagonists will be made.  To examine the\n      effects of different behavioral contingencies in modulating the reinforcing effects of\n      nitrous oxide in healthy volunteers."
