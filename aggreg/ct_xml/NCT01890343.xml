    <textblock>
      Study 18F-AV-45-010 is designed to evaluate the cerebral uptake of florbetapir 18F as
      measured by PET imaging in frontotemporal disorder (FTD) in comparison to cognitively normal
      volunteers and subjects with Alzheimer's disease (AD).

    <description>Standardized Uptake Value ratios (SUVRs) were calculated for the following regions of interest (ROI): mesial temporal lobe, temporal lobe, frontal lobe, anterior cingulate cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, parietal lobe, occipital lobe, central subcortical and the brainstem. SUVR is the ratio of tracer uptake in a predefined ROI, relative to uptake in the cerebellar grey matter.</description>
