  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anorexia nervosa is a chronic mental health condition characterized by maladaptive food
      consumption (i.e., hypophagia) and distorted body image. There is substantial evidence of a
      phenotypic overlap between anorexia nervosa and anxiety disorders, as well as data
      suggesting the two share a common genetic pathway. Despite these findings, little research
      has examined fear conditioning among individuals with anorexia nervosa, and no research has
      examined whether individuals with anorexia nervosa have a propensity to overgeneralize
      conditioned fear stimuli, one of the more robust fear-conditioning markers of anxiety
      disorders. The current study assesses generalization of conditioned fear with
      fear-potentiated startle: the cross-species enhancement of the startle reflex when an
      organism is in a state of fear. Animal data, as well as an emerging literature in humans,
      tightly links fear-potentiated startle to the amygdala-based fear circuit. Thus, evidence of
      overgeneralized fear-potentiated startle in anorexia nervosa would link this eating disorder
      to hypersensitivity of the fear circuit and could inform the development of novel
      pharmacologic and psychological treatments for anorexia nervosa based on treatment models
      used in the anxiety disorders literature.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overarching objective of the current proposal is to examine the feasibility of applying
      a generalization of conditioned fear-potentiated startle paradigm, which has been used
      successfully to measure the sensitivity of fear networks in anxiety disorders, to adults
      with anorexia nervosa. The specific aim will be to examine whether conditioned-fear
      generalization gradients in anorexia nervosa participants differ from those in healthy
      controls. It is hypothesized that anorexia nervosa participants will display stronger
      generalization as indicated by less quadratic generalization gradients (i.e., a more gradual
      decline in conditioned fear as the generalization stimuli deviate from the conditioned
      fearful stimuli), which is indicative of a heightened sensitivity, or lower thresholds of
      activation, in the fear circuit (i.e., less danger information necessary to trigger the
      fear).
