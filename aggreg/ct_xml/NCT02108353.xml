  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      EuRhythDia II is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind controlled study. The rationale of
      EuRhythdia is to explore the effects of 12 weeks of timed melatonin treatment on circadian
      rhythm, metabolic control and cardiovascular function in night shift workers. The 12 weeks
      of intervention will be followed by 12 weeks of washing out.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Modern lifestyle has dramatically changed the daily rhythms of life. Physical activity, diet
      and light exposure are no longer restricted to daytime hours due to increased shift work.
      Recent scientific reports have shown that shift work leads to disruption of circadian
      rhythms and promotes diabetes, obesity and cardiovascular disease. Until now only few
      studies investigating circadian rhythm disturbances in the context of type 2 diabetes and
      obesity have been conducted in man. Thus, knowledge of the molecular pathways and the
      responsibles genes in man are missing and have been identified only in animal studies.

      The objective of the project is to achieve breakthroughs in the understanding of the
      causality between inner clock rhythm disturbances and the development of type 2 diabetes and
      obesity. The provided data on the interaction between genes, epigenetics, metabolism,
      cardiovascular function and the internal clock are intended to contribute to identify novel
      biomarkers and novel therapeutic approaches focusing on circadian rhythms to reduce the
      occurence of diabetes and obesity in shift worker.
