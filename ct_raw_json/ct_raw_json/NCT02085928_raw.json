            "textblock": "Lateral epicondylitis (LE) is the most common cause of lateral elbow pain. Intratissue\n      percutaneous electrolysis (EPI technique) is a novel minimally invasive approach which\n      consists in the application of a galvanic current through a puncture needle which produces a\n      local inflammatory process in the soft tissue and the reparation of the affected tissue.\n\n      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical and ultrasonographic effectiveness of\n      a multimodal program using the intratissue percutaneous electrolysis technique and exercises\n      in the short term for patients with chronic lateral epicondylitis, and to determine whether\n      the clinical outcomes achieved decline over time.\n\n      This study is an observational one-way repeated measures design. 36 patients in a clinical\n      setting presenting with lateral epicondylitis (mean age = 38, mean time since injury = 12.6\n      months) received one session of EPI per week over 4-6 weeks, associated with a home program\n      of eccentric exercise and stretching. The main outcome measures were severity of pain (VAS,\n      digital algometer, Cozen and Thompson tests), disability (DASH questionnaire), structural\n      tendon changes (ultrasound), hypervascularity (power doppler) and patient's perceptions of\n      overall outcome (4-point scale). Measurements at 6, 26 and 52 weeks follow-up included\n      recurrence rates (increase of severity of pain or disability compared to discharge), the\n      perception of overall outcome and success rates. Paired Student t-tests and Chi squared\n      tests were applied to data. Enrollment into this study ended in September 2012.\n\n      All outcome measures registered significant improvements between pre-intervention and\n      discharge. Most patients (30, i.e. 83.3%) rated overall outcome as 'successful' at 6 weeks.\n      The ultrasonographic finding revealed that the hypoechoic regions and hypervascularity of\n      the extensor carpi radialis brevis change significantly. At 26 and 52 weeks, all\n      participants (32) perceived a 'successful' outcome. Recurrence rates were null after\n      discharge, and at the 6, 26 and 52 week follow-ups."

            "textblock": "Patients received one session of EPI technique per week over 4 weeks (or over 6 weeks when\n      pain persisted) associated with a home program consisting of eccentric exercise (EccEx) and\n      stretching, initiated 24 hours after each session. The EccEx and stretching program was\n      taught by a physiotherapist in the first session and monitored in subsequent sessions. At\n      discharge, patients were instructed to perform only EccEx once daily for the first 6 weeks\n      of the follow-up period.\n\n      The EPI technique was performed under ultrasound-guidance on the clinically relevant area\n      (or areas of maximum tenderness to palpation and with ultrasonographic degenerative tendon\n      changes) using an intensity of 4-6 milliampere (mA) during 3 seconds, approximately 3 times.\n      The investigators used the EPI machine (Cesmar Electromedicina S.L., Barcelona, Spain) and a\n      GE Logiq E Portable Ultrasound Machine with GE Linear probe 12L-RS (5-13 mhz) (GE\n      Healthcare, Wisconsin, EEUU). During the EPI technique, the patient was placed in a supine\n      position, with the affected elbow placed in a position of 90\u00b0 flexion and maximum pronation.\n      The elbow was sterilized and the sonographic transducer, enclosed in a sterile cover over\n      sterile applied gel, was placed at the lateral epicondyle (first approach) and over the\n      humeroradial joint between the head of the radius and the capitulum of the humerus (second\n      approach), where it remained throughout the procedure. A common target area was the deep\n      surface of the common extensor tendon (origin of the ECRB [extensor carpi radialis brevis]\n      and the EDC [extensor digitorum communis]) (first approach) and the deep surface of the\n      ECRB, over the capsule and the lateral ulnar collateral ligament (second approach). A 0.3 x\n      25mm. (1 inch) needle was inserted at a 30\u00b0 to 45\u00b0 angle to the skin in the direction of the\n      lateral epicondyle (first approach) and at a 80\u00b0 angle to the skin, with the needle tip\n      directed towards the humeroradial joint (second approach). In the first approach the needle\n      was advanced parallel to the longitudinal plane of the tendon (in-plane approach); whereas\n      in the second approach the needle was advanced along the short plane of the humeroradial\n      joint (out-of-plane approach). Real-time ultrasonographic imaging provided guidance for both\n      procedures. Once the needle reached the target tissue, readjustments of the needle position\n      were made in order to ensure a correct stimulation. The generation of the galvanic current\n      creates a white image (hyperechoic) as a result of the liberation of hydrogen gas due to the\n      electrolysis. Oral paracetamol was used when necessary for the purpose of pain relief only.\n\n      The eccentric exercise program consisted of three series of up to 10 repetitions of\n      eccentric work, repeated twice daily (morning and afternoon), under maximum load (initially\n      with one kilogram) in an optimal and functional pain-free range. From maximum wrist\n      extension and radial deviation, rapid wrist flexion movement were performed, followed by a\n      2-second hold of the final position. In between series patients were given a rest period of\n      2-3 minutes. This formula was used for the duration of the physiotherapy program. The\n      concentric contraction phase for returning to the starting position was nullified with the\n      help of the other hand.\n\n      The stretching program consisted of a stretching exercise for the epicondylar muscles\n      consisting in three series of 7 repetitions twice a day (morning and afternoon), performed\n      in a sitting position with a flexed wrist and fingers, ulnar deviation and elbow extension\n      reaching the stretch limit without bounces, and held for 45 seconds, with a 30-second rest\n      between repetitions."
