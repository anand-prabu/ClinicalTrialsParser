Courses repeat every 6 weeks in the\n      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of MS-275 until the maximum tolerated dose\n      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 3\n      or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 25-30 patients will be accrued for this study."
