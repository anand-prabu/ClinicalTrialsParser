            "textblock": "People with hypertension are at a higher risk for cardiovascular disease and death so it is\n      important to lower blood pressure to normal levels as quickly as possible. Previous research\n      has established that renal nerve denervation successfully lowers blood pressure measured in\n      the arm in the physician's office. This study is being conducted so that the investigators\n      can determine whether renal nerve denervation also helps to lower blood pressure over 24\n      hours, as well as central aortic blood pressure, which is pressure exerted by the aorta\n      closer to the heart and may be a better predictor of cardiovascular problems. The\n      investigators also want to know whether these beneficial effects on blood pressure can last\n      up to 2 years, whether renal denervation reduces the number of medications patients need to\n      take, and whether it reduces glucose and insulin levels in the blood since hypertension is\n      also related to obesity and diabetes."

The Symplicity Generator delivers controlled relatively low power radiofrequency energy (approximately 8 watts for 2 minutes). The Symplicity System selectively denervates the kidney by delivering radiofrequency from the generator via the electrode of the catheter through the renal artery wall from the intra-luminal side to ablate the renal sympathetic efferent and afferent nerves and reduce overall sympathetic nervous system activity.",
