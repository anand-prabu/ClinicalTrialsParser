  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall rationale for this study is to evaluate the clinical performance potential for
      Mepilex Border Post-Op in the ability to minimise the risk of blistering, maceration and
      less dressing change due to high absorption capacity. This study is a part of Post Market
      Clinical Follow-Up (PMCF).
