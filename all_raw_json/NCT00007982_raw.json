Combining chemotherapy with peripheral stem cell transplant may\n      allow the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill more cancer cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well chemotherapy and peripheral stem cell\n      transplant work in treating patients with central nervous system cancer."

Patients with germ cell or primary neuroectodermal tumors also\n      receive 4 courses of standard chemotherapy comprising cyclophosphamide, etoposide, and\n      cisplatin prior to high-dose chemotherapy.\n\n      All patients undergo peripheral blood stem cell or bone marrow harvest followed by high-dose\n      chemotherapy consolidation. Patients receive thiotepa IV 3 times daily on days -7 to -3,\n      carmustine IV over 1 hour on days -6 to -3, and etoposide IV over 5 hours on days -6 to -3.\n      Patients then undergo transplantation on day 0. Filgrastim (G-CSF) is administered\n      concurrently with stem cell harvesting and transplantation.\n\n      Patients with recurrent oligodendroglioma or CNS lymphoma who have not received radiotherapy\n      at diagnosis undergo conventional radiotherapy 6 weeks after completion of high-dose\n      chemotherapy.\n\n      Patients are followed every 2-3 months for 1 year and then annually for 5 years. Quality of\n      life is assessed at follow-up.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study over 3 years."
