  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To achieve the goal of trachoma control as mandated by the World Health Organization,
      countries must reduce the backlog of trichiasis surgery cases to less than 1/1,000 of their
      population. However, these cases reside in rural villages in trachoma endemic districts, and
      finding them to offer services is a challenge.  Community Treatment Assistants (CTAs) are
      village residents who are trained to offer Mass Drug Administration (MDA) to their
      communities, and hence are in contact with most residents. A training guide and tool for
      screening for trachomatous trichiasis (TT) will be developed to train CTAs in rural Tanzania
      to identify cases in their communities and refer them to surgery. Compared to the current
      process by which CTAs passively screen for TT if cases complain, investigators hypothesize
      that the trained CTAs will identify twice the usual number of TT surgery cases during
      ongoing community antibiotic administrations for trachoma and will also miss fewer cases. If
      this simple system is effective, it can be implemented widely to screen communities for
      cases of TT.

      Thirty-six villages, for which a complete census is available, will be randomized on a 1:1
      basis to intervention (where the CTAs receive the enhanced training from the enhanced
      training team) and usual assessment (where the CTAs receive the usual instructions from the
      regular MDA team). In both sets of villages the CTAs will keep records of all cases they
      have screened as positive for TT.

      A Master TT grader will grade all screened cases of TT to determine the rate of true
      positivity. In addition, he will examine a random sample of residents who are screened as
      negative to detect potentially missed cases and estimate the total burden of trichiasis
      cases.  The assessments of the Master TT grader will serve as the gold standard for
      calculations of sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of the
      enhanced training versus usual assessment methods.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All persons in the study and control communities are eligible for the MDA.

          -  Adults aged 15 and over will be eligible for the survey and re-assessment.

          -  Those who are screened positive in the re-assessment will be eligible for treatment
             at the surgery camp.

          -  Those who are screened positive for TT initially but refuse the definitive
             re-screening will still be offered surgery but told they may not have TT and will be
             re-screened by the surgeon.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  none
