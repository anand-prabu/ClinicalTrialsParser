A solid cancer is a cancer\n      that does not involve the blood, bone marrow or lymph nodes. Dose escalation determines the\n      least toxic and most effect dose of this drug combination for treatment. Once this dose is\n      established, it will be used for the dose expansion phase of the study where we will\n      determine the effect of BKM120 and Abraxane in women diagnosed with a recurrent endometrial\n      or ovarian cancer. We will see whether the combination of both drugs improves the response\n      and survival of patients treated on the two drug regimen. Also we will try to find out\n      whether there are changes in tumors that can help us determine what patients are more likely\n      to respond to BKM120 and Abraxane."

Sterilization:  have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without\n                       hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks ago.
