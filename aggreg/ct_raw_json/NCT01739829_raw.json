            "textblock": "Intraperitoneal islet transplantation has the potential to ameliorate type 1 diabetes\n      mellitus and avert the long-term consequences of chronic diabetes which cannot be achieved\n      by conventional insulin treatment.\n\n      As donor human islets are not available in sufficient numbers, porcine islets are the best\n      alternative source as they are recognised as the most physiologically compatible xenogeneic\n      insulin-producing cells. Although the use of pig-derived cells raises the risk of xenotic\n      infections, this can be minimised by obtaining cells from designated pathogen-free (DPF)\n      animals bred in isolation and monitored to be free of specified pathogens. The worldwide\n      experience to date in more than 200 patients who have received transplants of pig tissue has\n      not demonstrated evidence of transmitted xenotic infections.\n\n      As animal-derived tissues have to be protected from immune rejection when transplanted into\n      humans, transplants are usually accompanied by immunosuppressive therapy. However, porcine\n      islets are preferably transplanted without the use of immunosuppressive drugs which cause\n      significant morbidity. To protect them from immune rejection, the islets can be encapsulated\n      in alginate microcapsules which permit the inward passage of nutrients and glucose and the\n      outward passage of insulin. Alginate-encapsulated porcine islets transplanted without\n      immunosuppressive drugs have survived rejection for many months in animal studies, and have\n      been retrieved from a diabetic patient over 9.5 years after intraperitoneal transplantation\n      and shown to contain viable islets that stain positive for insulin.\n\n      DIABECELL\u00ae comprises neonatal porcine islets encapsulated in alginate microcapsules.\n      DIABECELL\u00ae has been safely transplanted in healthy and diabetic mice, rats, rabbits, dogs\n      and non-human primates. Following DIABECELL\u00ae transplants, the requirement for daily insulin\n      was significantly reduced in diabetic rats and non-human primates.\n\n      The optimal dose and frequency of transplantation of the current DIABECELL\u00ae preparation for\n      the treatment of type 1 diabetes in humans can only be determined in clinical trials. The\n      intention of this phase I/IIa clinical trial is to obtain at least 52 weeks safety and\n      preliminary efficacy data in type 1 diabetic patients following transplantation of two low\n      effective doses of DIABECELL\u00ae into the peritoneal cavity."
