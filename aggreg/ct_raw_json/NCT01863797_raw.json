A transcervical catheter (BARD) was inserted if this procedure was possible 19 and if cervical dilatation permitted, amniotomy was performed. The physician in charge performed all assessments and procedures except amniotomy.\nWhen the participants reached the active phase they were monitored according to the clinical guidelines."
