This operation\n      effectively prevents gastroesophageal reflux but gives rise to postoperative symptoms\n      related to over-competence of the gastroesophageal junction. 40% of the operated patients\n      experience increased flatulence and 20% dysphagia. Anterior fundoplication is an alternative\n      technique where the distal esophagus is anchored to the crura of the hiatus esophagi and\n      only a part of the front wall of the esophagus is covered with fundus. An anterior\n      fundoplication is un attempt to create a more physiologic reflux control and less functional\n      problems postoperatively. The aim with this study is to compare the results postoperatively,\n      both short time and long time results."

Postoperatively, telephone interview is performed\n      weekly the first two months. One year and ten years postoperatively. The patients are\n      investigated with endoscopy, esophageal manometry, 24 hour pH-monitoring and symptom\n      evaluation."
