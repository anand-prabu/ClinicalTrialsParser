The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that FS Grifols is not inferior to\n      commercially-available oxidized cellulose pads (Surgicel\u00ae) in providing benefit in the time\n      to hemostasis (i.e, the stoppage of bleeding).  This study has a Preliminary Part (I) for\n      study teams to become familiar with the application of FS Grifols and a Primary Part (II) to\n      assess the safety and efficacy of FS Grifols.  In both parts of the study, patients will be\n      randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either FS Grifols or Surgicel."
