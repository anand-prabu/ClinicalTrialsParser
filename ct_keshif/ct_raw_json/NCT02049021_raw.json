            "textblock": "Introduction:  In spite of recent advances in schizophrenia treatment, 30% of patients still\n      do not respond properly to antipsychotic therapy. These patients are considered\n      treatment-resistant or refractory, and the best choice for them is clozapine. However, even\n      supported by the literature as the best known antipsychotic in terms of efficacy and rates\n      of response, a considerable number of patients will still not respond to this treatment,\n      remaining symptomatic and dysfunctional.  These patients are classified as super-refractory\n      (clozapine-resistent). In these cases, augmenting strategies are necessary, and some have\n      been in use: typical and atypical antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, antidepressants and\n      electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). Some studies have favored ECT, but no definitive conclusion\n      has been drawn.\n\n      Objective: Test the electroconvulsive therapy efficacy and safety as augmenting strategy to\n      clozapine-resistant patients, as compared to placebo (sham ECT).\n\n      Methods: This is a pilot double blind, placebo controlled and randomized study to assess\n      electroconvulsive therapy efficacy as augmenting strategy to clozapine in super-refractory\n      schizophrenia. The ECT treatment will be delivered with either a  MECTA SPECTRUM 5000Q or\n      4000Q device, and the procedure is under general anesthesia and monitorization, after\n      informed consent. The Hospital will follow national protocols and regulations on ECT. Sham\n      ECT consists in habitual patient preparation and sedation, without stimulation. Patients\n      that fit inclusion criteria will have their clozapine blood levels dosed and undergo\n      structured assessments at baseline, after 6 treatments and at the end of the cycle of 12 ECT\n      sessions (thrice a week protocol). The assessments will be based on CGI (Clinical Global\n      Impression) and PANSS (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale) scales. All medication will be\n      maintained, except lithium carbonate."
