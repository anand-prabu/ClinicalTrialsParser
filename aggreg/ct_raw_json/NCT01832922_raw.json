These agents are\n      FDA approved for this indication.

Both cohorts will follow a standard\n      3+3 Phase I design. Once the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined, two expansion\n      cohorts will be enrolled. Dose limiting toxicities (DLT) will be assessed during the 1st\n      cycle of treatment.\n\n      Patients with CLL who have significant comorbidities (CIRS\u22657; at least one category grade\n      3-4), with or without minor renal dysfunction (CrCL>40 mL/min) will be accrued onto Cohort 1\n      of the study. At dose level 1, patients will receive bendamustine 45 mg/m2 in combination\n      with rituximab (375 mg/m2 with cycle 1 and 500 mg/m2 with subsequent cycles). If safe, the\n      dose of bendamustine will be escalated to 70 mg/m2 (dose level 2). By contrast, dose\n      de-escalation to 25 mg/m2 (dose level -1) will occur in this cohort if DLT's are encountered\n      at dose level 1. Once an MTD is determined an expansion cohort will be accrued at that dose\n      level to allow assessment of DLT's during subsequent cycles.\n\n      Because bendamustine has not been formally studied in patients with renal failure and due to\n      the potential for increased frequency of toxic events in such patients, patients with\n      significant renal dysfunction (CrCL 15-40 mL/min, but not receiving dialysis) will be\n      accrued on Cohort 2. DLT's in 0/3 (or \u22641/6) subjects with renal dysfunction at dose level 1\n      (as above) will permit continued accrual of such subjects onto the expansion cohort (N=10).\n      If unacceptable toxicity is encountered, bendamustine dose will be reduced to 25 mg/m2 (dose\n      level -1), followed by an expansion cohort if safe (10 patients). Dose escalation will not\n      be allowed in this cohort.\n\n      Accrual of both patient cohorts will occur simultaneously (see Schema) and will take place\n      at two centers: the ambulatory Hematology Clinics at the Norris Cotton Cancer Center (NCCC)\n      at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center (DHMC), Lebanon, NH (Lead [Dartmouth] Principal\n      Investigator [Lead PI] - Alexey Danilov M.D., Ph.D.), and the CLL Center at Dana-Farber\n      Cancer Institute (DFCI), Boston, MA (DFCI Principal Investigator [DFCI PI] - Jennifer Brown\n      M.D., Ph.D.).
