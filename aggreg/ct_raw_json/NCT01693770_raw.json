            "description": "High intensity focused ultrasound energy, delivered under the guidance of the MR images (MgFUS) allows for a predefined amount of energy to be delivered in the desired target (Metastasis). Bone readily absorbs focused ultrasound energy resulting in a thermo-related neurolysis of the periostium with consequent pain palliation. The amount of energy delivered can be modulated with the objective to penetrate cortical space and obtain necrosis of the metastasis thus preventing local recurrence."

There is also evidence that a high\n      intensity focused ultrasound beam can penetrate through the cortical bone to the medullary\n      space, producing thermal necrosis of cancer tissue. However, little is known about the\n      potential effects of MRgFUS as first line therapeutic modality for pain palliation in\n      skeletal metastases.\n\n      Our hypothesis sought to assess the clinical performance of MRgFUS primary treatment of\n      painful bone metastases and determine the potential of this technique for local tumor\n      control."
