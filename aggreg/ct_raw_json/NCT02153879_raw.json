An impaired function of the adipose tissue (AT) in T2D contributes to low HDL\n      concentrations.\n\n      Objectives: 1) Quantitative and qualitative characterisation of HDL subclasses by\n      ultracentrifugation, proteomic and metabolomic techniques. 2) To study the relationship\n      between the HDL subclasses, pre\u03b21 HDL and remnant HDL, and clinical determinants of\n      arteriosclerosis. 3) Functional in vitro studies of the HDL subclasses determined in\n      Objective 1. 4) To study the role of AT determining the low HDL levels. 5) To study the\n      impact of HDL increasing drugs on HDL qualitative changes."

HDL studies examining HDL proteomic and\n      metabolomic profiles will be performed.
