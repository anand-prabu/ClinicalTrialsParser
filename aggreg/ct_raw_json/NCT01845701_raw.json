A number of Chinese research groups documented that it was at least as effective as, and better tolerated than, chloroquine against falciparum and vivax malaria. With the development of piperaquine-resistant strains of P. falciparum and the emergence of the artemisinin derivatives, its use declined during the 1980s. However, during the next decade, piperaquine was rediscovered by Chinese scientists as one of a number of compounds suitable for combination with an artemisinin derivative.",

However, recrudescence is common with artemether and lumefantrine has a slow onset of action. A fixed combination tablet (20 mg artemether/120 mg lumefantrine) has therefore been developed.
