Participants will be\n      recruited from an academic course (N424 Integrated Practicum).  Participants will be\n      randomized to three intervention groups (i.e. expert modeling video, voice over PowerPoint,\n      and traditional readings). All participants will complete self-efficacy surveys and two\n      simulations.  During simulation, participants will be scored based on their competence\n      according to a performance rubric.    The hypothesis is that participants in the expert\n      modeling group will demonstrate more change in competence and report more change in\n      self-efficacy scores than participants in other groups."

Participants rate their self-efficacy on a 1 to 5 (not confident to very\n      confident scale).  The survey takes 5 minutes to complete.  The self-efficacy survey has\n      been used in many simulation research studies previously with novice nurses.
