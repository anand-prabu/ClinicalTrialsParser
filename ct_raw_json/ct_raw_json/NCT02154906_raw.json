            "textblock": "This entire protocol involves procedures that are standard care. The purpose of the research\n      is to evaluate whether there are any differences in results of periodontal surgical\n      treatment using PRF in intrabony defects versus using DFDBA in intrabony defects. The DFDBA\n      used in this study is an approved product and will be used in an approved manner.  The PRF\n      used in this study is an autologous product derived from the patient's own blood and is also\n      being used in an approved manner during this study.\n\n      The primary outcomes evaluated in this study will include the soft tissue parameter of gain\n      in clinical attachment level (CAL) and the hard tissue parameter of bone fill (BF).\n      Secondary outcomes evaluated will include the soft tissue parameters of probing depth (PD)\n      reduction and change in gingival recession (GR).  These parameters will be evaluated over a\n      6-month period following intraoperative application of the material in advanced periodontal\n      defects in 44 subjects (22 subjects per group with expected completion of 15 subjects per\n      group). Six months after surgery, final post-operative clinical and radiographic\n      measurements will be made.\n\n      Each subject will randomly be assigned (1:1) to receive either flap surgery with autologous\n      platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) placed into the intrabony defect (test) or flap surgery with\n      demineralized freeze-dried bone allograft (DFDBA) placed into the intrabony defect\n      (control). Subjects will be randomized by drawing a sealed envelope from a stack of\n      envelopes, each of which will contain a slip of paper on which is written PRF or DFDBA. The\n      number of envelopes per group will equal the total number of subjects to be enrolled per\n      group.  Because collection and processing of PRF requires specific equipment, subjects will\n      be randomized just prior to the surgical procedure being performed (before delivery of local\n      anesthesia) rather than after flap reflection and debridement.\n\n      Each subject will contribute only 1 study site. If a subject has more than one interproximal\n      bony defect in the area being treated surgically, only 1 such site will be chosen as the\n      study site.  The site with the deepest CEJ-BD measurement will be chosen.  All other\n      nonstudy sites in the surgical area will be treated with the same material as the adjacent\n      study site (PRF or DFDBA). Clinical measurements at the time of surgery and at the 6-month\n      follow-up will be made by one of two examiners who are masked as to study group. The same\n      clinical examiner who makes measurements at the time of surgery will also make measurements\n      at the 6-month follow-up.\n\n      Patients will be given post-operative antibiotics for 7 days after surgery as part of\n      standard care (amoxicillin 500mg three times a day for 7 days; if allergic to amoxicillin,\n      patients will receive doxycycline 100mg twice a day for 7 days). Subjects will be seen 10-14\n      days after surgery for routine follow-up procedures including removal of sutures and removal\n      of visible plaque.  Subjects will be followed again for routine postoperative procedures at\n      1 month, 2 months, and 4 months after surgery. The final postoperative visit will take place\n      at 6 months post-surgery and will include final radiographic and clinical assessments of the\n      study site. The study is over after this 6-month follow-up visit.\n\n      Routine radiographs will be made as standard care procedures pre-operatively and at the\n      6-month follow-up time point. Radiographs will be standardized using Rinn XCP holders with\n      customized bite registrations, and a 1mm radiopaque square grid (Fixott-Everett grid) will\n      be placed over digital sensor plates to allow ease of linear measurement on the digital\n      radiographic images. Radiographic measurements will be made by a masked examiner.  Hard\n      tissue measurements made from the radiographs at baseline and 6-month follow-up will include\n      CEJ to base of bony defect (CEJ-BD).Measurements will be made to the nearest 0.5mm.Bone fill\n      is the linear change (in mm) in CEJ-BD measurement between baseline examination and 6-month\n      follow-up.\n\n      Soft tissue measurements made at baseline and 6-month follow-up will include probing depth\n      (PD = gingival margin to base of soft tissue pocket), clinical attachment level (CAL = CEJ\n      to base of soft tissue pocket), and gingival recession (GR = CEJ to gingival margin) at each\n      defect site. North Carolina 15mm (UNC-15) periodontal probes will be used and measurements\n      will be rounded to the nearest 0.5mm.\n\n      Intraoperatively, the bony defect will be measured from CEJ-BD to the nearest 0.5mm. This\n      measurement will be made from both the facial and lingual aspect of the interproximal defect\n      (i.e., the depth of the interproximal bony defect will be measured from both the facial and\n      lingual aspect to its deepest depth).  In addition, the number of bony walls will be\n      characterized into one of 7 categories: 1) 1-wall, 2) 2-wall, 3) 3-wall, 4) combination\n      1,2-wall defect, 5) combination 1,3-wall defect, 6) combination 2,3-wall, or 7)\n      circumferential defects.  At 6-month follow-up, clinical evaluation of bone fill will be\n      made using transgingival probing in the periodontal pocket from the CEJ to the bony crest.\n      This measurement will also be made from both the facial and lingual aspect of the\n      interproximal defect.  This standard care procedure is done using topical anesthetic.\n      Surgical re-entry will not be performed.\n\n      For final analysis, the defect will be characterized at the location having the deepest\n      CEJ-BD measurement at the time of surgery. For example, if treating a defect on the distal\n      aspect of tooth #19 in which the CEJ-BD measurement is 8.5mm from the facial aspect and\n      7.5mm from the lingual at the time of surgery, changes in soft tissue parameters (CAL, PD,\n      recession) and hard tissue parameters (bone fill) for that defect will be determined using\n      PD, CAL, recession and bone fill measurements taken from the facial aspect only (rather than\n      using the mean of facial and lingual measurements to characterize the defect)."
