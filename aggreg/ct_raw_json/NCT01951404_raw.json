            "textblock": "Kidney patients on dialysis commonly die because of heart disease.  One of the biggest\n      problems in their hearts is that the muscle wall of the heart thickens. This makes it less\n      efficient.  We found in patients with mild kidney disease that a drug normally used to treat\n      gout (allopurinol) had the remarkable side effect of being able to reduce this thickening of\n      their heart wall.  In this new study we aim to find out if this benefit of allopurinol also\n      occurs in severe kidney patients i.e. those on regular dialysis.  We also are trying to\n      figure out the best dose of allopurinol to use. To do this we are planning a study where we\n      will recruit patients with kidney disease who are on dialysis. The 1st phase of the trial\n      will be to determine the best dose of allopurinol to use and the second phase will be to do\n      a clinical trial where patients will be randomly allocated to either this optimum dose of\n      allopurinol or a dummy medication (placebo) and will receive one year of treatment. They\n      will have a special scan of the heart using an MRI machine to measure the extent of\n      thickening of their heart muscle before they start on treatment and will have a further MRI\n      scan when their one year treatment finishes.\n\n      Phase 1- the dose finding study, will involve 10 patients who will have between 3 and 7\n      visits to the hospital scheduled around 4 to 17 dialysis sessions. The later study will\n      involve up to 76 patients who will be asked to attend the hospital up to 8 times over a 13\n      month period."

            "textblock": "The Phase 1 dose escalation study is an open label study undertaken to see which dose of\n      active allopurinol reduces plasma urate by the same margin (41%) as seen in our previous\n      Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) stage 3 study where allopurinol did regress Left Ventricular\n      Hypertrophy (LVH).\n\n      Ten patients with CKD stage 5 will initially receive 100 mg allopurinol daily after each\n      dialysis session for a total of 3 dialysis sessions.  Plasma urate will be checked at the\n      commencement of the fourth dialysis session.  Thereafter the allopurinol dose will be\n      increased to 200mg and the same procedure repeated.  The next step will be 250mg and then\n      300mg and 350mg (max).\n\n      The dose escalation will stop in each patient when plasma urate has fallen by >50% in that\n      patient which is in keeping with published recommendations to ensure safe prescribing of\n      allopurinol in ESRD.\n\n      From these pilot data, we will calculate which of the above doses of allopurinol (given at\n      the end of each dialysis session) produces on average a 41% fall in plasma urate.  This will\n      be the chosen dose for the ALTERED trial.\n\n      There will be a pause between the two phases of the study to calculate the optimum dose and\n      prepare the investigational medicinal products required for the main phase 2 trial.\n\n      The ALTERED trial is a randomised, double blinded, placebo controlled multi-centre study\n      conducted in the National Health Service (NHS) Tayside & NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde to\n      compare allopurinol (dose to be confirmed from dose escalation study noted above) at either,\n      100mg, 200mg, 250mg, 300mg or 350mg to placebo.\n\n      Patients will be enrolled in this trial for a period of between 12 to 13 months.\n\n      At screening visit an initial history and clinical examination will be performed.\n      Participants will then undergo an echocardiogram unless they have had an echo in the\n      previous 2 years. Eligible participants will have to have echo defined left ventricular\n      hypertrophy (LVH) as per American Society of Echocardiography criteria of Left Ventricular\n      Mass (LVM) \u2265115g/m2 for men and >95g/m2 for women.\n\n      Should the participant have echo defined LVH, they will return for a Cardiac Magnetic\n      Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan at a later date in the screening period, prior to their\n      baseline (Randomisation) visit.\n\n      They will also have bloods taken for safety analysis, have a 12 lead ECG done and have 24\n      hour BP monitoring and vital signs recorded.\n\n      Once the patient is known to be eligible they will return - for the first randomisation,\n      dosing visit at any time up to four weeks after screening. At this randomisation visit post\n      dialysis session, eligible participants will be randomly assigned to either placebo or\n      allopurinol 100mg.\n\n      They will continue on allopurinol/placebo 100mg for 2 weeks, with dosing after each dialysis\n      session only. They can have Flow Mediated Dilatation (FMD), Pulse Wave Velocities (PWV) and\n      Pulse Wave Augmentation (PWA) measurements taken. All participants will be offered the\n      opportunity to opt in or out of the FMD, PWV and PWA measurements which are secondary\n      outcome measures only.\n\n      If study drugs are tolerated, the dose would be increased at weekly intervals after the\n      200mg dose to the allopurinol dose chosen by the dose escalation study, if greater than\n      200mg. Baseline blood samples will be taken for full blood count, renal function, liver\n      function, random blood glucose, haemoglobin A1C, lipids, calcium and phosphate, and these\n      will be repeated at 6, 9 and 12 months, bar lipids which are tested at baseline and final\n      visit only. However, urate levels will be stored and measured at the end of the study in\n      order to ensure blinding throughout.  Subjects will be followed at baseline, week 2, week 6,\n      month 6, month 9 and 12 with close monitoring of their full blood count and renal function.\n      Research bloods for BNP measurement and inflammatory markers will be taken at baseline, and\n      at months 6, 9 and the final 12 month study visit. Office BP will be measured thrice at each\n      visit and the average of the second and third reading will be recorded.  Furthermore pre and\n      post dialysis.  BP is recorded as part of standard care and will be available for analysis.\n      24 hour BP will also be measured at baseline and at 12 months.\n\n      Patients will continue with all their usual medication, which will remain unchanged\n      throughout unless clinically indicated.\n\n      CMRI Methods The MRIs will always be done on a post-dialysis day.  Baseline and repeat CMR\n      examinations in screening (between 1-4 weeks before randomisation) and after the final 12\n      month (+/- 2 weeks) visit will be performed on similar 3T Magnetom scanners (Siemens,\n      Erlangen, Germany) using dedicated phase array cardiac and phosphorous spectroscopy coils.\n      Serial contiguous short-axis cines will be acquired from the vertical long axis and\n      horizontal long axis of the left ventricle (electrocardiogram gated, steady-state free\n      precession imaging [true fast imaging with steady-state precession], with the short axis\n      imaging parameters being a repetition time of 2.5ms, echo time of 1.1ms, flip angle of 60\u00b0,\n      and slice thickness 6mm).  Analysis will be performed offline (Argus Software, Siemens) by a\n      single blinded observer for the assessment of ventricular volumes (End Diastolic  Volume\n      (EDV), End Systolic Volume (ESV), stroke volume), Ejection Fraction, and left ventricular\n      mass.  This single observer will analyse scans from both sites.   The reproducibility of the\n      left ventricular mass assessment using MRI will be derived for this observer.  A test-retest\n      intraobserver coefficient of variation of 2.0% is usual in our past MRI studies.  We will\n      also assess reproducibility between each site, although the same observer will assess all\n      scans at both sites.  We will take the opportunity to measure two other MRI parameters of\n      interest which are easily obtained with little extra scan time: Phosphorous -31 MR\n      spectroscopy and aortic compliance by methods already published by us.[29, 30]   Both will\n      give significant added value.\n\n      MR spectroscopy will see whether allopurinol increases high energy phosphates in ESRD\n      (measured by PCr:ATP) which it is likely to do since it is known to increase ATP levels in\n      vitro and it is now known to improve cardiac energetics (MRI measured) in human heart\n      failure.[31, 32]  We will measure high energy phosphates (HEP), comparing Phosphocreatine :\n      Beta adenosine triphosphate (PCr:ATP) ratio from the long axis views of the left\n      ventricle.[29]  In addition we will use MRI to assess aortic vascular compliance and pulse\n      wave velocity [30] using cine transverse thoracic aortic gated steady state free precession\n      acquisitions which will complement well the other peripheral vascular measures of\n      endothelial/vascular function being assessed (see below).\n\n      Flow Mediated Dilatation (FMD) FMD will be offered to all participants in the main trial,\n      but may be declined without affecting their participation in the main trial.\n\n      FMD on the brachial artery will be performed in the non-fistula arm on three visits\n      (baseline, month 9 and month 12) using a Philips iE33 ultrasound machine (Phillips Medical\n      Systems, United Kingdom) according to the guide-lines set by the International Brachial\n      Artery Reactivity Task Force.[33]   The brachial artery will be longitudinally imaged above\n      the elbow using an 11.3-MHz probe.  The image will be recorded for 2 minutes, followed by\n      induction of forearm ischaemia by inflating a cuff below the elbow to 200 mmHg (or 50 mmHg\n      above SBP, whichever is higher) for 5 minutes and deflating rapidly.  The resulting reactive\n      hyperaemia will be recorded for a further 2 minutes.  After a rest period of 10 minutes, the\n      procedure will be repeated, with 0.4mg of glyceryl trinitrate being administered\n      sublingually to determine endothelium-independent dilation.  FMD will be expressed as per\n      cent change in diameter relative to the baseline diameter at rest.  Analysis of all FMDs\n      will be performed on the Brachial Analyser version 5.0 software (Medical Imaging\n      Applications, LLC) by a single trained investigator (the clinical research fellow) to avoid\n      inter-observer variability.  This investigator will be blind to allocated treatments.  Our\n      intra-observer coefficient of variation for FMD is usually 5.2%.   Two factors should ensure\n      reliable results despite there being two sites : each patient will always be studied on the\n      same equipment and the same individual (the research fellow) will do all the tests and\n      interpret them (blindly) at both sites.  For further reassurance, blinded ultrasound scans\n      will be re-analysed to ensure good reproducibility at each site and between sites.\n\n      Applanation Tonometry PWA will be offered to all participants in the main trial, but may be\n      declined without affecting their participation in the main trial.\n\n      Pulse wave analysis (PWA) and PWV will be determined in the non-fistula arm by recording the\n      radial waveforms and radial-carotid waveforms, respectively, at three visits (baseline,\n      month 9 and month 12) using the Sphygmocor system.  The central AIx will be corrected to a\n      heart rate of 75 beats/min.  A single trained investigator (the clinical research fellow)\n      who is blind to the allocated treatment will perform the PWA and PWV at both sites.  We will\n      also use bio-impedance at the same time to measure total body water in MRIs done at Glasgow\n      sites.[21]  . This will complement the end diastolic volume data from the MRI at both sites.\n       In our index study, EDV fell but we did not know if this was due to afterload reduction or\n      to a global fall in body water.[21]   Bio-impedance will help determine this.\n\n      Research Blood tests Research bloods will be taken at baseline and at the end of treatment\n      phase for BNP and inflammatory markers.\n\n      Adverse events Adverse events will be sought by symptom enquiry at each visit and by\n      monitoring of routine blood samples."
