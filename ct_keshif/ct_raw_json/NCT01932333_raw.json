This study consists of 3 phases: screening phase, treatment phase, and follow-up\n      phase. This study will be conducted in 2 cohorts (groups) (Cohort 1: JNJ-40411813 50 mg and\n      Cohort 2: JNJ-40411813 100 mg) and each cohort consists of 2 periods (Period 1: single dose\n      and Period 2: multiple doses). Approximately 36 participants will be enrolled in this study\n      (18 participants will be enrolled in each cohort) to receive JNJ-40411813 or placebo in 2:1\n      ratio. If safety/tolerability and pharmacokinetic results profile is favorable for single\n      dose of JNJ-40411813, multiple dose administration will follow. Safety will be evaluated by\n      the assessment of adverse events, vital signs, schellong test (a test for circulatory\n      function), 12-lead electrocardiogram, physical examination, neurological examination (to\n      measure mental status, motor examination, reflexes, sensory, gait and cranial nerves),\n      vertigo (giddiness) symptom, and clinical laboratory tests which will be monitored\n      throughout the study. The total duration of study participation for a participant will be 9\n      weeks."
