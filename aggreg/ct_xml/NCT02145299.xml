  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, single-blind study enrolling up to 75
      subjects at up to 5 sites in the US. Eligible subjects with symptomatic femoro-popliteal CTO
      will be randomized 2:1 to treatment with the TruePath™ CTO Device (Intervention) or the
      CROSSER™ CTO device (Control). All patients will receive standard anticoagulation per
      hospital protocol and antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel.

    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to compare the technical success and in-hospital
      safety of TruePath device with that of the CROSSER device in patients with symptomatic
      femoro-popliteal CTO. Subjects will be followed clinically while in the hospital and at 1
      month following the index procedure. All subjects will undergo procedural intravascular
      ultrasound (IVUS) imaging. The study population will consist of up to 75 patients with
      symptomatic femoro-popliteal CTO and indications for revascularization. Subjects must have a
      previously documented conventional percutaneous procedure or a concurrent failed attempt to
      cross the CTO using conventional guidewire techniques. All subjects must meet all inclusion
      and no exclusion criteria and sign an Informed Consent Form approved by the local
      Institutional Review Board (IRB) prior to enrollment and randomization.

    <description>The TruePath™ CTO Device (Boston Scientific Corporation, Natick, MA) is a new solution for intraluminal treatment of chronic total occlusions (CTO). It is the longest available crossing device (165 cm), and has a diamond-coated distal tip that can rotate at 13,000 rpm. Its profile is similar to a 0.018&quot; guidewire, and includes a shapeable distal tip allowing 1:1 torque response. In addition, it provides audio and visual navigation during CTO crossing.</description>

    <description>The CrosserTM CTO Recanalization Catheter (&quot;Crosser system&quot;) (Bard Peripheral Vascular Inc. Tempe, AZ, USA), which serves as a control in this investigation, gained U.S. FDA approval for peripheral indications in 2011. The device is similar in both design and indications to the TruePath device, with the exception that the Crosser system uses vibrational angioplasty to achieve CTO crossing.</description>

    <description>The TruePath CTO Device is composed of a 0.018&quot; guidewire and a motor housing with a connector cable along with a sterile, disposable battery-powered Control Unit for manipulation of the device during operation. The TruePath CTO Device is indicated to facilitate the intra-luminal placement of conventional guidewires beyond peripheral artery chronic total occlusions.</description>
