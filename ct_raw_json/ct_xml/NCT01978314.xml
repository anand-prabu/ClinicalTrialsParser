      This is a single site study designed to evaluate the FAST mGFR Test™ in healthy adult
      volunteers, patients with varying degrees of chronic kidney disease (CKD), and patients with
      acute kidney injury (AKI).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A rapid and accurate measurement of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is important in acute
      kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) for assessment of impairment,
      diagnosis, and prompt treatment. FAST BioMedical is an emerging technology company whose
      mission is to quantify clinically meaning ful physiological parameters that have been
      difficult or impossible to measure.  GFR is the most clinically relevant metric for
      understanding renal function, as it is the rate by which the kidney is able to filter waste
      products in the bloodstream.  The FAST mGFR is for direct measurement of GFR that relies on
      reading the ratio of fluorescent markers attached to different size dextran molecules
      introduced into the bloodstream.  The test is intended as an adjunct to current methods
      utilized to assess kidney function.
