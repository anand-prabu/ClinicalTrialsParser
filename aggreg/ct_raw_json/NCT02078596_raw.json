They\n      were in special education programs and not responding to psychostimulants.\n\n      The investigators systematically collected data on these children using the same screening\n      criteria as in our studies of adolescents. Since Depakote has been used to treat seizures in\n      children for more than twenty years, a great deal was known about its safety profile in the\n      pediatric population. The investigators treated 7 children, age 7-12, whose recurrent temper\n      outbursts and chronic mood lability did not respond to individual/family therapy. After\n      parents signed informed consent and children gave assent, these subjects would receive open\n      label Depakote in doses sufficient to reach a blood level between 50-100 micrograms/ml for\n      six weeks. The family received supportive therapy."

An addition in this protocol is to see if this hypothesis holds under\n      double blind placebo controlled conditions.\n\n      The  investigators have now completed open treatment with six children and have found that\n      the same criteria that selected a treatment responsive group of adolescents and adults also\n      worked for five of these six children. The investigators now propose to test these findings\n      under double blind conditions. There is no change in the overall safety profile of the\n      treatment.  The only change is the addition of a placebo phase. All children will receive\n      active treatment at some point.\n\n      In addition, the investigators hypothesize that the clinical syndrome of temper and\n      irritability will tend to resolve with development and that families will not exhibit\n      bipolarity in first degree relatives but will exhibit temper outbursts.

Of these, only the\n      latter has a specific pharmacologic treatment. The other two reliably describe problem\n      behaviors of special education classes, chemical dependency units and family courts but have\n      few treatment implications. In a previous communications, the investigators described\n      adolescent subjects with temper outburst and severe mood swings. The investigators labeled\n      the syndrome Explosive Mood Disorder (EMD) and drafted tentative criteria for temper\n      outburst and irritable mood swings (see Inclusion Criteria for EMD). The goal of this study\n      is to demonstrate that Depakote can help a certain type of problem child, one whose\n      disruptiveness is associated with mood dysregulation.\n\n      The investigators hypothesized the subjects' mood dysregulation and aggressive disinhibition\n      to be \"limbic\" pathology. The limbic system is heavily implicated in behavior and emotion,\n      and work by previous investigators suggested episodic dyscontrol can result from limbic\n      irritability. Since carbamazapine and valproic acid are used in limbic seizures and bipolar\n      spectrum disorders, the investigators predicted subjects would improve on divalproex sodium\n      (Depakote), the enteric coated form of valproic acid. The investigators treated thirteen\n      patients meeting the above criteria criteria with open label divalproex sodium. In all\n      cases, there were strikingly beneficial results, including a sharp decline in the frequency\n      and severity of temper outbursts and the severity of mood swings.\n\n      The typical patient would progress from irritation to screaming, door-slamming, property\n      destruction or fighting explosively, i.e., without intermediate steps. When not exploding,\n      the patient's affect and frustration tolerance would fluctuate throughout the day. The mood\n      could be irritable, normal or silly but always unpredictable. The patients had chronic\n      interpersonal difficulties, especially with authority figures, thus serious problems with\n      family, school and work were common. They tended to end up with deviant peers, since others\n      could not tolerate the unpredictable interactions. Though some of patients met criteria for\n      Conduct or Oppositional Defiant Disorder, these diagnoses were too heterogeneous to describe\n      the Depakote responders. Cyclothymia and Bipolar II Disorder did not capture the chronic,\n      maladaptive interactions with peers and authority figures. Intermittent Explosive Disorder\n      missed the above plus the connection to mood dysregulation. Borderline Personality implied a\n      specific type of interpersonal pathology (idealization, devaluation, manipulation) that was\n      not necessarily present.\n\n      The closest match the investigators found in the literature to our patients was \"Emotionally\n      Unstable Character Disorder\" (EUCD). This diagnosis described young adults with extreme\n      irritability, mood swings, chronic maladaptive behaviors, and a clear response to a mood\n      stabilizing agent (lithium carbonate). However, even this diagnosis does not capture the\n      explosiveness which is prominent in the sample of Depakote responders. The investigators\n      therefore decided to use the term Explosive Mood Disorder (EMD) to capture the temper\n      outbursts and the mood lability.\n\n      Campbell reported hospitalized conduct disordered children with affective (as opposed to\n      predatory) aggression improvement on lithium and Findling reported similar findings in\n      similar outpatients treated with risperidone. The key feature of irritable mood swings is\n      not directly addressed in these studies. In addition, other studies of childhood aggression\n      in Autism, Tourette Syndrome, Bipolar Disorder and mental deficiency suggest a role for\n      risperidone. Nonetheless, it is still not clear what alternative pharmacological treatments\n      for temper driven by irritable mood swings are available.\n\n      The investigators treated ten subjects who met screening criteria for EMD with open label\n      Depakote 1000mgs. Baseline evaluation included a full medical and psychiatric interview, the\n      Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Psychiatry-III-R and\n      a record of the total number of explosions during the previous week and thirty days. The\n      latter estimate was obtained from as many sources as possible. At minimum, the patient and\n      one parent had to each give an estimate. As many other sources as possible were also asked\n      to estimate the lability of the patient's mood during the previous week and thirty days.\n      Each week the same information would be obtained about the previous week and a global\n      assessment made as to whether the patient was unimproved, minimally improved, much improved\n      or very much improved.\n\n      Twelve adolescents agreed to participate, and two dropped out before receiving an adequate\n      trial. The other ten adolescents showed clear improvement in mood and number of explosions,\n      with the latter typically declining by 90-100%. All ten adolescent patients were judged at\n      least much improved by the psychiatrist, parents and patient. These results were later\n      replicated under double-blind, placebo controlled conditions.\n\n      Teachers and parents approached the investigators with children under the age of 13 and\n      asked us to treat them.  The investigators obtained permission to collect open label data on\n      those youngsters. The completion of open-label data has led to the current study."
