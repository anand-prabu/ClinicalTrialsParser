  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Difficult tracheal intubation is a cause of severe patient damage and death. There is not a
      good method to predict it. The McGrath Series 5 video laryngoscope can improve visualization
      of the glottic structures one to two grades. Moreover unlike a classical laryngoscope with a
      Macintosh blade, the McGrath provides a view of the glottis without requiring alignment of
      the oral, pharyngeal and laryngeal axes. In this study, the investigators will use it to
      compare the Cormack-Lehane score in sedation and anesthesia condition. It helps to know the
      role of videolaryngoscope in predicting difficult intubation.

      -  The enrolled patients were given a bolus of sufentanil 0.3-0.5Î¼g/kg to achieve Ramsay
           sedation score 2-3. The Cormack-Lehane score in sedation was evaluated by McGrath
           videolaryngoscope.

        -  Then the patients were induced with propofol. A bolus of rocuronium was given to
           facilitate intubation. The Cormack-Lehane score in anesthesia was recorded when
           intubated by McGrath videolaryngoscope.

        -  BMI, mouth opening, thyromental distance, intubation duration and ramsay sedation score
           were also recorded.
