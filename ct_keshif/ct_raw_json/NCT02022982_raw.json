To\n      determine the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), a 3+3 dose\n      escalation protocol will be undertaken.  Once the RP2D has been determined, the study will\n      then evaluate, in a randomized phase II study design, the combination of palbociclib and\n      PD-0325901 compared to PD-0325901 alone and palbociclib alone in KRAS mutant NSCLC.\n\n        -  Phase 1: The investigators are looking for the highest dose of the study drug that can\n           be administered safely without severe or unmanageable side effects in participants that\n           have cancer, not everyone who participates in this research study will receive the same\n           dose of the study drug.  The dose the participant receives will depend on the number of\n           participants who have been enrolled in the study before and how well the dose has been\n           tolerated.\n\n        -  Study Drug(s): The participant will be given a study drug-dosing calendar for each\n           treatment cycle.  Each treatment cycle lasts 4 weeks during which time you will be\n           taking the study drug for 3 weeks at a time.  The participant will take Palbociclib by\n           mouth once a day, every day for 3 weeks.  The participant will take PD-0325901 by mouth\n           twice a day, every day for 3 weeks.\n\n        -  Clinical Exams:  During all cycles the participant will have a physical exam and will\n           be asked questions about general health and specific questions about any problems that\n           they might be having and any medications they may be taking.\n\n        -  Scans (or Imaging tests): The investigators will assess the participant's tumor by\n           either a CT scan or MRI\n\n        -  Blood Tests: These are special tests to check the amount of drug and the amount of\n           tumor DNA in the participant's blood at specific points in time.\n\n      Phase II Outcomes:\n\n        -  Determine the response rate, as determined by RECIST 1.1, of  the combination of\n           palbociclib and PD-0325901 to that of palbociclib or PD-0325901 as single agents in\n           patients with advanced KRAS mutant NSCLC\n\n        -  Further evaluate the safety, tolerability and side effect profile for the combination\n           of palbociclib and PD-0325901 Phase II Secondary Outcomes\n\n        -  Determine the rate of progression free survival \u2265 4 months and the median PFS for the\n           combination of palbociclib and PD-0325901 compared to palbociclib or PD-0325901 as\n           single agents in KRAS mutant NSCLC"

Because there is an unknown but\n             potential risk of adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the\n             mother with the study agents, breastfeeding should be discontinued.\n\n          -  For Part II only: Individuals with a history of a different malignancy are ineligible\n             except if they have been disease-free for at least 2 years and are deemed by the\n             investigator to be at low risk for recurrence.
