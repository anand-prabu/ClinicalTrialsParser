This will allow for an estimated attrition of 10% in\n      each group.\n\n      An intervention will consist of eight weekly interactive modules, for a total of 12 hours,\n      and based on modules from National Standards for Diabetes Self-Management Education, and the\n      National Diabetes Education Program.  Data will be collected at baseline, immediately\n      post-intervention, and at 3 and 6 month follow-up visits."
