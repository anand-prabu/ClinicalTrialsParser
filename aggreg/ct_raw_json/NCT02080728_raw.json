A multiperforated catheter\n      whose length corresponds to that of the incision is chosed. The catheter will deliver one of\n      two products chosen at random: either ropivacaine or placebo.\n\n      This study will evaluate postoperative pain during the first 24 hours thanks to a recognized\n      indicator the VAS (Visual Analogue pain Scale). The total consumption of analgesics will\n      also be recorded, starting with the titration of morphine in the post-op room, and then the\n      consumption of classical analgesics in the nephrology department. These will only be given\n      if the VAS score is equal to 4 or above.\n\n      This is a prospective, single-centre, controlled, double blind study of ropivaca\u00efne 0.2%\n      versus placebo in continuous TAP block during the first 24 hours after the operation in\n      patients undergoing kidney transplant surgery."
