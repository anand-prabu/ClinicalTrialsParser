Determine the maximum tolerated dose, toxicity, and efficacy of fludarabine\n      in patients with steroid resistant chronic graft versus host disease.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Phase I: Patients receive fludarabine IV over less\n      than 30 minutes for 1-3 days. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for up to 4 courses in the\n      absence of relapse of underlying disease, malignancy, graft rejection, or unacceptable\n      toxicity. Patients with progressive graft versus host disease after completion of 3 courses\n      are taken off study. Patients with complete response are taken off study. Patients with\n      partial response may continue treatment at the immediate prior dose level. Cohorts 3-6\n      patients receive escalating doses of fludarabine until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is\n      determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 3 of 6 patients\n      experience dose limiting toxicity. Phase II: Patients receive fludarabine at the MTD from\n      phase I of the study.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-27 patients will be accrued for this study."
