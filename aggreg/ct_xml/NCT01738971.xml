      Pharmacists do not provide immediate contraception to women after emergency contraception
      (EC); they can only give advice on local contraceptive services.

      We wish to establish the following  2 pharmacy- based interventions in NHS Lothian, designed
       to increase uptake of effective contraception as soon as possible, after  EC

        1. Pharmacists would provide one packet of progestogen-only pills, giving women one month
           to arrange an appointment with contraceptive services.

        2. Rapid access to a family planning clinic upon presentation of the empty  EC packet.
           Women would be seen as a 'walk-in' and contraception provided.

      If feasible, these interventions could reduce unintended pregnancies.

      Participating pharmacies will be randomised to provide one of the interventions, or standard
      care (verbal/written advice on local contraceptive services).

      Women requesting EC from study pharmacies will be recruited by the research nurse/doctor to
      participate in the study that will involve them consenting to  contact by telephone 6-8
      weeks after EC by the researcher, to evaluate the interventions in terms of :

      (i) determine women's experiences/ views of the interventions and control. (ii) determine if
      women have commenced effective contraception and if not , reasons why.

      A subset of 12 women will also be invited for in-depth interview to collect more detailed
      qualitative data on their EC experience.

      We also wish  to (iii) explore pharmacists views on the interventions

      Data from this pilot will enable us to determine whether a larger multisite study is
      feasible. The aims of a larger study being to   determine if either of the two interventions
      being tested result in an increased proportion of women using effective ongoing
      contraception compared to the control.

      We propose to test 2 pharmacy based interventions to increase uptake of effective
      contraception after EC:

        1. Pharmacists would provide one packet of progestogen-only pills to women, so that they
           would have 28 days to arrange an appointment with contraceptive services to get a
           supply of ongoing contraception.

        2. Rapid access to a family planning clinic upon presentation of their empty(used) packet
           of EC. Women would be seen as a 'walk-in' (without appointment) and ongoing
           contraception discussed and provided.

      These interventions would be compared with the status quo, i.e. pharmacists give verbal
      advice and written information on local contraceptive services where ongoing contraception
      can be accessed.

      The interventions that we are testing are low cost i.e one packet of progestogen-only pills
      (£3 for most costly brand) plus additional consultation time with the pharmacist (estimated
      20 mins@ £1 per minute), versus the staff consultation time in a family planning clinic. In
      the family planning clinic, women would be seen as a 'walk-in' and so this may not add
      costs, since staff are already present.These interventions could, if shown to be effective,
      offer huge costs savings to the NHS, by reducing the costs of unintended pregnancies
      (abortion, miscarriage, birth).
