  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary Aim: To test the efficacy of an elementary school-based, school nurse-led weight
      management program  to reduce excess weight gain among children, 8 to 12 years old who are
      overweight and at risk of overweight by increasing healthy dietary practices and physical
      activity levels and decreasing sedentary practices.

      Primary Hypothesis: Relative to the control condition, the children receiving the
      intervention will have a significantly lower body mass index (BMI), following implementation
      of the 9-month intervention, controlling for baseline values.

    <description>Body Mass Index (primary outcome) is the recommended method of assessing overweight among adults and children and will be calculated with the formula: weight (kg)/height (m) 2. To determine child BMI percentile, we will calculate age- and gender-adjusted BMI with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) growth charts (ANTHRO 1.01 software-CDC). The primary outcome measure will be change in BMI z-score.</description>
