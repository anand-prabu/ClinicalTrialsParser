      UCLA researchers looking for healthy individuals (aged 35-50) who have a home computer with
      internet access, are not pregnant, planning to become pregnant, or currently breastfeeding
      (if female), to participate in a study investigating whether real-world experiences alter
      the brain and body. This study takes place over an eight week period and involves providing
      the names of 8 close friends or family members, completing a neuroimaging session, providing
      blood and saliva (for genetic analysis), and a 6-week period in which participants login
      twice a week to complete online questionnaires. Compensation is up to $210 for those who
      complete all aspects of the study. Please email realworld.ucla@gmail.com for more
      information.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy adults between the ages of 35-50

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Following a structured telephone interview, prospective participants with the following
        conditions will not be able to participate:

          1. claustrophobia, left-handedness, or presence of metal in their body (for the
             neuroimaging procedures),

          2. possible presence of a depressive disorder, which may interfere with the gratitude
             intervention (assessed by the Patient Health Questionnaire; Spitzer et al., 1999),

          3. regular use of medications that may impact inflammatory processes (anti-inflammatory
             drugs, steroids, opioids),

          4. current smokers or excessive caffeine users (&gt; 600 mg/day) because of known effects
             on inflammation, and

          5. pregnancy (which would affect oxytocin gene expression).
