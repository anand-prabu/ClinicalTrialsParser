The previous\n      rTMS/CIT study evaluated the safety and efficacy of 5 treatments of 6-Hz primed\n      low-frequency rTMS applied to the non-stroke hemisphere combined with constraint induced\n      therapy (CIT) to promote recovery of the paretic hand in children and adolescents. CIT has\n      shown improved behavioral outcomes as well as cortical reorganization in representation of\n      the affected limb. The previous RCT was a rTMS-Sham/CIT study design (real rTMS n=10 and\n      sham rTMS n=9).\n\n      Our research question, 'What is the medical status and perception of previous participants\n      concerning their involvement in an intensive rTMS/CIT RCT specific to symptom monitoring,\n      the TMS experience, and their current functional status'."
