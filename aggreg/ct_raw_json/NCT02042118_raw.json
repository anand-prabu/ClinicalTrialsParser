            "textblock": "Background: Perinatal mortality in Eastern Uganda 2007/2008 was estimated to 41/1000\n      pregnancies. The rate of stillbirth was 19/1000. In the whole of Uganda in 2008, neonatal\n      deaths constituted 21% of an estimated 190,000 under five deaths, while HIV constituted only\n      5%. Implementing a Helping Babies Breathe (HBB) program in one centre in Tanzania resulted\n      in almost 40 % reduction of early neonatal mortality. Introducing a neonatal intervention\n      package even reduced the rate of stillbirths. Birth asphyxia (BA) accounted for 60% of early\n      neonatal deaths in Haydom Lutheran Hospital, Tanzania.\n\n      The need for resuscitation is greater in the neonate than in any other age group. Providing\n      effective positive pressure ventilation (PPV) is the single most important component of\n      successful neonatal resuscitation (5). Ventilation is frequently initiated with face-mask\n      ventilation (FMV) followed by endotracheal intubation (ETT) if depression continues. These\n      techniques may be difficult to perform resulting in prolonged resuscitation. The laryngeal\n      mask airway (LMA) may achieve initial ventilation and successful resuscitation faster than a\n      face-mask device or ETT. Various publications and a Cochrane review has shown LMA to be as\n      efficient as ETT. Important air leakage during FMV is an issue. LMA reduces the need for\n      ETT. The latest generation of LMA is made of a medical-grade gel-like elastomer designed to\n      provide an efficient seal to the larynx without an inflatable cuff. The risk for trauma is\n      minimised. Insertion is easy with a low risk of tissue compression or dislodgement. In a\n      study to evaluate educational intervention in the Democratic Republic of Congo, both\n      physicians and midwifes showed a good level of expertise in LMA insertion on mannequins.\n      Both groups almost unanimously manifested a high degree of approval of neonatal\n      resuscitation with LMA.\n\n      Objective: To compare the use of uncuffed LMA vs. FMV during neonatal resuscitation in\n      Mulago Hospital, Kampala, Uganda.\n\n      Study design, setting and population: A randomized clinical trial will be conducted in\n      Mulago hospital among asphyxiated neonates in the delivery unit. Approximately 33000 babies\n      are born in this hospital each year.\n\n      Prior to the intervention all staff in the labour ward performing resuscitation will receive\n      training according to the HBB curriculum with a special module for training on LMA\n      insertion.\n\n      A total of 50 neonates will be randomized into being resuscitated with FMV or LMA. A trained\n      midwife under supervision of a paediatrician/anaesthesiologist will initiate the\n      resuscitation. Data from the intervention will be recorded by a research assistant and by\n      video. Resuscitation lasting more than 150 seconds will be handed over to the supervising\n      physician. Resuscitation will be performed according to international guidelines.\n\n      Utility of study: Findings from this study will determine if uncuffed LMA can improve\n      outcome of asphyxiated newborn in a large delivery ward where resuscitation is performed by\n      midwifes. Data will also show us whether uncuffed LMA is superior to FMV after a training\n      course according to the 2010 Guidelines on Neonatal Resuscitation (AHA, European\n      Resuscitation Council [ERC], ILCOR). The Millennium Development Goals 4 (MDG-4) aims for the\n      reduction of child mortality by two thirds from 1990 to 2015. It is crucial to explore\n      alternative, cost-effective modalities that not only would reduce mortality, but also the\n      burden of neurological damage in survivors."
