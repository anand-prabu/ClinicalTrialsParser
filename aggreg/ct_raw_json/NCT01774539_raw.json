The\n      investigators aim to determine if diffusion MRI (an imaging method to analyze tissue\n      properties) can effectively pick up differences between a healthy growth plate and an\n      injured one. This would allow orthopaedics surgeons to predict which injuries are at a\n      higher risk of growth arrest, so earlier interventions can be done in the orthopaedic\n      clinic."
