  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      -  Patients with spinal cord injury (SCI) usually breathe without any mechanical
           assistance, but significant breathing problems occur often during sleep, either because
           the upper airway closes (obstructive sleep apnea; OSA), or because of
           weakness/paralysis of the breathing muscles.  These problems often go unrecognized, as
           SCI patients face logistical barriers that cause them to refuse appropriate testing in
           sleep laboratories.  We have devised a strategy for diagnosing sleep-disordered
           breathing in the patient's home, using placement of noninvasive devices that monitor
           breathing overnight.  This project is designed to test the feasibility and utility of
           this strategy.

        -  After collecting baseline data on symptoms and medical events for four months, the
           home-based studies are performed noninvasively with FDA-approved devices: a type III
           sleep system and a recording oxygen saturation/ transcutaneous carbon dioxide monitor.
           If these studies identify sleep-disordered breathing, noninvasive ventilatory support
           is prescribed according to standard clinical practice.  Over the following twelve
           months, the subjects monitor their symptoms daily, and answer quality-of-life
           questionnaires every three months. After 3, 6, and 12 months, blood tests are performed
           to measure blood sugar and cholesterol/lipids.  Data is downloaded from the ventilator
           device to monitor compliance and ventilator performance.  This study is designed to
           determine the prevalence of sleep-disordered breathing in SCI, the feasibility of
           home-based testing to establish the diagnosis, and the short term effects on symptoms,
           quality-of-life, and associated conditions (glucose intolerance, blood lipid
           disorders).

      Eligible subjects will sign informed consent, followed by:

      a 4 month period of maintaining a daily log of symptoms and medical events (such as
      hospitalization, starting antibiotics).

      An overnight sleep study will be performed in the subject's home Based on the results of the
      sleep study, noninvasive ventilation (BiPAP) will be prescribed, according to standard
      medical practice.  A clinical assessment, pulmonary function tests, and blood tests (blood
      glucose, hemoglobin A1C, and blood lipid profile) will be performed at the same time.

      Quality of life surveys will be performed at months 0, 3, 6, and 12. The daily symptom logs
      will be continued for 12 months. Data from the BiPAP units will be downloaded and repeat
      overnight monitoring to measure blood oxygen and carbon dioxide levels will be performed
      periodically for 12 months after BiPAP is started.

      Subjects without sleep-disordered breathing will have the same clinical assessments and
      blood tests as subjects for whom BiPAP has been described.

    <description>After enrollment, the subject completes symptom logs for four months to collect baseline data.  At that point, the home-based sleep study is performed, and the results determine whether the subject has sleep-disordered breathing.  The frequency of technical errors related to the testing will also be noted at that time.</description>
