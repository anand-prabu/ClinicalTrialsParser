            "textblock": "Acute aortic dissection (AAD) is an acute vascular lesions with high early misdiagnosis\n      rate(31.8%), and mortality rate was 38%. In recent years, the incidence is rising and\n      serious threat to human health. At present, the clinical diagnosis of AAD commonly used\n      imaging methods, including chest X-ray, B ultrasound, CT, MRI and aortic angiography. Chest\n      X-ray and two-dimensional ultrasound is limited in diagnosis of AAD, esophageal\n      ultrasonography can display the intimal, identify the true and false lumen, but greater\n      risk. CT, MRI and aortic angiography can be used as diagnosis method, but time-consuming,\n      expensive and requires handling patients in emergency situations, should not be used as the\n      preferred. Therefore, it is significance that biomarkers with high specificity and\n      sensitivity for clinical fast diagnosis of AAD.\n\n      Parts small sample tests found that single serum \u03b1-smooth muscle actin    (\u03b1-SMA), myosin\n      heavy chain(MHC) and human soluble elastin fragments (sELAF) levels in patients with AAD\n      were significantly higher than that of others (normal people, acute myocardial infarction\n      patients). But because of the small study sample, limited control risk factors and\n      incomplete comparison, their conclusions were questionable. In our previous studies also\n      found that serum \u03b1-SMA, MHC and sELAF levels and the pathogenesis of AAD and prognosis are\n      closely related. Therefore, on the basis, a prospective study is needed. We observe all the\n      three biomarkers in enrolled patients with acute chest pain in emergency department, levels\n      in healthy volunteers as the blank control. Then make definite diagnosis of the enrolled\n      patients, and further observe the biomarkers dynamic change in AAD. Lastly, evaluate the\n      early diagnostic value of combination serum \u03b1-SMA, MHC and sELAF level on patients with AAD."
