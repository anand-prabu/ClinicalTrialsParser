  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess the safety and tolerability, characterize the dose-limiting toxicities, and
      identify the maximum tolerated dose of BMS-986016 alone and in combination with Nivolumab in
      subjects with select advanced (metastatic and/or unresectable) solid tumors and to provide
      preliminary information on the clinical benefits of the combination.
