A\n      cross-sectional survey will be administered electronically to Emergency Medicine physicians\n      at the University of Utah Hospital and the Emergency Physician Integrated Care, LLC (EPIC)\n      who staff ten-community hospital Emergency Departments (ED) in order to investigate\n      physician knowledge and attitudes regarding cost and perceived patient compliance.  In\n      addition, a cross-sectional survey will be administered to a convenience sample of patients\n      presenting to the University of Utah Emergency Department to obtain information about their\n      cost knowledge and reported compliance.  All ED patients will complete a follow-up phone\n      survey to measure compliance with recommendations made during the ED visits.  Following\n      administration of the baseline survey physicians will be provided the prices of the test and\n      procedures and will be re-surveyed 30-days later as a post intervention test to measure\n      changes in knowledge and attitudes."
