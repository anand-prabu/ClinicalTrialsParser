Although typically only an information-gathering,\n      forensic-styled examination, the Compensation examination is a crucial point of entry to VA\n      care. Objectives are:\n\n        1. To finalize the procedures, manual, and training materials of SBIRT-PM. The goals of\n           this stage will be (1) optimizing SBIRT-PM's appeal to Veterans concerned about their\n           musculoskeletal conditions and their Compensation claims; and (2) finalizing the\n           counseling materials and procedures.\n\n        2. To conduct a randomized clinical trial comparing SBIRT-PM to a no referral arm and a\n           pain module only arm."

                "textblock": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  Veteran of OEF/OIF/OND\n\n          -  Scheduled exam for back, neck, knee, or shoulder. These four body parts were selected\n             because they are classified as MSD by the VBA and are common causes of chronic\n             non-cancer pain. Including other conditions (e.g. osteomyelitis, muscle injuries)\n             would introduce more heterogeneity in illness course.\n\n          -  Able to participate psychologically and physically, able to provide informed consent,\n             complete assessments, and participate in study procedures.\n\n          -  Self-reports peak pain of at least 2 on a numeric pain rating scale (0 \"no pain\" to\n             10 \"worst pain imaginable\" in the last 28 days in the joint that is the focus of the\n             claim. This broad pain inclusion criterion may be narrowed after the Counseling\n             Refinement Stage. Some Veterans apply for service connection for injuries that are\n             not currently symptomatic, in case the injury recurs. This criterion will exclude\n             these asymptomatic Veterans\n\n          -  Risky substance use within the last 28 days, defined as one of the following:\n\n               1. Risky alcohol use: i.e. >14 drinks/week or>4 drinks/occasion for men 65 or\n                  younger; >7 drinks/week or >3 drinks/occasion for women. A standard drink will\n                  be 14 grams of absolute alcohol, equivalent to 12 oz of beer, 5 oz of wine, or\n                  1.5 oz of 80-proof liquor\n\n               2. Self-reported use of an illicit drug in the preceding 28 days. Use of opioids or\n                  sedative hypnotics not prescribed to the Veteran will be considered illicit drug\n                  use.\n\n               3. Misuse of prescribed opioid medications in the preceding 28 days. Two questions\n                  adapted from the CIDI for use in a NIDA Clinical Trials Network study, were\n                  modified to describe misuse of prescribed opioid medications: \"How often have\n                  you taken your pain medications in larger amounts than prescribed or for a\n                  longer period than prescribed?\" and \"How often have you used your pain medicines\n                  to get high, to relax, or to make you feel more alert?\"\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  Will not be able to attend the follow-up appointments.\n\n          -  Attended VA or non-VA substance abuse treatment during the three months prior to\n             randomization. Veterans who are receiving mental health treatment but indicate it is\n             not addressing substance use will be enrolled.\n\n          -  Physiological dependence on alcohol, illicit drugs, or non-prescribed opioids. People\n             with more severe dependence have not benefited from SBIRT in prior studies."
