  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      TIPS has been used for 20 years, as a means of reducing portal pressure in patients with
      cirrhosis and portal hypertension related complications. TIPS proved more effective than
      alternative treatments in controlling or preventing variceal bleeding and refractory
      ascites. The main drawback of the TIPS procedure is progressive overt hepatic encephalopathy
      (OHE). Three risk factors for post-TIPS OHE have been identified: age over 65 years, history
      of previous episodes of OHE, and Child-Pugh score equal to or over 10. However, the
      incidence of post-TIPS OHE in patients fulfilling these criteria remains close to 35 %.

      TIPS has been used for 20 years, as a means of reducing portal pressure in patients with
      cirrhosis and portal hypertension related complications. TIPS proved more effective than
      alternative treatments in controlling or preventing variceal bleeding and refractory
      ascites. The main drawback of the TIPS procedure is progressive overt hepatic encephalopathy
      (OHE). Three risk factors for post-TIPS OHE have been identified: age over 65 years, history
      of previous episodes of OHE, and Child-Pugh score equal to or over 10. However, the
      incidence of post-TIPS OHE in patients fulfilling these criteria remains close to 35 %.
      Furthermore, the pathogenesis of HE in general but also in patients treated by TIPS is still
      not well understood. Therefore, there is a real challenge in discovering new molecular
      mechanisms involved in pathogenesis of OHE as well as new treatment to better prevent the
      risk of OHE in patients treated by TIPS. Observational and experimental studies suggest a
      microbiota's role in the mechanism of OHE and recently a non absorbable antibiotic has
      proven to reduce the risk of recurrence of OHE. However, the effect of this drug for the
      prevention of a first episode of OHE in patients treated by TIPS is not known. In addition,
      the mechanisms of the beneficial effect of rifaximin remain poorly understood.
