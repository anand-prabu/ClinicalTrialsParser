    <textblock>
      This study will test the hypothesis that a wearable bionic pancreas system that
      automatically delivers insulin and glucagon can provide superior regulation of glycemia vs.
      usual care for adults with type 1 diabetes.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age ≥18 years and have had clinical type 1 diabetes for at least one year

          -  Diabetes managed using an insulin pump for ≥ 6 months

          -  Prescription medication regimen stable for &gt; 1 month (except for medications that
             will not affect the safety of the study and are not expected to affect any outcome of
             the study, in the judgement of the site principal investigator).

          -  Employee or student working or studying during most of the week at one of the
             participating campuses

          -  Lives within a 30 minute drive-time radius of the central monitoring location for one
             of the study sites

          -  Willing to remain within a 60 minute drive-time radius of the central monitoring
             location for one of the study sites during each of the 11-day study arms

          -  Have someone over 18 years of age who lives with them, has access to where they
             sleep, is willing to be in the house when the subject is sleeping, and is willing to
             receive calls from the study staff and check the welfare of the study subject if
             telemetry shows a technical problem or severe biochemical hypoglycemia without
             subject response and the subject does not answer their telephone (up to two
             individuals can share this role, but they must be willing to carefully coordinate
             with each other and the subject so that one of them is clearly designated as having
             this responsibility at any given time)

          -  Willing to wear two infusion sets and CGM sensor and change sets frequently (at least
             one new glucagon infusion set daily)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Unable to provide informed consent (e.g. impaired cognition or judgment)

          -  Unable to safely comply with study procedures and reporting requirements (e.g.
             impairment of vision or dexterity that prevents safe operation of the bionic
             pancreas, impaired memory, unable to speak and read English)

          -  Current participation in another diabetes-related clinical trial that, in the
             judgment of the principal investigator, will compromise the results of this study or
             the safety of the subject

          -  Pregnancy (positive urine HCG), breast feeding, plan to become pregnant in the
             immediate future, or sexually active without use of contraception

          -  Need to go outside of the designated geographic boundaries during either arm of the
             study

          -  Current alcohol abuse (intake averaging &gt; 3 drinks daily in last 30 days), use of
             marijuana within 1 month of enrollment, or other substance abuse (use within the last
             6 months of controlled substances other than marijuana without a prescription)

          -  Unwilling or unable to refrain from drinking more than 2 drinks in an hour or more
             than 4 drinks in a day or use of marijuana during the trial

          -  Unwilling or unable or to avoid use of drugs that may dull the sensorium, reduce
             sensitivity to symptoms of hypoglycemia, or hinder decision making during the period
             of participation in the study (use of beta blockers will be allowed as long as the
             dose is stable and the subject does not meet the criteria for hypoglycemia
             unawareness while taking that stable dose, but use of benzodiazepines or narcotics,
             even if by prescription, may be excluded according to the judgment of the principal
             investigator)

          -  History of liver disease that is expected to interfere with the anti-hypoglycemia
             action of glucagon (e.g. liver failure or cirrhosis). Other liver disease (i.e.
             active hepatitis, steatosis, active biliary disease, any tumor of the liver,
             hemochromatosis, glycogen storage disease) may exclude the subject if it causes
             significant compromise to liver function or may do so in an unpredictable fashion.

          -  Renal failure on dialysis

          -  Personal history of cystic fibrosis, pancreatitis, pancreatic tumor, or any other
             pancreatic disease besides type 1 diabetes

          -  Any known history of coronary artery disease including, but not limited to, history
             of myocardial infarction, stress test showing ischemia, history of angina, or history
             of intervention such as coronary artery bypass grafting, percutaneous coronary
             intervention, or enzymatic lysis of a presumed coronary occlusion)

          -  Abnormal EKG consistent with coronary artery disease or increased risk of malignant
             arrhythmia including, but not limited to, evidence of active ischemia, prior
             myocardial infarction, proximal LAD critical stenosis (Wellen's sign), prolonged QT
             interval (&gt; 440 ms). Non-specific ST segment and T wave changes are not grounds for
             exclusion in the absence of symptoms or history of heart disease. A reassuring
             evaluation by a cardiologist after an abnormal EKG finding may allow participation.

          -  Congestive heart failure (established history of CHF, lower extremity edema,
             paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or orthopnea)

          -  History of TIA or stroke

          -  Seizure disorder, history of any non-hypoglycemic seizure within the last two years,
             or ongoing treatment with anticonvulsants

          -  History of hypoglycemic seizures or coma in the last year

          -  History of pheochromocytoma: fractionated metanephrines will be tested in patients
             with history increasing the risk for a catecholamine secreting tumor:

               -  episodic or treatment refractory (requiring 4 or more medications to achieve
                  normotension) hypertension

               -  paroxysms of tachycardia, pallor, or headache

               -  personal or family history of MEN 2A, MEN 2B, neurofibromatosis, or von
                  Hippel-Lindau disease

          -  History of adrenal disease or tumor

          -  Hypertension with systolic BP ≥160 mm Hg or diastolic BP ≥100 despite treatment

          -  Untreated or inadequately treated mental illness (indicators would include symptoms
             such as psychosis, hallucinations, mania, and any psychiatric hospitalization in the
             last year), or treatment with anti-psychotic medications that are known to affect
             glucose regulation.

          -  Electrically powered implants (e.g. cochlear implants, neurostimulators) that might
             be susceptible to RF interference

          -  Unable to completely avoid acetaminophen for duration of study

          -  History of adverse reaction to glucagon (including allergy) besides nausea and
             vomiting

          -  Established history of allergy or severe reaction to adhesive or tape that must be
             used in the study

          -  History of eating disorder such as anorexia, bulimia, or diabulemia or omission of
             insulin to manipulate weight

          -  History of intentional, inappropriate administration of insulin leading to severe
             hypoglycemia requiring treatment

          -  Use oral (e.g. thiazolidinediones, biguanides, sulfonylureas, glitinides, DPP-4
             inhibitors, SGLT-2 inhibitors) anti-diabetic medications

          -  Lives in or frequents areas with poor Verizon wireless network coverage (which would
             prevent remote monitoring)

          -  Any factors that, in the opinion of the site principal investigator or overall
