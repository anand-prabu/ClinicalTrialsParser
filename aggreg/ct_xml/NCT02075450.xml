  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our project aims to improve the delivery and assessment of cardiopulmonary resuscitation
      (CPR) during pediatric cardiac arrest by introducing 2 novel approaches: 1.  We will
      evaluate the effectiveness of a novel, credit card sized, and highly affordable &quot;nano-card&quot;
      CPR visual feedback device to improve compliance with HSFC CPR guidelines when used during
      simulated pediatric cardiac arrest; 2. We will also develop and study a novel,
      &quot;Just-in-Time&quot; (JIT) CPR training video, integrating proven educational methods (video-based
      lecture, expert modeling, practice-while-watching), and use the CPR visual feedback device
      to provide real-time coaching.

      We hypothesize that:

      H1: The use of a CPR visual feedback device will improve compliance with current HSFC CPR
      and resuscitation guidelines during a simulated pediatric in-hospital cardiac arrest
      scenario compared with standard CPR with no visual feedback.

      H2: A JIT CPR Training Video, viewed by healthcare providers 2-4 weeks prior to the
      resuscitation event, will improve compliance with current HSFC CPR and resuscitation
      guidelines during simulated pediatric cardiac arrest compared with those healthcare
      providers with no prior exposure to the JIT CPR Training Video.

      Aim 1 - To evaluate the effectiveness of a CPR visual feedback device to improve compliance
      with current Heart and Stork Foundation of Canada (HSFC) CPR and resuscitation guidelines
      during simulated pediatric cardiac arrest for a team of healthcare providers.

      Aim 2 - To evaluate the effectiveness of a &quot;Just in Time&quot; CPR Training Video to improve
      compliance with current HSFC CPR and resuscitation guidelines during simulated pediatric
      cardiac arrest for a team of healthcare providers.

      Aim 3 - To determine if there is a synergistic effect when adding Just in Time CPR Training
      Video with the use of the CPR visual feedback device to improve compliance with current HSFC
      CPR and resuscitation guidelines during a simulated pediatric cardiac arrest scenario.

      Participants will be recruited from ten pediatric tertiary care centers in Canada, the
      United States, and the United Kingdom using the methodology already piloted and studied in
      our existing EXPRESS investigators collaborative.  Participants recruited to participate in
      the study will be asked to perform as members of a pediatric resuscitation team.  Each team
      of healthcare providers will be randomized into one of four study arms.  In study arm 1,
      resuscitation teams will participate in a simulated pediatric cardiac arrest scenario, and
      provide standard CPR without prior JIT training and blinded to any feedback from the CPR
      card during the scenario.  Instead, the CPR card will be placed on the chest during
      compressions to collect real-time data, but the feedback lights on the card will be covered
      by black tape and thus, not visible to the members of the resuscitation team.  In study arm
      2, resuscitation teams will participate in the same scenario without prior JIT training, but
      provide chest compressions with the CPR card placed on the chest (and providing visual
      feedback) during compressions.  In study arm 3, participants will be given a CPR card and
      asked to view the JIT training video.  Then, 2-4 weeks later, they will be asked to
      participate in the simulated cardiac arrest scenario, and provide standard CPR without
      feedback from the CPR card.  As in study arm 1, the CPR card will still be placed on the
      chest, but the feedback lights will be covered and not visible to the resuscitation team
      members.  Finally, participants in study arm 4 will received JIT training 2-4 weeks prior to
      the simulated scenario, and have the CPR card in place during chest compressions to provide
      immediate visual feedback.

    <time_frame>up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>No flow time (time during cardiac arrest without chest compression delivery) will be calculated as the total scenario time minus the time with no chest compression delivery. No flow fraction (no flow fraction: proportion of cardiac arrest time without chest compression delivery) will be calculated as the no flow time divided by the total arrest time. In accordance with previous pediatric and adult CPR studies, pauses in chest compression delivery are defined as period of interruptions &gt; 1.5 seconds.</description>

    <time_frame>up to 6 months</time_frame>

    <description>Residual leaning force (grams) of delivered chest compression will be captured. The proportion of chest compression with excessive residual leaning force (&gt;2500 grams) will be reported</description>

    <time_frame>up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The number of chest compression provider switches will be recorded as the number of times there is a change in chest compression provider. A provider can be counted more than once if, in the interim, another provider has preformed chest compression of more than 1 minute before the same provider resumes compressions.</description>
