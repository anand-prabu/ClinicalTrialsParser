We believe that the EMDC is an\n      unexploited resource in the prehospital treatment  of patients. By the use of\n      videoconferencing we will activate this resource.\n\n      Mobile videoconferencing between ambulances and physician at the EMDC enables patient\n      consultation at a distance. Video consultation between patient and the physician at the EMDC\n      can take place when the patient is at home or in the ambulance.\n\n      The primary aim of this study is to examine the effect of video consultation between\n      physicians at the EMDC and patients receiving treatment by ambulance personnel on the number\n      of patients receiving final treatment  on-site in the pre hospital setting."
