The cost of performing such studies on a new cohort would be many times greater.\n\n      DESIGN NARRATIVE:\n\n      The case-control study evaluated: 1) the relationship between acute phase reactants,\n      albumin, alpha 1 glycoprotein c-reactive protein and sialic acid; 2) oxidized low density\n      lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLC) measured by thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS),\n      and risk of myocardial infarction or coronary heart disease death; 3) Lp(a); 4) antioxidized\n      vitamin E and carotene.  The study was done in one year because of the need to analyze the\n      specimens shortly after they were thawed.  The statistical analysis was done in\n      collaboration with University of Minnesota Coordinating Center."
