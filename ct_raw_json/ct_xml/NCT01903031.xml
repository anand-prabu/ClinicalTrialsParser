  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will look at a method of hormonal birth control, called the NuvaRing, and
      specific anti-HIV medications, called antiretrovirals (ARVs). Some studies of women who use
      a hormonal birth control method (specifically oral pills, patches, and injections) and take
      ARVs have shown that ARVs interact with the hormones released by the birth control
      medication. These interactions may cause the birth control to be less effective at
      preventing pregnancy. There is also concern that hormonal birth control can increase HIV
      spreading to others, but more studies are needed to determine if this is true. The
      investigators do not know whether the NuvaRing and ARVs interact when they are used
      together, so this study will look to see if certain ARVs (efavirenz and
      atazanavir/ritonavir) interact with the two hormones released by NuvaRing. This will help us
      to determine if NuvaRing is safe and effective for women with HIV infection who are taking
      ARVs. The study will also include HIV-infected women who are not on ARVs but will use the
      NuvaRing to show us what the hormone levels are like in a similar group of women not on
      ARVs.

      Vaginal rings are also currently being studied to deliver anti-HIV medications that may
      prevent HIV acquisition, and to provide birth control over a longer period of time (more
      than 1 month). Since vaginal rings will become more commonly used to administer medications,
      the investigators  want to better understand the potential for drug interactions with drugs
      given vaginally. This study will also help us understand the potential for drug interactions
      between ARVs given orally, and other drugs given through vaginal rings, like the NuvaRing.
      Additionally, this study will help us understand how hormones released from a vaginal ring
      affect the amount of HIV virus in the genital tract, the bacterial make-up (microbiome) of
      the female genital track, and the immune system within the genital tract, all of which may
      affect the chances of spreading HIV.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Documented HIV-1 infection.

          -  Participants must be receiving either 1) EFV 600 mg daily with 2 or more NRTIs, 2)
             ATV/r 300 mg/ 100 mg daily with TDF 300 mg and 1 or more additional NRTIs, or 3) no
             ART. ART regimens should be stable for 30 days prior to study entry with no plans to
             change therapy during the first 28 days of this study. Participants receiving no ART
             should have no plans to initiate ART during the first 28 days of the study.

        NOTE: Participants must have access to their ART regimens through their primary care
        providers. ART medications are not supplied by this study.

          -  For participants on ART, documentation of plasma HIV-1 RNA &lt;/= 400 copies/mL obtained
             within 60 days prior to study entry.

          -  For participants not on ART, CD4+ cell count must be ≥350 cells/mm3, obtained within
             60 days prior to study entry.

          -  Laboratory values within 60 days prior to study entry:

               -  Platelet count ≥50,000 platelets/mm3

               -  Hemoglobin ≥8.0 g/dL

               -  Aspartate transaminase (SGOT) and alanine aminotransferase (SGPT) &lt;5 x upper
                  limit of normal (ULN)

               -  Creatinine ≤1.5 x ULN

               -  Total bilirubin ≤2.0 x ULN

          -  Last menstrual period &lt;/=6 months prior to study entry. If last menstrual period &gt;6
             months prior to study entry without another cause for amenorrhea, such as recent
             pregnancy, serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) must be checked and be &lt;/= 40
             mIU/mL to be eligible for enrollment.

          -  Premenopausal females with at least one functioning ovary.

          -  Documentation of Pap smear within 1 year prior to study entry.

          -  Negative serum or urine-HCG pregnancy test with a sensitivity of ≤25 mIU/mL within 60
             days prior to study entry and within 24 hours prior to study entry

          -  All participants must agree not to participate in a conception process (eg, active
             attempt to become pregnant or in vitro fertilization) for the duration of the study.
             Because it is unknown if ARVs will adversely affect the efficacy of NuvaRing as a
             contraceptive method, participants of reproductive potential, who are participating
             in sexual activities that could lead to pregnancy, must agree to use an additional
             reliable form of contraception while in the study. Acceptable additional methods of
             contraception include:

               -  Condoms (male or female) with or without a spermicidal agent

               -  Non-hormonal intrauterine device (IUD)

        Other hormonal forms of contraception are not allowed during the study period.

        Condoms should be used to prevent transmission of HIV and sexually transmitted diseases
        between sexual partners.

        NOTE: Participants with bilateral tubal ligation or non-hormonal IUD may be enrolled.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Received depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) within 4 months prior to study
             entry.

          -  Received other hormonal therapies (eg, oral contraceptive agents, hormone- containing
             vaginal ring, contraceptive patch, hormone replacement therapy, anabolic therapies,
             including nandrolone decanoate or megestrol acetate) within 30 days prior to study
             entry.

          -  Breastfeeding.

          -  Less than 6 weeks postpartum at study entry.

          -  Use of any prohibited medications within 30 days prior to study entry.

          -  Initiated, discontinued, or changed doses of drugs that are CYP substrates or known
             to have drug interactions with ethinyl estradiol or etonogestrel within 30 days prior
             to study entry.

          -  Bilateral oophorectomy.

          -  For women older than 35 years of age, smoking 15 or more cigarettes per day.

          -  History of invasive cancer of the reproductive tract; known or suspected malignancy
             of the breast, or known increased risk for breast cancer; undiagnosed abnormal
             vaginal bleeding; liver tumors; or serious ocular disorders at any time prior to
             study entry.

          -  Chronic immunosuppressive conditions other than HIV.

          -  Use of systemic or inhaled corticosteroids such as for acute therapy for Pneumocystis
             pneumonia (PCP) or asthma exacerbation and prednisone ≥10 mg (or equivalent) for any
             reason other than a stable or tapering dose.

          -  History of deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism.

          -  History of cerebral vascular or coronary artery disease.

          -  Severe uncontrolled hypertension within 60 days prior to study entry.

          -  Diabetes with vascular involvement.

          -  Clinically active cervical or vaginal infection at study entry. NOTE: Gonorrhea,
             chlamydia, and trichomonas testing will be performed during screening using
             techniques available at the local sites and documented in source documentation and
             case report forms (CRFs). Testing for bacterial vaginosis, performed using techniques
             available at the local sites, is only necessary if the participant is symptomatic and
             the provider feels treatment may be necessary. Women with genital herpes lesions
             should wait to be screened until the herpetic lesions have healed.

          -  Acute infections or other opportunistic diseases requiring medication within 14 days
             prior to study entry.
