According to the 2-standard deviation (2\n      SD) band analysis, statistical analysis were performed for each patient individually.\n      Accordingly, a statistically significant change was detected if two consecutive assessments\n      in the B-phase exceeded the 2 standard deviations (SD) of the mean of the A-phase.\n\n      Patients were recruited from an ongoing study at the Karolinska University Hospital with the\n      purpose to screen all patients with systemic sclerosis in Stockholm for cardiovascular\n      disease. All patients meeting the inclusion criteria were invited to participate in this\n      exercise study.\n\n      Assessments:\n\n      The six minute walking test was used to assess physical capacity. A submaximal treadmill\n      test was used to estimate oxygen uptake in ml/kg x min. Muscle endurance was assessed by the\n      Functional Index 2 registering the number of correct performed repetitions in 7 muscle\n      groups. Pain, Raynaud's Phenomenon, fatigue and global disease impact on general well-being\n      was assessed by the Visual Analogue scale (VAS), 0-100. Limitations in activities of daily\n      living were assessed using the Health Assessment Questionnaire and the SF-36 was included to\n      assess perceived health.\n\n      The Exercise program:\n\n      The program starts with a 10-minute warm-up session with biking at an intensity\n      corresponding to perceived light exertion (10 on the Borg RPE, 6-20 scale). Thereafter, the\n      load is increased to reach an intensity corresponding to perceived heavy exertion (15 on the\n      Borg RPE scale) for an additional 15 minutes. During the last five minutes of the biking\n      session, the loads are reduced to an intensity corresponding to light exertion. Heart rate\n      was is recorded with a pulse watch (RS100 Polar) and peripheral saturation recorded with a\n      heart rate oximeter (Wristox 3100 Nonin Medical). During the first weeks patients start on\n      lower leads and increasing to the goal intensity.  After the biking exercises, the\n      participants perform repetitive dynamic muscle resistance training with the goal to achieve\n      as many repetitions as possible in shoulder flexion and in hip flexion."
