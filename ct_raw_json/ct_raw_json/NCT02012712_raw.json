We know little\n      about how to make PHRs accessible for older adults and what effects this will have.\n\n      Methods: A PHR was designed and pretested with older adults and tested in a six-month\n      randomized controlled trial. After completing mailed baseline questionnaires, eligible\n      computer users aged 65 and over were randomized 3:1 to be given access to a PHR (n=802) or\n      serve as a standard care control group (n=273). Follow-up questionnaires measured change\n      from baseline medication use, medication reconciliation behaviors, and medication management\n      problems."

Users can enter, view, and print their current and past medicines, allergies, health conditions, and health event tracking over time. An embedded tutorial video provides assistance with the system. The PHR was developed and refined using participatory design and focus group sessions as well as evaluation in a usability laboratory.  The resulting design emphasizes the reduction of physical and cognitive demands on users, focusing on simplicity, readability, and quick navigation.\nIowa PHR displayed a message when a user entered a medication with an associated Assessing Care of Vulnerable Elders project (ACOVE\u20103) safety concern. This included 16 safety issues for 12 drugs or drug classes with safety concerns.  We also adapted four general medication use patient safety indicators from the ACOVE project and displayed them to all users on a rotating basis upon login.",
