Assuming intervention may result in 25% (3.1825g) reduction in\n      GWG, the estimated sample size with 90% power and type I error of 0.05 was 114 women in\n      intervention group and 57 in control group. Adjusting for 15% refusal or loss to follow up\n      during pregnancy, the total sample size required was 136 women in intervention group and 68\n      in control group(standard care group). Participants were randomly assigned to the control or\n      the intervention group. The intervention focused on restricting energy intake combined with\n      behavioral lifestyle modification through participation in group sessions and individual\n      counseling. The primary outcomes were gestational weight gain (GWG) and secondary outcomes\n      were the incidence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), hypertensive disorders during\n      pregnancy, large-for-gestational-age (LGA) infants, macrosomia and the rate of caesarian\n      section.\n\n      Hypothesis:The intensive dietary and lifestyle intervention performed from the first\n      trimester in obese women could  decrease total GWG,and perhaps improve relevant pregnancy\n      outcomes."
