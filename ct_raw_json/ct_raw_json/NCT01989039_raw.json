However, obesity is also associated with increased inflammatory markers. Obesity\n      is per se associated with increased adipose expression and plasma levels of leptin, lower\n      expression of adiponectin, and elevated inflammatory markers. To study the insulin\n      resistance\u3001inflammatory markers and cardiovascular risk in women with PCOS, body weight\n      status should be considered. Investigator therefore conduct this retrospective study to\n      evaluate the insulin resistance\u3001inflammatory and cardiovascular markers between PCOS and\n      non-PCOS among obese and non-obese women."
