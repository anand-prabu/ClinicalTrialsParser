            "textblock": "Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease that usually occurs in children and reduces\n      their pancreatic islet beta cells and thereby limits insulin production. Millions of\n      individuals worldwide have T1D, and the number of children with diagnosed or undiagnosed T1D\n      is increasing annually. Insulin supplementation is not a cure. It does not halt the\n      persistent autoimmune response, nor can it reliably prevent devastating complications such\n      as neuronal and cardiovascular diseases, blindness, and kidney failure. A true cure has\n      proven elusive despite intensive research pressure over the past 25 years. Notably, Dr.Zhao\n      and his team have successfully developed a groundbreaking technology Stem Cell Educator\n      therapy (Zhao Y, et al.BMC Medicine 2011, 2012). To date, clinical trials in adult patients\n      have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of Stem Cell Educator therapy for the treatment of\n      T1D and other autoimmune-associated diseases. Here, the investigators will evaluate the\n      safety and efficacy of Stem Cell Educator therapy in children with type 1 diabetes."
