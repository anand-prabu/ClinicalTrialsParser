  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Drainage of air and fluid from the chest cavity using plastic tubes (chest drains) is an
      essential tool in Chest Medicine.  A common complication of drain insertion is accidental
      removal of the drain, usually as a result of inadequate securing techniques, with rates of
      up to 1 in 5 reported. This often results in the need for further procedures (including
      drain re-siting), with associated additional risk to the patient and an increase in health
      care costs.  One suggested method to reduce premature drain removal is to use chest drains
      with ballooned tips, much like a bladder catheter.  These would provide a physical
      obstruction inside the chest cavity at the insertion site, whilst being easy to use as
      stitching or extensive taping may not be required.

      The investigators propose a trial of a dedicated ballooned chest drain to investigate
      whether a reduction in drain re-siting rates can be achieved.  Pain scores will also be
      assessed during this trial to ensure that irritation of the lining of the lung or chest wall
      by the balloon is not excessive.
