  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative pain is a major concern in routine management of children admitted to
      pediatric intensive care treatment. There are significant negative physiological and
      psychological ramifications of postoperative pain such as impairment of cardiac function due
      to tachycardia, restlessness in an intubated patient requiring increase dosage of sedative
      and paralytic drugs and reduced patient cooperation in the healing process.

      The main body of evidence dealing with gender differences in pain perception and treatment
      stems from studies in the adult and adolescent population as the gonadal hormones have a
      central role in the way one experiences pain The hypothesis of this study is that there is a
      difference in the perception of pain, the amount of analgesia used and the response to pain
      medication between male and female infants undergoing craniosynostosis repair or untethering
      of cord.
