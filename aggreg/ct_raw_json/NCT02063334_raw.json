            "textblock": "Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D3] is a well-established marker for vitamin D status of\n      the human body. In addition to the general importance of vitamin D for bone health, low\n      serum 25(OH)D3 concentrations have been associated with increased risk of several health\n      outcomes, such as autoimmune diseases, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular complications.\n      However, there is significant inter-individual variation in the average serum 25(OH)D3\n      concentrations and also in the response to supplementation with vitamin D. Genetic and\n      epigenetic factors have been suggested to be responsible for a large part of the variation,\n      but currently there is little information about the health effects of the variation.\n\n      In our previous study (VitDmet, Clinicaltrials.gov NCT01479933) we showed that only half of\n      the participants responded to the 5-month vitamin D3 supplementation of 40 \u00b5g/day or 80\n      \u00b5g/day as expected and that certain vitamin D receptor (VDR) target genes were suitable\n      biomarkers for displaying the transcriptomic response of human tissues to vitamin D3\n      supplementation.\n\n      The purpose of the current study is to investigate whether a high-dose vitamin D3 oral bolus\n      produces marked VDR target gene expression response and whether there is large\n      inter-individual variation, as what was suggested with the 5-month lower-dose\n      supplementation.\n\n      In the Trial 1, the subjects are randomized to receive either 2,000 micrograms (80 000 IU)\n      of vitamin D3 (n=20) or placebo (n=10) in one day. Blood samples are collected for\n      peripheral blood mononuclear cell isolation and serum 25(OH)D3 measurements at baseline and\n      24 h and 48 h and 30 days after the first dose. Blood samples are also collected for\n      immunomarker analyses. In the Trial 2, the procedures of the Trial 1 are repeated in two\n      subjects with known low and high serum 25(OH)D3 concentrations in order to investigate more\n      specifically the impact of different starting levels of serum 25(OH)D3."
