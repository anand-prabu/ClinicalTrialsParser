    <textblock>
      The investigators will evaluate the determinants of cerebral impairment in patients with
      non-ischemic heart failure compared to controls, and its relation to cognitive function.
      They hypothesize that patients with heart failure have impaired brain perfusion and
      hemodynamic factors are associated with cognitive dysfunction.
