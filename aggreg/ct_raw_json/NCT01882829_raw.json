This group\n      of patients - representing treatment-resistant depression (TRD) - accounts for an alarmingly\n      high public health burden and signifies a critical area of need in pharmaceutical treatment\n      development. While current treatments are slow to act and only partially effective, new\n      basic and clinical research focusing on the glutamate system is yielding promising new\n      avenues for novel drug discovery. Ketamine - a glutamate N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA)\n      receptor antagonist - has now been demonstrated in several studies to bring about a rapid\n      and robust antidepressant effect, even in patients suffering from TRD. Ketamine is limited\n      as a treatment for TRD by the need for intravenous administration and the potential for\n      untoward medical or psychiatric adverse effects. There is an urgent need, therefore, to\n      identify well-tolerated, orally available compounds that target the NMDA receptor as a novel\n      treatment approach for TRD. The current project aims to test the safety, tolerability and\n      efficacy of Nuedexta - containing the NMDA antagonist dextromethorphan."
