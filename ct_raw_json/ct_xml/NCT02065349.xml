    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the painkilling efficacy of ASP8477 relative to mock
      (placebo) in patients that have been diagnosed with painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy
      or postherpetic neuralgia determined by the change in the average daily pain intensity in
      patients that initially respond favorably to treatment with ASP8477.
