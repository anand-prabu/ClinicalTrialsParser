            "textblock": "Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) has been reported in up to 85% of all infants born\n      prematurely, and has been associated with a wide range of symptoms.  These include\n      irritability, pauses in breathing, heart rate drops, declines in oxygen levels, chronic lung\n      disease, and delays in growth and development.  A novel approach to the mangement of GERD in\n      infants is the use of an abdominal band, applying gentle pressure and possibly reducing the\n      reflux of acid from the stomach.  The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of a\n      swaddle blanket with an abdominal band insert on the incidence of infant apnea, bradycardia,\n      oxygen declines, and pH (acid) changes."
