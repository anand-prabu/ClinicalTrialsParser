  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Age-related macular degeneration is one of the leading causes of blindness worldwide. The
      factors that induce the progression of geographic atrophy, the advanced form of dry
      age-related macular degeneration, remain poorly understood. The aims of this study are to
      describe the natural history of geographic atrophy and identify potential risk factors
      associated with a faster spread of atrophy that may be used to develop rational therapies.

    <textblock>
      Age-related macular degeneration is the leading cause of blindness in developed countries.
      Geographic atrophy is the advanced form of dry age-related macular degeneration, and
      currently has no effective therapy. Little is known about the risk factors that drive the
      progression of geographic atrophy, and yet they are crucial to understand the mechanisms of
      the disease. Therefore, the identification of risk factors associated with a faster spread
      of atrophy may help contribute to identify the causes of the disease and, ultimately, to
      develop new therapeutic strategies to manage the disorder.

      The current prospective, observational, natural history study has the following objectives:

        -  Describe the natural history of geographic atrophy in anatomic and visual terms

        -  Identify risk factors associated with a faster enlargement of atrophy

      The main hypothesis is that lipofuscin accumulation at the borders of atrophy as seen with
      fundus autofluorescence imaging is associated with a faster progression of the disease.

             drug induced, central serous chorioretinopathy)

          -  Prior history of wet age-related macular degeneration

          -  Other significant concomitant macular diseases (ie, significant epiretinal membrane,

             antiangiogenic drugs or other treatments for wet age-related macular degeneration

          -  Intraocular surgery aside from phacoemulsification

          -  Inability to measure the full extent of the area of atrophy on a 35º fundus
             autofluorescence image centered on field 2
