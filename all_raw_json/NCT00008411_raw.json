Patients are stratified according to prior\n      taxane use (yes vs no), number of prior chemotherapy regimens for metastatic disease (0 vs\n      1), and participating center. Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 1. Courses repeat every 21\n           days.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses\n           repeat every 28 days.\n\n      Treatment continues in both arms in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable\n      toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed at 3 weeks, at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, and then annually for 4 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 160 patients will be accrued for this study."
