  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to examine if repetitive computerized cognitive training improves
      working memory in patients who are on sick leave due to complex symptom disorders (chronic
      pain, chronic fatigue, anxiety, depression and or sleep disorders), and whether effects of
      cognitive control training transfer to other tasks.

    <description>Subjects participating in a vocational rehabilitation program will receive systematic cognitive training for 5 weeks.Cogmed working memory training is a computer-based solution. Subjects are instructed to train each weekday (5 days a week) for 5 weeks. Each training session lasts about 40-50 minutes, subjects are asked to complete a set consisting of 8 different tasks, each designed to train working memory.</description>
