When compared to younger adults QOL is more important than gain in survival\n      for elderly patients. (Eyigor, et al., 2010).\n\n      The National Comprehensive Cancer Network recommends exercise as the most effective\n      intervention for cancer related fatigue.\n\n      Methods:\n\n      This is a single institution randomized controlled study to evaluate a home based exercise\n      program in elderly gynecologic oncology patients undergoing chemotherapy. Subjects will be\n      randomized to the intervention group or to the control group receiving usual care.\n\n      Intervention group will receive a home exercise program 3 days weekly consisting of 30mins\n      of strength and aerobic activity, utilizing a follow along exercise DVD and patient log to\n      assist with compliance.\n\n      The two groups will be compared by 1) objective PT assessment with the Berg Balance and 6\n      minute walk test (before or after) Cycle 1 and 6, 2) subjective nursing assessment with the\n      NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) and FACIT- F (Functional\n      Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy: Fatigue) prior to Cycle 1 (baseline),4 (midpoint),\n      and following cycle 6 (completion).\n\n      Conclusion:\n\n      PT directed home exercise program may improve CRF, functional decline, and QOL in elderly\n      gynecologic oncology patients undergoing chemotherapy."
