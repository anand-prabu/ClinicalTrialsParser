  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate duration of action
      of Baclofen ER capsules (GRS) compared with placebo in subjects with spasticity due to
      Multiple sclerosis.

      The trial will include male and female subjects greater than or equal to 18 years of age
      with spasticity with multiple sclerosis.

    <textblock>
      This clinical trial will be conducted in compliance with the Code of Federal Regulations of
      the United States of America, the guidance and rules of the International Conference on
      Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use
      (ICH), the Declaration of Helsinki, and all applicable regulatory requirements.

      This trial is designed to evaluate the duration of the anti-spasticity action of a single
      dose of Baclofen ER Capsules (GRS) administered in subjects with spasticity due to multiple
      sclerosis
