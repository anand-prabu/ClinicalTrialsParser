  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized, parallel-group, single-blinded, single center, Phase II
      study is to collect data to compare the comfort and patient satisfaction of a hip injection
      delivered via the Navigator compared to a standard needle injection.  In addition, delivery
      preparation will be compared between a Navigator injection and a standard hip injection.
      The data collected from this pilot study will serve as the basis to design a larger
      multi-center study.
