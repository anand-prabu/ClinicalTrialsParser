Smoking has been well documented by numerous\n      studies as a major environmental risk factor for periodontitis and adverse pregnancy\n      outcomes. Therefore, the investigators only selected non-smoking individuals in this study\n      as the smoking-related risk could obscure the polymorphism-related increase in risk for\n      periodontitis and adverse pregnancy outcomes. This study aimed to determine the association\n      between IL-1A (+4895), IL-1B (+3954), and IL-1RN polymorphisms with adverse pregnancy\n      outcomes and periodontitis in a non-smoking Turkish population."
