            "textblock": "GISTs are uncommon visceral sarcomas that arise predominantly in the gastrointestinal tract.\n      Most GIST cells are positive for c-kit (CD117), a cell surface antigen corresponding to the\n      Stem Cell Factor (SCF) receptor. The receptor has an intracellular tyrosine kinase (TK)\n      joined by a juxtamembrane domain. It is hypothesized that all malignant GIST cells harbor a\n      mutation of c-kit, resulting in the activation of c-kit and cell division and tumour growth.\n\n      Drugs that can selectively inhibit TKs are likely to be of benefit in GISTs. Masitinib\n      (AB1010) is a TK inhibitor, selectively and effectively inhibiting c-kit. Imatinib is also a\n      TK inhibitor indicated in the treatment of GIST. It might be associated with side effects\n      and patients might develop a resistance to treatment over time. Based on pre-clinical and\n      clinical studies, masitinib (AB1010) can be considered as a good candidate in the second\n      line treatment of patients with GIST after progression with imatinib."
