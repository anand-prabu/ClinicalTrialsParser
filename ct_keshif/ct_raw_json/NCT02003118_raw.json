Patients should\n        have an average pain level of between 4 and 8 on a Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) for at least\n        5 of 7 days before the randomisation, when answering the question: Please, rate the\n        average pain in your index knee during the last 24 hours. Prior to the study, patients\n        should have been using pharmacological treatments, such as Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory\n        Drug (NSAIDs), acetaminophen or weak opioids for their OA pain on a regular basis (defined\n        as having used NSAIDs, acetaminophen or weak opioids at least 10 days out of 30 days\n        during the last month prior to the screening visit).\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n        Patient has a concurrent medical/arthritic disease that could confound or interfere with\n        evaluation of efficacy.\n\n        Patients with impaired renal function, defined as an estimated creatinine clearance less\n        than or equal to 50 ml/min, or patients taking medications that might impair renal\n        function.\n\n        Patient has New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III-IV congestive heart failure.\n\n        The patient has a history of uncontrolled hypertension or a current blood pressure that in\n        the opinion of the Investigator makes the patient unsuitable for the study.\n\n        Patients with a trauma or surgery at the index knee within 3 months prior to screening."
