      The overall aim of this study is to compare standard staging of lung cancer (which includes
      clinical examination, CT, MRI, bone scan and PET-CT) with comprehensive staging - which
      includes the new staging methods (PET-MRI and systematic mapping of mediastinal and hilar
      lymph nodes using endobronchial ultrasound) with respect to disease stage and outcomes of
      therapy.

      The trial is a randomized, explorative study. Patients undergoing examinations for
      suspicions of lung cancer (Stage I-III) are randomized to either standard diagnostic work-up
      for lung cancer (Arm A, n=75) or comprehensive diagnostic work-up (Arm B, n=75) with
      standard examinations plus endobronchial-screening for metastatic lymph nodes (EBUS-TBNA)
      and PET-MRI.

      All patients will undergo todays' standard examination for diagnosing and staging lung
      cancer. This will be individualized for each patient according to current guidelines. In
      addition to the standard diagnostic work-up, patients in the interventional group (ArmB)
      will undergo

      1) PET-MRI 2) systematic mediastinal and hilar lymph node mapping using EBUS-TBNA
      (endobronchial ultrasound transbronchial needle aspiration of lymph nodes)

        1. PET-MRI PET-MRI will be done immediate after the standard PET-CT using the same
           infusion of tracer (18-fluorodeoxyglucose, FDG). The sequence protocols used for MRI
           will be standardized for the study, according to each body compartment. Measurement of
           Standard Uptake Values (SUV) of the tracer (FDG) will be recorded in pathological
           lesions. In the mediastinum, each lymph node station will be evaluated with description
           of visible nodes.

        2. Systematic mediastinal mapping The EBUS-TBNA will be done at the initial bronchoscopy
           and using standard conscious sedation according to the local guidelines at St.Olavs
           Hospital. Each lymph node station (station 2, 4, 7, 10 and 11 bilateral) will be
           examined and all lymph nodes ≥ 0,5 cm in short diameter that is easily accessible will
           be punctured for rapid on-site cytological evaluation (ROSE).

      After the initial diagnostic work-up is completed, the patient will be given treatment
      according to existing guidelines for lung cancer based on the given clinical stage.

      For patients undergoing surgery all accessible lymph nodes will be resected according to
      standard practice. Every resected lymph node will be carefully named according to the
      standard lymph station for comparison with clinical findings.

             St. Olavs Hospital

             opinion of the investigator would compromise the patient's ability to complete the
             study or interfere with the evaluation of the efficacy and safety of the study
             procedure

          6. No contraindication for study specific procedure - bronchoscopy, CT, MRI and PET.

          7. No conditions - medical, social, psychological - which could prevent adequate
