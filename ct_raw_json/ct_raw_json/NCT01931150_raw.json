Two different topical agents will be applied to the\n      skin. One topical agent is the dapsone gel and the other is a skin moisturizer.  Dapsone gel\n      is an FDA approved medication that you apply to the face. It is commonly used to treat acne.\n      Skin moisturizers are recommended to patients who receive Cetuximab treatment. In addition\n      to these topical agents they will be given a pill to take once a day. This pill has already\n      been shown to help fight rashes from Cetuximab."
