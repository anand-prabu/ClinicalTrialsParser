First line medications for\n      pain include intravenous and enteral narcotics, acetaminophen and NSAIDS or\n      N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonists but their effects appear to be short-lived.\n      Gabapentin has been shown in adult studies to tone down the body's response to pain and\n      decreases opioid use post-operatively.  The purpose of this study is to see if a single\n      preoperative dose will reduce post-operative pain scores and the amount of analgesic used."

Investigators will\n      also look for a limited set of genotypic variations to explain any difference between\n      individuals or groups in their response to the medication.  Additionally investigators will\n      document potential adverse effects including excessive sedation, respiratory issues,\n      surgical bleeding and emergence agitation/delirium.\n\n      Investigators hypothesize that gabapentin will reduce opioid analgesic requirements and pain\n      scores up to 36 hours post adenotonsillectomy without increased adverse effects such as\n      emergence delirium, respiratory complications or bleeding. The clinical effect may depend on\n      the individual's pharmacogenetic profile to look for a specific set of genetic polymorphisms\n      that relate to the metabolism and effect of the study drug, gabapentin, and opioid analgesic\n      pain medications."
