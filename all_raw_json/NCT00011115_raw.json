At the start of the study, participants will be weighed\n      and will complete questionnaires about their health, weight history, eating and exercise\n      habits, body satisfaction and mood. Participants will then be randomly assigned to 1 of 4\n      treatments. Participants in all 4 groups will receive information on topics related to\n      eating and exercise, and will receive calorie and fat intake goals, and exercise goals. The\n      4 treatments will differ in the emphasis given to various reasons for wanting to lose\n      weight. At 6, 12 and 18 months after enrollment, participants will again have weights\n      measured and fill out questionnaires."
