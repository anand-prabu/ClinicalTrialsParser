Patients are\n      randomized to one of two treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive adjuvant doxorubicin IV and cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on\n           days 0, 21, 42, and 63. Patients also receive oral chinese herbal therapy three times\n           daily on days -10 to 105.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive adjuvant chemotherapy as in arm I and oral placebo three times\n           daily on days -10 to 105.\n\n      Quality of life is assessed at baseline and on days 3, 24, 45, 66, 84, and 105.\n\n      Patients are followed at day 105.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients (30 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this\n      study."
