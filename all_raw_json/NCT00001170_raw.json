The\n      study was designed to explore the effect that depressed parents have on their children and\n      to better understand the factors that contribute to depression development and maintenance.\n\n      The study will continue to investigate if children have certain characteristics in early and\n      middle childhood that predict the later development of psychological disorders.\n\n      In addition, the study will continue looking at the processes responsible for the\n      development of children of parents with and without affective (mood) disorders."

Parents with a diagnosis of major\n      depression or bipolar illness and well parents and their children are studied (SADS-L, RDC,\n      and SCID, DSM-III).  A sibling pair is studied in each family.  Parent-child interaction is\n      investigated through direct observation of behavior in naturalistic and controlled settings.\n       Family history information is obtained through parent interviews.  Behavioral observations,\n      standard tests, physical examinations, and psychiatric interviews, and MRI procedures\n      provide multiple assessments of the offspring.  The study has been completed through\n      preadolescence, adolescence, and late adolescence.   Follow-up in young adulthood continues."
