Assess the antineoplastic activity and safety profile of\n      this regimen in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive daunorubicin liposomal IV over a\n      minimum of 2 hours on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for a maximum of 8 courses in\n      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive\n      escalating doses of daunorubicin liposomal until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is\n      determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting\n      toxicity. Patients with stable or responding disease are followed at 1 and 3 months, then\n      every 3 months for 1 year.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 15-20 patients will be accrued for this study within 1\n      year."
