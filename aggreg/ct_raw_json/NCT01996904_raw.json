The footprint area of the subscapularis tendon, which is trapezoidal in shape on the proximal part of the lesser tuberosity, was thoroughly cleaned of soft tissue and meticulous bone preparation was done prior to placement of anchor sutures.",

The ten activities of daily living include skills such as putting on a coat, sleeping on the affected side, wash back/do up bra in back, manage toileting, combing one's hair, reach a high shelf, lift 10lbs above shoulder,throw a ball overhand,do usual work and do usual sport.The items related to function are evaluated by a four-point Likert scale. The scores of the pain and function subsections are transformed in percentages and each one represents 50% of the final score, which can range from 0 (absence of function) to 100 (normal function).",

            "textblock": "Prospective randomized controlled study was designed to evaluate subscapularis repair in\n      anterosuperior rotator cuff tear compared with debridement of the subscapularis tear. After\n      identification of the subscapularis tear arthroscopically,  final eligibility of\n      participants for the study was established on the basis of intra-operative arthroscopic\n      inspection of the subscapularis using 70 degrees arthroscope. Once eligibility was\n      confirmed, patients were randomized to one of two arthroscopic methods; repair (group A) or\n      debridement (group B) of the subscapularis tear. The treatment allocations were decided\n      through an interphone by \"Research Coordinator\".  Block randomization was performed and no\n      stratification was performed. Random Sequence Generator (Random.org) was used for the\n      randomization process by given number whose digit was residue of modulo 2 (0 - group A, 1 -\n      group B). Sequence Boundaries was 1 (smallest value) to 300 (largest value) based on the\n      number calculated from power analysis. After randomization, patients underwent arthroscopic\n      repair or debridement of the subscapularis tear. Size of the rotator cuff tear was also\n      determined by the arthroscopic finding (small-to-medium, medium-to-large, large-to-massive).\n      When full-thickness tear was confined to supraspinatus, the tear was called small-to-medium\n      size tear. Medium-to-Large size tear was defined as complete full-thickness supraspinatus\n      tear combined with incomplete full-thickness infraspinatus tear. Large-to-massive tear\n      consisted of complete full-thickness tear of supraspinatus and infraspinatus or complete\n      full-thickness tear of supraspinatus and subscapularis or complete 3-tendon tears.\n      Postoperatively, rehabilitation was identical for both groups and consisted of sling\n      immobilization for six weeks. Pulley exercises were performed during this time period. After\n      six weeks from the surgery, active-assisted exercise including stick exercise to achieve\n      full range of motion was performed. After 9 weeks from the surgery, Theraband exercise was\n      initiated to strengthen repaired rotator cuff muscles. All patients underwent ultrasound at\n      24 months follow-up to evaluate integrity of supraspinatus tendon. The evaluation of\n      integrity of supraspinatus tendon was performed and compared between two groups to evaluate\n      the contribution of the subscapularis tendon to rotator cuff integrity. Re-tear of the\n      supraspinatus was carefully evaluated through ultrasound by musculoskeletal radiologists who\n      were experienced in ultrasound-diagnosis of shoulder more than 10 years."

The ten activities of daily living include skills such as putting on a coat, sleeping on the affected side, wash back/do up bra in back, manage toileting, combing one's hair, reach a high shelf, lift 10lbs above shoulder,throw a ball overhand,do usual work and do usual sport.The items related to function are evaluated by a four-point Likert scale.
