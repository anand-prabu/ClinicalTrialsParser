CTTHs typically occur at least 15 times a month or at least every\n      second day, and present as an achy or tight sensation that is felt around the head . The\n      pain may last from 30 minutes to several days and varies in intensity . Conventional\n      treatment is palliative, consisting of analgesics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs\n      (NSAIDs), which may produce adverse effects and analgesic rebound headaches . Lacticum\n      acidum 30CH is a homoeopathic remedy that has been shown to have potential benefits in the\n      treatment of CTTHs . Homaccords are the preparation of one remedy in multiple increasing\n      potencies in a single vehicle . There has been no research done to date on Lacticum acidum\n      Homaccord in the treatment of CTTHs.The aim of this study is to determine the efficacy of\n      Lacticum acidum Homaccord in the treatment of chronic tension-type headaches, using the\n      modified Headache Diary and the Headache Disability Inventory."

A randomized sample of 30 male and female participants between the ages of 18 and 45\n      years who suffer from CTTHs will be recruited. This will be done by means of purposive\n      sampling via advertisements placed on the UJ campuses, with relevant permission given . At\n      the initial consultation (day 0), prospective participants will be requested to sign the\n      Participant Information and Consent Form . They will then complete the Screening\n      Questionnaire to assess their eligibility for participating in the study. Those participants\n      who meet the diagnostic criteria for CTTHs, and whose symptoms match at least eight out of\n      the twelve Lacticum acidum headache related symptoms, will be eligible to participate. All\n      participants will also be requested to complete a Headache Disability Inventory.\n      Participants will be placed into matched pairs according to age and gender and will receive\n      one 30 mL bottle of their medication. On days 1-28 each participant will be requested to\n      complete the Headache Diary at the end of each day and to take 5 pillules of the medication\n      in the morning and in the evening. The first follow-up visit will occur on day 14; here\n      participants will complete the Headache Disability Inventory, the completed headache diaries\n      will be exchanged with new ones, a relevant physical examination including vital signs will\n      be conducted and an additional bottle of medication will be given. The final follow-up visit\n      will occur on day 28, where each participant will complete the Headache Disability\n      Inventory, and a relevant physical examination including vital signs will be recorded.\n\n      Collected data will be evaluated using frequencies, descriptive tests and cross tabulation,\n      the Shapiro Wilk test, the Independent samples t-test or Mann-Whitney test, and the Friedman\n      and Wilcoxon signed ranks tests. A possible outcome is that Lacticum acidum may have an\n      ameliorating effect on CTTHs and may provide a possible alternative treatment option for\n      this condition, opening up the field for further research."
