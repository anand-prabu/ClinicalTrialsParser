For the majority of the patients, symptom and distress can be\n      reduced if adequate treatment is provided. This study aims to test possible differences\n      between the impact of standardized care and the WOMAN-PRO II program on symptom prevalence\n      in women with vulvar neoplasia after surgical treatment.\n\n      In a sequential explanatory mixed-methods project, a randomized phase II study will be\n      followed by a qualitative sub-study. Ninety patients with vulvar neoplasia treated\n      surgically will participate in the randomized trial in four Swiss hospitals, one Austrian\n      and one Australian hospital. After stratification by precancer/cancer, women will be\n      randomly assigned (1:2 ratio) to standardized care and the WOMAN-PRO II program. The\n      standardized care group will receive a set of information leaflets about supportive care\n      options in the clinic. The WOMAN-PRO II program group will obtain counseling sessions by\n      specially trained gynecology-oncology nurse specialists at the moment of diagnosis, 7 days\n      post-surgery, in week two after discharge, week twelve and week 24 after surgery. The\n      primary outcome of this study is symptom prevalence. Secondary outcomes will be collected\n      for explorative reasons and include symptom distress, uncertainty, quality of life, social\n      support, resilience, quality of care, sociodemographic and medical characteristics,\n      post-surgical complications, functional status, cost evaluation and process outcomes.\n      Quantitative data will be collected at the counseling points of time and analyzed by using\n      mixed linear regression analysis. Twenty interviews will be conducted with women of the\n      WOMAN-PRO II program group. A focus-group interview will be conducted with twelve\n      gynecology-oncology nurse specialists in order to better understand to which degree the\n      interventions meet individual needs as well as to identify remaining barriers and enablers\n      for the implementation of symptom self-management. Qualitative data will be analyzed by\n      using thematic analysis and a critical hermeneutic reflection.\n\n      This study will evaluate the impact of the WOMAN-PRO II program on symptom prevalence,\n      patient-reported outcomes and clinical parameters, and inform the design of a possible phase\n      III study on the clinical efficacy of the program."

                "description": "The Assessment of Chronic Illness Care (ACIC) questionnaire was developed to assess if provided care is in alignment with the Chronic Care Model (CCM). The CCM comprises six areas: the organization of the health care system, the community linkage, self-management, decision support, delivery system design, and the clinical information system. The ACIC adresses how well a practice team or organization integrates the Chronic Care Model elements. Responses can be related to four descriptive levels from A \"fully implemented\" to D \"little or none\" implementation of the intervention.",

The economic evaluation will consist of a within-trial analysis and will compare direct costs and six-month outcomes of patients randomized to intervention II versus intervention I. Direct hospital costs will be the primary perspective. The study will record length of hospital stay, primary surgery costs, readmission, costs concerning intervention I, costs concerning intervention II, follow-up costs, patients non-productive time, and mortality. Comparison will be made between baseline and follow-up to estimate incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) comparing intervention II group with intervention I group in terms of the primary outcome measure (symptom prevalence) and costs.",
