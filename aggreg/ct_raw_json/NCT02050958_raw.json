The safety and tolerability of the study drug will also be assessed.\n\n      The study will involve approximately 44 healthy male and female subjects. Subjects will be\n      randomly assigned to receive either the study drug or reference product for 8 days. On Day\n      1, subjects will receive a single 800 mg dose of ibuprofen. On Days 2 to 9, subjects will\n      receive 800 mg ibuprofen three times a day."
