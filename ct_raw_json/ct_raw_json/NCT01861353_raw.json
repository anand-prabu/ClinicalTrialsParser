The investigators\n      hypothesize that cranberry-lingonberry juice should be started already during the\n      antimicrobial treatment of acute urinary tract infection in order to maximize the preventive\n      efficacy of the juice. In addition, the investigators aim to find the explanation for the\n      efficacy of cranberry-lingonberry juice by analyzing the concomitant changes in the chemical\n      composition of urine and feces as well as the changes of gut microbiota."
