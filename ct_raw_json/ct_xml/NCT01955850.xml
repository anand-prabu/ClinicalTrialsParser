    <textblock>
      The object of this study is to compare internet-delivered treatment for insomnia to
      face-to-face treatment and a waiting-list. In this study participants are randomized to: 1)
      online cognitive-behavioral intervention; 2) face-to-face cognitive behavioral intervention;
      3) waiting-list. Both the online and face-to-face interventions consist of: diary;
      psycho-education; relaxation exercises; stimulus control/sleep hygiene; sleep restriction;
      challenging the misconceptions about sleep; and paradoxical exercise. Adult persons with
      insomnia will be invited via a popular scientific website to fill out online questionnaires.
      Participants fill out questionnaires and a dairy at baseline post-test, 3-month follow-up,
      and 6-month follow-up. Participants on the waiting-list receive online treatment after the
      first post-test. The investigators expect that the online-delivered treatment and the
      face-to-face treatment are equally effective.
