      A study for women with ovarian cancer that has returned at least 6 months after
      platinum-based chemotherapy.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Phase 1b is unblinded and will have a small number of participants that will take LY2228820
      plus gemcitabine and carboplatin to test the safety of the combination and determine a
      recommended dose for the Phase 2 portion.

      Phase 2 will be blinded and all study participants will receive carboplatin and gemcitabine.
       Participants of one group will receive LY2228820, and the other group will receive placebo.

      If the participant achieves at least stable disease, there is a maintenance phase following
      the first 6 cycles. The participant will take either LY2228820 or placebo.  The participant
      will continue therapy until disease progression or other discontinuation criteria are
      fulfilled.
