The study will specifically look at\n      blood levels of these three drugs (taken as a 3-in-1 tablet) after taking them every day for\n      14 days.\n\n      The duration of the subjects involvement in the study will be up to 23 days plus a screening\n      visit which will take place up to 4 weeks prior to the start of the study, and a follow up\n      visit which takes place  16-22 days after the last dose of study medication.\n\n      This study is not randomised which means that all participants will receive all study\n      medications in the same order. The participant and the study doctor will know which study\n      medications you are taking at all times during the study."
