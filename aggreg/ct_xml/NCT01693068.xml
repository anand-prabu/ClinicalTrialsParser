  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, multicenter, randomized, controlled, open-label trial of pimasertib
      versus dacarbazine aimed to confirm the activity of pimasertib in previously untreated
      subjects with N-Ras mutated locally advanced or metastatic malignant cutaneous melanoma by
      comparing the progression-free survival (PFS) of subjects treated with either pimasertib or
      dacarbazine and by getting a better understanding of the efficacy, safety, pharmacogenomics
      (PGx) and their relationship with pimasertib exposure.

          1. Subjects with measurable, histologically or cytologically confirmed, locally advanced
             or metastatic cutaneous melanoma (stage III c or M1ac) N-Ras mutated. If N-Ras
             mutational status is unknown at screening, it must be prospectively defined before
             inclusion. If N-Ras mutational status is already known before screening, it must be
             retrospectively confirmed after inclusion by the sponsor.

          2. Tumor lesions amenable to biopsy or available tumor tissue as archival samples.

          3. Age â‰¥ 18 years.

          4. Has read and understood the informed consent form and is willing and able to give
             informed consent. Fully understands requirements of the trial and willing to comply
             with all trial visits and assessments.

          5. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative blood pregnancy test at the
             screening visit. For the purposes of this trial, women of childbearing potential are

             of contraception for 2 weeks prior to, during and four weeks after the last dose of
             trial medication. Effective contraception is defined as the method of contraception
             with a failure rate of less than 1% per year. Adequate contraception is defined as
             follows: two barrier methods or one barrier method with a spermicidal or intrauterine
             device or oral contraception for female partners of male subjects.

             treatment.

         14. Has received extensive prior radiotherapy on more than 30% of bone marrow reserves,
             or prior bone marrow/stem cell transplantation within 5 years from Day 1 of trial
             drug treatment.

         15. Has history of any other significant medical disease such as major gastric or small
             bowel surgery, recent drainage of significant volumes of ascites or pleural effusion
             or has a psychiatric condition that might impair the subject well-being or preclude
             full participation in the trial.

         16. Has known hypersensitivity to dacarbazine.

         17. Is a pregnant or nursing female.

         18. Participated in another clinical trial within the past 28 days.
