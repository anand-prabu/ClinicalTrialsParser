Patients are randomized to one\n      of two treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral Ro 31-7453 twice daily on days 1-4. Treatment repeats\n           every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral Ro 31-7453 twice daily on days 1-14. Treatment repeats\n           every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed at 28 days and then every 3 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 160 patients (49 per treatment arm plus 61 additional\n      patients in the arm determined to be most effective) will be accrued for this study within 1\n      year."
