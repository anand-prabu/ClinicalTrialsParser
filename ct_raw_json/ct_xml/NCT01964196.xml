      To evaluate the safety and the dose-response of ASP1517 on Hemoglobin (Hb) correction in the
      treatment of anemia in non-dialysis Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) patients when ASP1517 is
      applied intermittently.  Patients will receive ASP1517 three times a week (TIW) for first
      6weeks.  Patients may have the second-randomization to TIW dosing or once-a-week (QW) dosing
      at Week 6, 8, 10, 12, 14 or 16 if patients meet the criteria.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Chronic kidney disease with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (as calculated by
             the Japanese GFR estimation equation) of &gt;=15 and =&lt;89 mL/min/1.73 m2, and not
             required dialysis for 3 months since study completion

          -  The mean of two Hb values at screening test and Hb test (at least one week apart form
             the screening test) is &lt;10.0 g/dL, with a difference of ≤1.0 g/dL between the two
             values

          -  Both TSAT&gt;=5% and ferritin &gt;=30 ng/mL at screening test

          -  Serum folate ≥4.0 ng/mL and Vitamin B12 ≥180 pg/mL at screening test

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Proliferative retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, retinal vein occlusion
             and/or macular edema that is considered to require treatment

          -  Immunological disease with severe inflammation as assessed by the Investigator; even
             if the inflammation is in remission, the subject is excluded (e.g. lupus
             erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, Sjogren's syndrome, celiac disease, etc).

          -  Having a history of gastric/intestinal resection considered influential on the
             absorption of the drug in the gastrointestinal tract or evidence of active
             gastroparesis.

          -  Uncontrollable hypertension (more than one third blood pressure values of diastolic
             BP &gt;100 mmHg within 16 weeks prior to screening test including)

          -  Congestive heart failure (NYHA classification III or higher)

          -  Having a history of hospitalization for stroke, myocardial infarction or lung
             infarction within 24 weeks before screening test

          -  Positive for any of the following: anti-hepatitis C virus antibody (anti-HCV Ab);
             hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg); or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)

          -  Anemia other than anemia due to low/absent renal production of EPO (e.g., iron
             deficiency anemia, hemolytic anemia, pancytopenia, etc)

          -  Using ESA, anabolic androgenic steroid, testosterone enanthate or mepitiostane within
             6 weeks before screening test
