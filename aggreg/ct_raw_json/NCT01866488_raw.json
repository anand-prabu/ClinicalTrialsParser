The\n      primary outcome to be studied is vaginal delivery rate for the Obstetric Cook Catheter in\n      combination with oral placebo and the Obstetric Cook Catheter in combination with oral\n      misoprostol. Secondary outcomes to be studied include the safety of the method, composite\n      maternal morbidity and composite neonatal morbidity.\n\n      The hypothesis is that there is a higher vaginal delivery rate in the patient whom receive\n      both the Obstetric Cook Catheter and the oral misoprostol."
