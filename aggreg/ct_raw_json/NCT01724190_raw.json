            "textblock": "Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease characterized by destruction of the insulin\n      secreting beta-cells of the pancreas.  There is evidence that Vitamin D may play a role in\n      the initial risk of development of autoimmune disease, including type 1 diabetes.  However,\n      Vitamin D may also play a role the natural progression of type 1 diabetes by altering innate\n      insulin secretion and sensitivity and by influencing systemic inflammation, directly at the\n      level of the beta-cell.  Studies have shown that Vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency is\n      frequently reported in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes.  A majority of newly\n      diagnosed patients with type 1 diabetes enter a period of partial clinical remission,\n      characterized by low or even absent insulin requirements, also known as a honeymoon period.\n      This honeymoon period is associated with improved metabolic control, near normal insulin\n      sensitivity, and recovery of beta-cell function leading to preservation of endogenous\n      insulin secretion.  We hypothesize that supplementation with Vitamin D in children and\n      adolescents with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes will halt the destructive process within\n      the beta cell and improve beta-cell function by increasing endogenous insulin secretion and\n      decreasing systemic inflammation, thereby increasing the rate of partial clinical remission."
