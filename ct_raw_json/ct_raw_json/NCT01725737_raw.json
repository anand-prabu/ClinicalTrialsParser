Most of parents of children with ADHD in Taiwan dislike to use psychostimulant.\n      We expect that GlyTI-M will have better efficacy than placebo to reduce ADHD symptoms. This\n      study will also help us to understand the mechanism of ADHD and give a way to develop new\n      drug and also a more possible way to treat ADHD children under 6 years old."
