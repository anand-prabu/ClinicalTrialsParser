Nurse endoscopists have been widely accepted in the United Kingdom for the\n      past 15 years as a valuable resource to cope with the increasing demand for endoscopic\n      service, in particular diagnostic colonoscopy for colorectal screening.  A pilot study\n      performed in Hong Kong in 2008 has shown that endoscopy nurses can be trained to perform\n      diagnostic endoscopy safely and reliably.  This study aims to demonstrate that properly\n      trained nurse endoscopists have a comparable proficiency in performing colonoscopy\n      procedures as their medical counterparts."
