It is not yet known whether paclitaxel is more effective than\n      docetaxel for breast cancer.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to study the effectiveness of paclitaxel or docetaxel in\n      treating women with stage IIIB or metastatic breast cancer."

Patients are randomized to 1\n      of 2 treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 1. Courses repeat every 3 weeks\n           in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 1. Courses repeat every 3\n           weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Quality of life is assessed at baseline and after courses 4 and 6.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 400 patients (200 per arm) will be accrued for this study."
