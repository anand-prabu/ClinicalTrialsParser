    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the ability of a largely self-administered geriatric assessment
      (GA) to predict toxicity in non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) patients ≥60 years old receiving
      chemotherapy or chemoimmunotherapy.

    <description>They will be treated with a single dose of rituximab 375mg/m2, once, by intravenous infusion 3-10 days prior to initiation of planned R-CHOP-like chemoimmunotherapy, and prednisone 50mg to 100 mg (preferred dose is 100mg) PO daily for 5-7 days (preferred duration is 7 days) of the 14 days prior to initiation of planned R-CHOP, R-EPOCH or R-CEPP chemoimmunotherapy. Pre-phase therapy may be given in either the inpatient or outpatient setting. After completion of a single course of pre-phase rituximab and prednisone as described above, further treatment will be according to the choice of the attending physician, in accordance with appropriate medical practice. It is expected, based on the inclusion criteria, that patients enrolled on the pre-phase arm will most often receive initial therapy consisting of R-CHOP, R-EPOCH or RCEPP chemoimmunotherapy for ≥ 2 cycles, but alternative therapies as deemed appropriate by the treating physician will not be considered violations of this protocol.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects meeting the following criteria will be eligible for enrollment in the study
        (unless excluded):

          -  ≥60 years old

          -  Pathologically confirmed NHL.

          -  Must meet criteria for initiation of treatment; consisting of:

          -  Aggressive histology, or

          -  Indolent histology with one of the following markers of large tumor burden (67):

          -  Any nodal or extranodal tumor mass ≥7cm in greatest dimension

          -  ≥3 nodal masses that are each ≥3 cm in greatest dimension

          -  Systemic symptoms

          -  Cytopenias (leukocytes &lt;1 × 109/L and/or platelets ,100 × 109/L)

          -  Substantial splenomegaly

          -  Serous effusion (plural effusion or peritoneal ascites)

          -  Orbital or epidural involvement

          -  Ureteral compression

          -  Leukemic phase (malignant cells ≥5 x 109/L)

          -  Must be starting a new chemotherapy regimen

          -  Fluent in English (because not all components of the GA have been validated in other
             languages)

          -  Able to provide informed consent

        In addition to the above, subjects meeting the following criteria will be enrolled in the
        pre-phase arm of the study, until the accrual target for that arm is reached:

          -  Age ≥ 70 years OR KPS ≤ 70

          -  Pathologically confirmed diagnosis of DLBCL, with or without simultaneous or
             antecedent indolent lymphoma.

          -  Previously untreated for DLBCL

          -  Intended initial treatment to include ≥2 cycles of R-CHOP, R-EPOCH or R-CEPP using
             standard doses and schedule.(68, 69) R-CHOP chemoimmunotherapy may be given every 14
             days or every 21 days. (4, 70)

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects meeting the following criteria will be excluded from enrollment in the study:

          -  Enrollment in a Phase I trial

          -  Previously enrollment in this study

          -  Patients scoring ≥ 11 on the BOMC (implying cognitive impairment) will be excluded
             since their ability to reliably complete the questionnaire will be in doubt Subjects
             meeting the following criteria will be excluded from enrollment in the pre-phase arm
             of the study, but may be included in the GA only arm.

          -  Contraindication to use of rituximab or prednisone including:

          -  Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus

          -  Systemic fungal infection

          -  Evidence of active hepatitis B infection (i.e. patients testing positive hepatitis B
             surface antigen or viral DNA by PCR analysis) will be excluded. Patients with
             evidence of past infection without active viremia (i.e. positive hepatitis B core
             antibody, negative hepatitis B surface antigen and negative hepatitis B DNA PCR) will
             be treated with entecavir as per institutional guidelines and may be included in the
             study.

          -  History of any serious adverse reaction to either a corticosteroid or rituximab not
             including rituximab infusion reactions ≤ Grade 3.

          -  Patients enrolled on another clinical trial which prohibits the use of pre-phase
             therapy or any of its components.
