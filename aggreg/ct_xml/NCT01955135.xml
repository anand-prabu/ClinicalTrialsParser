  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Premature infants experience more respiratory problems after surgical procedures. The
      investigators aimed to compare general anesthesia with sedation on the need for
      post-operative mechanical ventilation in infants undergoing retinopathy of prematurity
      surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      60 patients who underwent laser surgery due to retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) were
      included in the study. The sedation group (Group S, n=30), received 1 mg/kg ketamine and 1
      mg/kg propofol as a bolus for induction. The patients then received an infusion of 100-150
      mcg/kg/min propofol and 0.25mg/kg/h of ketamine for maintenance. In the general anesthesia
      group (Group G, n=30), anesthesia was induced using 8% sevoflurane by inhalation with 50%
      nitrous oxide in oxygen; endotracheal intubation was facilitated without use of a
      neuromuscular blocker agent. Anesthesia was maintained with  sevoflurane (2%) and 50%
      nitrous oxide in oxygen. Our primary objective was to evaluate the need for post-operative
      mechanical ventilation.

    <description>Most of premature infants have chronic lung disease, for this reason endotracheal intubation causes some problems, because they have irritable airway. Administration of sedation and avoiding endotracheal intubation can be better for postsurgical outcomes.
How many infants needed endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation were recorded.</description>
