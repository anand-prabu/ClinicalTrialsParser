In this pilot,\n      40 healthy children, 12 through 35 months of age, including some children at risk of febrile\n      seizure, will be randomized to receive prophylactic acetaminophen or oral placebo\n      immediately following and every 4 to 6 hours in the 24 hours after receipt of a dose of IIV.\n       Data derived from the pilot study will be used to assess the feasibility of conducting a\n      larger scale study.  Feasibility will include assessments of the speed and ease of study\n      recruitment and adherence to and completion of study assessments.  Children will be followed\n      for the occurrence of fever, fussiness, changes in appetite and sleep patterns, and use of\n      medical services on the day of and day following vaccination.  Antibody to influenza\n      antigens contained in the 2013-2014 vaccine as measured by hemagglutination inhibition (HAI)\n      antibody will be assessed at baseline and four weeks following vaccination.  The proportions\n      of children experiencing fever, having solicited reactions, using medical services,\n      demonstrating a serologic response corresponding to seroprotection and seroconversion to\n      each of the IIV antigens will be determined for groups of children receiving acetaminophen\n      and placebo.  Likewise geometric mean HAI titers (GMT) and corresponding 95% confidence\n      intervals for each IIV antigen will be calculated for both vaccine groups."

The child must be 12 through 35 months of age.\n\n          2. The child must only need a single dose of IIV during the current season. (Children\n             only need 1 dose of vaccine in 2013-14 if they received a total of 2 or more doses of\n             seasonal vaccine since July 1, 2010. Children who did not receive a total of 2 or\n             more doses of seasonal vaccine since July 1, 2010 require 2 doses in 2013-14).[19]\n\n          3.

Immunosuppression as a result of an underlying illness or treatment, or use of\n             anti-cancer chemotherapy or radiation therapy within the preceding 36 months.\n\n         14.
