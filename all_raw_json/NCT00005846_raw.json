Patients are stratified according to prior substantive\n      treatment (yes vs no).\n\n      Patients receive oral tipifarnib twice daily on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks\n      for a maximum of 4 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.\n      Patients with continued hematologic response after completion of the fourth course may\n      receive additional courses at the discretion of the investigator.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 25 patients (12-13 per stratum) will be accrued for this study\n      within 25 months."
