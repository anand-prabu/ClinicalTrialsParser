The study is performed to investigate whether or not\n      performing hysterectomy for benign conditions with robotic surgery will be advantageous in\n      terms of shorter operating time, less complications, less conversions to open surgery, and\n      shorter hospital stay in comparison to other minimally invasive procedures such as vaginal\n      hysterectomy and traditional laparoscopic hysterectomy."
