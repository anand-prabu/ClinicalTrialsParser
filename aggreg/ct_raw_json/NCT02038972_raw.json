Autologous human umbilical cord blood therapy, which has\n      been used for over twenty years, has an excellent safety record. This study will determine\n      if autologous human umbilical cord blood infusion in children with hearing loss is safe and\n      feasible, improves inner ear function, audition, and language development.  The patients\n      umbilical cord stem cells collected at birth and stored at Cord Blood Registry will be used\n      for infusion."
