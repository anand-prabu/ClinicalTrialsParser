            "textblock": "Study Design Multinodular Goiter (MNG) patients requiring surgery were referred to the\n      Endocrine Surgery Unit.\n\n      Indirect laryngoscopy was routinely performed preoperatively to assess normal motility in\n      vocal folds (VF). Ultrasounds (US) study was performed the month previous to surgery to\n      evaluate thyroid volume. Eligible patients met the following criteria: to have MNG, age\n      between 18 and 80 and consent to be included in the study. Exclusion criteria included\n      previous neck surgery, vocal fold impairment, permanent or transitory NSAID or analgesic\n      treatment, coagulation disorders and any cognitive impairment.\n\n      Eligible patients were proposed to enter a randomized study with 2 arms in which we compared\n      the use of two harmonic scalpel devices: ACE14S and Harmonic Focus (Ethicon Endo-Surgery,\n      Cincinnati, OH, USA).\n\n      The main endpoint was operative time. Secondary endpoints were total and relative (%) time\n      of use of the device along thyroidectomy, recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) injury and\n      hypocalcaemia (both persistent or temporary), number of ligatures, length of skin incision,\n      postoperative pain according to a visual scale of pain, QOL after thyroidectomy (EuroQOL)\n      and budget impact analysis.\n\n      All patients were operated on by 2 surgeons, one senior (responsible for the Endocrine\n      Surgery Unit) and one junior under supervision.\n\n      Randomization Randomization was performed the same day of surgery at the OR by using a\n      closed envelope. Patients were randomized to Group I (ACE14S) or Group II (HF) and allocated\n      in a 1:1 proportion; they reminded blinded until the end of the study about the device used.\n\n      The haemostasis device was communicated to the surgeon previous to start surgery. Medical\n      staff of the Endocrine Surgery Unit collected clinical data.\n\n      Surgical Technique Total thyroidectomy (TT), defined as total bilateral extracapsular\n      lobectomy 9, was performed using HF or ACE14S for vessel division. Monopolar and bipolar\n      forceps for cutting and coagulation were routinely used. Ties were used under surgeon's\n      criteria according to size of the vessels and/or the need to obtain haemostasis in the\n      vicinity of the RLN when bipolar forceps were not considered safe enough."
