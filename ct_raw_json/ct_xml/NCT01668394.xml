  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronary heart disease is one the most common cause of death in Denmark and is also a
      chronic disease that 300,000 people in the country are living with. Cardiac rehabilitation
      is of great significance for this group of people because of its potential to reduce
      mortality and morbidity. However a lot of people are not succeeding in changing their
      lifestyle in a positive direction, and it is a great challenge to develop new methods which
      can help the patients to maintain a more healthy lifestyle in the long run. A concept for
      patient education, called learning and coping, has been developed in Norway. It is a health
      education method based on a high degree of involvement from the participants and on what is
      important for them. Planning, performance and evaluation happens in close cooperation
      between the health staff and so-called experienced patients. The course begins and ends with
      individual clarifying conversations.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of the concept of learning and coping
      strategies in cardiac rehabilitation on quality of life, risc- and lifestyle factors,
      morbidity and mortality.

      The number of participants are estimated to 750 ptt.s with datacollection at baseline, just
      after rehabilitation and 3 months after rehabilitation. It is carried out as an open
      randomized controlled parallel group study in three hospitals in Hospitalsenheden Vest,
      Central Denmark Region, where the participants is randomized to either the intervention
      group with learning and coping strategies or to the standard group without the strategies.
      The rehabilitation courses in both groups lasts for eight weeks and consists of both
      training and educations sessions. The concept of learning and coping is applied to the
      intervention group by letting 'experienced patients' participate in the education and not
      using standardized teaching slides. Also clarifying individual conversations are completed
      before and after the course. The 1:1 randomization is computer generated and is stratified
      by hospital, diagnosis and gender. All analyses will be performed after the principle of
      'intention to treat'.
