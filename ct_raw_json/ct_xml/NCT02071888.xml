  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many tumor cells, in contrast to normal cells, have been shown to require the amino acid
      glutamine to produce energy for growth and survival.  To exploit the dependence of tumors on
      glutamine, CB-839, a potent and selective inhibitor of the first enzyme in glutamine
      utilization, glutaminase, will be tested in this Phase 1 study in patients with advanced
      hematologic malignancies.

      This study is an open-label Phase 1 evaluation of CB-839 in subjects with hematological
      tumors.  Patients will receive CB-839 capsules orally three times daily.  The study will be
      conducted in 2 parts.  Part 1 is a dose escalation study to identify the recommended Phase 2
      dose. In Part 2, all patients will receive the recommended Phase 2 dose. Both Parts 1 and 2
      will enroll patients with advanced and/or treatment-refractory Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL),
      Multiple Myeloma (MM), or Waldenström's macroglobulinemia (WM).  All patients will be
      assessed for safety, pharmacokinetics (plasma concentration of drug), pharmacodynamics
      (inhibition of glutaminase), biomarkers (biochemical markers that may predict responsiveness
      in later studies), and tumor response.
