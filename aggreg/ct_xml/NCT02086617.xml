      The purpose of this study is to investigate prevalence of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA)
      among male patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). Secondary purpose is to document
      cost-effectiveness of ultrasound screening of AAA in selected population.

      Ethiology of AAA is known to be common with atherosclerotic arterial diseases, and on the
      basis of our previous studies (ClinicalTrials.gov ID CAD-AAA-02) the prevalence of AAA seems
      to be higher in CAD population than unselected male population. This leads to hypothesis
      that selective screening of these patients (for AAA) could be cost-efficient and life saving
      option for detecting AAAs before rupture.

      Study will be carried out as a single-center prospective screening study. Patients will be
      selected for this study on basis of their ICD 10 diagnose codes in North Carelian patient
      information system. Inclusion criteria will be any kind of atherosclerotic heart disease
      (ICD10 codes I20-I25). Criteria for exclusion are malignant disease, already diagnosed or
      treated AAA and failure to give informed consent.

      800 patient records that meet the inclusion criteria will be reviewed for eligibility.
      Invitations for screening will be sent for 600 patients with intention to have at least 400
      patients screened. Screening will be done by verified sonographers in designated screening
      appointments.
