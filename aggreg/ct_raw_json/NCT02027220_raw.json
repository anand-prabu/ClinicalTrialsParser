Granulocyte Clone Stimulating\n      Factor (G-CSF) possesses the ability to mobilize the plasma cells to detach from myeloma\n      niche, so as to promote drug sensitivity.\n\n      PURPOSE: This phase \u2161 trial is to study how well combination of G-CSF, bortezomib,\n      cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone works in treating patients with multiple myeloma."
