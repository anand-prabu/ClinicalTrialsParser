For this purpose the PK profile of 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) will be compared\n      after administration of a single dose of each of the two formulations, under fasting\n      conditions. The secondary objective is to assess the safety and tolerability of the test\n      product, mercaptopurine oral 100 mg/5 mL suspension."
