  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is a chronic respiratory condition characterized by eosinophilic airway inflammation.
      Individuals with classic asthma experience paroxysmal symptoms including cough, wheeze,
      shortness of breath and chest tightness. Cough variant asthma (CVA) is asthma in which
      chronic cough (cough lasting eight weeks or more) is the sole or predominant symptom of
      asthma. The pathophysiologic mechanisms which differentiate asthma, CVA, and eosinophilic
      bronchitis without asthma are not fully understood. We have recently identified individuals
      with chronic cough who cough during methacholine but have normal airway sensitivity (ie. do
      not have asthma or CVA) and may or may not have eosinophilic bronchitis. The purpose of this
      research is to examine the pathophysiologic differences between three causes of chronic
      cough: asthma, cough variant asthma and methacholine-induced cough with normal airway
      sensitivity.

      The objectives of this research are to compare (i) the bronchodilating and (ii) the
      bronchoprotective effects of deep inspirations (DIs) in individuals with: (a) asthma, (b)
      CVA and (c) methacholine-induced cough but normal airway sensitivity.

      Hypotheses:

      i. The bronchodilating effect of a DI will be: (a) absent or impaired in individuals with
      classic asthma; (b) impaired in individuals with CVA; and (c) preserved in individuals with
      methacholine-induced cough but normal airway sensitivity.

      ii. The bronchoprotective effect of a DI will be: (a) absent in individuals with classic
      asthma; (b) impaired in individuals with CVA; and (c) preserved in those with
      methacholine-induced cough but normal airway sensitivity.

    <description>The bronchodilating effect of a DI will be examined using responses to high-dose methacholine challenge testing (Visit 1) in these subgroups by comparing the mid-expiratory flow difference between the partial and full flow-volumes loops at 40% above RV from the forced vital capacity (FVC) (PEF40 and MEF40 respectively) at PC20 and PC50 with that recorded at baseline.</description>
