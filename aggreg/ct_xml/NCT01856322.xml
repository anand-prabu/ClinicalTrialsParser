      Background:

      - Some types of inflammation may increase the risk of cancers in the intestinal track.
      Because of this possibility, anti-inflammatory drugs may be able to prevent tumor growth and
      spread. One such drug, sulindac, may be helpful to study. Researchers want to see if people
      who are having surgery to remove intestinal tumors from advanced colorectal cancer will
      benefit from sulindac. It will be tested against a placebo.

      Objectives:

      - To see if sulindac can improve treatment outcomes in people who are having surgery for
      advanced colorectal cancer.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who are having surgery for advanced colorectal
      cancer.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood samples
           will be collected. Imaging studies and heart and lung function tests may also be given.

        -  Participants will be separated into two groups. One group will take sulindac. The other
           will take a placebo.

        -  Participants will take sulindac or placebo twice daily from about 2 to 3 weeks before
           the scheduled surgery. Seven days before the surgery, they will stop taking the pills.

        -  Participants will have surgery to remove their tumors. The surgery will also remove
           affected organ tissue.

        -  Participants will start to take the pills again once they have recovered from surgery.
           They will continue taking the sulindac or placebo twice a day for 3 years, or for as
           long as the tumors do not return.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  Despite strong evidence for a causative role of inflammatory mediators in intestinal
           cancer, the underlying mechanisms remain obscure. Established evidence indicates
           activation of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway is an early step in the malignant
           transformation of colorectal adenomas with persistent activation in 90% of colorectal
           cancers. Activation of this pathway ultimately effects transcription of the S100A4
           gene.

        -  S100A4 transcript serum levels have been shown to correlate with risk of recurrence in
           colorectal cancer and patients with systemic metastases are found to have increased
           S100A4 transcript expression.

        -  S100A4 may be a novel prognostic biomarker in colorectal cancer.

        -  Cyclooxygenase-2 is a key enzyme involved in the inflammatory response and is a key
           target of molecular chemoprevention in colorectal adenoma prevention trials.

        -  Recent studies demonstrate mitigation of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling by COX-2 inhibition
           via administration of the NSAID sulindac using in vitro and in vivo animal models.

        -  We hypothesize that sulindac administration will abrogate Wnt/beta-catenin mediated
           signaling and thus decrease S100A4 activity in patients with colorectal metastases.

        -  We propose to define the benefit of sulindac administration to patients with colorectal
           metastases following resection and validate the use of circulating S100A4 transcripts
           as a novel biomarker for disease recurrence.
