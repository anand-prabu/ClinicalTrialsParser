The following\n      measurements will be performed at baseline and 2 years post-randomization to determine\n      whether high-dose vitamin D supplementation vs. placebo: 1) Produces small increases or\n      reduces bone loss in spine, hip, and total body areal bone density as assessed by DXA; 2)\n      reduces bone turnover as assessed by biomarkers of bone resorption and formation; 3)\n      Improves measures of bone structure at the distal radius and tibia; 4) results in changes in\n      body composition assessed by DXA. Parallel assessments of the effects of omega-3 fatty acids\n      will be performed. This study may elucidate the mechanisms through which high-dose vitamin D\n      may prevent age-related fractures and provide new insights into the role of vitamin D on\n      skeletal health and body composition."
