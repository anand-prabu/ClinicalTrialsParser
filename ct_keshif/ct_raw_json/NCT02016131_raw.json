With the help of CQDSA, a quantitative evaluation of the endoleak hemodynamics and a\n      risk analysis of the type I endoleak could be performed during the EVAR procedure. This\n      approach may offer an objective assessment of the needs for immediate re-intervention,\n      conservative therapy or treatment endpoint in the future."

A small\n      circle ROI is selected in the vicinity of the endoleak entry which reflected the endoleak\n      hemodynamics of the endoleak to the utmost extent, and a reference at the same latitude\n      within the aorta.\n\n      The following parameters will be acquired through the CQDSA for analysis.\n\n        1. Time-versus-ROI contrast intensity graph. The graph contains one endoleak ROI flow\n           curve and one reference aortic flow curve (Ref). The x-axis shows time from 0 second to\n           the maximum frame time of the image. The y-axis shows the sum of pixel intensities,\n           namely total contrast, representing the contrast concentration within the ROI.\n\n        2. ROI Peak/Ref Peak. It is the ratio of intensity peak between the endoleak and the\n           reference in the aorta.\n\n        3. ROI TTP (Time to peak). Peak time of ROI in the vicinity of endoleak entry.\n\n        4. ROI AUC/Ref AUC. Area under curve (AUC) is calculated through Time-versus-ROI contrast\n           intensity graph.
