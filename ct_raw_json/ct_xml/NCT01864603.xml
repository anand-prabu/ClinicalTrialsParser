  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The SEARCH study will evaluate the health, economic and educational impact of early HIV
      diagnosis and immediate antiretroviral treatment using a streamlined care delivery system in
      rural communities in East Africa.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The SEARCH study is a cluster randomized community trial of 32 communities each with
      approximately 10,000 residents.  Annual community health campaigns will be conducted in all
      study communities and will offer HIV testing and multi-disease prevention and treatment
      services.  The intervention is antiretroviral therapy (ART), independent of CD4 cell count,
      delivered in a streamlined approach for all HIV infected adults and children.  Components of
      streamlined care include ongoing HIV combination prevention strategies including male
      circumcision. Control communities will receive annual testing campaigns and ART will follow
      country guidelines for ART.

      HIV incidence will be measured using an efficient community cohort design (ECCO) comprised
      of three key elements: A) baseline household community level census, B) annual community
      health campaigns (CHC) incorporating HIV testing that use unique identifiers to link
      individuals between successive waves of the intervention, and C) tracking and evaluation of
      individuals who do not participate in annual CHCs.
