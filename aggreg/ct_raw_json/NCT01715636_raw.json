            "textblock": "This study aims to describe the safety, tolerability and adherence to the coformulated\n      anti-HIV drug tenofovir-emtricitabine-rilpivirine (eviplera) when given to men who have sex\n      with men (MSM) following an actual or potential sexual exposure to HIV. This biomedical\n      intervention is known as nonoccupational post-exposure prophylaxis (NPEP). Patients receive\n      NPEP if they meet the criteria outlined in the 2007 National Australian NPEP Guidelines.\n      Three or two anti-HIV drugs are administered for 28-days depending on the severity of the\n      the assessed HIV acquisition risk. In this study eviplera would constitute 3-drug NPEP.\n      Tenofovir-emtricitabine (truvada) a component of eviplera has been used in NPEP at SVH since\n      2006.\n\n      This is a multi site, prospective, open-label, non-randomised trial. Participants will be\n      MSM who present at the various recruitment sites requesting NPEP. Initially, 50 eligible\n      participants will be assigned to receive eviplera 25mg once daily taken with food for\n      28-days according to established Australian guidelines for the use of 3-drug NPEP. There\n      will be 7 visits over a 12-week period. Follow-up post NPEP is for 8 weeks. If an interim\n      analysis demonstrates acceptable safety, it is proposed to seek ethics approval to increase\n      the samples size to 100 patients to gain more accurate information on regimen completion\n      rate and on-drug adherence.\n\n      The primary study objectives are:\n\n        1. To describe the safety of 28 days of NPEP using co-formulated FTC-RPV-TDF\n\n        2. To describe the tolerability of 28 days of NPEP using FTC-RPV-TDF\n\n        3. To describe on-drug adherence and regimen completion rates of 28 days of NPEP using\n           FTC-RPV-TDF"
