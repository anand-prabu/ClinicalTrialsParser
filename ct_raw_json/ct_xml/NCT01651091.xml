      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of an eight-week long group-based
      secular intervention known as Meditation Awareness Training (MAT) on psychosocial
      functioning in prison participants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Western practitioner settings, Buddhist principles are increasingly being used in the
      treatment of a wide range of mental health issues. However, there is a dearth of high
      quality research examining the effects of Buddhist-derived interventions (BDIs) on mental
      health in forensic settings. The purpose of this study is to assess the salutary effects and
      acceptability of a secularised group-based eight-week BDI known as Meditation Awareness
      Training (MAT) against relevant predictors of adaptive psychosocial functioning and mental
      health in violent offenders. A randomized controlled trial (RCT) design will be employed
      structured with reference to CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) 2010
      guidelines. English speaking adult males (aged 18-65 years) serving indeterminate prison
      sentences for offences of instrumental violence at a category B prison will be invited to
      receive MAT on a voluntary basis. Computer-generated numbers will be used to randomly
      allocate prison participants (n=102 - based on statistical power calculations) to either an
      intervention or 'treatment as usual' (TAU) control condition.  Measures will be taken pre-
      and post-intervention and at three-month follow-up to assess maintenance effects.
