      The purpose of this Collaborative R01, under Program Announcement PAR-09-153, is to conduct
      a full-scale trial of an intervention to assist mothers living with HIV (MLH) with
      disclosing their serostatus to their young age 6 - 14 year old), well children. A pilot
      study of the intervention has recently been completed (R01 MH077493) and met its major aims.
      The basis for development of the pilot intervention was work from three R01s (MH057207,
      currently Yr. 14) designed to longitudinally assess MLH and their children. Within that
      work, several studies were conducted on maternal disclosure, suggesting disclosure is
      difficult, and outcomes for MLH and children could be improved by intervention. The pilot
      study, known in the community as Teaching, Raising, And Communicating with Kids (TRACK), was
      based on integrative disclosure theory. Results of the pilot trial indicate that those in
      the intervention group were six times more likely to disclose their HIV/AIDS status to their
      child than those in the control group (O.R. 6.33); by the 9-month follow-up 33% of
      intervention MLH disclosed, compared to only 7.3% of the control group. Perhaps more
      importantly, the intervention group's emotional functioning and their satisfaction improved
      significantly following the intervention, compared to the control group. Similarly, child
      mental health indicators among children of intervention MLH were significantly better than
      control group children at follow-ups. In this study, TRACK II, we propose to conduct a
      full-scale trial of the intervention in two sites: (1) Los Angeles county (Site 1, where the
      pilot trial was conducted), which will include a high proportion of Latina families and a
      smaller proportion of African-American and White families; and (2) Atlanta, Georgia (Site 2,
      where the primary consultant on the pilot trial conducts research), which will include a
      high proportion of Southern African-American families, as well as White families. MLH and
      their children (N = 440 total; 110 mothers and 110 children per site, n = 220 per site) will
      be assessed at baseline and at 3, 9, and 15-month follow-ups. MLH will be randomly assigned
      to the intervention or control. Aims are to:

        1. facilitate disclosure of the mothers' HIV status to the children, which will include
           secondary aims of:

             1. increasing mothers' self-efficacy to disclose and respond to child questions
                regarding HIV;

             2. reducing mothers' fears regarding disclosure and stigma;

             3. improving maternal knowledge of child development and how to provide appropriate
                levels of information given the age of the child;

        2. improve MLH mental health indicators over time (i.e., depression, anxiety, quality of
           life);

        3. improve child mental health indicators over time (i.e., depression, anxiety, acting out
           behaviors); and

        4. improve family functioning indicators (e.g., cohesion, perceived closeness between
           mother and child).
