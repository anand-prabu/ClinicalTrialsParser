            "textblock": "Preterm infants are at high risk for feeding issues.  Feeding difficulties lead to prolonged\n      hospitalization, increase medical complications and raise parental anxiety. The transition\n      from tube feeding to oral feeding is an especially important step in a preterm infant's\n      early life.  Currently, there is limited evidence to guide this transition.  There are two\n      commonly used schedules for transitioning preterm infants to oral feeding: an every 6 hour\n      schedule and an every 3 hour schedule.  However, there is currently no evidence to guide\n      providers in their choice of oral feeding schedule.\n\n      The primary objective of this study is to explore whether an every 6 (q6) hour oral feeding\n      schedule will improve time to full oral feedings as compared to an every 3 (q3) hour oral\n      feeding schedule. The secondary objectives are to test whether every 6 hour feeding allows\n      for improved medical stability and oral-motor coordination as compared to the other commonly\n      used q3 hour schedule.  Each infant will be randomly assigned to a q6 hour or q3 hour oral\n      feeding schedule.  Data on oral feeding progression, respiratory status and oral motor\n      proficiency will be collected and compared.  The study will collect data on how long it\n      takes each infant to get to full oral feeds, respiratory status throughout their time of\n      oral feeding, whether there were any episodes of medical complications, measures of oral\n      motor feeding skills, and the time to discharge from the hospital.  This study is a crucial\n      first step towards determining which feeding schedule is optimal for preterm infants to\n      ensure timely attainment of full oral feeds and hospital discharge without compromising\n      medical stability."
