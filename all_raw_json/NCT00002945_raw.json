Combining chemotherapy with peripheral stem cell\n      transplantation may allow the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill\n      more cancer cells. Interleukin-2 may stimulate a person's white blood cells to kill leukemia\n      cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase III trial to study the effectiveness of high-dose combination chemotherapy,\n      peripheral stem cell transplantation, and interleukin-2 in treating patients who have acute\n      myeloid leukemia."

Beginning 12\n           hours after the last dose of cytarabine, patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF)\n           subcutaneously (SQ) each day until blood counts recover.\n\n      Intensification\n\n        -  Patients receive etoposide IV over 34.3 hours followed 1 hour later by cyclophosphamide\n           IV over 2 hours for 3 days. Beginning 24 hours after the last dose of cyclophosphamide,\n           patients receive G-CSF SQ each day until blood counts recover.\n\n      Peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) are harvested and selected for CD34+ cells. Patients\n      receive melphalan IV over 1 hour on day -4 followed by total body irradiation on days -3,\n      -2, and -1. PBSC are reinfused on day 0.\n\n      When blood counts recover, patients receive high dose interleukin-2 SQ on days 1-10 followed\n      by low dose interleukin-2 SQ on days 11-13. Interleukin-2 treatment repeats every 14 days\n      for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with\n      immunologic response to 6 courses of interleukin-2 treatment may continue for 6 additional\n      courses.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 100 patients will be accrued for this study over 5 years."
