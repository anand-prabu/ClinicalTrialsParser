            "textblock": "IVH occurs in about 40 percent of intracerebral hemorrhage cases and 15 percent of\n      aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage cases. Evidence supports a strong contribution of IVH to\n      morbidity and mortality after cerebral hemorrhage. External ventricular drainage (EVD) is\n      required clinical management; however, EVD via intraventricular catheter alone fails to\n      prevent much of the morbidity and mortality of IVH. This study seeks to demonstrate the\n      safety and efficacy of intraventricular thrombolysis, using rt-PA, as a method of removing\n      this blood and altering morbidity and mortality. Patients will receive intraventricular\n      injections of rt-PA or placebo every 12 hours. They will be followed prospectively with\n      daily head CT scans during the acute-treatment phase and again between Days 28 and 32."
