Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage cancer\n      cells. Umbilical cord blood transplantation may allow doctors to give higher doses of\n      chemotherapy or radiation therapy and kill more cancer cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and\n      umbilical cord blood transplantation in treating patients with hematologic cancer."

Determine the safety, efficacy, and toxicity of using cord blood as a source\n      for stem cell transplantation in patients with hematologic malignancies.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients undergo autologous bone marrow harvesting or peripheral stem cell\n      collection prior to transplant regimen, unless the patient has acute leukemia in relapse,\n      aplastic anemia, or myelodysplastic syndrome. Arm I: Patients eligible to undergo total body\n      irradiation (TBI) first receive cyclophosphamide IV over 2 hours on days -5 and -4, then\n      undergo TBI twice a day on days -3 to -1. Patients also receive antithymocyte globulin (ATG)\n      IV over 10 hours on days -3 to -1. Cord blood is infused on day 0. Arm II: Patients not\n      eligible to receive TBI receive oral busulfan every 6 hours on days -7 to -4 for a total of\n      16 doses. Cyclophosphamide, ATG, and cord blood are then administered as in arm I. All\n      patients receive cyclosporine on days -2 to 180, methylprednisolone on days 5-180, and\n      filgrastim (G-CSF) from day 1. Patients are followed weekly until day 180 and then monthly\n      for 2 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients (10 patients per arm) will be accrued for this\n      study within 4 years."
