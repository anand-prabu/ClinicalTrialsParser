  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In current clinical practice, an acceptable standard treatment for high risk prostate cancer
      is radiation therapy in combination with hormone therapy (called Treatment B or Group B in
      this study).  However, despite our best treatments, there is a risk that the prostate cancer
      may eventually return.  As well, the hormonal therapy that is given to treat the prostate
      cancer is known to cause some harmful effects, with some patients using the hormones gaining
      weight, developing diabetes, having increased cholesterol levels, having increased blood
      pressure, and/or heart problems.

      This study is looking at whether Metformin, a drug that is commonly used to treat diabetes,
      can prevent patients from developing some of the harmful effects of the hormonal therapy.
      In treating diabetes, Metformin is known to decrease patients' sugar levels and also
      prevents patients from gaining weight, decreases their cholesterol levels, decreases the
      number of heart problems and allows patients to live longer.  As a result, the researchers
      in this study are hopeful that Metformin will also be beneficial for men with prostate
      cancer on hormonal therapy by preventing them from developing these problems.

      This study will examine the role of Metformin as a means to prevent increases in weight as
      well as the prevalence and severity of metabolic syndrome, with their associated morbidity,
      amongst men with high risk, biopsy confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate (PCa) that are
      planned to receive curative intent therapy with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and
      external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) to the prostate.

      Males of any age with biopsy confirmed high risk PCa (any T3; and/or Gleason Score ≥ 8.0;
      and/or PSA ≥ 20 ng/mL), ECOG 0-1, non-diabetic with no evidence of metastatic PCa will with
      randomized to either:

      Group A:  Metformin 500mg PO TID for 3 years total, with Neoadjuvant and adjuvant ADT for
      2-3 years and EBRT of 46 Gy/23# to pelvic lymph nodes; plus prostate boost to 78 Gy/39#

      OR

      Group B:  Identical placebo TID for 3 years total, with Neoadjuvant and adjuvant ADT for 2-3
      years and EBRT of 46 Gy/23# to pelvic lymph nodes; plus prostate boost to 78 Gy/39#

      A planned sample size of 104 patients will provide 97% power for a 2-tailed α of 0.05 to
      detect 4 kg difference in weight at 12 months of follow-up.
