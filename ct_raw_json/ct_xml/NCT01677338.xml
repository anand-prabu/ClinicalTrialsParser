  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a multi-center, open-label comparison study and aimed to evaluate the
      preliminary performance of this 13C-uracil GEBT to examine its abilities of identifying
      abnormal (accelerated or delayed) gastric emptying rates in subjects.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately equal numbers of subjects will be enrolled in each of the 3 groups (with
      normal gastric emptying, with rapid (accelerated) gastric emptying, and with delayed gastric
      emptying (gastroparesis)) to complete at least 10 subjects per group.

      The subjects will first have their gastric emptying rates investigated by scintigraphy using
      the Solid Test Meal containing 500 uCi 99mTc sulfur colloid at Visit 1.  Second, the
      subjects will have their gastric emptying rates investigated by scintigraphy and 13C-uracil
      GEBT simultaneously using the Semi solid Test Meal containing 500 uCi 99mTc sulfur colloid
      and 100 mg of 13C-uracil, respectively, at Visit 2.  A comparison will be made between the
      results obtained at Visits 1 and 2 along with a comparison of the data obtained during Visit
      2 for evaluation of the 13C-uracil GEBT.
