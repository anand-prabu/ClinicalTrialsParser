      The aim of the study is to determine whether spontaneous LH peak is superior to human
      chorionic gonadotropin before a transfer of a day 3 frozen embryo.

    <textblock>
      For surplus embryos after fresh IVF-cycles, cryopreservation has become common medical
      practice. These frozen embryos are mostly replaced in an artificial cycle with exogenous
      estrogen and progesterone or in a natural cycle. Often, hCG is administered as an ovulation
      induction agent for scheduling purposes.

      Successful implantation requires a co-ordinated series of events allowing a timely dialogue
      between a receptive endometrium and the intrusive blastocyst . The period of receptivity is
      thought to be 3 days in human. It is suggested that blastocyst apposition begins about day
      LH+6 and is completed by day LH+10

      In general, the aim is to transfer the embryo during the 'window of implantation', what is
      defined as the period during which the uterus is receptive for implantation of the
      free-lying blastocyst.  This has been a subject of debate since many years.

      A prospective study by Fatemi et al. (2010) revealed a significantly higher ongoing
      pregnancy rate after transferring frozen-thawed embryos in natural cycles with a spontaneous
      LH peak compared with natural cycles controlled by hCG for final oocyte maturation and
      ovulation (31.1% vs. 14.3%, respectively). In this trial, FrET (frozen embryo transfer) was
      planned 5 days after the LH surge or 5 days after the administration of 5000IU of hCG.

      In order to optimize the synchronization in the hCG group, and therefore enhance the
      pregnancy rates, the aim is to plan a FrET 6 days after hCG administration instead of 5
      days.  The rationale behind is that day 3 frozen embryos are thawed the day before embryo
      transfer, which means  they are already at day 4 of the embryonic development.
