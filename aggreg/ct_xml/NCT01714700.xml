      Background: The interactive effects of resistance training and dietary protein on hormonal
      responses in overweight or obese adults are not clear and remain controversial.
      Investigators tested the effect of an isocaloric high-protein diet on body composition,
      ghrelin, and metabolic and hormonal parameters during a 12-week resistance training program
      in untrained overweight healthy young men.

      Methodology: Investigators randomized 18 healthy young males to a standard diet (ST group)
      or an isocaloric high protein diet (HP group). Subjects in both groups participated in a 12
      week-resistance exercise program. Investigators measured body composition, lipid profile,
      homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) indices, total ghrelin, and
      exercise related hormones at baseline and 12 weeks.
