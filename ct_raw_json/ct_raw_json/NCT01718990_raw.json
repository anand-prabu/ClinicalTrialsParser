The people who have IPF will be\n      followed for 12 months to collect more biological samples and record clinically relevant\n      information.\n\n      The goal of this study is to identify new molecular markers that are measurable and reliable\n      in people who have IPF. It is hoped that these markers can be used in future drug studies to\n      signifiacantly speed up the process of finding drugs that help."

We expect that levels of some of these mechanistic markers will be measurable in patient samples, and may be differentially present in IPF compared to normal controls.
