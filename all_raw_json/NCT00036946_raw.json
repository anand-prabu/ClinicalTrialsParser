The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6\n      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, 5 additional\n      patients are treated at the MTD.\n\n      Patients are followed at 1 and 4 weeks.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 30 patients will be accrued for this study."
