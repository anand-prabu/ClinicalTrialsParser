The imaging results will ultimately be compared to final pathology as the gold\n      standard.  If the accuracy of FDG-PET-MRI is improved as compared to standard MDCT, the\n      investigators plan to conduct a larger follow-up study to confirm the results of this pilot\n      study.  In addition, this pilot study will set the stage for the evaluation of novel PET\n      tracers in the imaging of bladder cancer."
