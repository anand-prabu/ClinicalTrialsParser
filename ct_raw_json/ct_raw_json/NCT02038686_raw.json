            "textblock": "1. Introduction:\n\n           Controversy exists with regard to whether to treat AO/OTA (Orthopaedic Trauma\n           Association) 32.A2 - 32-A3 fractures of the proximal part of the femur with an\n           intramedullary short PFN-A or long PFN-A. A prospective, randomized, controlled trial\n           is performed to compare the outcome treatment of these unstable fractures of the\n           proximal part of the femur with either a short PFN-A (170-240mm) or long PFN-A\n           (300-420mm).\n\n        2. Objectives and Hypothesis The hypothesis is that the Short PFN-A would have fewer\n           complications than Long PFN-A\n\n           Main Objective: Is defined as Total number of complications between PFN-A short and\n           PFN-A long. Outcome measures were subdivided into preoperative, perioperative and\n           post-operative. Follow up data at four weeks, three months and one year.\n\n           Secondary objectives: Complete and uneventful radiological and clinical healing of the\n           fracture. Revision operations (related to the failure of primary treatment) and\n           mortality. Baseline characteristics were documented pre-operatively: Outcome measures\n           were subdivided into intra-operative, post-operative and follow up data at four weeks,\n           three months and one year.\n\n        3. Methodology: One hundred and eighty eight patients presenting with an AO/OTA 31-A2 and\n           31-A3 fracture of the proximal part of the femur will be randomized, at the time of the\n           admission, to fixation with use either a short PFN-A or a long PFN-A."
