  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Regular aspirin use has been associated with a reduction in the development of a number of
      different malignancies including lung cancer.  The mechanism of aspirin's cancer prevention
      is not known.  This study will evaluate whether once daily aspirin use can reduce the
      production of a protein named prostaglandin E2 (PGE-2), which is known to promote cancer.
      Specifically, this study will evaluate if aspirin can inhibit the production of PGE-2 by
      blocking an enzyme named cycloxygenase-2 (COX-2).  To accomplish these goals, participants
      will take either aspirin 325 mg daily, celecoxib 200 mg twice daily, or the combination of
      both during various days of this 16-day study.  Urine be collected to evaluate for PGE-2
      production at 4 timepoints in this 16-day study.

    <description>Baseline urinary PGE-2 metabolite (PGE-M) will be measured.  Then after 3 days of COX-2 blockade with celecoxib, it will again be measured.  Participants will then undergo 10 days of treatment with aspirin and urinary PGE-M will be measured.  Finally, participants will be treated with combined aspirin and celecoxib for 3 days and urinary PGE-M will be measured one last time.  Using these values, the degree of aspirin inhibition of COX-2 specific urinary PGE-M production can be calculated.</description>
