However, whether there is a causal relationship between\n      cardiovascular events and hypoglycemia remains unclear with conflicting data in the\n      literature.  In this study, we plan to study whether acute exposure of patients to\n      clinically relevant (50-60 milligrams/deciliter) levels of hypoglycemia induces or worsens\n      blood vessel endothelial dysfunction- a key 1st step in the development of heart attacks and\n      strokes.   This will be determined in humans both with and with type 2 diabetes."
