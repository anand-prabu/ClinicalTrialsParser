      Objective:

      Glutamate-based medications including the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist
      ketamine result in rapid, robust and sustained (up to one week) antidepressant effects in
      randomized controlled trials in treatment-refractory unipolar and bipolar depression.
      Previous work by our group has demonstrated that a family history of alcohol dependence
      predicts a more robust antidepressant response to ketamine in both treatment-resistant
      unipolar and bipolar depression.

      Recently-detoxified alcoholics and affected first-degree relatives display blunted
      psychotomimetic, cognitive and other neuropsychiatric effects with a subanesthetic dose of
      ketamine.  Also, a family history of alcoholism alone predicts differential response to
      intravenous alcohol.  Based on our prior post hoc results, we seek to prospectively
      demonstrate that a family history of alcohol dependence predicts a more robust
      antidepressant response to ketamine.  We will also explore potential biomarkers of ketamine
       s antidepressant effects in treatment-refractory depressed patients at risk of alcohol
      dependence (using physiological and neurochemical responses to alcohol).

      Study Population:

      21-65 year old treatment-resistant major depressive disorder without psychotic features
      patients in a current major depressive episode of at least moderate severity will be
      recruited and enrolled in this protocol.  All subjects must also be free of a lifetime
      substance use disorder diagnosis with the exception of a nicotine or caffeine use disorder)
      and will be psychotropic medication-free for at least two weeks prior to the first alcohol
      infusion.  Our targeted number of completers will be 50 depressed subjects (60 signing
      consent to account for attrition): 25 FHP subjects [as defined by either one first degree
      relative or two second-degree relatives with alcohol dependence on the Family Interview for
      Genetics Studies (FIGS) and Family Tree Questionnaire (FTQ)] and 25 FHN negative subjects.

      Design:

      This study is a single-site, open-label protocol in psychotropic medication-free depressed
      subjects admitted to the Clinical Research Center   s Mood and Anxiety Disorder Inpatient
      Research Unit (7-SE).  This protocol consists of two phases (Phase I and Phase II). The
      first phase consists of the medication taper and drug-free period.  The second phase will
      have three subphases: Subphase IIA (   alcohol clamp    infusion #1 with neurophysiological
      assessments), IIB (   alcohol clamp    infusion #2 during 7 Tesla-Magnetic Resonance
      Spectroscopy/Imaging (7T-MRS/I)) and IIC (subanesthetic/antidepressant dose ketamine
      infusion during 7T-MRS/I).

      Outcome Measures:

      The primary hypothesis/outcome measure will be change in mean Montgomery-Asberg Depression
      Rating Scale (MADRS) total score from the pre-ketamine infusion baseline-to-7 days
      post-infusion between the FHP and FHN groups.  Other exploratory measures include
      neurophysiological responses to intravenous alcohol infusion, brain neurochemical
      alterations during intravenous alcohol infusion, brain neurochemical alterations during
      intravenous ketamine infusion and resting state (task-free) functional magnetic resonance
      imaging as a function of family history of an alcohol use disorder.
