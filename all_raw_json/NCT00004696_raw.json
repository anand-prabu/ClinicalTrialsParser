Compare nonmechanically ventilated infants who receive morphine\n      postoperatively as intermittent intravenous bolus doses or as a continuous intravenous\n      infusion targeted to reach a steady-state concentration.\n\n      II.  Assess ventilation (blood gases, continuous oximetry, and CO2 response curves) and\n      analgesia (infant pain score) between the two treatment groups of infants.\n\n      III.  Compare ventilation parameters (blood gases, CO2 response curves, and time to wean\n      from assisted mechanical ventilation) in cyanotic and acyanotic infants after thoracotomies."

Infants are randomly assigned to one of\n      two treatment arms.\n\n      In part I, following major thoracic, abdominal, or cardiac surgery, infants are randomized\n      to receive either continuous IV morphine infusions (arm I) or to receive morphine by single\n      IV bolus doses every 2-3 hours (arm II).\n\n      In part II, cyanotic and acyanotic infants following thoracotomy receive morphine by 2\n      loading doses over 15 minutes and then by continuous IV infusion.\n\n      Patients are followed for at least 2 days."
