The advantages of developing this\n      technology are threefold. First, monitoring can be conducted for a fraction of the cost of a\n      bedside nurse. Second, monitoring can be done in real time and stored so that we can\n      diagnose and manage critical events in a more timely manner. Lastly, many patients can be\n      monitored simultaneously. The wireless sensors will be fitted to healthy volunteers of\n      various ages. The data gathered from the sensor with respect to their vital signs will be\n      compared to that of conventional tools such as nursing assessments and pulse oximetry."
