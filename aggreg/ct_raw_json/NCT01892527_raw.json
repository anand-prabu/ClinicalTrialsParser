Fresh tumor tissue\n      is needed for the MET testing, thus a biopsy will be required to participate in this trial.\n      In a minor percentage of subjects archival tumor tissue could be acceptable for this\n      analysis.Eligible subjects will be treated with tivantinib (ARQ 197) at a dose of 360 mg\n      twice daily (a total daily dose of 720 mg) orally in a continuous manner and cetuximab\n      (Erbitux) at a dose of 500 mg/mq i.v. every 2 weeks.  The overall treatment period will be\n      divided into continuous 28 days cycles without treatment interruption. Disease status and\n      tumor response will be assessed per modified Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors\n      (RECIST) criteria version 1.1 at screening (within 4 weeks before the first scheduled dose\n      of study drug), in 8 weeks intervals while the subjects are on treatment or as clinically\n      indicated until progression of disease, withdrawal of consent, death, or lost to follow-up.\n      Tumor measurement will also be performed during the end of treatment visit if not done\n      within the previous 8 weeks. Subjects with progressive disease at any time during the\n      treatment period will discontinue study treatment.

CR and\n      PR must be confirmed no sooner than 4 weeks after the initial observation. After\n      discontinuation from study treatment during the follow-up period, survival status will be\n      obtained by phone every 3 months until the subject dies, withdraws consent from study, or is\n      lost to follow-up, for a maximum of 12 months."
