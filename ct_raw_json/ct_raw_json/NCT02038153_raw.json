To define maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and establish therapeutic dose level (TDL) of\n      lenalidomide given post autologous transplant for AML.\n\n      II. To determine the progression free survival for patients treated with this approach.\n\n      III. To determine the overall survival for patients treated with this approach. IV.

Courses repeat 4\n      weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 6\n      months thereafter."
