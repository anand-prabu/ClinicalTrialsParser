There is a new form of cognitive behavioral therapy\n      called integrated cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) that specifically addresses the\n      cognitive, social, and functional deficits of schizophrenia. This study is to compare iCBT\n      to another treatment that has been shown to be helpful in schizophrenia called\n      psychoeducation (PE). We will compare iCBT to PE in subjects with schizophrenia who are\n      enrolled in a Supported Employment (SE) program, and evaluate whether iCBT is more helpful\n      in improving job performance, and other areas of functioning both right after treatment, and\n      6 months after the end of treatment."

Our primary specific aim is to determine\n      whether iCBT will significantly improve work outcomes at post-treatment to a greater extent\n      than Psychoeducation (PE) in low functioning patients with schizophrenia who join the SE\n      program. Our secondary aims are to evaluate the whether iCBT will significantly improve work\n      outcomes at 6 month follow-up relative to PE, and whether iCBT will improve functional\n      outcomes post-treatment and at follow-up relative to PE in subjects who join the SE program."
