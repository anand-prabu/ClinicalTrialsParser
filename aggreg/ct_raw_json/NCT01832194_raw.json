The men must have had temporary relief from a testicular cord block using marcaine.\n      Before and 1 month, 3 months and 6 months after the Onabotulinum Toxin A injection, the men\n      would be asked to fill in visual analog scales for pain, a quality of life assessment, a\n      depression index (MDI) and Chronic Epididymitis Symptom Index (CESI). They will also be\n      subject to sensory testing of the scrotum before, after 1 month, 3 moths and 6 months."
