The\n      apelin and its receptor, which is named apj, are expressed in many tissues including\n      sensitive to the action of insulin, such as skeletal muscle, adipose tissue and heart\n      tissue.\n\n      Recent work by the team of Prof. P.Valet (INSERM U1048, Toulouse) opened a new field of\n      investigation, demonstrating for the first time in mouse models that apelin exerts a\n      glucose-regulating in vivo action. The investigators propose a translational clinical\n      research project whose goal is to provide the proof of concept of the favorable influence of\n      apelin on insulin sensitivity in humans."
