      The Sensor Optimization of Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT) Response (SOCR) Study is
      a multicenter, prospective, non-randomized acute feasibility study that is being conducted
      to determine if subcutaneous heart sounds and/or intracardiac impedance can acutely identify
      the optimal atrioventricular (AV) pacing intervals and optimal left ventricular (LV)
      electrodes in patients indicated for cardiac resynchronization therapy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject must be undergoing implant of a new or replacement/upgrade Medtronic CRT-P or
             CRT-D device for approved indications.

          -  Subject is implanted or will be implanted with an right ventricular (RV) lead that
             supports bipolar pacing and sensing (e.g. a bipolar pace/sense lead or a true bipolar
             defibrillation leads)

          -  Subject (or subject's legally authorized representative) must be willing to give
             informed consent

          -  Subjects must be at least 18 years of age

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has congenital heart disease

          -  Subject has a tachyarrhythmia (atrial and/or ventricular) at the time of enrollment
             and a cardioversion will not be attempted prior to the research procedure

          -  Subject has unstable coronary artery disease

          -  Subject cannot undergo transvenous catheterization

          -  Subject has a mechanical tricuspid or aortic valve prosthesis or history of
             significant structural tricuspid or aortic valvular disease

          -  Subject requires dual chamber cardiac pacing or single chamber (ventricular) pacing
             at rest for rate control

          -  Subject has a recent echocardiogram (within prior 6 months) which revealed the
             presence of an LV thrombus

          -  Subject is pregnant

          -  Subject is enrolled in a concurrent study that may confound the results of this study
             without documented pre-approval from Medtronic study manager
