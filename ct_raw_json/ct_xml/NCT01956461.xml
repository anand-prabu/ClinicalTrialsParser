      In this study, the investigators would like to analyze the bone mineral density (BMD) , bone
      turnover makers, and fracture prevention effects of daily teriparatide in Japanese patients
      under clinical practice. The participants are treated in the investigators hospital, who are
      under severe osteoporotic condition.

      Several determinants were reported to be related to subsequent BMD increase, such as
      baseline bone turnover markers (BTMs), low BMD at baseline, age, prior treatment, but
      comprehensive discussion is lacking. Specifically, there analyses were performed
      fragmentarily.

      The main objective of this study is to reveal the determinants of subsequent BMD increase
      and fracture preventing effect by teriparatide.

      Next, in Japan, as the baby boom generation retires, aging and depopulation occur rapidly.
      As a result, there is a lot of nursing home. But there are few reports concerning to the
      efficacy of teriparatide treatment in nursing home patients. The second objective is to
      reveal the efficacy of teriparatide for patients living nursing home, especially BMD
      changes, bone turnover makers change, and adverse events.

      Registry criteria: Patients treated in the investigators hospital using teriparatide.
      Enrolled patients are severe osteoporosis; more than two previous osteoporotic fractures,
      low BMD (&lt; young adult mean 65%).

      Interventions: blood analyses and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) every 4 months
      Informed consent: Written informed consent will be obtained. Sample size: Five-hundreds

    <description>The investigators plan to analyze 500 patients who undergo teriparatide treatments 12 months. To enroll 500 participants, up to 24 months is required beside 12 months treatment periods.
We investigate several determinants related to BMD increase, such as baseline age, gender, body mass index, BMD, BTMs, history of fracture, and prior treatment. We also investigate determinants related to fracture prevention effects by teriparatide treatment, such as baseline age, gender, body mass index, BMD, BTMs, history of fracture, prior treatment, walking ability, dementia,and site of living.
To determine the response variables of BMD changes and fracture prevention effects, initially univariate analyses are performed by Spearman correlation coefficients and Mann-Whitney U test. Data are further analyzed with a multiple regression. To estimate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) of each determinants, logistic regression analyses are performed.</description>

    <description>We plan to evaluate longitudinal BMD and BTMs changes for 24 months. BMD was evaluated every four months, ans BTMs are evaluated one months after treatment, and every four months. Fracture prevention effects are evaluated by radiography, if fracture is suspected. Statical analyses are performed using Spearman correlation coefficients, paired t-test, Mann-Whitney U test, and Kaplan-Meier method.</description>
