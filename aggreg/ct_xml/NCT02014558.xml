  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability, including the maximum
      tolerated dose, of ASP2215 in subjects with relapsed or treatment-refractory acute myeloid
      leukemia (AML).  This study will also determine the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of
      ASP2215.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is defined as morphologically documented primary or secondary AML by the
             World Health Organization (WHO) criteria (2008) and fulfills one of the following:

               -  Refractory to at least 1 cycle of induction chemotherapy

               -  Relapsed after achieving remission with a prior therapy

          -  Subject has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status &lt;= 2.

          -  Subject's interval from prior treatment to time of study drug administration is at
             least 2 weeks for cytotoxic agents (except hydroxyurea given for controlling blast
             cells), or at least 5 half-lives for prior experimental agents or noncytotoxic
             agents, including immunosuppressive therapy post hematopoietic stem cell
             transplantation (HSCT).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject was diagnosed as acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL).

          -  Subject has BCL-ABL-positive leukemia (chronic myelogenous leukemia in blast crisis).

             from prior AML treatment (including chemotherapy, kinase inhibitors, immunotherapy,
             experimental agents, radiation, or surgery).

          -  Subject has had hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) and meets any of the
             following:

               -  Is within 2 months of transplant from C1D1

               -  Has clinically significant graft-versus-host disease requiring treatment

                  Donor lymphocytes infusion (DLI) is not permitted &lt;= 30 days prior to study
                  registration or during the first cycle of treatment on the study in Cohort 1 and
                  first two cycles of the treatment in Cohort 2

          -  Subject has clinically active central nervous system leukemia

          -  Subject has disseminated intravascular coagulation abnormality (DIC)

          -  Subject has had major surgery within 4 weeks prior to the first study dose.

          -  Subject has had radiation therapy within 4 weeks prior to the first study dose

          -  Subject has congestive heart failure New York Heart Association (NYHA) class 3 or 4,
             or subject with a history of congestive heart failure NYHA class 3 or 4 in the past,
             unless a screening echocardiogram performed within 3 months prior to study entry
             results in a left ventricular ejection fraction that is ≥ 45%

          -  Subject requires treatment with concomitant drugs that are strong inhibitors or
             inducers of Cytochrome P450-isozyme3A4 (CYP3A4) with the exception of antibiotics,
             antifungals, and antivirals that are used as standard of care post-transplant or to
             prevent or treat infections and other such drugs that are considered absolutely
             essential for the care of the subject

          -  Subject required treatment with concomitant drugs that target serotonin 5HT1R or
             5HT2BR receptors or sigma nonspecific receptor with the exception of drugs that are
             considered absolutely essential for the care of the subject.

          -  Subject has an active uncontrolled infection

          -  Subject is known to have human immunodeficiency virus infection

          -  Subject has active hepatitis B or C, or other active hepatic disorder
