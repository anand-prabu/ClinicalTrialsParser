In a controlled prospective open naturalistic monocentric\n      3-month study, 60 patients with a major depressive disorder requiring a treatment with\n      venlafaxine will be included and assessed before treatment, 1 month and 3 months\n      post-treatment. 20 controlled healthy subjects matched for age and gender will also be\n      assessed. The Beta-arrestin pathway will be assessed using genetic polymorphisms, Peripheral\n      Blood Mononuclear Cell measures and functional pathway. Antidepressant response will be\n      assessed using depression scales, olfaction and memory as surrogate markers of neurogenesis."
