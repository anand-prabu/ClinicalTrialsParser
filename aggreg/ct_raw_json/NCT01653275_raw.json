            "textblock": "Postmenopausal women are at increased risk of osteoporosis and fracture.  Components of a\n      Mediterranean style diet (MedSD) are associated with reduced bone loss and fracture risk;\n      however, the MedSD has not been tested in this population in the U.S. Therefore, we propose\n      a 24 week clinical research trial (12 week observational period followed by 12 week MedSD\n      intervention) with feasibility of diet adoption and markers of bone turnover as the primary\n      outcomes.  The 12 week intervention will include provision of olive oil, walnuts and high\n      n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) fish to replace other fats and oils, processed snacks\n      and red meat, respectively; accompanied with fruit, vegetable, whole grain and legumes\n      intake recommendations.  We hypothesize the MedSD intervention will increase serum n-3 PUFA\n      and decrease saturated fatty acids and n-6 PUFA and this will result in an improvement in\n      bone turnover markers.  The outcomes of the proposed intervention trial will promote further\n      study of the benefits of a MedSD in the US.  We envision the research team to expand to\n      other systems such as cardiovascular, metabolic, and inflammatory mechanisms in which less\n      risk of disease is associated with a MedSD."
