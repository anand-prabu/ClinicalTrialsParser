Those children cannot void but urine leakage can\n      happen when the pressure in the bladder is so high that it overcomes the closed urethra\n      (overflow at high filling bladder pressure)  and/or when  an overactive contraction is very\n      strong. The high bladder pressure before overflow occurs puts those children at risk for\n      kidney damage and the overactive contractions decrease the quality of the bladder\n      additionally to the fact that they can cause leakage.  Therapy is aimed to decrease the high\n      filling bladder pressure and the overactive detrusor contractions.\n\n      The purpose of this study is to evaluate long term efficacy and safety of treatment with\n      solifenacin succinate (the study drug) and blood levels of solifenacin succinate (the study\n      drug) in children with neurogenic detrusor overactivity after multiple dose administration."
