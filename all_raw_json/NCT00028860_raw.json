Treatment repeats every 21\n      days for a total of 2 courses.\n\n      Beginning 3 weeks after the completion of the second course of chemotherapy, patients\n      receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8 and carboplatin IV over 1 hour on day\n      1. Patients also receive G-CSF SC once daily on days 2-6 and again beginning on day 9 and\n      continuing until blood counts recover. Treatment repeats every 21 days for a total of 2\n      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed at 3 months, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually for 3\n      years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10-30 patients will be accrued for this study."
