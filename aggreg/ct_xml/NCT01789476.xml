      This is a single-center, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, parallel group proof
      of concept study to evaluate the analgesic efficacy as well as the safety, tolerability and
      pharmacokinetic profile of CR845 in patients with pain following bunionectomy surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently, the most widely used drugs to treat pain after surgery are opiates, such as
      morphine. Morphine works mainly by activating one of several types of opiate receptors that
      control some of our pain sensation - the so-called mu opiate receptors. These receptors are
      located in many areas of the brain and also outside of the brain. By activating these
      receptors, morphine provides significant pain relief, but also causes side effects that
      limit its use. Some of these side effects include: respiratory depression or arrest (slowed
      or stopped breathing), sedation (a state of calmness or extreme relaxation), euphoria (an
      exaggerated feeling of physical and mental well-being), constipation, nausea, vomiting, and
      drug addiction.

      In order to avoid the side effects of morphine and other mu opiates, the present
      experimental drug CR845 was designed to work at a different type of opiate receptor - called
      kappa - that can also provide pain relief, by acting on sensory nerves outside the brain.
      CR845 was designed to penetrate the brain much less than other opiate drugs, which should
      result in pain relief similar to that of morphine, but with fewer side effects. Because
      CR845 activates kappa receptors instead of mu receptors, the side effects are different than
      with a morphine-type drug. In particular, kappa opiates, such as CR845, do not cause
      respiratory depression or arrest, euphoria, constipation, drug tolerance, physical drug
      dependence or drug addiction. For these reasons, CR845 may present a distinct advantage over
      other opiates that are currently used for pain relief and post-operative pain in particular.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Able to provide written informed consent prior to any study procedures;

          2. Able to communicate clearly with the Investigator and staff;

          4. Scheduled for elective primary unilateral first metatarsal bunionectomy surgery
             (osteotomy and internal fixation) with no collateral procedures;

          5. Females physically incapable of childbearing potential (postmenopausal for more than
             1 year or surgically sterile) or practicing an acceptable method of contraception
             (hormonal, barrier with spermicide, intrauterine device, vasectomized partner, or
