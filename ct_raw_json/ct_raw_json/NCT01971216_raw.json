The use of a relaxation tape by breastfeeding mothers that will be given starting at week\n      2 postpartum, will result in : i) reduced maternal stress and anxiety ii) the production of\n      a higher volume of breast milk iii) lower milk cortisol concentrations iv) favourable\n      effects on infant behaviour (less crying, more sleeping) v) higher milk intake by the infant\n      vi) more optimal growth, specifically higher lean mass and lower fat mass (body composition)\n\n      Secondary hypotheses (i) Infant temperament/behaviour and gender influence milk and energy\n      intake and hence early growth and body composition (ii) Non-nutrient factors in breast milk\n      (hormones including ghrelin and leptin) influence infant behaviour and feeding patterns and\n      hence infant growth and body composition."
