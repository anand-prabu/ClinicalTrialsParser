The\n      rationale for this study arises from the response of human and murine NF1 cells to Gleevec\u00ae\n      in vitro and the response of a single NF1 patient treated with Gleevec\u00ae for airway\n      compression by a plexiform neurofibroma with a dramatic response not previously seen in NF1\n      therapy. The plan of therapy will include oral dosing of Gleevec\u00ae at 440 mg/m2/day (max 800\n      mg/day) for pediatric subjects and 800 mg/day for adult patients. (with 25% dose reduction\n      for significant toxicity).  Treatment will continue for 6 months with an option to continue\n      as long as the patient remains on study provided the patient shows benefit from treatments\n      with Gleevec\u00ae and there are no safety concerns."

Male and\n             female patients of reproductive potential must agree to employ an effective barrier\n             method of birth control throughout the study and for up to 3 months following\n             discontinuation of study drug.\n\n          7. Written, voluntary informed consent.\n\n        Exclusion criteria:\n\n          1.

Patient is < 5 years free of another primary malignancy except: if the other primary\n             malignancy is not currently clinically significant nor requiring active intervention,\n             or if other primary malignancy is a basal cell skin cancer or a cervical carcinoma in\n             situ. Existence of any other malignant disease is not allowed.\n\n          3. Patient with Grade III/IV cardiac problems as defined by the New York Heart\n             Association Criteria.

Patient has a known brain metastasis. Non-specific CNS changes on MRI/CT\n             characteristic of NF1 are allowed, but not known CNS malignancies.\n\n          7. Patient has known chronic liver disease (i.e., chronic active hepatitis, and\n             cirrhosis).\n\n          8. Patient has a known diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.\n\n          9. Patient received chemotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosourea or mitomycin-C)\n              prior to study entry, unless the disease is rapidly progressing.\n\n         10. Patient previously received radiotherapy to greater than 25 % of the bone marrow\n\n         11. Patient had a major surgery within 2 weeks prior to study entry.\n\n         12.
