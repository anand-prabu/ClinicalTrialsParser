No existing studies have systematically evaluated the\n      influence of n-3 PUFAs on insulin sensitivity and beta cell function in insulin resistant,\n      non-diabetic humans.  The Investigators hypothesize that 6 months of oral supplementation of\n      purified EPA/DHA (3.9g/day) will significantly improve hepatic and peripheral insulin\n      sensitivity and beta cell responsiveness in insulin-resistant, non-diabetic individuals.\n      Based on recent work in mice, the investigators also hypothesize that EPA/DHA will increase\n      the content and function of mitochondria in skeletal muscle, measured using a combination of\n      in vivo and in vitro methods. Overall, the investigators hypothesize that EPA+DHA\n      supplementation will improve hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity in insulin resistant\n      humans, and this improvement will be associated with mitochondrial biogenesis and attenuated\n      lipid accumulation in skeletal muscle and liver."
