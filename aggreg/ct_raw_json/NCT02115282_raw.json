Estrogen can cause the growth of breast cancer cells. Endocrine therapy\n      using exemestane may fight breast cancer by lowering the amount of estrogen the body makes.\n      Entinostat may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for\n      cell growth. It is not yet known whether exemestane is more effective with or without\n      entinostat in treating breast cancer."

To evaluate whether the addition of entinostat to endocrine therapy (exemestane) improves\n      progression-free survival (PFS) and/or overall survival (OS) in postmenopausal patients with\n      hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative\n      locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer who have previously progressed on a\n      non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor (Al).\n\n      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of entinostat in combination with exemestane, and\n      to compare the safety profile to that of endocrine therapy with placebo.\n\n      II. To evaluate the objective response rate of exemestane in combination with entinostat or\n      placebo.\n\n      III. To evaluate whether the efficacy of exemestane with entinostat varies with changes in\n      acetylation status in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs).\n\n      IV. To evaluate the time to treatment deterioration (as defined by decrease in\n      health-related quality of life [HRQL], progression, death) of exemestane + entinostat versus\n      exemestane + placebo arms.\n\n      V. To evaluate the differences in overall health-related quality of life (HRQL) between the\n      exemestane + entinostat versus exemestane + placebo arms.\n\n      VI. To evaluate the difference with respect to specific symptoms that are associated with\n      entinostat, i.e., fatigue, nausea, anorexia and diarrhea, between the exemestane +\n      entinostat versus exemestane + placebo arms.\n\n      VII. To measure adherence to protocol therapy.\n\n      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I.

To collect patient ratings of adverse events (AEs) using select Patient-reported\n      outcomes (PRO)-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) items to evaluate the\n      psychometric properties of PRO-CTCAE items and explore the incorporation of PRO-CTCAE items\n      into a phase III double-blind placebo-controlled trial.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\n      ARM A: Patients receive exemestane orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28 and entinostat\n      PO on days 1, 8, 15, and 22.
