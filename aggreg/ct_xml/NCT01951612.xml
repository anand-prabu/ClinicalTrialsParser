  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is a leading cause of disability; most strokes (80%) are subcortical, with ischemic
      damage due to occlusion in penetrating arteries. Although ischemic white matter disease
      (iWMD) may lack gross clinical manifestation, it causes significant cognitive impairment,
      particularly on measures of executive function, attention, and memory. This impairment is
      attributable to diffuse damage affecting network connections.

      While there are many studies concerning rehabilitation of motor function and language in
      patients with large focal strokes, few studies have addressed attentional and executive
      functions. To our knowledge, there are no such studies on iWMD. In this study, patients will
      be randomized to a novel intervention for improving executive function and a control
      condition matched for therapist exposure. Patients will be assessed pre-intervention,
      post-intervention, and at long-term follow-up using a battery of behavioural and
      neuroimaging tasks. We predict that the novel intervention will be associated with improved
      executive function, as assessed behaviourally, and improved frontal network function, as
      assessed through neuroimaging markers.
