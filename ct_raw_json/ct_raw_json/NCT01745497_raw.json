Causes of insomnia in children with ASD are multifactorial\n      and can be difficult to treat effectively. Low iron stores, as manifest by low serum\n      ferritin levels, is also common in children with ASD.  Both insomnia and low iron stores are\n      associated with Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) and Periodic Limb Movement of Sleep (PLMS).\n      Children with ASD often have difficulty communicating symptoms or tolerating Polysomnography\n      (Sleep Study). This makes establishing a diagnosis of RLS or PLMS very difficult in children\n      with ASD. Because polysomnography is not well tolerated in children with ASD and cannot\n      measure sleep over time in a natural environment, improvements in sleep with treatment with\n      iron will be measured by standard actigraphy (a watch that measures movements during sleep)\n      and sleep diaries. The investigators also propose to evaluate periodic limb movement index\n      (PLMI) as a predictor of response to iron treatment for insomnia in children with ASD, as\n      measured by the PAM-RL, an actigraph designed to measure PLMS. The investigators will\n      collect secondary data regarding attention and behavior over the course of the study to\n      monitor improvement in daytime functioning in both groups.  Many clinicians will empirically\n      treat children with ASD, insomnia and low ferritin levels (< 50ng/ml) with iron.  This is\n      based on data from a previous open label trial demonstrating subjective improvement in\n      restless sleep in children with ASD with low/low normal ferritin levels who were treated\n      with iron.  In order to evaluate the efficacy of such treatment, The investigators propose a\n      randomized placebo-controlled trial of oral elemental iron for treatment of insomnia in\n      children with ASD and ferritin levels that are low but above the laboratory cut off for\n      deficiency. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of treatment of insomnia with oral\n      ferrous sulfate (iron) at a dose of 3mg/kg divided twice per day for 3 months compared to\n      placebo."
