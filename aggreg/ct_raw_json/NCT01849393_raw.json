The study population is adolescents (ages 16 - 24) positive for human\n      immunodeficiency virus (HIV) currently undergoing treatment with antiretrovirals at St.\n      Jude's HIV clinic. Participation in the study will involve completion of a survey: an Audio\n      Computer Assisted Self Interview (ACASI). The duration of the survey is anticipated to be\n      10-20 minutes. Patient identifiers will not be attached the survey."
