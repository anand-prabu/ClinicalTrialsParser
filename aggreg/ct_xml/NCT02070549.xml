    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of trametinib in treating patients
      with advanced cancer and hepatic dysfunction. Trametinib may stop the growth of tumor cells
      by blocking mitogen-activated extracellular signal regulated kinase (MEK) 1 and MEK 2, which
      are important proteins needed for cell growth. When these proteins are blocked, the growth
      of cancer cells may be stopped and the cancer cells will then die. Hepatic dysfunction is
      frequently found in patients with advanced cancer and usually prevents patients from
      receiving standard treatments or from participating in clinical trials. Hepatic dysfunction
      is either a result of metastatic disease or pre-existing medical conditions that often
      require dose adjustments to avoid accumulation and potential toxicity. Trametinib may be a
      safe treatment for patients with advanced cancers and hepatic dysfunction.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To provide appropriate dosing recommendations for patients with varying degree of hepatic
      dysfunction receiving trametinib (mild, moderate and severe).

      II. To establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of
      trametinib in advanced cancer patients with varying degrees of hepatic dysfunction.

      III. To characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of trametinib in advanced cancer
      patients with varying degrees of hepatic dysfunction.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To document the non-DLTs associated with the administration of trametinib in patients
      with varying degrees of hepatic dysfunction.

      II. To document any antitumor activity associated with trametinib treatment of patients
      enrolled on this study.

      III. To explore and characterize predictive biomarkers for individual cancer patients
      utilizing genomic sequencing technologies.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive trametinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every
      28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks.
