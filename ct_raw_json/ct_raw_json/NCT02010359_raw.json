Specifically it\n      addresses the hypothesis that fish oils treatments will reduce signaling by chemokine\n      pathways  (fractalkine and MCP-1) important in adipose tissue for the recruitment and\n      activation of certain white blood cells (macrophages). The study is a double-blind\n      placebo-controlled trial of the fish oil Lovaza from GlaxoSmithKline (omega-3-acid ethyl\n      esters; a combination of ethyl esters of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic\n      acid (DHA)) in obese non-diabetic adults, to determine if Lovaza decreases markers of\n      inflammation and macrophage activation in adipose and blood and understand the mechanism by\n      which fish oils affect inflammation."
