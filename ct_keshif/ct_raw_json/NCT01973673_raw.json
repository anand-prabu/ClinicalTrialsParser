To prevent\n      this, guidelines recommend participation in healthy bone behaviours including weight-bearing\n      exercise and adequate calcium/vitamin D intake. However, prior studies have shown that\n      patients are not regularly screened or counselled regarding healthy bone behaviours while\n      receiving ADT. Maintaining bone health in prostate cancer patients is important because men\n      on ADT are at increased risk of fractures. In this study, the investigators will examine\n      whether an intervention designed to improve healthy bone behaviours among prostate cancer\n      patients on ADT can be implemented. The intervention consists of a written \"healthy bones\n      prescription\", brief verbal counseling, and printed educational materials for participants.\n      Investigators hope to obtain an initial estimate of whether the intervention works. They\n      also hope to show that this simple intervention can be implemented in a real, working cancer\n      clinic.\n\n      The investigators hypothesize that an intervention to improve bone health in prostate cancer\n      patients receiving ADT (healthy bones prescription, verbal counseling, and printed\n      educational materials) is effective, implementable, and accepted by clinicians and patients."
