However, most of the topical lubricants available are not very well\n      characterized and data about efficacy is sparse.\n\n      The aim of the present project is to investigate the effect of topically administered Olixia\n      pure\u00ae eye drops on tear film thickness in healthy subjects.\n\n      Tear film thickness will be determined using ultra high-resolution optical coherence\n      tomography (OCT). Measurements will be performed before instillation of the eye drops and\n      every 10 minutes after instillation for one hour. One eye will receive Olixia pure\u00ae eye\n      drops, the fellow eye will receive physiologic saline solution as placebo control. The study\n      eye will be chosen randomly."
