Evaluate the efficacy of surgical resection of an identifiable zone of\n      cortical abnormality versus multiple drug therapy in children with infantile spasms\n      refractory to standard therapy.\n\n      II.  Assess how infantile spasms interfere with development and whether this is partially\n      reversible.\n\n      III.  Determine the predictors of good surgical outcome and whether surgery permanently\n      controls seizures and improves development."

The first group undergoes sequential antiepileptic therapy with\n      pyridoxine, corticotropin, valproic acid, carbamazepine, and nitrazepam.  The sequence of\n      administration may be altered based on drugs taken prior to entry.  Any drug may be omitted\n      due to medical contraindications or prior use at study doses or higher.\n\n      The second group undergoes surgical resection of the zone of cortical abnormality.  A\n      functional hemispherectomy is performed for hemiparesis or diffuse unihemispheric\n      dysfunction.\n\n      If seizures are controlled in the first group at 3 months, the current medication is\n      maintained; if seizures are not controlled, sequential therapy continues to completion.\n      Patients experiencing uncontrolled seizures at 6 months cross to surgery.\n\n      Surgical patients experiencing uncontrolled seizures at 3 months or persistent seizures\n      after taper of pre-study antiepileptics cross to drug therapy.\n\n      All patients are followed at 6 months and 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and 10 years."
