This information will be used to determine target doses of external beam radiotherapy. The treatment infusion of Samarium, 30 mCi/kg, will be administered and dosimetry will confirm total dose delivered, and information will be used to finalize doses of external beam radiotherapy. Approximately 14 days after treatment infusion, previoulsy harvested autologous peripheral blood or bone marrow stem cells will be infused in order to ameliorate the expected myelosuppression. Radiotherapy will be delivered according to the judgement of the treating radiation oncologist."
