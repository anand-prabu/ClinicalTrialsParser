Has a parent or guardian providing written parental permission/informed consent, with\n             subject assent (if required by local IRB).\n\n          2. Is a child 2 years old through 17 years old, inclusive (at the time of informed\n             consent signing).\n\n          3. Has a routine pediatric procedure that is expected to cause at least mild to moderate\n             pain.\n\n          4. Is expected by the investigator to require a minimum of one (1) dose of oral codeine\n             for the treatment of mild to moderate post-procedural pain.\n\n          5. Has the ability to read and understand the study procedures and has the ability to\n             communicate meaningfully with the study investigator and staff (if the subject is of\n             preverbal age or cannot read or communicate meaningfully, then the subject's parent\n             or guardian must meet this criterion).\n\n          6. If female subject is of childbearing potential, she must have a negative urine or\n             serum pregnancy test result on the day of the scheduled procedure prior to the\n             procedure.  In this population, female of childbearing potential is defined by the\n             onset of menarche, that is, menstruation, whether at irregular or regular intervals\n             (periods).\n\n          7. Must have vascular access to facilitate multiple blood draws.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          1. Is currently lactating.\n\n          2. Has significant medical disease(s), laboratory abnormalities, or conditions(s) that\n             in the investigator's judgment could compromise the subject's welfare, ability to\n             communicate with study staff, complete study activities, or would otherwise\n             contraindicate study participation.\n\n          3. Weighs less than 10.5 kg. (see Table 4 Maximum Number of Doses of Study Drug by\n             Weight for details)\n\n          4. Has weight \u2264 5th or \u2265 95th percentile for age based on CDC Growth Charts. (see\n             Appendix 6)\n\n          5. Has received codeine, hydrocodone, morphine or oxycodone in any form in the previous\n             seven (7) days.\n\n          6. Has used opioids chronically (e.g., codeine, morphine, oxycodone, hydrocodone, or\n             hydromorphone) for >7 calendar days within the previous 30 days before surgery.\n\n          7. Has known hypersensitivity or contraindication to receiving oral opioid(s).\n\n          8. Has an active enteral malabsorption disorder.\n\n          9. Has impaired liver function (e.g., alanine aminotransferase [ALT] \u22653 times the upper\n             limit of normal [ULN], or bilirubin \u22653 times ULN), known active hepatic disease\n             (e.g., hepatitis), evidence of clinically significant chronic liver disease or other\n             conditions affecting the liver (e.g., chronic hepatitis) that may suggest the\n             potential for an increased susceptibility to hepatic toxicity with oral codeine\n             exposure.  NOTE: Subjects with no previous history of liver function impairment may\n             be enrolled before results are available from screening laboratory samples.\n\n         10. Has significantly impaired renal function or disease, as evidenced by an estimated\n             glomerular filtration rate (i.e., from creatinine levels using the Schwartz formula)\n             calculated to be less than one-third (1/3) of normal for the applicable age of this\n             study population.  NOTE: Subjects with no previous history of kidney function\n             impairment may be enrolled before results are available from screening laboratory\n             samples.\n\n         11. Is undergoing a procedure as treatment for acute burns.\n\n         12. Has a history of substance abuse or there is evidence of current substance abuse, in\n             the investigator's opinion.\n\n         13. Has participated in an interventional clinical study (investigational or marketed\n             product) within 30 days before screening, or plans to participate in another clinical\n             trial in the next 30 days."
