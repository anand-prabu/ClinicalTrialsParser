Patients are stratified according to\n      center. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive usual care (no special intervention).\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive smoking-cessation therapy based on the 4-step intervention\n           plan in the \"Manual for Physicians\" published by the National Cancer Institute. The\n           smoking cessation coordinator and physician provide self-quitting advice and support to\n           the patient via counseling, self-help materials, and referral to a smoking cessation\n           counselor at the Cancer Information Service (CIS). Patients receive nicotine\n           replacement, if indicated. Patients who express an interest in more intensive treatment\n           are referred to local American Cancer Society or American Lung Association clinics\n           and/or advised to call the CIS for additional local program referrals.\n\n      All patients are followed at 6 and 12 months. Patients who report that they are still\n      smoking and interested in help to quit smoking at the 12-month follow-up interview are\n      encouraged to return to their physicians and contact the CIS for additional help quitting or\n      for a referral to more intensive or specialized treatments in their area.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 494 patients will be accrued for this study."
