On a scale from 1 to 10, how much are you bothered by your hot flashes?\n\n        2. Do these hot flashes wake you up at night? Around how many times do they occur at\n           night?\n\n        3. What are you expectations about this study?\n\n      A Menopause Rating Scale questionnaire will be completed by the potential participant to\n      assess symptoms Eligible patients from each group will initially undergo a 7 day washout\n      period before intervention in order to eliminate any effects of hormone replacement\n      therapies (HRT) or herbal supplements that subjects may be using prior to participation in\n      the study. Subjects will be randomized to receive a Farabloc fabric or placebo fabric for\n      one week. After this, the two groups will undergo a second 7 day washout period before\n      crossing over to the other fabric. Once crossed over, participants will use the allocated\n      fabrics for another week.\n\n      Participants will be asked not to take their usual HRT or herbal supplements for the entire\n      experimental duration in this study in order to produce impartial, precise and reliable\n      results.\n\n      The manufacturer will assign codes for placebo fabric or experimental Farabloc. The\n      randomization code will be broken at the completion of the study for data analysis."
