Headache is one of the most\n      debilitating clinical symptoms in Veteran with MTBI and the cause of it is still not\n      entirely clear. Recently, the use of non-invasive brain stimulation such as repetitive\n      transcranial magnetic stimulation(rTMS) has yielded favorable clinical outcome in a few\n      intractable chronic central pain conditions including headaches. This study aims to 1)\n      assess the effect of rTMS in relieving headache and improving neurophysiological functions;\n      and 2)explore the neuronal mechanisms associated with MTBI related headache and the\n      analgesic effect of rTMS with function magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)."
