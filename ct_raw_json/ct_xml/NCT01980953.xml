    <textblock>
      This 2-part study will assess the effect of formulation and food on the pharmacokinetics of
      GDC-0032 in healthy volunteers. Part 1 is an open-label, 3-period, 6-sequence study, and
      Part 2 is an open-label 2-period crossover study. Subjects will receive single doses of
      GDC-0032 capsule or tablet formulation, in the fasted or fed state.

             defined by protocol from Period 1 Check-in (Period 1, Day -1) until 90 days following
             the last dose of study drug

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Significant history or clinical manifestation of any metabolic, allergic,
             dermatological, hepatic, renal, hematological, pulmonary, cardiovascular,

          -  Use of any tobacco- or nicotine-containing products  within 6 months prior to Period
             1 Check-in (Period 1, Day -1) and during the entire study

          -  Participation in any other investigational study drug trial in which receipt of an
             investigational study drug occurred within 5 half-lives or 30 days, whichever is
             longer, prior to Period 1 Check-in (Period 1, Day -1) and during the entire study
