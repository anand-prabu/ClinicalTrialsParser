Determine the maximum tolerated dose of ZD 1839 given intermittently or\n      continuously and concurrently with standard doses of carboplatin and paclitaxel in patients\n      with advanced non-small cell lung cancer. II. Determine the safety of ZD 1839 in these\n      regimens in these patients. III. Determine whether the exposure of either free carboplatin\n      or paclitaxel in an established treatment regimen is significantly altered by the addition\n      of oral ZD 1839 in this patient population. IV. Determine the exposure of ZD 1839 before and\n      after standard doses of carboplatin and paclitaxel to assess whether ZD 1839 steady state is\n      significantly altered by coadministration of chemotherapy.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is an open label, 2 part, multicenter study. Part 1 is a randomized, dose\n      escalation, 2 period, 2 sequence, crossover design. Part 2 is a nonrandomized, single dose\n      evaluation design. Part 1: Patients are randomized to receive ZD 1839 beginning 1 week\n      before either the first (arm I) or second (arm II) course of carboplatin and paclitaxel. Arm\n      I: Patients receive oral ZD 1839 daily on days 1-14. On day 1 only, ZD 1839 is given twice\n      at 12 hour intervals. Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours followed by carboplatin IV\n      over 30 minutes on days 8 and 36. Subsequent courses consist of ZD 1839 for 14 days and\n      paclitaxel and carboplatin every 28 days. Arm II: Patients receive paclitaxel and\n      carboplatin as in arm I on days 1 and 29. Patients receive oral ZD 1839 daily on days 22-35.\n      On day 22 only, ZD 1839 is given twice at 12 hour intervals. Subsequent courses are\n      administered as in arm I. Part 2: Patients receive oral ZD 1839 daily on days 1-56. On day 1\n      only, ZD 1839 is given twice at 12 hour intervals. Patients receive paclitaxel and\n      carboplatin as in part 1 on days 8 and 36. Subsequent courses consist of ZD 1839\n      continuously and paclitaxel and carboplatin every 28 days. Treatment continues in both parts\n      for a maximum of 6 months in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. In\n      both parts 1 and 2, cohorts of 6-12 patients receive escalating doses of ZD 1839 until the\n      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at\n      which 4 of 6 or 4 of 12 patients experience dose limiting toxicities.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 48 patients will be accrued for this study."
