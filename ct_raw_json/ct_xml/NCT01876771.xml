  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neuroendocrine tumours (NETs) are rare, slow growing, and diagnosis often delayed with
      advanced metastases at presentation. In select patient populations, radioisotope therapy has
      been shown to be a safe and effective palliative therapy. Lutetium-177 (Lu-DOTA-TATE) has
      been used at the Cross Cancer Institute to treat 91 patients with NETS since August, 2010.
      This study is being done because the investigators Lu-DOTA-TATE treatment is currently given
      under Health Canada's (HC) Special Access Programme (SAP), with each individual treatment
      requiring separate approval. HC has requested that the investigators conduct a clinical
      trial with Lu-DOTA-TATE, with the goal of receiving approval to use Lu-DOTA-TATE as a
      marketed treatment agent. There will be two groups of subjects: Group A (primary therapy)
      will have somatostatin receptor positive tumours; Group B (secondary therapy) will be those
      subjects who have currently been provided with Lu-DOTA-TATE under the SAP. All subjects will
      be treated in a therapeutic stage using 8-12 week dosing for 4 cycles followed by a
      maintenance stage using dosing at 22 to 26 week intervals for up to 8 cycles with a 22 to 26
      week follow up after the last dose. Safety will be assessed by vital signs, blood work,
      renal function and adverse event collection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A major group of somatostatin receptor positive tumours are those of neuroendocrine origin
      (NETs), which comprise a spectrum of rare (&lt;5%) neoplasms derived from primitive
      neuroectodermal tissue. Because these neoplasms grow slowly and have symptoms that are
      common in the general population, diagnosis is often delayed with advanced metastases at
      presentation. Radiopharmaceuticals labelled with Lutetium-177 have been reported as
      effective therapeutic agents in this population of patients, and used extensively by groups
      in Europe, in particular Dr. Krenning's group at the University of Rotterdam. The peptide
      DOTA0-tyr3-octreotate (DOTATATE) has been granted orphan drug status in the USA and in
      Europe. Dr. Krenning et al have published data on over 300 patients, demonstrating the
      safety and effectiveness of this treatment. They have shown stable disease, minimal, partial
      and complete responses in 80% of patients treated with Lutetium-177 octreotate. They have
      also shown comparable response rates in terms of improvements in symptoms and quality of
      life. Coupled with a relatively benign safety profile the investigators believe this
      treatment offers the realization of significant objective disease burden reduction and
      improvements to the quality of life through symptomatic relief to NET subjects and intend
      these benefits to be further demonstrated in this study. The Lu-DOTA-TATE used in this study
      will be provided by the Edmonton Radiopharmaceutical Centre. The radiopharmaceutical is
      manufactured under compliance with Health Canada requirements and each batch meets approved
      quality control specifications.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female ≥ 14 - 90 years of age. If female of child-bearing potential and

             negative pregnancy test is required.

          2. Presence of somatostatin receptor positive tumour(s) (either histologically or
             Octreoscan image proven), with at least 1 tumour site reliably evaluable by CT or MRI
             of at least 1.5 cm (smallest dimension) with respect to RECIST criteria (the target
             lesion).

          3. Presence of somatostatin receptors on (at least) the target lesion demonstrated by
             uptake of OctreoScan® at least equal to liver uptake within 26 weeks of enrollment.

             mL/min measured within 2 weeks of enrollment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Potential for surgery with curative intent. Local surgery for symptomatic relief
             permitted as long as target lesion unaffected.

             normal within 12 weeks of enrollment.

          5. Another significant medical, psychiatric or surgical condition uncontrolled by
             treatment, which may interfere with completion or conduct of the study (such as
             urinary incontinence, co-existing malignancies).
