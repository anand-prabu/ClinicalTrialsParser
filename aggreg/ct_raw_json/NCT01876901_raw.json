            "textblock": "Hypothesis:\n\n      In France, approximately 12,000 new rectal cancers are diagnosed each year. Frequency is one\n      and a half times higher in men than in women. The average age of diagnosis is 65. Unlike\n      colon cancer, technical management remains challenging with unresolved operating\n      difficulties. Morbidity of surgical procedures remains high with a very large number of\n      preventive or curative stoma derivations.\n\n      Reference in surgical treatment is total excision of the rectum and its mesentery, followed\n      by continuity restoration by immediate coloanal anastomosis (ACAI). In this procedure, rate\n      of fistula that results is reported in the literature between 15 and 25%.\n\n      An alternative to ACAI is delayed coloanal anastomosis without reservoir (ACAD). Based on\n      retrospective experiences, we form the hypothesis that ACAD offers a much lower rate of\n      fistula (<5%) and allows diminution of preventive stoma derivation practice. Morbidity and\n      mortality are reduced, and patient's quality of life greatly improved. Direct costs\n      (consumables intraoperative, hospitalization, stoma complications) and indirect\n      (pocket-fitting stoma) are greatly reduced.\n\n      This study is a multicentre, two arms, phase 2 clinical trial."
