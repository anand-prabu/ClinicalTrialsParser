Using materials to reinforce tissue defects is\n      indicated as standard of care for this type of surgery. The Cook Biodesign mesh is currently\n      FDA-approved for implantation to reinforce soft tissues where weakness exists, but the\n      investigators would like to collect additional follow-up information to continue to assess\n      the durability of the repair after placement of the hernia mesh. This follow-up would\n      include the collection of information about complications such as infections and seromas\n      (collections of fluid around the surgery site), as well as hernia recurrence and quality of\n      life questionnaires. Patients who qualify to take part in this study have been diagnosed\n      with a ventral incisional hernia and will have been scheduled for a surgical hernia repair.\n      This surgery will be an \"open\" surgical procedure and reinforcing your tissue with material\n      is indicated for this type of hernia repair."

The mesh will not be used as\n      a \"bridge,\" and the fascial layers will be closed completely.\n\n      The research staff may photograph the repair of an enrolled patient's hernia during their\n      treatment and will supply a copy of the photograph to Cook Medical, Inc. if the sponsor's\n      review is requested.
