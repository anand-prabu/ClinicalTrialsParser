  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are very few studies comparing the accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of HemoCue
      glucose 201 RT system with the laboratory gold standard.

      The incidence of cystic fibrosis related diabetes (CFRD) has risen significantly as
      patients' survival improves. Around 30% of all cystic fibrosis (CF) adult patients have
      CFRD. Early diagnosis of CFRD is important to slow the deterioration of lung function and
      nutritional status, both of which increase mortality.

      The oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is the accepted method for detecting CFRD and the
      Cystic Fibrosis Trust guidelines recommend that patients with CF over the age of twelve
      years should be screened annually.

      The World Health Organisation has pointed out that due to the absence of a more specific
      biological marker to define diabetes, plasma glucose estimation remains the basis of
      diagnostic criteria. WHO recommends that venous plasma glucose should be the standard method
      for measuring and reporting glucose concentration in blood. However, it has also recognised
      that there is a widespread use of capillary sampling. Although fasting values for venous and
      capillary plasma glucose are the same, in the nonfasting state capillary samples will give
      higher results than venous samples, and glucose values require conversion which can be
      problematic.

      HemoCue Glucose 201 RT (HGS 201 RT) analyzer with plasma conversion provides laboratory
      quality test results at the point of care for the diagnosis, screening and monitoring of
      diabetes mellitus. The analyzer is easy to use and the system can be operated by
      nonlaboratory personnel, also the results can be presented immediately, leading to
      significant time and resource saving. The patient also benefits from having the result
      immediately instead of waiting for several hours. With immediate result, the doctor and
      health care professionals can provide education, support and reassurance, and implement care
      plans, if appropriate, at the earliest opportunity.

      The aim of the study is to compare the clinical accuracy of HemoCue Glucose 201 RT with the
      laboratory standard method in the analysis of blood glucose concentration during oral
      glucose tolerance test.

    <textblock>
      All CF patients attending annual review who require an OGTT will have a venous and a
      capillary blood sample taken simultaneously before (fasting = 0 min) and 2 hours (post
      glucose load = 120 min) after the administration of 75 grams Glucose solution orally.

      The capillary sample will be analysed immediately using HGS 201 RT. The venous sample will
      be collected in a Fluoride Oxalate tube (WHO guideline) and sent to the Trust's laboratory
      for analysis as per usual practice.
