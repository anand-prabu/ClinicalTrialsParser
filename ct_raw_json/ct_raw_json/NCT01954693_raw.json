The IMP is a licensed\n      medicine in this patient group but for a different target of effect. The current trial is a\n      proof of principle study for memory and executive function outcomes.\n\n      Following an eligibility visit, patients will be scheduled for baseline visit and\n      randomization. They will then be followed up for 6 months undergoing both safety and\n      neurocognitive assessments whilst taking either the placebo or study drug.\n\n      48 patients aged 16 to 60 years with tuberous sclerosis (TSC) who have IQ > 60 and a\n      significant deficit in one or more primary outcome measures will be randomly allocated in a\n      ratio of 2:1 to either RAD001 (Everolimus) or Placebo."
