In this context, patients will  be monitored  for\n      renal  biomarkers  (TIMP-2,  IGFBP7)  and  intestinal  biomarkers  (plasmatic intestinal\n      fatty acid binding protein (i-FABP))  and local tissue perfusion will be assessed using\n      contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS).\n\n      The ultimate goal of this study is an early identification of patients developing one or\n      both of these complications, which may facilitate a timely intervention to improve outcome."
