            "textblock": "1. Background:\n\n           Preliminary studies have suggested that valproate acid (VPA) may promote neuron\n           survival, inhibit apoptosis, decrease the neuron function deficit in cerebral ischemia,\n           and promote the brain functional recovery after traumatic brain injury (TBI). Besides,\n           in the guide of prevention and treatment of epilepsy in 2007, VPA was one of the\n           antiepileptic drugs which were suggested to prevent early epilepsy after TBI (less than\n           7 days).\n\n        2. Objectives:\n\n           Our main objective was to evaluate whether VPA could protect brain and improve recovery\n           of brain function after severe TBI. The secondary objective was to explore whether VPA\n           could prevent late epilepsy after severe TBI (more than 7 days).\n\n        3. Methods:\n\n      We would enroll 160 patients who were in a vegetative or minimally conscious state 4 to 16\n      weeks after TBI and who were receiving inpatient rehabilitation. Patients were randomly\n      assigned to receive VPA or placebo for 4 weeks and were followed for 2 weeks after the\n      treatment was discontinued. The rate of functional recovery on the Disability Rating Scale\n      (DRS; range, 0 to 29, with higher scores indicating greater disability) was compared over\n      the 4 weeks of treatment (primary outcome) and during the 2-week washout period with the use\n      of mixed-effects regression models."
