Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as\n      busulfan and etoposide, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by\n      killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. A PBSCT may be able to replace\n      blood-forming cells that were destroyed by chemotherapy. This may allow more chemotherapy to\n      be given so that more cancer cells are killed. Aldesleukin may stimulate the white blood\n      cells to kill cancer cells. Giving busulfan and etoposide together followed by PBSCT and\n      aldesleukin may be an effective treatment for AML."
