      To determine if contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) and shear wave elastography can
      accurately diagnose bowel wall inflammation and fibrosis in patients with known Crohn's
      disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Crohn's disease (CD) is an inflammatory condition that affects the intestinal tract (large
      and small bowels).  Some patients with CD may get swelling of the intestinal tract
      (inflammation) or scarring of the intestinal tract (fibrosis).  Fibrosis develops because of
      chronic injury.  Both inflammation (swelling) and fibrosis (scarring) can cause the bowel to
      narrow, which can lead to the bowel becoming blocked.  The long-term goal of this project is
      to develop new noninvasive radiology imaging tests that can show the difference between
      bowel wall inflammation and fibrosis.  Currently there are no imaging tests that can do this
      reliably.

      Current imaging methods (CT and MRI) that are ordered to help diagnose and follow-up CD are
      excellent at showing inflammation, but are not accurate for finding fibrosis.  CT also
      exposes patients to small amounts of radiation, and both CT and MRI are costly.  We are
      therefore studying ultrasound imaging, as it is more cost-effective and does not expose
      patients to radiation.  CEUS uses microbubbles in a solution that are injected into a vein
      in one of the arms.  This allows doctors to see the blood flow to parts of the body.  This
      microbubble contrast agent (dye) is called Optison.  Another imaging method, called shear
      wave elastography, uses sound waves to noninvasively measure the stiffness of structures in
      the body.

      It is important to be able to tell the difference between inflammation and fibrosis in
      Crohn's disease, because narrowing of the bowel due to inflammation generally responds well
      to medications, whereas narrowing caused by fibrosis does not respond well to medications
      and may require surgery.
