To determine the effect of pomegranate fruit extract (PFE) 1000 mg, taken daily for 1\n      year, on the plasma levels of insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) from baseline to end of\n      study (52 weeks) in participants undergoing active surveillance (AS) for early stage\n      prostate cancer.\n\n      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. To assess compliance with a once daily oral administration of PFE versus placebo over a\n      52-week period of time.\n\n      II. To assess the toxicity of PFE vs. placebo when taken daily for 52 weeks. III. To compare\n      and correlate the modulation of the following biomarkers with response to PFE versus placebo\n      on follow-up biopsy results performed at week 52 (or earlier if clinically indicated),\n      including the presence or absence of tumor, the extent of tumor and Gleason scores; plasma\n      biomarkers: Insulin-like growth factor 1/IGF binding protein 3 ratio (IGF-1/IGFBP-3 ratio);\n      normal and abnormal prostate tissue biomarkers: prostate-specific antigen (PSA), IGFBP-3,\n      apoptosis (TUNEL), proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R),\n      8-hydroxy-2' -deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and androgen receptor.\n\n      IV. Measure PFE constituents/metabolites in plasma and urine for evidence of accumulation\n      (trough levels): ellagic acid, dimethyl ellagic acid, dimethyl ellagic acid glucuronide\n      (DMEAG), urolithin A, urolithin A-glucuronide, urolithin B and urolithin B-glucuronide.\n\n      V. Measure PSA doubling time (PSA DT) in serum, using the calculation provided on the\n      Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center website.\n\n      VI. To assess the feasibility of cancer chemoprevention trials in a population of men\n      undergoing active surveillance for prostate cancer.\n\n      VII. Measurement of serum testosterone.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.\n\n      GROUP I: Patients receive pomegranate-extract pill orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 52 weeks.\n\n      GROUP II: Patients receive placebo PO QD for 52 weeks."
