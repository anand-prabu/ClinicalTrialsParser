Additionally,\n      an open-label cohort (where participants and study staff know the identity of the assigned\n      treatment) in Caucasian men will investigate the pharmacokinetics and safety of a single\n      intravenous (into a vein) (IV) infusion. The study will consist of 3 phases: a screening\n      phase, a treatment phase (comprising 2 days and 1 night at the study center) and a follow-up\n      period (comprising approximately 11 visits to the study center). During the double-blind SC\n      treatment period, participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups: group 1\n      will receive a single SC injection of 100 mg CNTO 3157 or placebo; group 2 will receive 2 SC\n      injections of CNTO 3157 (making a total dose of 300mg) or placebo; group 3 will receive 4 SC\n      injections of CNTO 3157 (making a total dose of 600 mg) or placebo. Group 4 (open-label\n      cohort) will receive a single IV infusion of 300 mg CNTO 3157. Participants will be enrolled\n      in each SC dose group sequentially from the lower to higher dose level. The study sponsor\n      and the study doctor will review the test results (in terms of safety and tolerability) for\n      each group before dosing participants in the next treatment group; this review will be\n      carried out in a blinded manner. An equal number of Japanese and Caucasian participants will\n      be assigned to the SC treatment groups forming 2 subgroups within each group (groups 1A, 1B,\n      2A, 2B, 3A and 3B). Within each SC treatment group, 10 participants will be randomly\n      assigned in a 4 to 1 ratio to receive CNTO 3157 or placebo. Only Caucasian participants will\n      be enrolled in the IV treatment group (group 4). For each treatment group, blood and urine\n      samples will be taken at various time points during the study. Each participant will take\n      part in the study for approximately 85 days. Participant safety will be monitored throughout\n      the study."
