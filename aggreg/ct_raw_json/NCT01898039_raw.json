These patients will be treated with the A2/4-1BBL melanoma\n      vaccine, a compatible melanoma cell line that has been engineered to express a molecule\n      termed 4-1BBL, which enhances the chances of the cell line to be recognized by the patient's\n      immune system, and to induce its stimulation. The hypothesis that drives the study states\n      that the immune response against the cell line will also be effective against the residual\n      tumor that may still be present in the body."
