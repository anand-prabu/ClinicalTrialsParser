Samples of blood,\n      urine and tumour tissues will be analysed for molecular biomarkers. These biomarkers may\n      potentially help us in the future in predicting whether a patient will benefit or not from\n      the cancer treatment. The study also aims to investigate if a newer imaging method, called\n      PET-CT (positron emission tomography-computed tomography), at an earlier stage  (than a\n      normal CT scan) can identify patients who will benefit from the given treatment."
