This study will also\n      examine the ability of antiretroviral therapy combined with IL-2 to boost the immune system.\n\n      IL-2, given through injection under the skin, in combination with anti-HIV therapy can\n      increase CD4 cell counts.  This study examines 3 doses of IL-2 in order to determine the\n      safest and most effective dose to use."

Using a smaller\n      patient sampling, this Phase II study helps develop the clinical experience needed to\n      consider formation of a larger, more complete Phase III trial.\n\n      Seventy-two HIV-infected patients (previously treated or naive) are randomized independently\n      to receive either control therapy with antiretrovirals alone OR escalating doses of\n      subcutaneous interleukin-2 (IL-2) plus antiretrovirals.  In the absence of dose-limiting\n      toxicity (DLT) in at least 9 of 12 patients in Group 1, 12 additional patients are entered\n      into Group 2 and treated as indicated. In the absence of DLT in 9 of 12 patients in Group 2,\n      the final 12 patients are entered into Group 3. Those patients enrolled in either of the\n      first 2 dose groups who complete 3 courses of therapy have their dose escalated to a maximum\n      dose. A course of treatment is defined as 5 days of IL-2 plus antiretrovirals followed by 7\n      weeks of antiretroviral therapy alone."
