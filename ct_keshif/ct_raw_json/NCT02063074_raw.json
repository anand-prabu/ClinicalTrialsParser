It is our primary\n      hypothesis that premenopausal women with irregular periods or endocrine issues related to\n      estrogen will have significantly poorer low back and hip bone health when compared to\n      regularly menstruating women. It is our secondary hypothesis that long-term assessment of\n      changes in endocrine function and lifestyle behaviors will assist in establishing risk\n      factors for osteoporosis in young women. This study will include 1000 premenopausal women.\n      The women will participate in the collection of a blood sample, bone scan, body fat\n      measures, and lifestyle questionnaires. In addition, we hope to use this initial study to\n      develop a group of women to follow throughout menopause, with additional visits occurring\n      every 5 years over the course of their life."
