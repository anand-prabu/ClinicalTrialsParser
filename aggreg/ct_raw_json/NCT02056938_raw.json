In case of a patient with a functional arteriovenous fistula or a high-flow venous catheter, the infusion of Thymoglobuline\u00ae can begin just after the randomization pre operatively. When the patient has no available arteriovenous fistula for the Thymoglobuline\u00ae infusion, it is necessary to install a high-flow vein (central vein) by the anesthesiologist, and to begin the perfusion as soon as possible intra-operatively before the reperfusion of the kidney. The dose of Thymoglobuline\u00ae per infusion is 1.5mg/kg. The duration of each infusion is between 6 to 24 hours.\nThe total duration of the Thymoglobuline\u00ae administration is 4 days (starting at and including the first day of the surgery)."
