In particular, the investigators want to determine if the need for\n      postoperative opioids will be reduced and whether this will lead to shorter admission to\n      recovery room and fewer instances of side effects such as postoperative nausea and vomiting.\n      In addition, the investigators will determine whether the functional outcome is improved\n      i.e. faster and more successful rehabilitation. This would have profound benefits not only\n      to the individual patient but also to society by reducing expenses during admission, the\n      cost of sick leave etc."
