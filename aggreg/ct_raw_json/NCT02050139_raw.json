            "textblock": "Over the last decades, peritoneal dialysis has grown worldwide to become one of the most\n      common modalities of renal replacement therapy, particularly in developing or newly\n      industrialized countries, such as India, China, Korea, Turkey, Malaysia, Mexico and Brazil.\n      Peritoneal dialysis has been associated with an initial survival benefit compared to\n      hemodialysis, although this advantage becomes less apparent over time, likely due to the\n      progressive loss of residual renal function and the development of pathological alterations\n      of peritoneum . Recent results suggest that an antioxidant therapy by N-acetyl-cysteine oral\n      supplementation may improve residual renal function in peritoneal dialysis patients. This\n      finding may have major clinical relevance, as preserving residual renal function in\n      peritoneal dialysis patients has been associated with improved survival . Aim of the present\n      randomized, double-blind, crossover study is to confirm the preliminary evidence of the\n      beneficial effects of antioxidant agents on residual renal function by using the\n      L-enantiomeric form of cysteine in 10 prevalent peritoneal dialysis patients with residual\n      diuresis."
