            "textblock": "Each year about 800 renal transplantations are performed in the Netherlands. The current\n      immunosuppressive strategies have led to a 1-year patient and graft survival of more than\n      90%. This high survival rate urges medical specialists to pay increasing attention to the\n      long\u2010term side effects of immunosuppressive medication, such as virus\u2010associated cancers. An\n      example of an oncogenic virus is the high risk Human Papillomavirus (hrHPV) which is related\n      to (pre)malignancies of the anogenital tract e.g. cervix, vulva and anus. These malignancies\n      are among the most common malignancies in renal transplant recipients (RTRs). The incidence\n      of hrHPV\u2010related cervical and vulvar malignancies is increased up to a 100\u2010fold in RTRs\n      compared to the general population. There is limited literature on the exact behaviour of\n      HPV infection related anogenital (pre)malignancies in RTRs. A part of these\n      (pre)malignancies are probably already present at the time of transplantation while others\n      develop in the years after transplantation.  With gynaecological examination the\n      investigators can diagnose anogenital (pre)malignancies before transplantation so treatment,\n      if necessary, can commence before transplantation. Knowledge about HPV status before and\n      after transplantation gives insight in the natural course of the HPV infection in this group\n      of patients and with this information the investigators can determine the value of\n      vaccination in patients waiting for renal transplantation in the future."
