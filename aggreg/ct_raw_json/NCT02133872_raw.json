            "textblock": "Hypertension (HTN) is the single most prevalent risk factor for cardiovascular disease,\n      diabetes, obesity and metabolic syndrome. Recent American Heart Association (AHA) statistics\n      indicate that one-third of all adults in the United States of America suffer from HTN.\n      Despite advances in life style modification and multi-drug therapies, 20-30% of all\n      hypertensive patients remain resistant.\n\n      These individuals exhibit autonomic dysregulation due to elevated sympathetic activity and\n      norepinephrine spillover, and low parasympathetic activity. It is generally accepted that\n      this uncontrolled, resistant HTN is primarily \"neurogenic\" in origin, involving over\n      activity of the sympathetic nervous system that initiates and sustains HTN. A surgical\n      approach such as the recently developed \"Simplicity Catheter\" assisted renal denervation\n      remains one of the few options available to these patients. Thus, a mechanism-based\n      breakthrough is imperative to develop novel strategies to prevent and perhaps eventually\n      cure neurogenic hypertension (NH). This study is designed to evaluate a low and high dose of\n      minocycline to test the hypothesis that minocycline treatment would produce antihypertensive\n      effects in drug-resistant neurogenic hypertensive individuals. Minocycline has been selected\n      because of its demonstrated effects on inhibiting microglial activation and its ability to\n      penetrate the blood brain barrier. There is no other compound available that is safer and\n      displays specificity better than Minocycline in inhibiting microglial activation. Thus, the\n      potential therapeutic benefits of this inexpensive, well tolerated, already FDA-approved\n      drug that has minimal side effects would be enormous."

At baseline, subjects will undergo blood tests (lipid panel, high\n      sensitivity-C reactive protein, high sensitivity troponin, glucose, metabolic profile, lipid\n      panel, Cystatin C and albumin).\n\n      Patients will have ambulatory BP monitoring completed. Systolic BP greater than 160 mm Hg\n      will result in randomization. Patients will be dispensed study medication and asked to\n      return every 12 weeks till the end of the study.\n\n      At each visit, a brief physical examination will be performed, an update of medical history,\n      an assessment of medication compliance and tolerance, and measurement of blood pressure and\n      other vital signs will be completed. Study drug will also be dispensed. At the six month\n      visit, a repeat pregnancy test will be performed. Prior to the patient returning for the 52\n      week visit, subjects will be mailed an ambulatory BP cuff to wear for the 24 hours prior to\n      returning for the final visit. At the final visit the same blood tests and urine studies as\n      done at baselines will be repeated. When they complete 52 weeks of treatment and come in for\n      their final visit, this will complete participation in the trial."
