To\n      compare the immune response to 100 mcg gp120 vaccine versus 300 mcg gp120 vaccine. To\n      determine whether gp120 vaccine immunization causes a significant immune response as defined\n      by specific parameters (e.g., induction of neutralizing antibodies to the IIIB isolate of\n      HIV-1, gp120 antigen-specific lymphocytic proliferation).\n\n      Recent evidence suggests that gp120 is the HIV-1 protein with the greatest potential as a\n      vaccine against HIV-1 infection. The gp120 envelope protein may be produced by recombinant\n      DNA technology, and studies have shown that the vaccine is capable of eliciting neutralizing\n      antibody activity in both rodents and nonhuman primate species."

For each dose level, 10\n      subjects will receive vaccine and four subjects will receive matching placebo. Injections\n      are given intramuscularly at 0, 4, and 32 weeks. Each subject receiving treatment at the\n      lower dose level must be monitored for unacceptable toxicity for at least 2 weeks following\n      the initial immunization before his or her second dose is administered and before treatment\n      at the higher dose level begins.
