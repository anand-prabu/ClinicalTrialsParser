  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Long-term indwelling urinary catheters are associated with chronic recurrent urinary tract
      infections and blockage caused by crystalline biofilm accumulation (encrustation) of the
      catheter surfaces.  When the urine and catheter are colonized by urease-producing bacteria
      such as Proteus mirabilis, encrustation of the catheter is likely to occur.

      The use of a catheter irrigation solution that can prevent biofilm formation and
      encrustation leading to blockage may keep the catheter patent longer, resulting in fewer
      catheter changes, potentially lower incidence of UTIs and better  patient quality of life.

      Auriclosene is a non-antibiotic, fast-acting, broad-spectrum antimicrobial, which exhibits
      potential for the rapid decolonization of a range of urologic pathogens, including the
      urease-producing Proteus mirabilis.

      Subjects will be randomized to either Auriclosene Irrigation Solution, Auriclosene in saline
      solution or citrate vehicle solution.
