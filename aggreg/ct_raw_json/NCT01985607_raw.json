The recommended treatment of CMA is an extensive\n      hydrolysate. The North American Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology Hepatology and\n      Nutrition (NASPGHAN) & the  European Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology Hepatology and\n      Nutrition (ESPGHAN) reflux guidelines have no strict recommendations for the treatment of\n      distressed infants with reflux, suspected of CMA. One of the preferred proposed options is\n      to thicken an extensive hydrolysate .\n\n      This study aims at evaluating the additional value of a thickened extensive hydrolysate in\n      children suspected of CMA and presenting with frequent regurgitation."
