Moxifloxacin (Avelox) is a drug with a known potential to create a\n      mild QTc interval prolongation; therefore, it will serve as a positive control to validate\n      the ability of this study to detect a change in the QTc interval. All subjects will\n      participate in 4 study periods separated by a minimum washout period of 5 days.  Each\n      subject will receive one of 4 regimens (A = Losmapimod 7.5 milligram [mg] Twice daily [BID]\n      x 5 days, B = Losmapimod 20 mg Once daily [QD] x 5 days, C = moxifloxacin 400 mg on Day 5, D\n      = Losmapimod matched placebo and moxifloxacin placebo x 5 days) in each of the 4 planned\n      study periods in a randomized, cross-over fashion. Subjects will be assigned to one of four\n      treatment sequences following a Williams design (ABDC, BCAD, CDBA, DACB). Follow-up visit\n      will occur 10 to 14 days after end of Period 4"
