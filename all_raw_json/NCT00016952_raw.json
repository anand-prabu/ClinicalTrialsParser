Patients are stratified according to prior\n      chemotherapy (oxaliplatin-based therapy vs irinotecan and oxaliplatin combination therapy).\n      Patients are assigned to one of two treatment groups.\n\n        -  Group I (prior oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy): Patients receive irinotecan IV over 90\n           minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks.\n\n        -  Group II (prior irinotecan and oxaliplatin combination chemotherapy): Patients receive\n           leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours and fluorouracil IV continuously on days 1 and 2.\n           Treatment repeats every 2 weeks.\n\n        -  Both groups: Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable\n           toxicity. Patients with a confirmed complete response for 2 consecutive courses may\n           discontinue treatment at investigator's discretion.\n\n      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, approximately every 6 weeks during treatment, and\n      then after the last course of treatment.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 5 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40-96 patients (20-48 per arm) will be accrued for this study\n      within 1-2 years."
