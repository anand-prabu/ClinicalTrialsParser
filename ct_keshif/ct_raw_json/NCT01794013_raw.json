Before the first session, all parents in the\n      intervention group had to learn about DIR/ Floortime\u2122 model approach through 1 - hour one on\n      one coaching (at the beginning oft the study, the end of 1st and 3rd month) and through 2\n      hours DVD lecture and a pocket book. The parent in the intervention group will be asked to\n      carry out FloortimeTM together with using Floortime strategies during daily activities a\n      minimum of 15 hour per week. Meanwhile, the children in the control groups will continue\n      their routine care. The baseline assessment and follow up time schedule were similar to\n      those of the intervention group."
