  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      According to World Health Organization (WHO) estimates, more than 200 million people suffer
      from asthma worldwide and in 2009, the disease had claimed 250,000 lives globally. Autopsy
      reports suggest 2 phenotypes of severe asthma: one that is characterized by intense airway
      inflammation with mucus plugging, and the other by severe bronchoconstriction causing
      respiratory failure in the absence of significant airway inflammation. However, it is not
      easy to stratify patients according to phenotypes without bronchoscopy. Although severe
      asthma comprises only 10% of affected individuals, it accounts for more than half of the
      total healthcare spending on asthma. Inhaled corticosteroids are effective by suppressing
      production of multiple pro-inflammatory mediators, unfortunately efficacy plateaus. Addition
      of long acting beta agonist and anti-cholinergic agent to inhaled corticosteroids offers
      some measure of relief but effective treatment of severe asthma remains an unmet goal,
      resulting in intensive utilization of healthcare resources. In 2010, the United States Food
      and Drug Administration (FDA) approved bronchial thermoplasty (BT) as an adjunctive therapy
      for severe asthma. BT is radiofrequency ablation of airway smooth muscle via bronchoscopy
      with each patient undergoing three procedures which targets different lobes of the lung 3
      weeks apart. Studies have demonstrated improved symptom control allowing discontinuation of
      oral steroids in some patients as well as reductions in exacerbations, hospitalizations and
      use of rescue medications. No development of airway strictures or bronchiectasis, and
      regeneration of normal epithelium after BT has been observed. At present, it remains unclear
      if BT benefits all asthma phenotypes or if BT has any effect on airway inflammation and
      remodeling.

      The hypothesis of this study is that bronchial thermoplasty is likely to benefit all severe
      asthma phenotypes, and achieves this by exerting an effect on airway inflammation and
      remodelling.

      The specific aims of the study are: 1) to better define the asthma phenotype who will
      benefit from BT by microarray and gene expression profiling; 2) to study effects of BT on
      airway inflammation; 3) to define its role in the overall asthma management algorithm
