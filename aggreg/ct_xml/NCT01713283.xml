Rebound: &gt; 1 log10IU/mL increase in HCV RNA from nadir while on treatment, confirmed with 2 consecutive values (note: second confirmation value can be posttreatment), or last available on-treatment measurement with no subsequent follow up values, or
Nonresponse: HCV RNA persistently ≥ LLOQ through 8 weeks of treatment</description>
