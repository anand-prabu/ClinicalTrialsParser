It is unknown whether kidney-sparing\n      surgery is more effective than kidney removal in treating kidney cancer.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of surgery to completely\n      remove the kidney with kidney-sparing surgery in treating patients with resectable kidney\n      cancer."
