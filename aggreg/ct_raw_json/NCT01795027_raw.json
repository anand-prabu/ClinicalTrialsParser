And TS-1 has become one of\n      the standard  therapies  to these patients. But it is still unknown whether  it would\n      improve more to OS and DFS than single TS-1 after combined with oxaliplatin . This trial is\n      designed to investigate  the efficacy and safety  of  TS-1 plus oxaliplatin versus TS-1\n      single as adjuvant chemotherapy after D2 resection in patients with gastric cancer.\n\n      Patients and methods: In this study , patients with histologically confirmed gastric cancer\n      who received D2 resection and staged II or III, aged from 18 to 70  years and  with Eastern\n      Cooperative Oncology Group performance status \u22642 and adequate organ function, are randomized\n      1:1 to oxaliplatin 100mg/m2 on day 1 and TS-1 40~60mg twice everyday for 14 days in a\n      21-days cycle for total 6 cycles followed by TS-1  single with the same dose and frequency\n      to the end of the 1st year postoperatively(SOX) , or  TS-1  single 40~60mg twice everyday\n      for 14 days in a 21-days cycle to the end of the 1st year postoperatively (TS-1). The\n      primary end point is overall survival (OS), and  secondary end point is disease free\n      survival(DFS) and safety. Final study analysis will be conducted in the end of the 5th year\n      after the last patient's enrollment."
