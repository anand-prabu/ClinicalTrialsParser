Previous clinical observation\n      showed the increase of lung water in liver transplant recipients. Some patients may even\n      develop pulmonary edema which not only lengthen intensive care unit stay and hospital stay,\n      but also increase morbidity and mortality. In the hepatic ischemia reperfusion animal model,\n      we proved that the release of large amount of reactive oxygen species play an important part\n      in remote lung injury. If propofol, which possesses free radical scavenger property, is\n      given adequately, the production of reactive oxygen species will decrease thus reducing the\n      extent of remote lung injury. In another clinical study, we found that resuming two lung\n      ventilation from one lung ventilation induces a massive superoxide production, which also\n      could be reduced when using propofol for the maintenance of anesthesia.\n\n      Postoperative pain caused by surgery-associated tissue injury is a major concern for all the\n      clinical practitioners.
