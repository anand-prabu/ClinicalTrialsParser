Evaluating the effects of complementary intervention (such as exercise\n      training) on functional status and QOL are clinically important and relevant to HF patients.\n\n      In the last decade, hospital-based and a home bicycle exercise programs for HF have been\n      shown to improve peak oxygen consumption (VO2) and symptom scores, and restore autonomic\n      balance. These programs may be costly for patients to perform.  Improved peak VO2 may not\n      necessarily translate into improved functional status and quality of life. To date, the\n      effects of a home walking exercise program alone on functional status, QOL and autonomic\n      tone has not been evaluated.\n\n      Objectives:\n\n      The specific aim was to compare functional status (FS), quality of life (QOL) and autonomic\n      tone in 2 groups of advanced HF patients (nurse-managed home walking exercise (HWE) group\n      vs. control group).\n\n      Methods:\n\n      A randomized controlled trial comparing a 12-week nurse-managed progressive HWE protocol to\n      usual activity was conducted in 79 HF patients (78[99%] male; mean age 62.6 \ufffd 10.6 years; EF\n      27 \ufffd 8.8%; 63 [80%] NYHA II, 15[20%] NYHA III-IV; HF duration 39.2 \ufffd 41.8 months) from a VA\n      medical center and a university affiliated medical center.  The 12- week HWE program is once\n      a day, 5x a week and initiated at 10 minutes and progressively increases in duration and\n      intensity up to 60 minutes. Pre- and post-study measures were FS (peak VO2 and ventilatory\n      threshold via CPX, 6-minute walk test (6MWT) and a Heart Failure Functional Status Inventory\n      (HFFSI)), QOL (Cardiac Quality of life Index (C-QLI), SF-36, and Dyspnea-Fatigue Index (DFI)\n      with global rating of symptoms), and autonomic tone (norepinephrine (NE) and heart rate\n      variability (HRV)).  Intention-to-treat analysis with repeated measures ANOVA was used to\n      identify group differences.\n\n      Status:\n\n      Completed."
