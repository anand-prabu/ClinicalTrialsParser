To determine the objective response rate of patients with malignant mesothelioma who are\n      treated with ARQ 197 (tivantinib).\n\n      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. To determine the progression-free survival of patients with malignant mesothelioma who\n      are treated with ARQ 197.\n\n      II. To determine the toxicity experienced by patients with malignant mesothelioma who are\n      treated with ARQ 197.\n\n      III. To determine median and overall survival of patients with malignant mesothelioma who\n      are treated with ARQ 197.\n\n      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. To determine the frequency of mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) gene amplification\n      in malignant mesothelioma patient tumor samples, and to correlate the results with MET\n      immunohistochemistry (IHC).\n\n      II. To determine whether MET gene amplification results in increased sensitivity to ARQ 197\n      as observed by improved clinical outcomes (response rate [RR] and progression free survival\n      [PFS]) compared to those without MET gene over-expression/amplification.\n\n      III. To determine whether high baseline serum hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), as well as\n      changes in serum HGF during treatment at pre-defined early time points, correlate with\n      treatment efficacy and clinical outcome, as measured by response rate and progression-free\n      survival.\n\n      IV. To identify mutations by sequencing of specific areas of the MET gene in tumor samples\n      (semaphorin [SEMA], jumonji [JM] and tyrosine kinase domains).\n\n      V. To perform immunohistochemistry (IHC) of mesothelioma tumors for HGF, MET and\n      phosphorylated (p)-MET (pY1003 and pY1230/34/35).\n\n      VI. To assess serum HGF and serum soluble MET levels by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay\n      (ELISA) (R&D systems) pre-treatment, after 2 cycles and at disease progression.\n\n      OUTLINE:\n\n      Patients receive tivantinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID). Treatment continues in the\n      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 1 year."

while\n             inhibitors/inducers of these cytochrome P450 isoenzymes are not specifically\n             excluded, investigators should be aware that ARQ 197 exposure may be altered by the\n             concomitant administration of these drugs; because the lists of these agents are\n             constantly changing, it is important to regularly consult a frequently-updated list;\n             as part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled\n             on the risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need\n             to be prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or\n             herbal product\n\n          -  History of congestive heart failure defined as Class II to IV per New York Heart\n             Association (NYHA) classification;

because there\n             is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to\n             treatment of the mother with ARQ 197, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the\n             mother is treated with ARQ 197\n\n          -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients on combination antiretroviral\n             therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with\n             ARQ197; in addition, these patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when\n             treated with marrow-suppressive therapy; appropriate studies will be undertaken in\n             patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated\n\n          -  No prior treatment with a c-MET inhibitor"
