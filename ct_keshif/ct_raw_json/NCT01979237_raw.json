            "textblock": "Shoulder anterior dislocation is a major disease entity in emergency department. There are\n      more than 10 reduction methods that have been reported. Traditional reduction methods\n      require sedatives, which could cause adverse effects on the patients such as respiratory\n      suppression and allergy. There are some reduction maneuvers reported recently which do not\n      need sedatives prior to performing reduction, including FARES method and SPASO method. So\n      far, there are no well-designed study to compare these two methods. Besides, in clinical\n      experience, we found that combining these two methods could even get higher successful\n      reduction rate. This study is aimed to compare these two methods as a prospective randomized\n      design, and furthermore, to show that combining these two methods could get higher\n      successful reduction rate."
