Insufficient stroke volume and/or\n      cardiac output due to hypovolemia or cardiac defects play a central role in causing poor\n      peripheral tissue oxygenation. In order to assess stroke volume, there are numerous invasive\n      and non-invasive methods available. Up to the present date it is unknown, if these methods\n      may by used interchangeably in patients with severe cardiac defects like aortic stenosis."
