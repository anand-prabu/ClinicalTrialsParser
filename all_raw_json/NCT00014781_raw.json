After the first blood draw, patients receive a beverage\n      containing sugar and write down everything they ate and drank during the 24 hours before\n      study entry.  Patients also undergo a dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan over 15\n      minutes.\n\n      Within 2 weeks after the OGTT, patients keep a journal of everything they ate and drank over\n      3 days.  Patients are fed a selected meal the following evening and receive saline fluids IV\n      overnight.  During the night, patients receive 2 doses of oral doubly labeled water. The\n      next morning, patients receive [1,2-13C]acetate IV.  A liquid mixed meal (Ensure Plus) is\n      ingested hourly throughout the day.  Patients also undergo hood indirect calorimetry over 30\n      minutes twice to measure resting energy expenditure. All urine is collected."
