            "textblock": "Cesarean section (CS) is the commonest major operation performed on women in the world.\n      Approximately one in 4 women in the United States is delivered by cesarean section, and it\n      is well established that operative abdominal delivery is associated with a significant risk\n      of infection compared with vaginal delivery. These risks are increased with preexisting\n      operative site infection, breaks in sterile technique, prolonged preoperative admissions\n      that may result in colonization with resistant microbes, prolonged operative duration,  use\n      of electrocautery, obesity, advanced age, inadequate host immunocompetence.\n\n      Obese women may have increased susceptibility to infections because of the effects of\n      obesity on the immune system, skin barriers, wound healing, mobility, and coexisting chronic\n      diseases including diabetes, which could increase infection risk by itself. Cohort studies\n      have shown that women with a body mass index (BMI)>30kg/m^2 have a two to three folds\n      increased risk of post cesarean infections, such as wound infection, urinary tract infection\n      UTI), endometritis, or pneumonia, compared with non-obese women. Other studies found that\n      obesity doubled the risk specifically for post-cesarean wound infection.\n\n      Wound complications are a major source of morbidity after CS and contribute to prolonged\n      hospital stay and rates of readmission. Age, (BMI), length of incision, and timing of\n      prophylactic antibiotic administration have all been associated with post cesarean surgical\n      site infection (SSI).\n\n      A surgical site infection is an infection that occurs after surgery in the part of the body\n      where the surgery took place. SSI can sometimes be superficial infections involving the skin\n      only. Other surgical site infections are more serious and can involve tissues under the\n      skin, organs, or implanted material. SSI has a great impact on the economy and health care\n      resources. Infection has always been a feature of modern surgery and continues to be a\n      significant problem for health care practitioners across the world.\n\n      The ideal skin closure would be safe and effective, associated with minimal patient\n      discomfort, and have a good cosmetic result. It would also be inexpensive and require fewer\n      health care resources by being fast and easy to apply, require minimal follow-up evaluation,\n      and be associated with a low rate of complications.\n\n      Methods for closing the skin at the time of cesarean delivery include stainless steel\n      staples, subcuticular absorbable staples, subcuticular suture, adhesive closure strips, and\n      tissue adhesives (cyanoacrylates). Each of the methods has its postulated benefits for wound\n      outcomes; however, none of these have been compared in a prospective trial.\n\n      The role of skin closure suture material on wound complication rates in Obstetrics is poorly\n      studied. And when we are talking about obese patients we did not find any recommendation\n      regarding the suture material of skin closure although most of Obstetricians use different\n      sutures materials.\n\n      Does closure of skin by absorbable compared to non absorbable suture affect the rate of\n      surgical site infection in obese patients undergoing caesarian section? Our hypothesis is\n      that no difference between absorbable compared to non absorbable suture."
