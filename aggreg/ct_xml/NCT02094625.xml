  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cisplatin is a key chemotherapy agent for the treatment of multiple childhood cancers but
      causes permanent hearing loss. This study investigates the drug N-acetylcysteine (NAC) to
      determine the dose necessary to protect hearing and also how well tolerated NAC is when
      combined with chemotherapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a dose-finding study of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) to protect hearing in children
      receiving cisplatin for the treatment of their cancer.  NAC also has potential to protect
      the kidneys from cisplatin toxicity.

      The study uses a 3+3 dose-escalation scheme to determine the dose of NAC necessary to
      achieve serum levels consistent with hearing protection in pre-clinical animal models. Three
      dose levels are predefined.  Once the maximum tolerated dose is determined, an expansion
      cohort will then be enrolled to further evaluate tolerability as well as intra-patient and
      inter-patient variability in achieved serum levels.

    <description>Subjects will be monitored during and after each NAC infusion to determine how well they tolerate the drug. Infusion rate related and spontaneously resolving &quot;anaphylactoid&quot; reactions are the most common reported toxicity and will be closely monitored. Most subjects will receive 3 cycles of cisplatin and NAC, typically within the first 15 weeks of starting chemotherapy. Subjects who opt to continue to receive NAC following the first 3 cycles will continue to be monitored.</description>

    <description>This is a dose-finding study using a traditional 3+3 dose escalation scheme.  Up to 18 subjects (3 dose levels as per below) will be enrolled to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD).  The MTD is defined as per traditional 3+3 criteria of less than or equal to one dose-limiting toxicity at the dose level.  Once the MTD is determined, subjects will be equally distributed at the &quot;safe&quot; dose levels (less than or equal to the MTD) to determine the optimum dose to achieve NAC levels in the blood necessary for hearing protection.  The selected dose will then be tested further in an expansion cohort of an additional 6 subjects.</description>
