  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this exploratory study is to compare the treatment effect on dentinal
      hypersensitivity of a tubule occluding dentifrice as measured by Schiff and Tactile
      sensitivity. This proof of concept study will compare the test dentifrice with three other
      treatment groups.

      This will be a single center, eight week, randomized, controlled, examiner blind, four
      treatment arms, parallel design study in participants with at least two sensitive teeth that
      meet all the criteria at the Screening and Baseline visit. Participants will be assessed at
      baseline, four and eight weeks to monitor clinical efficacy and safety.

    <description>Response to a constant jet of air applied to hypersensitive teeth is evaluated using a Schiff Sensitivity pain response scale. According to this analog scale, pain response for each individual stimulated tooth ranged from 0 to 3; 0 - participant does not respond to air stimulation, 1 - participant responds to air stimulus but does not request discontinuation of stimulus, 2 - participant responds to air stimulus and request discontinuation of stimulus, 3 - participant responds to air stimulus, considers stimulus to be painful and request discontinuation of stimulus.</description>

    <description>Response to increasing force on hypersensitive teeth is evaluated using a Yeaple Probe pain response scale. According to this tactile sensitivity assessment, an increasing force is applied to hypersensitive tooth until a yes response is recorded or the maximum force has been reached.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants between 18 and 55 years of age, in good general health, with
             pre-existing self-reported and clinically diagnosed tooth sensitivity are required
             for entry into the study.

          -  Participants will be required to have at least four teeth with facial/cervical
             erosion, abrasion and/or gingival recession which respond to qualifying evaporative
             (air) assessment at the Screening visit and have at least two teeth (incisors,
             canines or pre-molars) demonstrating signs of sensitivity, measured by qualifying
             tactile threshold (Yeaple ≤ 20 gram (g)) and evaporative (air) (Schiff Sensitivity
             Score ≥ 2) assessments at the Baseline visit.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Specific Dentition Exclusions for Test teeth

               1. Tooth with evidence of current or recent caries, or reported treatment of decay
                  in 12 months of Screening.

               2. Tooth with exposed dentin but with deep, defective or facial restorations, teeth
                  used as abutments for fixed or removable partial dentures, teeth with full
                  crowns or veneers, orthodontic bands or cracked enamel.  Sensitive teeth with
                  contributing etiologies other than erosion, abrasion or recession of exposed
                  dentin.

               3. Sensitive tooth not expected to respond to treatment with an over-the-counter
                  dentifrice in the opinion of the investigator

          -  Use of a sensitivity dentifrice within 8 weeks of screening

          -  Individuals who require antibiotic prophylaxis for dental procedures
