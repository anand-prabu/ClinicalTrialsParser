Drugs used in\n      chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or\n      die. Combining chemotherapy with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of radiation therapy plus fludarabine in\n      treating patients who have locally advanced cancer of the mouth, pharynx, or larynx."

Determine the maximum tolerated dose of fludarabine that can be given during\n      the sixth and seventh weeks of radiotherapy in patients with locally advanced squamous cell\n      carcinoma of the oral cavity, pharynx, or larynx, based on the systemic toxicity of the drug\n      and the acute mucosal reactions in the irradiated fields. II. Document the qualitative and\n      quantitative toxicity of this combination therapy in this patient population.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of fludarabine. Patients receive radiotherapy on\n      days 1-5 for 7 weeks. Patients receive fludarabine IV on days 1-5 of weeks 6 and 7 of\n      radiotherapy. Fludarabine is administered 3-4 hours prior to daily radiotherapy. Cohorts of\n      3 patients receive escalating doses of fludarabine until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is\n      determined. The MTD is defined as the dose that produces a severe toxicity rate nearest to\n      20%. Patients are followed every 4 weeks after the completion of treatment until acute\n      reactions have resolved, then every 3 months for 2 years, every 4 months for 1 year, and\n      then every 6 months for 2 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 18 patients will be accrued for this study within 1.5 years."
