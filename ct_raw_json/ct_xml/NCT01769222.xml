    <textblock>
      This pilot phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best of dose ipilimumab when given
      together with local radiation therapy and to see how well it works in treating patients with
      recurrent melanoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, colon, or rectal cancer. Monoclonal antibodies,
      such as ipilimumab, can block cancer growth in different ways. Some block the ability of
      cancer cells to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and help kill them or carry
      cancer-killing substances to them. Radiation therapy uses high energy x rays to kill cancer
      cells. Giving monoclonal antibody therapy together with radiation therapy may be an
      effective treatment for melanoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, colon, or rectal cancer

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the safety of combining intratumoral anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated
      protein 4 (CTLA4) immunotherapy with local radiation therapy in patients with melanoma,
      non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and colorectal carcinoma with a monotherapy ipilimumab safety lead-in.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the induction of an anti-tumor immune responses using laboratory correlative
      studies.

      II. To determine tumor response rates and duration of response at unirradiated tumor sites
      in patients with advanced malignancies.

      III. To identify putative immunologic biomarkers of tumor response.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I dose-escalation study of ipilimumab, followed by a phase II
      study.

      Patients receive ipilimumab intratumorally on day 1 and undergo local radiation therapy
      within 48 hours for at least 3 fractions.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4 and 8 weeks, and then
      every 24 weeks for 5 years.

             investigator will make the administration of ipilimumab hazardous or obscure the
             interpretation of adverse events (AEs), such as a condition associated with frequent
             diarrhea

          -  Patients with underlying heart conditions who are deemed ineligible for surgery by

             the course of the study, in a manner such that risk of failure is minimized; before
             study enrollment, WOCBP must be advised of the importance of avoiding pregnancy
             during study participation and the potential risk factors for an unintentional
             pregnancy; all WOCBP MUST have a negative pregnancy test before first receiving
             ipilimumab; if the pregnancy test is positive, the patient must not receive
