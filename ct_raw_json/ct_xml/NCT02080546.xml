      Purpose of the study Part 1: Retrospective Review: The purpose of part 1 is to establish the
      historical rate of vaginal cuff dehiscence following total laparoscopic hysterectomy
      compared to total abdominal hysterectomy (TAH), total vaginal hysterectomy (TVH), radical
      hysterectomy (RH) and laparoscopic-assisted vaginal hysterectomy (LAVH) at Duke University
      Medical Center.

      Part 2: Prospective Randomized Controlled Trial: The purpose of part 2 is to determine if
      the mode of electrothermal colpotomy incision affects (1) the degree of thermal injury at
      the time of laparoscopic hysterectomy or (2) the incidence of clinical surrogates of
      compromised vaginal cuff healing. Women already scheduled for TLH will be randomized to
      colpotomy incision with the V mode or standard cut/coag form of electrothermal energy.

      Prevalence of vaginal cuff injury will be calculated, and cross tabulation tables will be
      used to examine the association fo dehiscence with proposed risk factors in the
      retrospective part of the study. In the randomized controlled trial, depth of thermal injury
      will be compared between the two groups, and a chi-square test will be used to test for a
      difference in clinical outcomes between the two groups. There is little risk associated with
      this study above the normal surgical risks; however, the V mode has not been previously been
      studied for its use in making a colpotomy incision. Loss of confidentiality is a risk of the
      study, but all samples will be de-identified and given a unique study number, and only
      individuals directly involved in the study will be given access to the study information.
