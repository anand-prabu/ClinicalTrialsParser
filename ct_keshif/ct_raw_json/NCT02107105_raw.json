You will complete the questionnaires before surgery for rectal cancer (if\n      you have not yet had surgery), at 6 and 12 months after surgery, and then 2, 3, 4 and 5\n      years after surgery.  You will receive and return the questionnaires in the clinic, although\n      if you are unable to come to the clinic for your regular follow-up, you may be able to\n      receive and return your surveys by mail if recommended by the PI. They should take about\n      20-30 minutes to complete.\n\n      In addition, your medical records will be reviewed to learn about what kind of treatments\n      you may have had, and whether you have had any complications related to your treatment.\n\n      This is an investigational study.\n\n      Up to 330 participants will be enrolled on this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson."
