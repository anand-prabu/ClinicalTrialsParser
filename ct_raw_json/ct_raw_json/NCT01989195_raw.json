            "textblock": "We hope to introduce a novel MRI contrast agent with SeeM ore \u2122 that directly defines viable\n      myocardium. Identifying viable myocardium non-invasively using cardiac MRI is still a moving\n      target and a question we plan to answer more definitively with the SeeMore \u2122 contrast.\n      Though well tested. in small and large animals and Phase I & II clinical trials, we would\n      like to determine the efficacy of the SeeM ore TM contrast further in a clinical setting.\n\n      SeeM ore \u2122 is a new manganese (Mn)-based intravenous imaging agent being developed to\n      enhance magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). While Mn has long been known to have desirable\n      magnetic and kinetic properties for MRI, use in humans was not initially possible due to\n      cardiovascular depression and electrocardiogram (ECG)changes, including prolongation of PR\n      and QTc intervals, associated with intravenous administration [1-5]. Chelation of Mn, as had\n      been done with gadolinium for use with MRI, provided relevant safety, but sacrificed\n      desirable magnetic and kinetic properties [6]. SeeM ore rM provides Mn in a form that\n      maintains the desired magnetic and kinetic properties while overcoming the cardiovascular\n      toxicity of Mn. SeeM ore rM is taken up into heart cells .(primarily via addition of calcium\n      to avoid cardiotoxic effects; please refer to US patent #5,980,863). The potential to\n      distinguish healthy heart tissue from unhealthy heart tissue based on a specific sustained\n      pattern of enhancement provides a basis for evaluating the performance of SeeM ore rM in\n      heart patients. MRI offers benefits over other imaging technologies. Relative to radioactive\n      nuclear imaging procedures, MRI is 3-dimensional, provides good soft tissue discrimination,\n      and is of high spatial and temporal resolution. These features have been reported to\n      identify smaller defects (e.g., subendocardial infarcts) and match angiographic results more\n      closely than other modalities such as SPECT [7,8]. It may be possible to enhance the utility\n      of MRI for heart disease further through the use of an imaging agent that is specifically\n      taken up into heart cells. SeeM ore rM is the only cardiac-specific agent being developed\n      for this purpose. Unlike nuclear perfusion agents, SeeM ore rM is not radioactive and does\n      not require special handling, shielding, transport or storage. In addition, the specific\n      pattern of enhancement achieved in the heart muscle persists over time, offering potential\n      .benefits over the nonspecific extracellular agents currently available for MRI or X-ray/CT\n      procedures. This feature allows full use of the high resolution of MRI, since there is not a\n      trade-off of high spatial resolution for temporal (first-pass) resolution. It is anticipated\n      the features offered by SeeMore\u2122 along with the high resolution, three dimensional\n      attributes of MRI will result in higher accuracy than is available with other current\n      modalities in practice, including stress echocardiograms, cardiac MRI using gadolinium\n      contrast and nuclear studies such as SPECT and PET. This will be evaluated in this study and\n      serve as the basis for pivotal registration studies.\n\n      All components of SeeMore\u2122 are USP and are approved for use as drugs in man, orally and/or\n      intravenously. A summary of the Phase I safety and PK (pharmacokinetics)study are provided\n      below.\n\n      The Phase I study evaluated the safety and tolerance of SeeM ore \u2122 in humans, with special\n      emphasis on cardiovascular safety, and assessed its PK profile."
