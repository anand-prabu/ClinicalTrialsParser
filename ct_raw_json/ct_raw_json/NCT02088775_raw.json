To evaluate the ability of PET-CT to reproducibly determine dose to tumor, normal liver,\n      and other surrounding organs.\n\n      II. To determine the stability of microsphere location by examining the changes in dose in a\n      subset of patients with PET-CT scans performed on day 0 and day 1.\n\n      III.
