In a previous study (not\n      yet published) we showed that remifentanil induce pulmonary aspiration in healthy volunteers\n      and the aim of this study is to objectively determine weather remifentanil infusion in\n      healthy volunteers influence the pharyngeal phase of swallowing. The purpose is also compare\n      the effect of remifentanil to morphine and younger volunteers to elderly volunteers.  To\n      assess this question we are going to study 24 volunteers, 12 younger and 12 elderly,  who\n      are randomised to receive remifentanil infusion with target concentration 3 ng/ml during 30\n      minutes at one occasion and an injection of morphine (younger: 0.1 mg/kg, elderly 0.07\n      mg/kg) at the other. The volunteers are asked to swallow  10 ml normal saline several times\n      both before and after opioid administration and pharyngeal motility is parallelly recorded\n      using combined manometry and impedance catheter placed transnasally into to the\n      pharyngo-esophageal segment. Any subjective swallowing difficulties are also recorded."
