      to patients with unresectable locally advanced pancreatic cancer combined with chemotherapy
      treatment.

      In this Phase II study a single dose 3,000µg (eight 375µg siG12DLODERs) will be administered
      to patients with unresectable LAPC combined with chemotherapy treatment (Gemcitabine or
      FOLFIRINOX). This will be the first study to assess the response rate of the siG12D LODER in
      patients with unresectable LAPC. The study is of a two-arm design with one arm receiving
      siG12D LODER + chemotherapy, while the other arm receiving ony chemotherapy.

      The investigational agent siG12D LODER is a miniature biodegradable capsule that encompasses
      the drug, designed and produced by Silenseed Ltd. The implantation of LODERs is selected to
      meet current gastroenterology endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) biopsy procedures, proved to be
      highly effective and safe.

      siG12D LODER has been studied in the escalating dose Phase I study of 12 patients, and
      results showed a high safety and tolerability profiles, with no single DLT.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Provide written informed consent and be between the ages of 18 and up.

          -  Have an unresectable, locally advanced diagnosed adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. Or
             patients with a tumor who are not planning to undergo surgery due to a high surgical
             risk (e.g., coagulopathy or severe congestive heart failure).

          -  Allocated to receive standard of care chemo as first line treatment in accordance
             with treating physician recommendation.

          -  Have a target tumor that is accessible for intratumoral administration by PTA or EUS
             guidance as determined by the radiologist/gastroenterologist performing the PTA/EUS
             injection.

          -  Have an ECOG performance status of ≤ 1

          -  Have a life expectancy of ≥ 3 months.

          -  If female and of child-bearing potential, have a negative serum pregnancy test during
             screening.

          -  Agree to use a barrier method of contraception if sexually active (both men and
             women) from the time of administration of the first treatment and for at least 8
             weeks after treatment.

          -  Have serum creatinine&lt; 2.0 mg/dL, INR &lt; 1.5, absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt; 1,000
             x 103 cells/mL, platelets ≥ 75,000/mL, and hemoglobin ≥ 10 mg/dL.

          -  Have screening procedures completed within 4 weeks of starting treatment.

          -  No other malignancy present that would interfere with the current intervention.

          -  Have measurable disease. Patients must have clinically and/or radiographically
             documented measurable disease. At least one site of disease must be unidimensionally
             measurable as follows:

        CT-scan {&gt; 10 mm} Lymph node short axis{ &gt; 15 mm}
