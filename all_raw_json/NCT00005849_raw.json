Determine the overall survival and time to tumor progression in patients\n      treated with this regimen. III. Determine the T cell subset analysis and serum levels of\n      interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha in these patients after receiving bryostatin 1\n      and correlate with clinical endpoints.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour on days 1,\n      8, and 15 and bryostatin 1 IV over 1 hour on days 2, 9, and 16. Treatment repeats every 4\n      weeks for a minimum of 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable\n      toxicity. Patients are followed for at least 2 years for survival.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-40 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year."
