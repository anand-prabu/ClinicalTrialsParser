One experienced orthopaedic surgeon performed all double-bundle (DB)\n      ACL reconstructions. Two independent examiners made the clinical examinations at the\n      two-year follow-up: clinical examination of the knee, KT-1000, International Knee\n      Documentation Committee (IKDC) and Lysholm knee evaluation scores and IKDC functional score.\n      The MRI evaluations were made by two musculoskeletal radiologists separately and the means\n      of these measurements were used."
