  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cirrhosis is associated with a reduction in muscle mass and exercise capacity. This has an
      impact on morbidity and mortality. Regular aerobic exercise training is a proven effective
      therapy to improve exercise capacity in healthy and clinical populations. The effect of this
      training has not yet been evaluated in the decompensated cirrhosis patient population. The
      safety of this intervention also requires further study. Using a randomized controlled
      design, the investigators aim to determine the safety and efficacy of eight weeks of aerobic
      exercise training on aerobic capacity, functional performance, and muscle mass in
      decompensated cirrhosis patients.
