Additional cortisol levels are drawn at 30 and 60 minutes.\n      Corticotropin is measured by immunoradiometric assay and cortisol is measured by\n      radioimmunoassay.  Mean arterial blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate are\n      recorded at baseline and at 60 minutes.\n\n      Patients receive routine management for septic shock and multiple organ system failure."
