Hopefully, the results of this study can be applied to humans.\n\n      AIDS, which is caused by infection with HIV, is associated with many deaths and occurrences\n      of disease. Although recent advances have been made in anti-HIV therapy for AIDS, there is\n      no cure for HIV infection or AIDS, and drug therapy is too expensive for most infected\n      populations. Some organizations are trying to make safe and effective vaccines that may\n      prevent HIV infection and AIDS worldwide. Certain vaccines can generate specific antibodies\n      in humans, but they do not inhibit HIV infection in laboratory tests. It is possible,\n      however, that these antibodies may make HIV disease less severe following infection. For\n      this reason, monkeys will be used to evaluate the role of specific human antibodies."

            "textblock": "AIDS, caused by infection with the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is associated\n      with enormous morbidity and mortality worldwide. Although recent advances have been made in\n      antiretroviral therapy for AIDS, there is no cure for HIV infection or AIDS, and drug\n      therapy is too expensive for most infected populations. The development of safe, effective\n      vaccines to prevent HIV infection and AIDS worldwide is a commitment of some health-oriented\n      organizations. A major goal in the effort to design an effective vaccine has been the\n      identification of the immunologic correlates of protective immunity. Non-neutralizing\n      antibodies might possess clinically important anti-HIV activities that remain to be defined\n      and warrant investigation. The role played by antibody with minimal neutralizing activity\n      induced by various HIV vaccination strategies is unknown. It is possible that low-level\n      neutralization or other activities may lead to an improvement or worsening in disease course\n      following infection. For this reason it is proposed that a challenge trial in  the rhesus\n      macaque SHIV model be performed, in which the role of such antibodies, which are derived\n      from non-infected human vaccinees, will be evaluated.\n\n      This is a 2-part study. Part I involves human participants; Part II involves rhesus\n      macaques.\n\n      Part 1: Human participants are divided into 2 groups:\n\n      Group I: Participants who previously were enrolled in specific AIDS Vaccine Evaluation Group\n      (AVEG) protocols are immunized with a single dose of the recombinant gp160MN/LAI-2 vaccine\n      in alum (aluminum hydroxide adjuvant) on Day 0 of the study.\n\n      Group II: Participants who are vaccine naive receive no immunization. Each participant will\n      have 5 clinic visits during the study. Blood is drawn at each visit for routine testing and\n      immune system check. Sera is drawn from participants for neutralizing antibody\n      determination. Approximately 3 weeks after immunization (Day 18), blood is drawn from\n      participants of both groups for a plasmapheresis procedure in which platelets and plasma are\n      removed. This process is repeated 1 week later. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) is purified from the\n      plasma of vaccinated participants.\n\n      Part II: Juvenile rhesus macaques are divided into 4 groups and are infused with IgG from\n      human participants of Groups I and II at Day 0. At Day 1, the macaques are exposed to\n      SHIV-89.6P. At Days 3, 7, 10, and weekly up to Day 73, the CD4 lymphocyte count, plasma\n      viremia, and antibodies of the macaques are measured."
