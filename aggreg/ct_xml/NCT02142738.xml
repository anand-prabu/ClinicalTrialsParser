  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an efficacy and safety study to assess pembrolizumab (SCH 900475) compared to
      standard of care (SOC) platinum-based chemotherapies in the treatment of participants with
      previously untreated stage IV, programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) strong expressing
      Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC). The primary hypothesis of this study is that
      participants with PD-L1 strong NSCLC will have a longer Progression Free Survival (PFS), as
      assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) when
      treated with pembrolizumab than when treated with platinum-based chemotherapies.

      Treatment Phase: Participants randomized to pembrolizumab will be treated for up to 35
      cycles or until documented progressive disease (PD) occurs. Participants randomized to SOC
      chemotherapies will be treated with their randomized study drug for up to 4-6 cycles. After
      this, participants with non-squamous histologies may choose to be treated with maintenance
      pemetrexed for the remainder of the study or until PD occurs. For the SOC chemotherapy
      participants, If documented PD occurs, these participants may be eligible for the Cross-Over
      Phase. Cross-Over Phase: This is only applicable for participants randomized to SOC who have
      documented PD. Participants will be treated with pembrolizumab for the remainder of the
      study or until PD occurs.
