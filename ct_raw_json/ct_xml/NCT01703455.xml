    <textblock>
      This is a single agent, prospective, open-label, monocenter, phase II trial of sorafenib in
      patients with recurrent and/or metastatic salivary gland carcinoma. This trial will be
      conducted with the primary aim to determine the response rate (CR+PR) according to the
      RECIST criteria. Response rate according to CHOI criteria, correlation between CHOI criteria
      and outcome, disease Control Rate (DCR) and acute toxicity will be evaluated as secondary
      objectives.
