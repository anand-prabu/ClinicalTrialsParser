  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oral mucositis (OM) is a common adverse effect of chemotherapy, radiotherapy and
      conditioning regimens before Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT). The aim of this
      study is to effectiveness of cryotherapy as a prophylactic treatment in children undergoing
      HSCT.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is a complex pathobiology behind OM; chemo and radiotherapy affects the mucosa and
      submucosa causing DNA-strand brakes and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). This
      initiates a cascade of events, among others activation of transcription factors,
      up-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and activation of macrophages and proteases
      leading to tissue injury causing symptoms such as erythema, edema, ulceration, taste
      perception alterations, and mouth dryness. OM often causes local and systemic infections,
      fatigue, pain, and difficulties in basal functions such as swallowing (and hence drinking
      and eating) and talking and reduces patients' psychological well-being. Nearly 90 % of
      pediatric patients undergoing HSCT are afflicted with OM. In pediatric patients mucositis is
      reported as one of the most painful and debilitating side effects during cancer
      treatment.Beyond a significant suffering for the patient it is hence associated with higher
      costs for health care and increased mortality.

      The current scientific situation regarding prevention and treatment of OM  has been
      summarized in Cochrane reports showing limited data on adults and practically missing data
      on children and adolescents. Concluding guidelines from these reports emphasize the need for
      well conducted randomized controlled trials (RCT's) to evaluate and refine treatments in
      order to establish evidence based interventions.

      The use of cryotherapy to prevent oral mucositis in patients who are receiving high-dose
      chemotherapy as a conditioning agent prior to HSCT continue to show evidence in the adult
      population.

      The aim of this study is to compare treatment with cryotherapy (Arm 1)with a standard oral
      care protocal (Arm 2)

      ARM 1 Children are instructed to use chew on ice-chips, ingest ice-cream or ice-water during
      infusion of chemotherapy as part of the conditioning treatment prior to HSCT. Melted ice
      should be replaced by new as soon as possible. Children receiving a 24-hour infusion are
      instructed to use cryotherapy for one hour 4 times a day.

      ARM 2 Standard care for prevention and management of oral mucositis

      Primary outcome

        -  Degree and duration of Oral mucositis

      Secondary outcomes

        -  Oral pain

        -  Weight loss

        -  Duration of neutropenic fever

        -  Duration of antibiotic treatment

        -  Duration of hospitalization

        -  Emotional and psychological status

        -  C reactive protein (CRP) and s-albumin correlation to grade of Oral Mucositis
