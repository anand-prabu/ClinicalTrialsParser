    <textblock>
      Patient suffering a Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) or stroke are subsequently at high risk
      of a new stroke, however, poor adherence to secondary prevention medications occurs
      frequently within this patient group.  The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether a
      complex tailored pharmacist intervention will lead to increased adherence to secondary
      stroke prevention medications and less new stroke events when compared to a usual care
      group.  Interventions focus on motivational interviewing, medication review and telephone
      follow up.
