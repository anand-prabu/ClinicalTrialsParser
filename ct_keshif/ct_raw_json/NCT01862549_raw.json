Further, DBT-C, as\n      compared with TAU will have significantly higher treatment satisfaction rating by subjects\n      (on the child and caregiver Therapy Satisfaction Questionnaires), and by therapists (on\n      Therapist Satisfaction Scale), and higher patient compliance (on Psychosocial Treatment\n      Compliance Scale).  Therapist treatment adherence and competence as measured by DBT-C\n      Treatment Integrity Scale, will not fall below 80%.\n\n      Specific Aim 2: Examine preliminary efficacy of DBT-C in reducing symptoms of Disruptive\n      Mood Dysregulation Disorder.\n\n      Hypothesis 2: Children in DBT-C condition as compared to TAU will have significantly greater\n      reduction in irritability, anger, aggression, temper outbursts, and mood instability (on\n      Clinical Global Impression - Improvement scale [primary categorical outcome] and Mood\n      Symptoms Questionnaire [primary continuous outcome]).\n\n      Exploratory Aim 3: Examine efficacy of DBT-C in improving adaptive coping skills, emotional\n      and behavioral regulation, social skills, and reducing aggressive behaviors, affective\n      reactivity, non-suicidal self-harm behaviors, suicidal ideations, suicidal attempts, and\n      non-suicidal self-harm urges.\n\n      Hypothesis 3: Children in DBT-C condition as compared to TAU will have significantly greater\n      improvement in adaptive coping skills (on the Children's Coping Strategies Checklist),\n      emotional and behavioral regulation (on the Emotion Regulation Checklist and Child Behavior\n      Checklist - Dysregulation Syndrome) and social skills (on the Social Skills Rating Scale),\n      and significantly greater reduction in aggressive behaviors (Measure of Aggression, Violence\n      and Rage in Children), affective reactivity (on the Affective Reactivity Index), and greater\n      reduction in non-suicidal self-harm behaviors (in Columbia Suicide and Self-Injury Severity\n      Rating Scale [C-SSIS] self-injurious behaviors),  suicidal ideations (in the C-SSRS suicidal\n      ideation classification category), suicidal attempts (in C-SSIS suicide attempts category),\n      and non-suicidal self-harm urges (in C-SSIS self-injurious urges, no suicidal intent\n      category).\n\n      Exploratory Aim 4: Examine efficacy of DBT-C in reducing the need for higher level services.\n\n      Hypothesis 4: Children in DBT-C condition as compared to TAU will have significantly fewer\n      psychiatric hospitalization, emergency room visits, total number of days inpatient, and\n      residential care placements (on the Services Assessment Form).\n\n      Exploratory Aim 5: Examine whether parent emotion regulation moderate the relationship\n      between intervention and outcomes, while parent ability to effectively cope with children's\n      negative emotions and children's coping skills and emotion regulation mediate outcomes.\n\n      Hypothesis 5: Parents' own emotion regulation (on the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation\n      Scale) will moderate outcomes and parents' ability to effectively cope with children's\n      negative emotions (on the Parental Response to Children's Negative Emotions), children\n      coping skills (on the Children's Coping Strategies Checklist) and emotion regulation (on\n      Emotion Regulation Checklist) will mediate outcomes."
