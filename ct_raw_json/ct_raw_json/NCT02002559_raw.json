Superficial\n      esophageal neoplasia were diagnosed by IPCL Type IV, V1,V2 and Vn. Lugol chromoendoscopy\n      would be performed subsequently and suspicious neoplasia were classified as understain or\n      unstain lesions. The diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of NBI were compared\n      to Lugol chromoendoscopy with histology serving as a gold standard."
