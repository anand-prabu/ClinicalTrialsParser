Closure of the deep tissues and superficial perineal skin using a continuous 3-0 Vicryl\n           suture\n\n        2. Closure of the deep tissues with a continuous 3-0 Vicryl suture and reapproximation of,\n           but not suture-closure of the perineal skin.\n\n      The primary goal of our study is to compare patient pain amongst the following three\n      perineal skin repair techniques after second degree laceration:\n\n        1. Perineal skin closure with suturing\n\n        2. Not suturing the perineal skin\n\n        3. Closure of the perineal skin with n-Butyl 2-cyanoacrylate (Indermil\u00ae) surgical glue.\n\n      In all women, the deep vaginal and perineal tissues will be closed using a continuous 3-0\n      Vicryl suture, as is current standard practice.\n\n      Aim: To assess and compare patient pain among the three groups at intervals of 1 day, 2\n      weeks, 6 weeks and 3 months postpartum."
