Indeed, depressive symptoms have been linked\n      with elevated plasma concentrations of D-dimer and Interleukin-6 (IL-6), both of which are\n      associated with increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). The present research tests\n      a brief behavioral intervention for reducing both depressive symptoms and CVD biomarkers in\n      Alzheimer caregivers. We hypothesize that caregivers receiving a brief Behavioral Activation\n      (BA) therapy will show greater reductions in depressive symptoms and in CVD biomarkers\n      relative to those randomized to a time-equivalent Information and Support (IS) therapy."

The stresses associated with\n      this care have been well-documented in the scientific literature, and are noted to be\n      associated with increased risk for psychological and physical morbidity, particularly\n      cardiovascular disease. Indeed, caregiving is associated with elevations in negative affect\n      (e.g., depressive and anxiety symptoms), which in turn is associated with biological\n      indicators that are thought to predict CVD risk (e.g., markers of coagulation and\n      inflammation). The primary goal of this study is to examine the efficacy of a brief\n      Behavioral Activation (BA) Treatment, called the Pleasant Events Program (PEP), for reducing\n      biological CVD risk indicators in a sample of Alzheimer caregivers. We will enroll 100\n      dementia caregivers and randomly assign them to receive 4-sessions of PEP or 4-sessions of\n      support + information. Our PEP intervention will be conducted in caregivers' homes and will\n      emphasize the importance of monitoring and increasing activities that help individuals make\n      contact with natural reinforcers in their environments, identifying and reducing negative\n      coping responses, and selection and achievement of behavioral goals for healthier living.\n      Caregivers will be assessed for our biological outcomes at baseline, post-treatment, and\n      1-year to determine intervention efficacy. Given the brief nature of the PEP intervention,\n      the ease with which it can be applied in real-world settings (e.g., community agencies\n      providing services to caregivers), and lack of difficult skills for interventionists and\n      caregivers to acquire, we believe our PEP intervention will be easily transferred to\n      \"real-world\" settings. If our PEP intervention is efficacious, it may have a considerable\n      impact on both the physical and mental health of caregivers, and will likely have public\n      health implications."
