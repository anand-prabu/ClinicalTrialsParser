            "textblock": "Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) treatment guidelines recommend an incremental\n      approach to pharmacological treatment as the disease state worsens, involving the use of\n      combinations of drug classes with different or complementary mechanisms of action [Celli,\n      2004, GOLD 2009].  As disease progresses from mild to moderate, regular treatment with one\n      or more long-acting bronchodilators is recommended. Inhaled bronchodilators, including beta2\n      agonists and anticholinergics are included with ICS therapy and are mainstays of therapy in\n      patients diagnosed with COPD. Since GSK573719 Inhalation Powder is expected to be used for\n      chronic management of COPD as long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA), this study is\n      intended to evaluate the safety and tolerability of long-term administration of GSK573719\n      Inhalation Powder 125 mcg in Japanese patients with COPD at doses possibly used to be in\n      Japan.\n\n      In this study, patient safety will also be monitored by evaluating pulmonary function and\n      clinical symptoms."
