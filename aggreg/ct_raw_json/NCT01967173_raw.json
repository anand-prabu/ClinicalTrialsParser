Baseline FEV1\u226540% of predicted and/or post-bronchodilator FEV1\u226540% of predicted.\n\n          5. Asthma confirmed either by: (1) Beta-agonist reversibility to 4 puffs albuterol \u2265 12%\n             OR (2) PC20FEV1 \u2264 16 mg/ml OR (3) an absolute relative change in %predicted FEV1 of \u2265\n             12% over two measurements documented by repeat spirogram over the previous year\n\n          6.

Inadequate asthma control will\n             be defined as an ACT/c-ACT score <20; well-controlled asthma will be defined as an\n             ACT/c-ACT score \u226520.\n\n          7. Stable asthma controller therapy dose (ICS or ICS/LABA) for the 2 weeks prior to\n             enrollment.\n\n          8. Non-smoker (total lifetime smoking history < 5 pack-years if <18, or <10 pack-years\n             if \u226518 years of age; no smoking for at least 1 year).\n\n          9. For participants \u226518 years of age: Ability to provide informed consent.

Major medical problems prohibiting study participation, i.e. presence of chronic or\n             active lung disease other than asthma or history of unstable significant medical\n             illness other than asthma, including thyroid disease, diabetes mellitus, Cushing's\n             disease, Addison's disease, hepatic disease, or concurrent medical problems that\n             could require oral corticosteroids during the study or that would place the\n             participant at increased risk.\n\n          5. Systemic corticosteroid treatment for any condition within 4 weeks of enrollment or\n             more than five courses of systemic corticosteroids in the past year.\n\n          6.

History of a respiratory tract infection within 4 weeks of enrollment.\n\n          8. If a female of child-bearing potential, failure to practice abstinence or use an\n             acceptable birth control method.\n\n          9. Pregnancy or lactation or planning to get pregnant during the course of the trial.\n\n         10. Receiving hyposensitization therapy other than an established maintenance regimen\n             defined as a continuous regimen for \u2265 3 months prior to enrollment.\n\n         11. Participation in an intervention trial or use of investigative drugs in the past 30\n             days or plans to enroll in such a trial during the study."

If treatment superiority cannot be assigned by exacerbations, then they are compared by asthma control days (ACDs). If one treatment yields at least 31 annualized ACDs more than another, it is deemed the superior treatment. If treatment superiority still cannot be assigned by ACDs, then they are compared by percent predicted FEV1 at the end of a treatment period.  If one treatment yields at least 5% greater FEV1 than another, it is deemed the superior treatment.  If treatment superiority cannot be assigned by exacerbations, ACDs or FEV1, then that participant is classified as having no differential response.",
