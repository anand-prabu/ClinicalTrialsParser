  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, Phase 1/2 study that will be conducted in two parts. The
      Phase 1 part will comprise dose escalation and establishment of the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) when E7438 is given BID (twice daily) orally on a continuous basis. Additionally, in
      separate cohorts in Phase 1, the effect of food on the bioavailability of E7438 will be
      evaluated as well as the drug-drug interaction (DDI) potential as evaluated by the effect of
      E7438 on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of midazolam, a CYP3A4 substrate.

      Once the MTD has been confirmed and a Phase 2 dose has been recommended, the protocol will
      be amended with updated dosing instructions and safety instructions. The Phase 2 part will
      determine the safety and activity of E7438 in EZH2 mutation positive subjects with
      histologically confirmed diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) or Grade 3 follicular
      lymphomas with relapsed or refractory disease following 1) high-dose therapy (HDT) and
      autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT), or 2) at least one combination chemotherapy
      containing rituximab and an anthracycline (unless anthracycline-based therapy is
      contraindicated), and are ineligible or unwilling to undergo HDT and ASCT.

             a negative beta-human chorionic gonadotropin [beta-hCG] test with a minimum
             sensitivity of 25 IU/L or equivalent units of beta-hCG). A separate baseline
             assessment is required if a negative screening pregnancy test was obtained more than
             72 hours before the first dose of study drug. All females will be considered to be of
             childbearing potential unless they are postmenopausal (at least 12 months consecutive
             amenorrheic, in the appropriate age group, and without other known or suspected
             cause) or have been sterilized surgically (i.e., bilateral tubal ligation, total
             hysterectomy, or bilateral oophorectomy, all with surgery at least 1 month before
             dosing). Females of childbearing potential must not have had unprotected sexual
             intercourse within 30 days prior to study entry and must agree to use a highly
             effective method of contraception, from the last menstrual period prior to
             randomization, during Treatment Cycles, and for 30 days after the final dose of study
             treatment, and have a male partner who uses a condom. Highly effective contraception
             includes:

               1. Double barrier methods of contraception such as condom plus diaphragm or
                  cervical/vault cap with spermicide.

               2. Placement of an intrauterine device.

               3. Established hormonal contraceptive methods: oral, injectable, or implant.
                  Females who are using hormonal contraceptives must have been on a stable dose of
                  the same hormonal contraceptive product for at least 4 weeks prior to dosing and
                  must continue to use the same contraceptive during the study and for 30 days
                  after study drug discontinuation.

             Female subjects exempt from this requirement are subjects who practice total
             abstinence or have a male partner who is vasectomized with confirmed azoospermia. If
             currently abstinent, the subject must agree to use a double barrier method as
             described above if they become sexually active during the Treatment Cycles, and for
             30 days after study drug discontinuation (revised per Amendment 01).

         10. Male subjects must have had a successful vasectomy (confirmed azoospermia) or they
             and their female partner must meet the criteria above (i.e., not of childbearing
             potential or practicing highly effective contraception and use a condom throughout
             the study period and for 30 days after study drug discontinuation) (revised per
             Amendment 01).

         11. Voluntary agreement to provide written informed consent and the willingness and
             ability to comply with all aspects of the protocol.

             Phase 1 only:

         12. Histologically and/or cytologically confirmed advanced or metastatic solid tumor or B
             cell lymphomas that has progressed after treatment with approved therapies or for
             which there are no standard therapies available.

             Phase 2 (EZH2-mutation positive) B cell lymphomas only:

         13. Subjects must satisfy all of the following criteria:

               1. Have histologically confirmed DLBCL or Grade 3 follicular lymphomas with
                  relapsed or refractory disease following: 1) HDT and ASCT or 2) at least one
                  combination chemotherapy containing rituximab and an anthracycline (unless
                  anthracycline-based therapy contraindicated), and are ineligible or unwilling to
                  undergo HDT and ASCT

               2. Must harbor a Y641 mutation in EZH2. (At the time of protocol amendment, before
                  initiation of Phase 2, the specific methodology for detection of EZH2 mutation
                  will be included in the amended protocol)

               3. Have measurable disease as defined by International Working Group-Non-Hodgkin's
                  Lymphoma (IWG-NHL [Cheson, 2007])
