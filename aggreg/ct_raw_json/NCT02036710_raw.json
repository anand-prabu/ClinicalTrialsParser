Integral to proffered hypotheses are the actions of\n      the hormones glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1), peptide YY (PYY), and leptin.\n\n      Study objective: To obtain blood levels of GLP-1, PYY, and leptin after stimulation of the\n      terminal ileum and cecum by a static infusion of a food hydrolysate in morbidly obese\n      patients undergoing a duodenal switch procedure.\n\n      Methods: Plasma levels of GLP-1, PYY, and leptin were obtained at 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120\n      minutes after instillation of 240 ml of a food hydrolysate into the ileum or cecum."
