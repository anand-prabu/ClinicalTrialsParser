  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite a benign public perception, marijuana use disorders represent a significant public
      health problem. The development of safe and effective pharmacotherapies for marijuana
      dependence is an important unmet public health need. Quetiapine, an effective atypical
      antipsychotic that acts by blocking serotonin type 2A, dopamine type 2, histamine type 1,
      and adrenergic receptors, is a promising treatment for substance use disorders. In animal
      models, quetiapine blocks the enhancement of reward by cocaine, which is likely due to its
      actions on both dopamine and non-dopamine neurotransmission. Clinical studies of quetiapine
      have shown benefit for the treatment of alcohol and cocaine use disorders.

      Conceptually, the clinically prominent effects of quetiapine, namely sedation, anxiolysis,
      mood stabilization and appetite stimulation, are a good match for the symptoms of marijuana
      withdrawal. Most importantly, an open-label dose-finding study of quetiapine for the
      treatment of marijuana dependence conducted by our research group determined that quetiapine
      was well-tolerated and associated with reductions in marijuana use indicating that it is a
      promising agent deserving of further study in marijuana-dependent outpatients.

      The proposed research project is a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial
      to evaluate the efficacy of quetiapine for the treatment of marijuana dependence over a
      12-week period. All participants will receive Medical Management, a medication adherence
      focused psychosocial intervention that facilitates compliance with study medication and
      other study procedures, promotes abstinence from marijuana and other substances, and
      encourages mutual-support group attendance. All participants will receive voucher incentives
      for compliance with study visit attendance, returning study medication bottles, and
      completing other study procedures, with the objective of achieving a highly compliant
      sample. The goal of this phase II clinical trial is to build on our promising open-label
      pilot study results and examine the efficacy of quetiapine on participants' marijuana
      consumption under placebo-controlled double-blind conditions using an abstinence-initiation
      model, where participants will be using marijuana regularly at study entry, reduce their
      use, and then achieve abstinence. The specific aims of the projects are to determine whether
      quetiapine is superior to placebo in 1) reducing marijuana use and 2) achieving abstinence.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a 12-week randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial, we will evaluate the
      efficacy of quetiapine for the treatment of marijuana dependence in 150 outpatients.
      Participants will be randomly assigned to treatment under double-blind conditions with
      either a fixed dosing schedule of quetiapine or placebo. All participants will receive
      Medical Management, a medication adherence focused psychosocial intervention that
      facilitates compliance with study medication and other study procedures, and promotes
      abstinence from marijuana and other substances. All participants will receive progressive
      voucher incentives for compliance with study visit attendance and completing other study
      procedures, with the objective of achieving a highly compliant sample.

      The results of a dose-finding pilot study of quetiapine for the treatment of marijuana
      dependence (see Preliminary Studies) suggests that the ideal dosing for the proposed project
      is a single 300 mg dose every evening, achieved after a gradual three-week titration.
      Clinical experience with this medication for treatment of marijuana dependence indicates
      that a gradual upward titration of dose is advisable to maximize tolerability and that
      morning dosing was poorly tolerated. Quetiapine (immediate release formulation) will be
      administered in 25 and 100 mg capsules; placebo capsules will appear identical to the
      quetiapine capsules. Participants in both treatment arms will take the same number of pills
      on the same schedule. Study medication will be dispensed on a weekly basis starting with the
      baseline visit. Quetiapine will be titrated over a three-week period to the target dose of
      300 mg or the maximum tolerated dose. The research psychiatrist will make dose reductions
      for tolerability if necessary.
