This project will be undertaken in\n      coordination with Special Olympics entities from Texas and around the nation to determine\n      how involvement in Special Olympics improves the strengths and limitations of their\n      athletes. The Short Child Occupational Profile (SCOPE) will be used to gather this\n      information from the parents and coaches. The SCOPE measures the impact that personal and\n      environmental factors have on a child or youth's occupational participation."

Parents\n      and coaches will be the only individuals who have contact with the athletes. Participants\n      will be assured that their participation is completely voluntary. If they agree to\n      participate in the research an informed assest form will be explained by a parent, guardian,\n      or coach and they will be asked to sign it. Parents will be asked to sign a consent form for\n      their child's participation in the study. Coaches will administer the SCOPE as a\n      pre/post-test outcome measure. Parents will submit the Parent form of the SCOPE and the\n      coaches will submit the SCOPE Clinical Data Summary Form. All data will be de-identified and\n      sent in form the coaches. The TWU special olympics research team will compile de-identified\n      data from a pre-test and post-test utilizing the SCOPE. A codebook that links the ID number\n      with the participants will be kept by the coaches. The research team may be able to trace\n      assented data collected through the TWU data collection protocol back to the coaches.\n      Participating athletes will not be contacted by the PI and no contact information will be\n      collected. In the case of an unexpected or adverse event, or if the participants request to\n      be contacted, attempts may be made to find the subjects contact information through the\n      coaches. De-identified data collected by the TWU Special Olympic research team or other Key\n      Research personnel will be stored on a password protected computer or in a locked file\n      cabinet in a locked office in the department of occupational therapy at Texas Woman's\n      University in Houston. The raw data collected will not be made available to anyone other\n      than the PI and immediate study research personnel. Data is entered into the database using\n      the ID number, and the computer database is password protected. The raw data is not going to\n      be shared. The data will be kept in a locked file cabinet within the research office of the\n      databases destroyed 4 years after the end of the study. The results of the analysis, which\n      may include information from the data, will be kept on a password secure computer\n      indefinitely. The data collected from pre-tests and post-tests will then be compiled and\n      analyzed."
