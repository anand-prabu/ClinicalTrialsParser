      The primary objectives are as follows:

      Phase 1b:

        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of oprozomib given orally, once daily, on
           2 different schedules.

        -  To evaluate safety and tolerability

      Phase 2:

        -  To estimate the overall response rate (ORR).

        -  To evaluate safety and tolerability
