            "textblock": "Background:\n\n      - Some types of inflammation may increase the risk of cancers in the intestinal track.\n      Because of this possibility, anti-inflammatory drugs may be able to prevent tumor growth and\n      spread. One such drug, sulindac, may be helpful to study. Researchers want to see if people\n      who are having surgery to remove intestinal tumors from advanced colorectal cancer will\n      benefit from sulindac. It will be tested against a placebo.\n\n      Objectives:\n\n      - To see if sulindac can improve treatment outcomes in people who are having surgery for\n      advanced colorectal cancer.\n\n      Eligibility:\n\n      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who are having surgery for advanced colorectal\n      cancer.\n\n      Design:\n\n        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood samples\n           will be collected. Imaging studies and heart and lung function tests may also be given.\n\n        -  Participants will be separated into two groups. One group will take sulindac. The other\n           will take a placebo.\n\n        -  Participants will take sulindac or placebo twice daily from about 2 to 3 weeks before\n           the scheduled surgery. Seven days before the surgery, they will stop taking the pills.\n\n        -  Participants will have surgery to remove their tumors. The surgery will also remove\n           affected organ tissue.\n\n        -  Participants will start to take the pills again once they have recovered from surgery.\n           They will continue taking the sulindac or placebo twice a day for 3 years, or for as\n           long as the tumors do not return."

            "textblock": "-  Despite strong evidence for a causative role of inflammatory mediators in intestinal\n           cancer, the underlying mechanisms remain obscure. Established evidence indicates\n           activation of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway is an early step in the malignant\n           transformation of colorectal adenomas with persistent activation in 90% of colorectal\n           cancers. Activation of this pathway ultimately effects transcription of the S100A4\n           gene.\n\n        -  S100A4 transcript serum levels have been shown to correlate with risk of recurrence in\n           colorectal cancer and patients with systemic metastases are found to have increased\n           S100A4 transcript expression.\n\n        -  S100A4 may be a novel prognostic biomarker in colorectal cancer.\n\n        -  Cyclooxygenase-2 is a key enzyme involved in the inflammatory response and is a key\n           target of molecular chemoprevention in colorectal adenoma prevention trials.\n\n        -  Recent studies demonstrate mitigation of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling by COX-2 inhibition\n           via administration of the NSAID sulindac using in vitro and in vivo animal models.\n\n        -  We hypothesize that sulindac administration will abrogate Wnt/beta-catenin mediated\n           signaling and thus decrease S100A4 activity in patients with colorectal metastases.\n\n        -  We propose to define the benefit of sulindac administration to patients with colorectal\n           metastases following resection and validate the use of circulating S100A4 transcripts\n           as a novel biomarker for disease recurrence."
