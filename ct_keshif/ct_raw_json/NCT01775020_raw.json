Prolonged intravenous supplementation of L-arginine proved effective\n      in pigs for increasing NO production, restoring gut function, and inhibiting an increase in\n      pulmonary arterial pressure, without any deleterious systemic side effects. Prolonged\n      intravenous L-arginine supplementation could therefore be useful in septic ICU patients."
