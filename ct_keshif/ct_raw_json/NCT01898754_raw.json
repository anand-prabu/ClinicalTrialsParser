            "textblock": "Durable suppression of HIV replication is critical to (1) improving the health of infected\n      individuals, (2) to reducing HIV transmission to sexual partners and from mothers to their\n      infants, and (3) to maintaining the effectiveness of the current 1st-line non-nucleoside\n      reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI)- based ART. Across multiple trials, individuals\n      with NNRTI-resistance, even at low-concentrations, have substantially greater virologic\n      failure when treated with NVP- vs PI-ART. A cost-effective strategy is needed to detect and\n      manage ARV-resistant HIV infections. A simple low-cost innovative assay the investigators\n      developed and successfully transferred to Asian and African countries (oligonucleotide\n      ligation assay (OLA)) can detect NNRTI+lamivudine (3TC) resistant HIV using reagents that\n      costs <$7.00/person. Furthermore, detection of NNRTI-resistance by OLA is highly (P<0.001)\n      associated with virologic failure of nevirapine (NVP)-ART in two retrospective studies; one\n      of Thai women who had been previously randomized to single-dose NVP and the second of\n      ARV-na\u00efve Kenyan adults.\n\n      The investigators hypothesize that implementation of OLA into routine care will allow Kenyan\n      clinicians to appropriately target protease inhibitor (PI)-based ART and improve rates of\n      durable suppression of viral replication, and thus improve CD4 cell gains and individuals'\n      health, reduce the transmission of ARV-resistant HIV within the community, and maintain the\n      utility of NNRTI-ART. In addition, the investigators hypothesize that programmatically\n      OLA-guided ART will be more cost-efficient compared to the current strategy of empiric use\n      of NNRTI-ART as initial treatment."
