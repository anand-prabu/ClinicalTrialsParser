            "textblock": "Chronic Ankle Instability (CAI) is a health condition that results in repeated ankle sprains\n      and other residual impairments.  CAI has been linked to many different causative factors\n      including sensory and motor deficits that affect the global function of the sensorimotor\n      system as well as the patient.  Over the past 20 years, strong evidence has been generated\n      to support balance training as an effective intervention strategy in the CAI population.\n      Unfortunately, most investigations have focused solely on maximizing motor output through\n      balance training, while ignoring the full spectrum of sensorimotor dysfunction associated\n      with CAI.  There may be advantageous sensory-targeted interventions that augment the effects\n      of balance training and lead to greater enhancements of functional outcomes for CAI.\n      However, this possibility has not been systematically explored.  Sensory-targeted ankle\n      rehabilitation strategies (STARS), such as joint mobilization and plantar massage have\n      resulted in improved sensorimotor function in those with CAI.  However, only a single STARS\n      (i.e. stochastic resonance) has been investigated in combination with balance training.\n      While the combined effects were greater than those of balance training alone, stochastic\n      resonance requires relatively expensive equipment that is not commercially available.  Thus,\n      the purpose of this investigation is to test the hypothesis that combining low cost STARS\n      (e.g. plantar massage and joint mobilizations) with balance training will result in greater\n      sensorimotor and functional improvements in those with CAI than balance training alone."
