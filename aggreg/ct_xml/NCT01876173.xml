  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sudden cardiac death (SCD) due to a ventricular arrhythmia is a serious cause of
      cardiovascular death in Canada. The implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) offers
      high-risk patients a treatment option to reduce the incidence of SCD by delivering an
      internal shock to restore a normal rhythm, if needed. Definitive evidence has established
      the effectiveness of the ICD for reducing mortality when used as prophylaxis for SCD (a
      primary prevention indication). Approximately 3,700 new candidates accrue annually. Practice
      guidelines define the criteria to determine patient ICD candidacy for primary prevention.
      However, in addition to SCD risk, ICD candidates may have chronic diseases such as diabetes,
      renal insufficiency, hypertension, and atrial fibrillation. Thus, balancing the benefits and
      risks of an ICD can become complex, particularly when competing mortality risks are present.
      Research has recognized human costs associated with device complications and shocks
      affecting psychological, health related quality of life (HRQL), and morbidity outcomes. The
      complexities surrounding the long-term benefits/risks, complications, replacements, and
      shocks, warrant decision support to prepare patients to make decisions. In Canada, there is
      no clear framework to support patients' decision-making in the context of ICD treatment
      options. Decision support, using a decision aid, could moderate treatment related
      uncertainty and prepare patients to make active, informed, quality decisions.

      Objectives: 1) develop a decision aid for ICD candidates to support quality decision-making
      (informed, deliberate, values-based choices), 2) to evaluate the decision aid, and 3) to
      determine the feasibility of conducting a trial.

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Development of the decision aid will be guided by the Ottawa Decision Support Framework (ODSF). Evaluation will include the Decision Aid Acceptability questionnaire comprised of 10 items including comprehensibility, balance of presentation of information, and overall suitability.</description>

    <time_frame>Pre-Post consultation - participants will be followed until consultation is completed and at 3 months post consultation (average of 16 weeks)</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>In this feasibility RCT, the feasibility regarding processes (referral and recruitment rates, consent), key to the success of a larger study will be assessed. This includes successful delivery of the decision aid in an efficient manner, the monitoring of resources (budget), and study management (trial coordination, human resources). We will assess the proportion of patients who complete the decision aid, quality questionnaires, and missing data.</description>

    <time_frame>Pre and post consultation- (intervention and usual care group, baseline visit + 1 week post consult)</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The Decisional Conflict Scale measures a person's perception of the difficulty in making a decision, the extent to which they feel uncertain about treatment options, are knowledgeable about the risks and benefits of options, clear about personal values, and supported in decision making. The scale has good test-retest reliability (Cronbach's alpha coefficients &gt; 0.78) and predictive validity.</description>

    <description>The Sure Test is a 4 item decisional conflict screening tool designed for use in clinical practice. The Sure Test is embedded in the decision aid (intervention group).</description>

    <description>The CES-D has 20 items that measure depressive symptoms. The CES-D has good reliability and validity across community and clinical settings. Associations between depressive symptoms and decision choice will be assessed.</description>
