They want to know more\n      about the effects of alcohol use disorders on a person   s behavior. They want to develop\n      tasks that can be done inside a scanner that can help them better understand these effects\n      in later studies.\n\n      Objective:\n\n      - To develop tasks that investigate a person   s behavior that can be used in later studies.\n\n      Eligibility:\n\n        -  Inpatient participants of another study. They must be physically healthy right-handed\n           adults 18   60 years old.\n\n        -  Healthy right-handed volunteers 18   60 years old.\n\n      Design:\n\n        -  Participants will be screened with medical history and physical exam. They will have an\n           EKG to record heart activity. They will give blood and urine samples and have a\n           psychiatric interview.\n\n        -  Participants will have between one and three visits.\n\n        -  Participants will be asked about their alcohol drinking to see if they have an alcohol\n           use disorder.\n\n        -  Participants will complete one of three simple computerized tasks either inside the\n           magnetic resonance imagining (MRI) scanner or outside of it.\n\n        -  The MRI scanner takes pictures of the brain. The scanner is a metal cylinder.\n           Participants lie on a table that can slide in and out of the cylinder. They will be in\n           the scanner for about 60 minutes. They may have to lie still for up to 20 minutes. The\n           scanner makes loud knocking noises, but they will get earplugs."

We will study up to 100 male and 100 female individuals who have never met criteria\n             for an alcohol use disorder and are between the age of 18 and 60 years and will be\n             recruited from the NIAAA protocol 98-AA-0009, Screening Evaluation for NIAAA\n             Protocols.\n\n          2.
