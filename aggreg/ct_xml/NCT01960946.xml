      This study will investigate if Modified Citrus Pectin (MCP) can help people with high blood
      pressure.  MCP is a dietary supplement that is derived from plants, and therefore is not
      subject to approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  However, MCP has been
      deemed as 'generally regarded as safe' by the FDA.

      This study will examine whether Modified Citrus Pectin (MCP) can help people with high blood
      pressure.  The study will help understand how MCP may affect the risk for heart disease in
      patients with high blood pressure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gal-3 appears to be a potential mediator of cardiac fibrosis, preceding the development of
      clinical heart failure.  In this study, we seek to identify individuals at risk for the
      development of HF based on clinical hypertension and elevated Gal-3 concentrations.
      Participants will be randomized to receive a Gal-3 inhibitor (MCP) or placebo.  The primary
      outcome will be the effect on collagen metabolism, and secondary outcomes include
      echocardiographic measures of cardiac structure and function, and non-invasive measures of
      vascular function.
