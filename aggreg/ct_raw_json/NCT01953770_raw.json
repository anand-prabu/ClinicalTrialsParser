Whether the early PEG-asparaginase in induction will lead to the earlier achievement of\n           remission, improvement of days 8 and 15 responses leading to an earlier reconstitution\n           of bone marrow and immunocompetence, decrease of severe infections and early mortality\n           rate?\n\n        2. Whether the use of PEG-asparaginase in induction will allow to avoid the anthracyclines\n           in standard risk group patients and to reduce treatment myelotoxicity?\n\n        3. Whether the administration of 9 doses of PEG-asparaginase 1,000 U/m2 instead of 18\n           doses of E.coli L-asparaginase 5,000 U/m2 in standard risk patients will improve\n           treatment outcome?\n\n        4. Whether the administrations of high dose methotrexate (2 g/m2 in 24 hours) during 1-st\n           consolidation in intermediate risk patients will result in decrease of central nervous\n           system relapse incidence and improvement of event-free and overall survival? Whether\n           the increase of 6-mercaptopurine starting dose up to 50 mg/m2 in 1-st consolidation\n           phase (instead of 25 mg/m2) will decrease in relapse risk, but would not be accompanied\n           with enhanced toxicity?\n\n        5. Is it possible to completely avoid the cranial irradiation in intermediate risk\n           patients? In some subgroup of intermediate risk patients? Is it enough to control\n           neuroleukemia in these patients to introduce additional TIT in the consolidation phase\n           of treatment? How will change the possible late effects in these patients according to\n           the third arm of randomization?\n\n        6. Will the new risk group stratification to improve overall and event-free survival?"

There is severe concomitant disease, which significantly impedes chemotherapy\n             protocol (such as multiple malformations, heart diseases, metabolic disorders, etc.);\n\n          4. There is a lack of important basic data needed for the exact adherence to the\n             cytostatic therapy according to a specific protocol of chemotherapy (differential\n             diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic/myeloid leukemia is not possible, stratification\n             according to risk group is not possible);\n\n          5.
