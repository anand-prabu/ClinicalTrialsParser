            "textblock": "Iatrogenic hypoglycemia is the most frequent acute complication of insulin therapy in people\n      with type 1 diabetes (T1DM). Recurrent hypoglycemic events initiate a process of\n      habituation, characterized by suppression of hypoglycemic symptoms and lead to hypoglycemia\n      unawareness, which in itself defines a particularly high risk of severe hypoglycemia. Recent\n      evidence suggest a pivotal role for increased brain lactate transport capacity in the\n      pathogenesis of hypoglycemia unawareness. However, there is uncertainty about the magnitude\n      of this effect and whether such excess brain lactate is oxidizes as a glucose-sparing\n      alternative energy source or acts as a metabolic regulator controlling brain glucose\n      metabolism, oxygen consumption and cerebral blood flow.\n\n      Objective: The primary objective of this study is to investigate the effect of hypoglycemia\n      on brain lactate accumulation and regional cerebral blood perfusion in humans. The secondary\n      objective is to assess whether this effect is a related to hypoglycemia unawareness or a\n      consequence of T1DM per se.\n\n      Hypothesis: The investigators hypothesize that hypoglycemia stimulates lactate transport\n      over the blood-brain barrier leading to cerebral lactate accumulation and that this lactate\n      accumulation is a function of prior hypoglycemic exposure frequency contributing to clinical\n      hypoglycemia unawareness. Furthermore, the investigators expect that this effect of\n      hypoglycemia on brain lactate accumulation is related to changes in cerebral blood flow\n      (CBF)."
