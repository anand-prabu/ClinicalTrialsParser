  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Problematic and state of the art Obesity and its associated non communicable diseases (NCDs)
      are rising rapidly in middle income countries, such as those in the Maghreb (North Africa).
      This progression is related to the context of a nutrition transition (changing food and
      physical activity environment) and profound changes in technological advances and in
      society. These societies and their health systems are insufficiently prepared for this
      evolution, which has enormous health and socioeconomic consequences. In the context of
      limited resources, the priority has been given on an international level to prevention. But
      several problems arise: - these countries are still confronted by undernutrition in terms of
      micronutrient deficiencies, which coexist with obesity and NCDs, including at a family level
      and also individual level. Known as the 'double burden', this coexistence is relatively new
      and has been rarely documented until recently.  Educational measures could be ineffective in
      a society where cultural norms do not recognise obesity and where changes in lifestyle are
      possibly not seen as acceptable. As well as information about citizen's knowledge of risk
      factors, data on their perceptions and attitudes are indispensable. Policies that involve
      changing the 'obesogenic' environment that individuals occupy is a priority.

      Objectives of the project Overall aim: to contribute to the development of preventive
      strategies for obesity and chronic NCDs in the context of a nutrition transition.

      Specific objectives: characterise the nature and size of the double burden
      (obesity/undernutrition) in regions, families and individuals; estimate the prevalence of
      biological and behavioural risk factors; characterise the psycho-sociocultural determinants
      of behaviour.
