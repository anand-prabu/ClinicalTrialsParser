Patients taking daily temozolomide 50 mg/m2/day will undergo a PET scan using radiolabeled temozolomide (TMZ-PET) at 2 time points: 7-13 days after initiation of temozolomide but before beginning bevacizumab (\"baseline\"- temozolomide steady-state scan) and 1 day after initiation of bevacizumab (day 15). Arterialized venous blood samples will be collected during the imaging in order to measure radioactivity, blood metabolites, and the relationship between radiotracer uptake and tumor features such as blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown and tumor blood flow.\nIn addition, we will explore the link between flow, permeability, and tumor temozolomide retention. These studies will be performed using our human simultaneous MRI-PET imaging camera."

            "textblock": "This research study is exploring how the blood vessels in the participant's tumor change\n      from treatment with bevacizumab, and how these changes affect the way their tumor absorbs\n      temozolomide (TMZ).\n\n      The pilot part of this study is to evaluate the use of [11C] temozolomide PET (TMZ-PET)\n      scans and MRI scans to tell investigators more about how standard treatment with bevacizumab\n      affects the blood vessels in the participant's tumor, and how these changes affect the way\n      the participant's tumor absorbs temozolomide. \"Investigational\" means that the role of\n      TMZ-PET scans is still being studied and that research doctors are trying to find out more\n      about it.\n\n      Bevacizumab is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use in people with the\n      participant's type of cancer. It works by blocking signals on a specific protein called\n      vascular endothelial growth hormone (VEGF), which plays a role in promoting the growth of\n      spread of tumor blood vessels. Bevacizumab is an \"anti-VEGF' agent because it is designed to\n      slow the growth of the participant's cancer.\n\n      Since anti-VEGF agents also affect normal blood vessels in the brain, they can inhibit the\n      way other drugs used in combination with bevacizumab are delivered to the tumor. Researchers\n      are looking for how bevacizumab affects delivery of chemotherapy, in this case temozolomide.\n\n      In PET scans, a radioactive substance is injected into the body. The scanning machine finds\n      the radioactive substance, which tends to go to cancer cells.\n\n      For the PET scans in this research study, the investigators are using a radioactive\n      substance called [11C] temozolomide, which is chemically identical to the prescription drug\n      TMZ. TMZ is FDA approved as a chemotherapeutic agent in cancer but [11C] temozolomide is an\n      investigational agent.\n\n      In this research study, participants will receive standard treatment with bevacizumab and\n      oral temozolomide as well as standard MRI scans. In addition, participants will undergo\n      TMZ-PET scans before and after treatment with bevacizumab. The first TMZ-PET scan will occur\n      7-13 days after starting treatment with oral temozolomide but before beginning treatment\n      with bevacizumab, and day 1 after starting treatment with bevacizumab. TMZ-PET scans will be\n      given at the same time as a vascular MRI, which will evaluate the changes in tumor blood\n      flow, blood volume, and how receptive blood vessels are while also measuring how much TMZ is\n      in the brain."

Blood samples will be drawn 2.5, 5, 10, 20, 40, 60, 75, and 90 minutes after\n      the [11C] temozolomide injection.\n\n      The participant will be assessed for side effects via clinic visit or phone call about 24\n      hours after each of the visits above.\n\n      - Planned Follow-up:  The investigators would like to call the participant every 3 months\n      for three years after their second MR-PET scan to see how they are doing and if the\n      participant is experiencing any side effects. If the participant was removed from the study\n      due to an unacceptable side effect, the participant will be followed until it has been\n      resolved."
