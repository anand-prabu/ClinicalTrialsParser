In Phase II, up to six sites will implement their work plans to test changes to\n      existing procedures, practices, and structures related to domestic violence homicide\n      prevention.  This evaluation will assess the processes and outcomes within and across sites.\n\n      Subjects:\n\n      As this is an evaluation of models carried out by Phase II sites, the \"subjects\" are the six\n      funded sites. Research Design and Methods:  The national evaluation will be a\n      utilization-focused developmental evaluation-\"utilization-focused\" in that the project will\n      be done for and with primary intended users of the evaluation findings; \"developmental\" in\n      that the intended use is development of domestic violence homicide prevention models.\n      Process evaluation will focus on the internal dynamics and actual operations of domestic\n      violence homicide prevention programs at Phase II sites.  This will be achieved primarily\n      through the use of system dynamics modeling, which uses computer simulation to understand\n      the behavior of complex systems over time.  Outcome evaluation will examine the intended and\n      unintended consequences of the prevention programs.  This will be carried out largely\n      through the use of multilevel modeling, which takes into account multiple sources of\n      variation when estimating differences in outcomes between sites.\n\n      Analysis:\n\n      System dynamics modeling within and across sites will progress through a series of iterative\n      steps involving problem articulation, formulation of a dynamic hypothesis, development of a\n      computer simulation model, validation and model testing, and policy design and\n      recommendations.  Multilevel modeling will take into account individual- (victims and\n      perpetrators), intimate partner relationship-, and site-level variables in estimation of\n      between site variation in outcomes.  Cost-effectiveness analyses will include an assessment\n      of the cost-effectiveness of the overall initiative, as well as sub-analyses comparing\n      cost-effectiveness of individual sites whose prevention programs proved effective.\n\n      Products, Reports, and Data Archiving:\n\n      The investigators will produce a final report providing a comprehensive overview of the\n      national evaluation and its findings.  The investigators will also provide quarterly\n      financial reports as well as semi-annual progress reports. The final project submission will\n      also include data files with original and transformed data variables; statistical analysis\n      software syntax that documents the analysis process; files that document the system dynamics\n      models; and a data and research guidebook as specified in the archiving plan."
