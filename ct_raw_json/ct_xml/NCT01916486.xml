  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct a proof-of-concept randomized controlled trial study to
      provide preliminary evidence of efficacy of exercise training or a complex mental and social
      activities program for improving cognitive function in older adults with chronic stroke,
      compared with a stretch and relaxation program.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 119 adults diagnosed with chronic stroke will be randomized to either a 6-month
      twice-weekly exercise program, complex mental and social activities program, or stretch and
      relaxation program. After 6 months of intervention, they will be followed for an additional
      6 months. There will be three measurement sessions: baseline, 6 months (end of intervention
      period); and 12 months.

      <textblock>
        The study will specifically recruit individuals who had an ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke
        and have probable mild cognitive impairment.

        In addition, individuals must meet the following inclusion criteria:

          1. Aged 55 years or over;

          2. Have a history of a single stroke of at least one year prior to study enrolment;

          3. Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) (5) score of â‰¥ 20 at screening, including a
             perfect score on the 3-step command to ensure intact comprehension and ability to
             follow instructions;

          4. Have subjective cognitive complaints;

          5. Community-dwelling;

          6. Lives in Metro Vancouver;

          7. Able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plan, and other trial procedures;

          8. Must be able to read, write, and speak English in which psychometric tests are
             provided with acceptable visual and auditory acuity;

          9. Stable on a fixed dose of cognitive medications (e.g., donepezil, galantamine,
             rivastigmine, memantine, etc.) that is not expected to change during the 12-month
             study period, or, if they are not on any of these medications, they are not expected
             to start them during the 12-month study period;

         10. Able to walk for a minimum of six metres with rest intervals with or without
             assistive devices;

         11. Have an activity tolerance of 60 minutes with rest intervals;

         12. Not currently participating in any regular therapy or progressive exercise; and

         13. Provide a personally signed and dated informed consent document indicating that the
             individual (or a legally acceptable representative) has been informed of all
             pertinent aspects of the trial. In addition, an assent form will be provided at
             baseline and again at regular intervals.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Diagnosed with dementia of any type;

          2. Diagnosed with another type of neurodegenerative or neurological condition (ie.
             Parkinson's disease) that affects cognitive function and mobility;

          3. At high risk for cardiac complications during exercise and/or unable to self-regulate
             activity or to understand recommended activity level (i.e., Class C of the American
             Heart Risk Stratification Criteria);

          4. Have clinically significant peripheral neuropathy or severe musculoskeletal or joint
             disease that impairs mobility, as determined by his/her family physician;

          5. Taking medications that may negatively affect cognitive function, such as
             anticholinergics, including agents with pronounced anticholinergic properties (e.g.,
             amitriptyline), major tranquilizers (typical and atypical antipsychotics), and
             anticonvulsants (e.g., gabapentin, valproic acid, etc.); or

          6. Have aphasia as judged by an inability to communicate by phone.
