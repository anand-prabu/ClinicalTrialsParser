  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, 3-way cross over design
      in allergic rhinitis subjects.  Subjects will receive repeat doses of intra-nasal
      levocabastine for 7 days in each period and the duration of the study will be about 13
      weeks. An Environmental Exposure Chamber (EEC) will be used in this study. The primary
      objective of the study is to investigate the non-inferiority effect of 7 days treatment with
      levocabastine on nasal symptoms elicited by an EEC when administered once daily (QD)
      compared with twice daily (BID). Also study will be conducted to investigate the superiority
      of effect of 7 days treatment with levocabastine (QD and BID) on nasal symptoms elicited by
      an EEC in subjects compared to placebo.

             one of the contraception methods for an appropriate period of time (as determined by
             the product label or investigator) prior to the start of dosing to sufficiently

             dose of study medication, unless in the opinion of the Investigator and GSK Medical
             Monitor the medication will not interfere with the study procedures or compromise
             subject safety.

        Subjects who are using some of the medications below on an as needed basis, may
        participate in the study if they remain free of medication for the following periods of

        decongestants: 24 hours, Oral decongestants: 24 hours, Nasal glucocorticosteroids: 7 days,
        Inhaled glucocorticoids: 1 week, Oral glucocorticosteroids: 12 weeks, Oral leukotriene
        receptor antagonists: 7 days, Oral 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors: 7 days, Oral
