The\n      purpose of this research study is to determine what type of skin closure after cesarean\n      section helps decrease pain level the most and improves the appearance of the incision site.\n\n      The study hypothesis is to determine if skin closure with absorbable subcuticular staples\n      leads to improved cosmesis and/or decreased post-operative pain.\n\n      Participants in the study will already be scheduled for a cesarean section for delivery of\n      their baby.  They will be randomized into one of three groups, 1) Insorb (absorbable\n      subcuticular stapes), 2) Vicryl suture or 3) Monocryl suture for the skin closure of their\n      cesarean section.  Information that will be recorded includes amount of pain medication\n      usage while in the hospital after cesarean section, daily patient rated pain score until\n      discharge from hospital, pain score 6 weeks after surgery and cesarean section cosmetic scar\n      6 weeks after surgery."

            "textblock": "Cesarean delivery is the most common surgical procedure performed in the United States, with\n      over 1 million procedures performed per year.  Based on recent Centers for Disease Control\n      National Vital Statistics Report  32.3% of all births in the United States were via cesarean\n      delivery, marking the twelfth consecutive annual increase in the cesarean delivery rate.\n      Given the high numbers of cesarean deliveries being performed today, there has been interest\n      in optimizing surgical techniques.  Several recent reviews have summarized the evidence for\n      various steps of cesarean delivery, but surprisingly in many cases there is little\n      scientific evidence on which to base the choice of surgical technique.\n\n      The topic of skin closure after cesarean delivery is an area that has been the focus of\n      several randomized control trials.  The trials compared surgical steel staples to\n      subcuticular suture of various materials focusing on differences in post-operative pain,\n      infection rates, and scar cosmesis.  Cosmesis has been investigated in all three Randomized\n      Clinical Trials and none have found differences between surgical steel staples and\n      subcuticular suture.  Infection rate has been studied in a single observational study which\n      found a higher infection rate in those patients whose skin was closed with surgical steel\n      staples compared to suture.  Studies of post-operative pain and skin closure technique have\n      been contradictory.  The earliest Randomized clinical trial to investigate skin closure and\n      post-operative pain was done by Frishman et al (5) and found that subjective self-assessment\n      of pain was better at hospital discharge and 6 weeks post-operatively in patients when\n      subcuticular suture rather than surgical steel staples were used.   A subsequent Randomized\n      clinical trial reported the opposite result with less pain 6 weeks post-operatively when\n      surgical steel staples were used.  This discrepancy may, in part, be due to the different\n      suture material used in the two trials.  The study by Frishman et al  which showed a benefit\n      of subcuticular suture utilized used polyglycolic acid (Vicryl suture or Insorb staples);\n      whereas, the study by Rousseau et al used polyglecaprone (Monocryl suture).  To date direct\n      comparison of skin closure at the time of cesarean with these two suture materials has not\n      been performed.\n\n      Recently, a new technology for skin closure has been introduced that employs absorbable\n      material, polylactic and polyglycolic acid, in subcuticular staples.  In animal models this\n      method of skin closure has shown less histological inflammation and fewer wound infections\n      than either surgical steel staples or subcuticular suture.  Unfortunately, little is known\n      about how this skin closure technique compares to the other more established techniques\n      after cesarean delivery in humans.  However, a retrospective analysis comparing subcuticular\n      absorbable staples with surgical steel staples revealed an association between subcuticular\n      absorbable staples and decreased in-hospital analgesic use.  The current study is a\n      prospective randomized trial that investigates four cesarean skin closure\n      techniques\u2014surgical steel staples, subcuticular polyglycolic acid suture (Vicryl),\n      subcuticular, polyglecaprone suture (Monocryl), and absorbable subcuticular polyglycolic\n      acid staples\u2014to determine if one is associated with improved cosmesis or a decrease in\n      post-operative pain."
