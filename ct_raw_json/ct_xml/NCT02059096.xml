    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the effect of repetitive Transcranial Magnetic
      Stimulation (rTMS) in the resolution of chronic pain. Participants will be patients with
      Multiple Sclerosis suffering from chronic pain of neurological origin.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      On the one hand, Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is the most frequent chronic disease generating
      neurological disability in young adults. Among the many types of disabilities associated
      with MS, chronic pain is very frequent, especially neuropathic pain. This type of pain is
      often treatment resistant. Moreover, abnormal intra-cortical excitability has been described
      in MS patients.

      On the other hand, repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) has shown an
      analgesic effect in various chronic pain conditions (fibromyalgia, post-stroke, peripheral
      neuropathic pain). Three groups have shown that analgesia was correlated to defective
      intra-cortical excitability restoration.

      The goal of this study is to compare the analgesic effects of two types of primary Motor
      cortex (M1) rTMS, namely 10Hz and prolonged continuous Theta-Burst Stimulation (pcTBS), with
      sham stimulation.

      Patients will benefit from 1 daily session per day for 5 consecutive days and from a total
      follow up of 4 weeks. Pain will be assessed each day and several other signs and symptoms
      will be repeatedly assessed.
