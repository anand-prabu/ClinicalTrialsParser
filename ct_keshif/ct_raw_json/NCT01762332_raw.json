            "textblock": "Pain is an unpleasant sensation, ranging from slight discomfort to intense suffering. Since\n      pain is a subjective phenomenon, it has frequently defied objective, quantitative\n      measurements. Today, in order to measure pain, subjective uni-dimensional scales are used to\n      quantify pain. One of the most common scale used to rate a patient's pain intensity is the\n      Numeric Pain Scale (NPS), usually scored from 0 to 100. Hitherto, those scales are based on\n      the subjective evaluation of pain by the patient.\n\n      During anesthesia the patient cannot communicate and therefore the verbal or other report is\n      impossible. As a consequence, due to misrepresentation of the existence or extent of pain,\n      care providers may fail to estimate the correct measure of pain and give too much or too\n      little medication, leading to possible complications and adverse reactions. A validated\n      scoring system of subject's pain level, or as in the case of an anaesthetised patient,\n      subject's nociception level, is therefore needed.\n\n      In this study the investigators intend to test and analyze the performances of Medasense\n      pain response index, PRI, by comparing it with other standard pain related indicators (Heart\n      Rate (HR), Heart Rate Variability (HRV), Skin Conductance, etc) before and after painful\n      stimuli at different levels of analgesia. In addition, in order to reduce the variability\n      between stimuli, a standardized stimulus (Tetanic ,30 sec, 100Hz, 60mA) will be given to all\n      patients after sleep induction and before intubation, with and without administration of\n      Fentanyl and the values of the PRI during these stimuli will be investigated."
