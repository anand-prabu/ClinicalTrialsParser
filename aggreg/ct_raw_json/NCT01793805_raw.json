Tissue specimens will be used to\n      profile molecular characteristics, including actionable mutations most commonly identified\n      in colorectal cancer.  Specimens may be further interrogated by other methods to discover\n      additional mechanisms and targetable genetic alterations that may predict sensitivity or\n      resistance to drug therapies.\n\n      The repository will be populated, maintained, and analyzed through continuous patient\n      recruitment.  Patient tumor specimens will be interrogated to characterize an individual's\n      molecular profile.  At a future date for discovery purposes, the normal tissue may be\n      profiled for comparison with the profile of the tumor tissue.  NSABP will hold a database\n      with molecular profiles and relevant patient information.  As agents become available for\n      clinical study, particularly those matching specified profiles, the treating physician will\n      be contacted so that the patient may be offered participation in that trial via a separate\n      consent process.  Each NSABP trial will have a defined molecular profile for entry which\n      will be specific to the agent(s) under study.  The MPR-1 patient registry and tissue\n      repository and all treatment protocols associated with MPR-1 are being developed as part of\n      the NSABP Oncology-Genome Assessment Guided Medicine (N-GAMe) Program.\n\n      This registry and repository platform uses a translational science approach for more\n      personalized therapy for patients with mCRC.  This analysis provides an individual molecular\n      profile in an attempt to direct each patient's treatment based on the pattern of genetic\n      alterations.  These efforts also may aid in the discovery of with or without new gene\n      targets for future drug development.\n\n      Approximately 1000-2000 tumor (with or without) normal tissue specimens from living mCRC\n      patients will be collected, stored, and analyzed as part of this biospecimen repository.  It\n      is anticipated that 200-400 participants will be registered within the first year."
