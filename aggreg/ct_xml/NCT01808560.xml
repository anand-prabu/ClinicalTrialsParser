  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot feasibility study is to assess whether treating meibomian gland
      dysfunction (MGD) prior to cataract surgery helps promote meibomian gland function, visual
      quality and ocular comfort after cataract surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a post-market, prospective, non-significant risk, open-label, randomized
      multi-center clinical trial evaluating treatment with the LipiFlow System in patients with
      meibomian gland dysfunction prior to planned bilateral cataract surgery. All subjects
      undergo examination to determine study eligibility and to capture the Baseline status prior
      to surgery.   Subjects are randomized to receive LipiFlow treatment (Pre-treatment group)
      one month before cataract surgery or no LipiFlow treatment (Untreated Control group).
      Cataract surgery is performed on both eyes of each subject with the second eye surgery
      completed within two months of the first eye.  All subjects are evaluated at one month and
      three months after cataract surgery on the second eye with comparison of the study endpoints
      between the Pre-treatment and Untreated groups.  To facilitate subject recruitment, the
      Untreated Control group receives crossover LipiFlow treatment for MGD (Post-treatment group)
      three months after cataract surgery on the second eye.

    <description>The primary endpoint assesses change in meibomian gland function by scoring the meibomian gland secretion characteristics before and after surgery. The primary endpoint is the mean change in total meibomian gland score in the Pre-treatment group compared to the Untreated group from Baseline after cataract surgery.</description>

    <description>The secondary endpoint assesses the change in visual quality and ocular comfort before and after cataract surgery using the OSDI questionnaire. The secondary endpoint is the mean change in the OSDI questionnaire score in the Pre-treatment group compared to the Untreated group from Baseline after cataract surgery.</description>
