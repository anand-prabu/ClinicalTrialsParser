  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent research studies have suggested that proteins called antibodies that are produced by
      the immune system might be involved in the lung damage of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
      (IPF). Antibodies produced by the immune system normal help to fight infections by attacking
      bacteria and viruses without harming our own tissues.  In patients with IPF, there is
      evidence that certain antibodies (called autoantibodies) attack the lung and contributes to
      the injury and scarring that occurs in IPF.  Our recent studies have found that many IPF
      patients appear to have excessive autoantibody levels in blood and lungs that might make
      their disease worse.

      Rituximab is a medication approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the
      treatment of autoantibody diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis.  Rituximab works by
      destroying B cells, a type of white blood cell, called a B-lymphocyte, which produce
      autoantibodies. In this research study, rituximab will be given into a vein to reduce the
      autoantibody levels that we believe might be contributing to the lung damage in IPF.

      This study is being conducted to determine if rituximab provides beneficial effects for IPF
      patients by decreasing further lung injury.

      This is a double-blinded, Phase II trial in which 58 ambulatory IPF patients at any of four
      medical centers (University of Pittsburgh, University of Chicago, Geisinger Medical Center,
      and Temple University) will be randomized equally to 1. placebo or 2. two doses of rituximab
      1 gm i.v., with a 14 day interval inbetween doses.

      Subjects will be followed for 9 months.
