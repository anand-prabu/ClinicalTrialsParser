  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HE4 is a new marker that could improve the detection of ovarian cancer. The HE4 assay may
      have an advantage over the CA-125 assay in that it is less frequently positive in patients
      with non malignant disease. Since the evaluation of HE4 for detection and diagnosis of
      ovarian cancer is well known, the behaviour of the marker during chemotherapy and follow-up
      period after treatment in metastatic ovarian cancer should be studied. It could be used in
      patient with non CA-125 secretary tumors. Prognosis and predictive value of HE4 should be
      compared with information provided by CA-125. The kinetics of HE4 values after treatment
      should be also analysed to determine the role that HE4 could play in the detection of
      recurrences during the follow-up of metastatic patients.
