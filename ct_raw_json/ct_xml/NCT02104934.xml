  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Total knee arthroplasty or replacement (TKA), a commonly performed surgery for
      osteoarthritis of the knee, is a painful procedure and requires a multimodal analgesic
      approach. A method for analgesia is local infiltration analgesia (LIA), where a mixture of
      drugs is injected around the knee joint.

      Adductor canal block (ACB) is an alternative regional anaesthesia technique which has been
      shown to result in minimal thigh weakness.

      The investigators aim to study if the analgesia provided by ACB is superior to LIA while
      preserving quadriceps strength.
