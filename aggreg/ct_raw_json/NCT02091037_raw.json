            "textblock": "Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease characterized by pruritis and\n      eczematous lesions with a worldwide prevalence of 15-20%. The burden of disease is highest\n      in the most developed nations and predominantly affects children, with 50% of cases arising\n      in the first year of life, and most others arising in the first 5 years. There is a\n      well-known increased susceptibility to skin infection with S. aureus in patients with AD,\n      and such infections are associated with clinical deterioration. While it is routine to\n      evaluate for S. aureus colonization in the anterior nares, there is recent evidence\n      suggesting that rectal colonization may be more significant. The significance of\n      colonization site has not been evaluated in the AD population.\n\n      Additionally, while topical antibiotics are a mainstay of treatment in AD, there is no\n      routine data on the resistance to these agents.\n\n      Our aim is to characterize the S. aureus colonization patterns in children with AD,\n      including site of colonization and antibiotic resistance. We will analyze\n      routinely-collected skin culture specimens from children with AD seen at our center and\n      determine antibiotic susceptibility profiles. The significance of colonization site will be\n      analyzed."
