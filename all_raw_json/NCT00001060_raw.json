Injections are\n      administered on day 0 and at weeks 4, 8, 12, and 24. When patients entered at the lower\n      vaccine dose (Cohort A) reach week 6, the data is reviewed and the higher dose cohort\n      (Cohort B) will begin. When both cohorts reach week 14, data is evaluated and Cohort C\n      begins vaccine administrations at a chosen vaccine dose.  Within each cohort, eight patients\n      receive vaccine plus IFA and two patients receive IFA alone. Patients are followed to week\n      52; 18 clinic visits and four telephone calls are required."
