In this\n      randomized clinical trial, 160 alcohol-dependent outpatients, after 5 days of abstinence,\n      will receive one of the two psychosocial therapies and either naltrexone (Revia) or placebo\n      for a 12-week treatment period.  Abstinence rates, alcohol use, and time to alcohol relapse\n      will be evaluated in all four groups along with measures of alcohol craving, biological\n      measures of alcohol consumption, drinking consequences, changes in self-confidence for\n      avoiding alcohol, and medication compliance.  All study participants will be assessed for\n      measures of outcome variables at 3 and 6 months after completing the treatment protocol."
