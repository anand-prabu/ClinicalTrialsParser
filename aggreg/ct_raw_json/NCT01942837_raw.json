The purpose of this study is to\n      analyze features of tumor specimens sampled prior to therapy and at disease progression to\n      determine why patients respond or stop responding to treatment with Enzalutamide. Prior\n      chemotherapy is not a requirement of this trial. Enzalutamide is a drug designed to block\n      the effects of male hormones in the body that may be helping prostate cancer to grow. It has\n      already been approved by the FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) for patients with\n      castration-resistant prostate cancer who have received prior chemotherapy.\n\n      Additionally, this study will analyze features of tumor specimens sampled prior to therapy\n      and at disease progression to determine why patients respond or stop responding to treatment\n      with enzalutamide."
