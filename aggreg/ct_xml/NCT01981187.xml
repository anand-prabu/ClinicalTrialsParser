      The purpose of this signal seeking study is to determine whether treatment with LGX818
      demonstrates sufficient efficacy in select pathway-activated solid tumors and/or hematologic
      malignancies to warrant further study

        Inclusion Criteria

          -  Patient has a confirmed diagnosis of a select solid tumor (except with a primary
             diagnosis of melanoma and colorectal cancer (CRC)) or hematologic malignancies and is
             in need of treatment because of progression or relapse.

          -  Patient's tumor has been evaluated and pre-identified as having a tumor with a
             BRAFV600 mutation at a CLIA certified laboratory.

          -  Patient must have received at least one prior treatment for recurrent, metastatic and
             /or locally advanced disease and for whom no standard therapy options are anticipated
             to result in a durable remission.

          -  Patient must have progressive and measurable disease per RECIST 1.1. or other
             appropriate hematological response criteria.

          -  Patient has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤ 1

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has received prior treatment with LGX818.

          -  Patients with Central Nerve System (CNS) metastasis or leptomeningeal carcinomatosis.

          -  Patient has received chemotherapy or other anticancer therapy ≤ 4 weeks (6 weeks for
             nitrosourea, antibodies or mitomycin-C) prior to starting study drug.

          -  Patients with acute or chronic pancreatitis.

          -  Patients with impaired cardiac function or clinically significant cardiac diseases.

          -  Patients with another primary malignancy within 3 years prior to starting study
