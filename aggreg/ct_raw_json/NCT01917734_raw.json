            "textblock": "Madhya Pradesh's program for the provision of care to children with severe acute\n      malnutrition (SAM) was initiated in the district of Shivpuri in January 2006. By January 1,\n      2010, Madhya Pradesh National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) had established 199 Nutrition\n      Rehabilitation Centers (NRCs) where children were receiving therapeutic care following\n      protocols based on the guidelines for the management of SAM by the World Health Organization\n      (WHO)and the Indian Academy of Pediatrics.\n\n      The detection of children with SAM was ensured in the communities by frontline workers in\n      the context of monthly growth monitoring and promotion sessions. Once at the NRC the age,\n      weight, height, mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) and presence of bilateral pitting edema\n      were determined for each child. SAM was defined as per WHO recommendations by the presence\n      of bilateral pitting edema or the presence of severe wasting. Severe wasting was defined by\n      a MUAC below 115 mm and/or a weight-for-height z-score (WHZ) < - 3 of the median WHZ in WHO\n      Child Growth Standards. All children 6-59 months with bilateral pitting edema, and/or WHZ <\n      - 3 and/or MUAC < 115 mm were admitted to the NRC.\n\n      Once children were admitted to the NRC, a medical doctor conducted a clinical examination on\n      them to detect the presence of medical complications (lethargy, pneumonia, dehydration,\n      fever, tuberculosis, and/or severe anemia) using the criteria for the Integrated Management\n      of Neonatal and Childhood Illnesses (IMNCI).\n\n      As per protocol, children with edema, and/or medical complications, and/or poor appetite\n      were fed locally-prepared F-75 therapeutic milk every two hours for 48 hours (stabilization\n      phase) while their medical complications were treated. After completion of the initial 48\n      hours, children were fed alternatively F-75 and locally-prepared F-100 therapeutic milk six\n      times a day for about 48 hours (transition phase). After the transition phase, children were\n      fed F-100 and locally-produced lipid-based therapeutic food (TF) with the aims of initiating\n      rapid weight gain (rehabilitation phase). Children with normal appetite and free of medical\n      complications entered the rehabilitation phase from the day of admission. All children\n      received a course of broad spectrum antibiotic.\n\n      Upon the completion of a prescribed 14-day stay in the NRC, children were transitioned to\n      the community phase of the program where they were followed up by community-based frontline\n      workers. Frontline workers were to ensure that the child benefited a Supplementary Nutrition\n      Program (SNP) and returned for a follow up visit at the NRC every 15 days during the 60 days\n      following discharge. At the four follow up visits, children's weight gain was assessed and\n      mothers were counseled on child feeding and care.\n\n      From January 1 to December 31, 2010 a total of 44,017 children 6-59 months old were admitted\n      to the IM-SAM program. This study evaluates the effectiveness of the program by analyzing\n      program outcomes in sample of children (n=2,740) randomly selected among the 44,017 children\n      admitted."
