The drug rIL-2 has been shown\n      to increase CD4 cell counts, which help the body fight off HIV.\n\n      There is strong evidence that rIL-2 increases CD4 cell counts (cells of the immune system\n      that  fight infection).  This study examines the effect of 2 different amounts of rIL-2 on\n      CD4 cell count and the amount of HIV in the blood (viral burden)."

Whether or not rIL-2\n      delays progression to AIDS and extends survival is currently unknown, such clinical benefits\n      of rIL-2 can only be established in a large, long-term, randomized trial. This study\n      examines the effect of two different rIL-2 doses on HIV viral burden and CD4+ cell count and\n      provides additional information on optimal dosing, safety, and antiviral activity of rIL-2.\n\n      Patients are randomized to receive one of two subcutaneous (sc) doses of recombinant rIL-2\n      or no rIL-2. Those patients who take rIL-2 initially receive three courses of treatment. For\n      this study, a course is defined as eight calendar weeks, including the five-day period of sc\n      rIL-2 administration. Additional courses are given (no more frequently than every 6 weeks)\n      in order to maintain a CD4+ count of at least twice its baseline level or at least 1,000\n      cells/mm3. Follow-up will continue for all patients until a common closing date of 12 months\n      following enrollment of the last patient."
