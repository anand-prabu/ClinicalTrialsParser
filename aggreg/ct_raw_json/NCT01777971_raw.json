            "textblock": "Ascites is the accumulation of fluid within the peritoneal cavity of the abdomen.  It is a\n      frequent complication of cirrhosis that is associated with significant morbidity and poor\n      quality of life.  Large-volume ascites has been associated with impaired pulmonary function.\n       In a previous study, the presence and severity of ascites were determined to be significant\n      determinants of fatigue.\n\n      In this study, we will determine whether large-volume ascites contributes to fatigue by\n      assessing the response to drainage of ascites by means of a procedure called large-volume\n      paracentesis.  We hypothesize that treatment of ascites with a single large-volume\n      paracentesis leads to decreased fatigue and improved quality of life and that this\n      improvement is associated with improved sleep pattern.\n\n      20 patients with cirrhosis with refractory ascites requiring regular drainage of ascites\n      fluid by large-volume paracenteses will be recruited for the study.  All patients will\n      undergo a complete clinical and physical examination for liver function, including blood\n      tests.  Hepatic encephalopathy, a change in mental status associated with liver dysfunction,\n      will be assessed by obtaining historical data and by means of simple bedside\n      neuropsychological examinations.\n\n      Study visits will take place on two consecutive days, with each visit lasting approximately\n      2-3 hours.  Immediately prior to a large-volume paracentesis, patients will complete\n      standardized questionnaires for fatigue severity, quality of life, quality of sleep, and a\n      physical assessment of fatigue by means of a 6-minute walk test.  Repeat evaluations will be\n      performed 1 day after the procedure.  Statistical analysis will then be performed to\n      determine the effect of the paracentesis on the various clinical assessments."
