To determine whether intratumoral/peritumoral injection of HSV1716 (oncolytic HSV-1716)\n      is safe in children with recurrent high-grade gliomas amenable to resection.\n\n      II. To estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or a recommended Phase II dose of\n      intratumoral/peritumoral injection of HSV1716.\n\n      III. To describe any dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) of intratumoral/peritumoral injection of\n      HSV1716 at the doses given to children with high-grade gliomas.\n\n      IV. To evaluate changes in tumor enhancement, quantitative magnetic resonance (MR) measures\n      of tumor perfusion (relative cerebral blood volume [rCBV], transfer coefficient [k^trans],\n      fractional blood-plasma volume [Vp] and extravascular extracellular space per unit volume\n      tissue [Ve] values and apparent diffusion coefficient [ADC]) in response to HSV1716\n      injection.\n\n      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I.

To preliminarily describe the antitumor activity of HSV1716 injection within the\n      confines of a Phase I study.\n\n      IV. To evaluate anti-tumor immune cellular and humoral immune responses. V. To evaluate\n      changes in fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)- positron emission tomography (PET) uptake in response\n      to HSV1716 injection.\n\n      VI. To evaluate changes in tumor choline values using magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy\n      in response to HSV1716 injection and further delineate from progressive disease versus\n      pseudo-progression post therapy.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.\n\n      Patients receive oncolytic HSV-1716 intratumorally (IT) and peritumorally after undergoing\n      surgical tumor resection. Patients also receive dexamethasone intravenously (IV) prior to\n      and 6 and 12 hours after surgery.\n\n      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 2 months for 1 year,\n      every 6 months for 4 years, and then annually for 10 years."
