    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to compare the safety and effectiveness of the study drug
      known as  LY2944876 to exenatide extended-release and placebo in participants with type 2
      diabetes mellitus. All drugs will be given by an injection under the skin. Participants
      remain on stable doses of metformin, as prescribed by their personal investigator if they
      were on metformin at study entry. Participants involvement in the study is expected to last
      about 30 weeks.

      The study will include a 12 week blinded treatment period, where neither the participant nor
      the investigator will know to which treatment each individual is assigned. Thereafter
      follows a 12 week period where participants and the investigator will know which treatment
      they are assigned to. Participants on LY2944876 and on exenatide extended-release continue
      treatment in this period, those who received placebo will be followed without treatment.
