During subsequent courses, patients receive gemcitabine\n      as above followed immediately by fluorouracil IV over 24 hours once weekly for 2 weeks.\n      Patients also receive leucovorin calcium orally on days 1 and 8 and IV on days 2 and 9.\n      Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Sequential dose escalation of fluorouracil is followed by sequential dose escalation of\n      gemcitabine. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of fluorouracil and then\n      gemcitabine until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the combination is determined. The MTD\n      is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 108 patients will be accrued for this study."
