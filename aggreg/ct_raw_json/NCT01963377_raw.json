After local anesthesia of\n      the airways using lignocaine spray 10% and solution 1%, the bronchoscope will be introduced\n      in seated position using a mouthpiece and placed at mid-tracheal level. Arterial O2-pressure\n      sampled at the earlobe will be measured after incremental O2-supplementation from 0 to 2 and\n      then 4 l/min using a nasal cannula or the aspirating channel of the bronchoscope. At each\n      flow rate, capillary O2-pressure will be measured after 2 minutes. Between each condition of\n      O2-supplementation there will be a pause of 5 minutes of room air breathing. The order of\n      O2-supplementation condition will be selected at random. The whole bronchoscopic procedure\n      should then last about 15 minutes. Additional doses of lignocaine 1% will be instilled in\n      the trachea as requested and O2 saturation and heart rhythm will be monitored continuously\n      during the procedure. Since the subjects are probably able to perceive additional flows in\n      the nose and/or trachea and this may affect the pattern of breathing and the results, air at\n      similar flow rate will be added in the nasal cannulae when O2 is administered using the\n      bronchoscope channel and vice versa such that the subject will be blinded to the way O2 is\n      administered.\n\n      This study should allow to demonstrate higher values of capillary O2-pressure during\n      bronchoscopic administration of O2 than when using nasal cannulae. As shown by a recent\n      meta-analysis, partial pressure of O2 measured in capillary blood from the arterialized\n      earlobe (PcO2) is lower than the arterial value but this factor is not important in the\n      present study since it will concentrate on differences in PO2 between the two conditions at\n      similar O2 flow rates that are not affected by this limitation."
