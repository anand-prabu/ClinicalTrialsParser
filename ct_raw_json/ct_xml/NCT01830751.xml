  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the proposed study is to test the effect of an intervention technique that
      reduces trunk flexion upon rising, on the outcome measures of self-reported back pain and
      functional impairment in individuals with chronic or recurrent non-specific low back pain
      (LBP).  The intervention is a self-administered and requires no medical intervention or
      drugs. The technique referred to as the restrained sitting treatment (RST), involves
      training in minimizing forward bending of the trunk immediately upon rising. The technique
      builds upon a previous randomized controlled study conducted and published by members of the
      research team. The underlying premise of RST exploits the natural diurnal pattern as the
      intervertebral discs (people are tallest when they first wake up).  The discs are fully
      hydrated upon rising, disc internal hydrostatic pressures and external forces acting on
      surrounding soft tissues are greatest at this time, and these pressures and forces can
      increase significantly with trunk flexion.  The RST technique utilizes a back support used
      in sitting during the first hour upon rising to minimize trunk flexion during this critical
      period as the intervertebral discs begins the diurnal cycle of fluid loss. The study will
      test the null hypothesis that there are no significant difference in outcome (LBP, work or
      social function/disability) between groups performing RST, the experimental group performing
      RST upon rising, the control group performing prior to going to bed.
