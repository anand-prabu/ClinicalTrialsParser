Relationships between baseline expression levels and changes in expression levels with response and certain toxicities will also be explored graphically (e.g. side\u2010by\u2010side boxplots) and with quantitative summaries. Confidence intervals will be presented as the primary method of analysis. Correlations among expression of the genes, miRs, and methylated signatures will be evaluated using scatterplots and the Spearman\u2010rank correlation coefficient.",
