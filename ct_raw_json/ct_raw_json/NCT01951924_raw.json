            "textblock": "Multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) is a chronic acquired, probably autoimmune, demyelinating,\n      motor neuropathy. It is a rare disease, variable in its clinical features. The disease\n      course is usually steadily progressive.\n\n      Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is the standard and the first line treatment for MMN. The\n      Cochrane review of four randomized placebo-controlled studies showed a significant clinical\n      improvement in muscle strength from IVIG in 78% of patients with MMN versus 4% with placebo\n      but a non-significant improvement in disability (39% versus 11%) (van Schaik IN, 2005).\n      However, IVIG treatment does not prevent a mild gradual decline in muscle strength which is\n      probably due to ongoing axonal degeneration. In addition to its efficacy, IVIG is also a\n      safe treatment with a positive benefit-risk ratio in MMN.\n\n      Muscle strength measured with the Modified Medical Research Council (MMRC 10) sum score as\n      described in the study of Cats (Cats EA, 2008) including 20 movements i.e. 10 muscle groups\n      of the upper and lower limbs on each side was selected as the primary endpoint. Other\n      parameters of muscle strength such as measurement of grip strength by dynamometer - and\n      functional disability will also be evaluated to reinforce the robustness of the study and\n      substantiate the efficacy of I10E in MMN patients."
