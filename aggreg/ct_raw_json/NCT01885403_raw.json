This study will collect data in\n      an observational and clinical setting in the re-compensation phase of ADHF.\n\n      Correlation between measured lung and respiratory parameters and standard clinical\n      parameters characterizing stages of re-compensation will be undertaken. Standard clinical\n      parameters may include diuretics and other cardiac medication dose frequency, weight, heart\n      rate, respiratory rate, chest x-rays (when routinely performed), symptoms such as shortness\n      of breath or fatigue, biomarkers such as brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), stroke volume,\n      cardiac output, and oxygen requirements."
