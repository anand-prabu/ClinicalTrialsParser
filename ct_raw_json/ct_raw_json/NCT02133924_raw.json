GVHD is the most common serious\n      complication, after bone marrow transplant. GVHD occurs when the donor cells (the graft),\n      treat the recipient's body as \"foreign\" and attack the cells in the recipient's body.\n      During this immune system response, donor cells damage body tissues, such as the skin,\n      liver, stomach, and/or intestines. Acute GVHD can be severe and if severe, potentially fatal\n      to the transplant recipient. Acute GVHD usually happens within the first several months\n      after transplant.\n\n      The goal of this research is to develop a safer and more effective treatment for acute GVHD,\n      and particularly for acute GVHD that affects the gastrointestinal (or GI) tract, with the\n      ultimate goal being safer and more effective transplant therapies for blood cancers such as\n      leukemia, lymphoma, and multiple myeloma."

            "textblock": "The only proven effective treatment for patients with acute graft vs host disease is\n      steroids. Patients who do not respond to steroid treatment are at high risk for death.\n      Unfortunately, based on the early symptoms, it is not possible to tell whether a patient\n      will respond to steroids, when GVHD is diagnosed and treatment with steroids, such as\n      prednisone, is started.\n\n      This research trial is designed to study the safety and effectiveness of combining the study\n      drug, Natalizumab (Tysabri\u00ae) with the use of steroids to treat acute GVHD in patients who\n      are at the earliest stages of their clinical symptoms, but  who, by using a proprietary\n      method developed at the University of Michigan, are  predicted to be at high risk for not\n      responding to steroid therapy, the standard of care.\n\n      Investigators at the University of Michigan have developed a research method, they believe\n      might make it possible to predict who is at high risk for not responding to steroids. This\n      method, called Ann Arbor GVHD grading, uses the levels of naturally occurring chemicals in\n      the blood (called biomarkers) to determine a patient's GVHD grade (1, 2, or 3).\n\n      A hypothesis is that most patients with Ann Arbor grade 3 GVHD, will not respond well to\n      steroid treatment. The investigators research shows that almost half of the patients with\n      Ann Arbor grade 3 GVHD, will die within 6 months of their GVHD diagnosis. Most of the deaths\n      are due to intestinal GVHD, which sometimes does not develop, until after standard steroid\n      treatment has already begun.\n\n      Only patients who have Ann Arbor grade 3 GVHD, will be eligible for this study treatment. It\n      is important to understand that Ann Arbor GVHD grading is not approved for clinical use. It\n      can only be used as a test for research purposes. In this study, patients must have their\n      blood tested to determine, if they qualify asre Ann Arbor grade 3 GVHD, and must start the\n      study treatment within 3 days of their  clinical diagnosis of acute GVHD.\n\n      The study will test whether the investigators can improve steroid response and prevent death\n      from GVHD with the combination therapy, by blocking the donor cells from getting to the\n      intestine and causing damage. Natalizumab (Tysabri\u00ae) is a drug that works by blocking the\n      signals that cause immune cells like donor cells, to travel to organs like the intestine or\n      brain.\n\n      Natalizumab is FDA-approved in adults, to treat Crohn's disease, a chronic condition where\n      immune cells cause damage to the digestive system (such as the stomach, intestines). It is\n      also used to treat multiple sclerosis where immune cells cause damage to the nervous system\n      in the brain. Its intended use is for patients whose disease has not responded to the\n      standard treatment, or who cannot tolerate the side effects from standard treatments.\n\n      Natalizumab has never been used for treating GVHD. It is an experimental drug for this\n      study, because the investigators are investigating a new use for the drug, as a GVHD\n      treatment, and also because it has not been studied in pediatric patients (patients under\n      the age of 18), even for its approved uses."
