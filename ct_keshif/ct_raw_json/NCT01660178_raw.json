The sample consisted of\n      116 medical records of newborns indicated for the treatment of early stimulation,\n      representing (9.2%). The study excluded seven infants who had some type of congenital\n      malformation. It was used the following variables: weight, sex, gestational age, Apgar\n      score, diagnosis of Respiratory Distress Syndrome and Intracranial Hemorrhage and the use of\n      mechanical ventilation and CPAP."
