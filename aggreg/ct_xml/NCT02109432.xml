    <textblock>
      The purpose of this investigation is to evaluate participant use of a dedicated office pedal
      desk with and without behavioral support.

      For this pilot study the investigators will identify and recruit up to 20 full time
      Pennington Biomedical staff members employed in sedentary jobs (i.e., report mostly sitting
      during working hours). The sample size is limited by the number of pedal desks being built
      for this pilot study and the need for timely data generation. Although the investigators can
      stagger starts as needed, all participants must intend to be on campus for the subsequent 6
      weeks after they start the intervention. Two cohorts of 10 participants will complete the
      three 2-week conditions in the following order: 1) SELF-DIRECTED use where participants have
      access to their daily recorded data but will not have any other form of feedback or
      goal-setting; 2) FACILITATED use where participants are provided with their daily recorded
      pedal desk data and additional daily behavioral support from an interventionist (e.g.,
      feedback and goal-setting) to increase their use of the pedal desk by an individually
      negotiated and agreed upon amount; 3) FACILITATED use with PEDOMETER where participants will
      be provided with their daily recorded pedal desk and step count data and additional daily
      behavioral support from an interventionist (e.g., feedback and goal-setting) to increase
      their use of the pedal desk by an individually negotiated and agreed upon amount and
      increase their step count by 3,000 steps/day compared to baseline. Participants will be
      asked to pedal at a sustainable and self-selected pace while using the pedal desk.

    <description>Investigators are interested in comparing objectively determined physical activity and sedentary behavior at baseline to activity levels during the second week of each of the three 2-week conditions (self-directed use, facilitated use, facilitated use with additional pedometer intervention; outlined below). Pedal desk use will be continuously tracked to determine behavior uptake and change.</description>
