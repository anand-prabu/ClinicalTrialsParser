Participants will not receive a password to access the website to follow their accumulating data during the intervention period (first 6 months). At the start of the 6-month monitoring period (second 6 months), the control group will be provided with a password to access the pedometer web page that allows them to create and view a visual map of their progress giving them a clear picture of how they are doing and where they are headed."

Throughout life, including adulthood, children with\n      epilepsy are at increased risk of impaired health, functioning, psychological well-being and\n      quality-of-life. There is evidence that physical activity improves the medical and\n      psychosocial aspects of health in adults with epilepsy- but there are no such studies in\n      children. The investigators predict that we can increase levels of physical activity and\n      influence children's functioning, psychological well-being and quality of life through\n      multiple pathways. The investigators propose to evaluate the relationship between enhanced\n      physical activity and health, and explore facilitators and barriers to physical activity in\n      children with epilepsy."

            "textblock": "This project explores an innovative idea that, if successful, will have the potential to\n      significantly change current thinking and practice regarding health promotion among children\n      with epilepsy. There are many unfounded assumptions about the dangers of exercise in\n      children with epilepsy that may be seriously detrimental to children's health, and that we\n      have good reason to challenge. Physical activity (PA) interventions, such as walking\n      programs, are practicable, non-pharmacological approaches to health promotion and represent\n      a neglected opportunity for disease modification. We propose to undertake a prospective\n      randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effects of increasing physical activity levels\n      through a modern pedometer-measured walking program, followed by assessment of the\n      sustainability of the program. We hypothesize that a motivational program to increase the\n      levels of PA over 6-months will result in sustainable enhanced PA. This in turn will\n      positively and simultaneously influence health and reduce several morbidities in children\n      with epilepsy, leading to improved health and life quality in childhood and continuing into\n      adulthood."

Participants will be motivated by augmented behavior modification strategies such as: having access to the pedometer web page to view calculated step counts; scanning and discussing neighborhoods for available walking routes; and creating a buddy system for walking. Each will be facilitated by telephone-based physical activity behavior change counselling, occurring weekly, bi-weekly and monthly. Participants will upload their daily pedometer data wirelessly.
