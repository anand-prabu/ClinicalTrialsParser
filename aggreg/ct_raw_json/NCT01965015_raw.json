Study endpoints\n      were then chosen to portray both safety (device related Major Adverse Cardiac And\n      Neurological Events) as well as preliminary performance as assessed by a well characterized\n      measure (e.g., LAP which is known to be associated with the general state of the disease and\n      most importantly left ventricular ejection fraction and cardiac function in general)."
