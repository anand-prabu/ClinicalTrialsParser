    <textblock>
      This non-randomized, open-label, multicenter study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      CH5424802/RO5424802 in patients with ALK-rearranged non-small cell lung cancer who failed
      crizotinib treatment. In Phase I, cohorts of patients will receive escalating doses of
      CH5424802/RO5424802 orally twice daily. In Phase II, patients who failed crizotinib
      treatment will receive the recommended phase II dose (600 mg) daily in two oral doses.
