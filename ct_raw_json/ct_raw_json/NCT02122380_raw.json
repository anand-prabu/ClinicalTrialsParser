The proposed research will test the hypothesis that chronic sitagliptin therapy will\n      enhance GH secretion and vascular function while improving glucose tolerance in patients\n      with impaired GH secretion who are at risk for the development of diabetes mellitus and\n      cardiovascular disease, specifically obese women with polycystic ovary syndrome."

The use of oral\n      contraceptives or metformin will be discontinued at least 30 days prior.  In females\n      experiencing monthly cycles, the outpatient visit will take place during the mid-luteal\n      phase of the participant's menstrual cycle and the inpatient visit will take place during\n      the late follicular phase.\n\n      Subjects will be randomized to treatment order (sitagliptin 100 mg daily vs placebo) using a\n      block randomization algorithm with a block size of two. The dose of sitagliptin was chosen\n      as it is currently the FDA-recommended dose of sitagliptin for type 2 diabetic patients with\n      unimpaired renal function. Subjects will receive standardized dietary counseling throughout\n      the study; visits will be standardized to the menstrual cycle when possible. Subjects will\n      take each therapy for one month; a minimum one month wash-out will separate study\n      treatments. Side effects and compliance with study medication will be assessed at each visit\n      in the CRC.\n\n      Each subject will undergo one outpatient visit and one inpatient visit during each\n      treatment. On each study day, subjects will report fasting to the CRC in the morning having\n      abstained from exercise that morning.  On each study day, subjects will receive an\n      intravenous catheter. Subjects will undergo an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) during the\n      outpatient study visit. During the inpatient study visit, vasodilation in response to\n      intra-arterial vasodilators will be assessed,  and the arterial line subsequently\n      discontinued. Standardized meals will be provided at lunch and dinner. Body composition will\n      be determined in the afternoon. At 8 PM overnight frequent sampling for venous GH will begin\n      every 10 minutes for 12 hours to determine overnight GH secretion."
