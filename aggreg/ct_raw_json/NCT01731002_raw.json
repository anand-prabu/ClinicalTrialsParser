Unmedicated (post-washout) IOP \u2265 24 mm Hg at 2 eligibility visits (08:00 hr), 2-7\n             days a part, and \u2265 22 mm Hg at 10:00 and 16:00 hrs at the second qualification visit.\n             If only one eye meets the IOP criteria it must be the same eye that met the criteria\n             at all the qualification timepoints.\n\n          4. Corrected visual acuity in each eye +1.0 logMAR or better by ETDRS in each eye\n             (equivalent to 20/200).\n\n          5. Able and willing to give signed informed consent and follow study instructions.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n        Ophthalmic\n\n          1. Glaucoma: pseudoexfoliation or pigment dispersion component, history of angle closure\n             or narrow angles. Note: Previous laser peripheral iridotomy is NOT acceptable.\n\n          2. IOP > 36 mm Hg.\n\n          3. Known hypersensitivity to any component of the formulation (benzalkonium chloride,\n             etc.), or to topical anesthetics.\n\n          4. Previous glaucoma intraocular surgery or glaucoma laser procedures in study eye(s,\n             e.g., laser trabeculoplasty).\n\n          5. Refractive surgery in study eye(s) (e.g., radial keratotomy, PRK, LASIK, etc.).\n\n          6. Ocular trauma within the past six months, or ocular surgery or laser treatment within\n             the past three months prior to screening.\n\n          7. Evidence of ocular infection, inflammation, clinically significant blepharitis or\n             conjunctivitis at screening (Visit 0), or a history of herpes simplex keratitis\n\n          8. Ocular medication of any kind within 30 days of Visit 0, with the exception of a)\n             ocular hypotensive medications (which must be washed out according to the provided\n             schedule), b) lid scrubs (which may be used prior to, but not after Visit 0) or c)\n             lubricating drops for dry eye (which may be used throughout the study).\n\n          9. Clinically significant ocular disease (e.g. uveitis, severe keratoconjunctivitis\n             sicca) which might interfere with the study, including glaucomatous damage so severe\n             that washout of ocular hypotensive medications for one month is not judged safe\n             (i.e., cup-disc ratio > 0.8).\n\n         10. Central corneal thickness greater than 600 \u00b5m.\n\n         11. Any abnormality preventing reliable applanation tonometry of either eye.\n\n             Systemic:\n\n         12. Clinically significant abnormalities (as determined by the treating physician) in\n             laboratory tests at screening.\n\n         13. Known hypersensitivity or contraindication to latanoprost.\n\n         14. Clinically significant systemic disease (e.g., myasthenia gravis, hepatic, renal,\n             endocrine or cardiovascular disorders) which might interfere with the study.\n\n         15. Participation in any investigational study within 30 days prior to screening.\n\n         16. Changes of systemic medication that could have a substantial effect on IOP within 30\n             days prior to screening, or anticipated during the study.\n\n         17. Due to the current status of the preclinical safety program, women of childbearing\n             potential who are pregnant, nursing, planning a pregnancy, or not using a medically\n             acceptable form of birth control.  An adult woman is considered to be of childbearing\n             potential unless she is one year post-menopausal or three months post-surgical\n             sterilization.  All females of childbearing potential must have a negative urine\n             pregnancy test result at the screening examination and must not intend to become\n             pregnant during the study."
