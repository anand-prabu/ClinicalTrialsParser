  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the use of a medical food, oral serum-derived bovine
      immunoglobulin/protein isolate (SBI), in helping patients with advanced COPD with cachexia
      (a wasting syndrome) improve their nutritional status and gain weight. The medical food is
      in powder form and is mixed with a liquid such as water or orange juice and consumed by
      swallowing. The primary hypothesis is that SBI protein isolate (SBI) will improve the
      nutritional status of cachexic patients with advanced stages of COPD.

          -  Current substance abuse, including tobacco, alcohol and illicit drugs

          -  Diagnosis of unstable cardiovascular disease including myocardial infarction in the
             past 6 weeks, uncontrolled congestive heart failure, or uncontrolled arrhythmia

          -  Dementia or other cognitive dysfunction which in the opinion of the investigator
             would prevent the participant from consenting to the study or completing study
             procedures

          -  Non-COPD obstructive lung disease (various bronchiolitides, sarcoidosis, LAM,
             histiocytosis X) or parenchymal lung disease, pulmonary vascular disease, pleural
             disease, severe kyphoscoliosis, neuromuscular weakness, or other cardiovascular and
             pulmonary disease, that limit the interpretability of the pulmonary function measures

          -  Prior significant difficulties with pulmonary function testing

          -  Hypersensitivity to or intolerance of albuterol sulfate or ipratropium bromide or
             propellants or excipients of the inhalers, or to beef

          -  History of or current exposure to chemotherapy or radiation treatments that, in the
             opinion of the investigator, limits the interpretability of the pulmonary function
             measures.

          -  Current or planned pregnancy within the study course.

          -  Currently institutionalized (e.g., prisons, long-term care facilities)
