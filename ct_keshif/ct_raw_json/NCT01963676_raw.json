We hypothesize that tDCS will modulate the abnormal neuronal activity\n      found in schizophrenic patients and thereby decrease their auditory hallucinations when\n      measured after stimulation.\n\n      AIM 2: To evaluate the long term effects of tDCS by having patients give a rating on the\n      AHRS after one month has passed since stimulation and comparing this value to their baseline\n      score and their score immediately after stimulation. We hypothesize that there will remain a\n      significant reduction in auditory hallucination score in participants who received tDCS at\n      one month.\n\n      AIM 3: To collect pilot data on a small number of subjects (5) who undergo transcranial\n      alternating current stimulation (tACS) instead of tDCS as their stimulation paradigm."
