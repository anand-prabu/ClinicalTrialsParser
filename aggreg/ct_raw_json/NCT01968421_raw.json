            "textblock": "Bronchiectasis is still a common chronic respiratory disease. Non-cystic fibrosis\n      bronchiectasis is characterized by irreversible dilatation of the medium-sized bronchi as a\n      result of airway injury due to recurrent or chronic inflammation and infection. Clinical\n      features of bronchiectasis include chronic production of sputum often mucopurulent or\n      purulent in nature, persistent bacterial colonization, recurrent lower respiratory tract\n      infections. Bronchiectasis airways are often colonized with bacterial species. Infections of\n      the airways are thought to play an important role in bronchiectasis exacerbation.\n      Progressive lung damage in bronchiectasis results from a 'vicious cycle' of recurrent\n      bacterial infection and a deregulated inflammatory response. The non-specific prevention of\n      recurrent airway infections by immunostimulating agents has gained growing scientific\n      interest. OM-85, consisting extracts of eight kinds of bacteria important in respiratory\n      infections, has been known to support the respiratory tract resistance to the pathogens via\n      activating pulmonary macrophages, increasing the ratio of CD4 to CD8 lymphocytes, and\n      changing the level of a variety of cytokines in the lung. OM-85 has shown the benefit for\n      significantly reducing the incidence of exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary\n      disease (COPD). Bronchiectasis exacerbations contribute substantially to rapid decline in\n      lung function, reduced quality of life, and the medical costs. The purpose of this study is\n      to investigate the PReventive effect of OM-85 on Bronchiectasis Exacerbation in Chinese\n      patients (iPROBE).\n\n      This study is designed as a prospective randomised double-blind placebo-controlled\n      multi-centred trial. A total of 244 patients with bronchiectasis, who have had at least one\n      exacerbation of bronchiectasis in the previous year, will be included. The subjects will be\n      randomly received two courses of 7mg of OM-85 or matching placebo to take one oral capsule\n      per day for 10 days a month for 3 consecutive months at the beginning of the study, then 3\n      months later with the same schedule for 1 year.\n\n      We will investigate whether long-term therapy with an oral immunostimulant OM-85 can\n      decrease exacerbations in patients with bronchiectasis over 1-year period. Besides, we will\n      assess other outcomes including: the rate of event-based exacerbation, lung function\n      parameters, the total scores on the St George's respiratory questionnaire and coughing, and\n      inflammatory index. We hope that this study will provide novel information on the preventive\n      effects of OM-85 treatment on bronchiectasis exacerbation and will address a knowledge gap\n      for this poorly understood and under-studied disease."
