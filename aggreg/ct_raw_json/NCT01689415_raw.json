With 24\n      hours blood pressure measurements the effect after renal nerve denervation is examined 1,3,6\n      and 12 months after the procedure."

RND shows a significant reduction in the systolic and diastolic blood\n      pressure in patients with treatment resistant hypertension.\n\n      The hypothesis is that RDN is able to reduce the blood pressure in patients with previous\n      stroke and treatment resistant hypertension and thereby reduce the risk of a new stroke.\n\n      Aim of study:\n\n        1. To validate the reduction in blood pressure after RND in patients with stroke and\n           treatment resistant hypertension compared to the results achieved in patients only with\n           essential hypertension\n\n        2. To examine if this treatment is possible on patients after stroke (procedure related\n           limitations and security of the patient)\n\n        3. To describe the effect of RND in the development of changes in the white matter over\n           time"
