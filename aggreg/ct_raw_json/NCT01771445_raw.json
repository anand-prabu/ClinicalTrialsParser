However, IL-1 antagonism also decreases IL-6 levels. The\n      effect if IL-6 on the glucose metabolism has been unclear in the past and subject to intense\n      debate, with recent evidence indicating a beneficial role in regulating glucose metabolism.\n      However little is known about regulation of muscle-induced IL-6 produced during exercise. It\n      is therefore our aim to investigate whether exercise induced increases in IL-6 are dependent\n      on the IL-1 system. If IL-1 antagonism does decrease IL-6 and along with it, the beneficial\n      potential of IL-6, this may require additional medication like IL-6 substitution or\n      dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV)antagonists.\n\n      In addition, the investigators will assess the effect of IL-1 antagonism on insulin and\n      Glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1) secretion as well as muscle soreness,fatigue and vascular\n      function in response to an acute exercise bout."
