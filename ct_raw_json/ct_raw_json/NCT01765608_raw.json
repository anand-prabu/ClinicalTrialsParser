The standard setting is a pressure delivery in the pressure range 5-15 mbar and the full treatment is maintained in the patient\u00b4s home. The adequate performance of the device is controlled by user time readers and built-in memory cards and control readings are routinely performed within the first 4 weeks of treatment initiation. Patients will be encouraged via telephone calls for maximum use. Total duration of CPAP treatment is 24 weeks."

Patients will be randomized to receive\n      zonisamide, placebo or nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) during 4 weeks. A 5\n      month open extension part will follow when patients in the tablet groups will all receive\n      zonisamide. Patients in the open CPAP group will continue with CPAP treatment.\n\n      Study hypothesis:\n\n      Controlled pharmacological weight reduction with Zonisamide will result in elimination of\n      OSA and OSA sequels more effectively than nCPAP due to incomplete compliance with the\n      mechanical treatment and a lack of direct beneficial metabolic effects after nCPAP. Further\n      it is hypothesized that zonisamide has a direct pharmacological effect on respiratory\n      control during sleep by its carbonic anhydrase inhibitory effects and this will result in a\n      reduction of sleep disordered breathing."
