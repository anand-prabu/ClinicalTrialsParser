In particular, the recent dissemination of a serine\n      carbapenemase (e.g., KPC) in Enterobacteriaceae in US hospitals now poses a considerable\n      threat to the carbapenems and other members of the beta-lactam class of antimicrobial\n      agents.\n\n      Rempex is developing a fixed combination antibiotic of a carbapenem (RPX2014) plus a new\n      beta-lactamase inhibitor (RPX7009) which has activity against serine beta-lactamases,\n      including KPC. This Phase 1 study will assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics\n      of intravenous RPX2014 and RPX7009, administered in combination in subjects with varying\n      degrees of renal insufficiency."
