This study will also investigate the safety\n      and tolerability of repeat doses of GSK2586184. During the study, up to 3 Interim Analyses\n      will be conducted. These are to monitor the pharmacodynamic effect and safety following 2\n      weeks of therapy (Interim Analysis 1); and the clinical efficacy and safety of GSK2586184\n      following 12 weeks of therapy (Interim Analyses 2 and 3). Subjects who meet the entry\n      criteria (approximately 150 to 250) will be randomized in a 1:1:1:1:1 ratio to receive\n      GSK2586184 at doses of 50 milligram (mg) twice daily (b.i.d), 100 mg b.i.d, 200 mg b.i.d,\n      400 mg b.i.d or Placebo b.i.d.
