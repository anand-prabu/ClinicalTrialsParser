      Assess the long-term outcomes of children infected with HIV in terms of: clinical and and
      immunovirological response to ARV therapy, long-term ARV tolerance, and the impact of family
      environment and lifestyle on adherence to ARV treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The follow-up of HIV infected children is an important part of their access to
      antiretroviral drugs. This therapeutic follow-up has an impact on infant morbidity and
      mortality and remains challenging due to its complexity (multi-drug therapy), the use of
      galenic forms that are not well adapted to children, the risks of toxicity and their
      prolonged administration, and the evolution of this syndrome in the patients' parents.
      Currently, while access to ARV is being ameliorated for children in Sub-Saharan Africa,
      little information is available on medium to long-term evolution of early treated HIV
      infected infants on ARV treatment. In Cameroon, the PEDIACAM ANRS12140 study has assessed
      for a period of 2 years, the impact of early ARV treatment in HIV infected children and
      their humoral responses to EPI vaccines. The prolongation to 5 years of follow-up of these
      children, including HIV non-infected children is a unique opportunity to describe in terms
      of medium to long-term response: the clinical and immunovirological prognosis of the HIV
      infection in children and to identify factors associated with treatment failure.

      This is a prospective longitudinal, observational, national multi-centred study including
      two groups of infants: one group of HIV infected infants treated early, and one group of HIV
      non-infected infants (born to either HIV infected or HIV non-infected mothers).
      Participation in the study will be proposed to all the infants included in PEDIACAM
      ANRS12140, if possible before the age of 2 years. Only children whose parents or legal
      guardians consent to this continuation of the follow-up will be included. The children
      participating in the study will be followed up every 6 months until the age of 5 years
      (duration of prolongation of study is 3 years). In the course of each visit, a clinical
      examination will be carried out as well as a complete laboratory examination. Antiretroviral
      treatment will be in line with the national recommendations and guidelines. The PEDIACAM
      ANRS12225 two year follow-up concerns 340 children divided into 200 non-infected infants and
      140 HIV positive infants. Population size has been calculated taking into account possible
      deaths, loss to follow-up and refusal to participate.

      This cohort will enable us to answer the questions that arise regarding the long-term
      outcomes of HIV infected children in terms of clinical prognosis and immunology, and the
      impact of family environment and lifestyle on ARV treatment adherence. It will also aid in
      structuring the follow-up of children treated with ARVs in Cameroon. Furthermore, a study on
      the response to vaccines will enable the identification of possible failures and to propose,
      if necessary, an adjustment of the vaccine calendar.
