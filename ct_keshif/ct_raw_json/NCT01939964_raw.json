Active ingredients include sodium bicarbonate,\n      potassium bicarbonate, sodium carbonate, strontium carbonate, gold nanoparticles, calcium,\n      germanium, selenium , zinc, sugar and  water.  When applied to the skin , it has been shown\n      to reduce the appearance of wrinkles by stimulation of skin fibroblasts to produce new\n      collagen while removing aging dermis cells, facilitate the production of fibrillin proteins\n      and protect the skin from ultraviolet rays."
