            "textblock": "Traumatic brain injury represents a dynamic spectrum of physiologic and cognitive\n      dysfunction that exerts effects at multiple levels of human health. Mild traumatic brain\n      injury (mTBI) is a multi-factorial illness that is an increasingly serious public health\n      issue for military and civilian personnel. The assessment of neurocognitive deficits in mTBI\n      has been suggested to be less conclusive, presumably because of the predominating influence\n      of PTSD and other co-morbid factors.  Recent research suggests that psychological factors\n      play a substantial role in TBI-related impairments in self-reported health and cognition\n      function. Furthermore, research has shown that TBI is rarely an isolated finding in military\n      combat settings and that persistent post-concussive symptoms are commonly associated with\n      post-traumatic stress disorder and chronic pain, a constellation of findings that has been\n      termed the \"polytrauma clinical triad\". Indeed, significant numbers of returning Veterans of\n      Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom (OEF/OIF) display the polytrauma clinical\n      triad (PCT) of pain, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and traumatic brain injury. The\n      proposed project will: 1) elucidate best practices for treating mTBI with co-occurring\n      symptoms (pain, sleep disturbance, PTSD) encompassing cognitive, emotional, and\n      psychological functioning; and 2) address psychosocial aspects of managing pain and\n      co-morbidities associated with mTBI through integrative and complementary and alternative\n      approaches."

Self-compassion seems to entail three main components: 1) self-kindness, being kind and understanding toward oneself in instances of pain or failure rather than being harshly self-critical, 2) common humanity, perceiving one's experiences as part of the larger human experience rather than seeing them as separating and isolating, and 3) mindfulness, holding painful thoughts and feelings in balanced awareness rather than over-identifying with them. Thus, SCS may be used to assess the potential benefits induced by mindfulness based interventions, which may be strongly related to the construct of self-compassion.",
