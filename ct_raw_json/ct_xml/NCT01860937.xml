  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety of giving the patient special cells made
      from their own blood called &quot;Modified T-cells&quot;. The goal is to find a safe dose of modified
      T-cells for patients whose leukemia has returned to the bone marrow.

    <textblock>
      This is a phase I multicenter clinical trial for pediatric and young adult patients with
      relapsed/refractory CD19+ B-ALL. The T cell doses originally proposed in this study were
      based on doses administered safely in prior autologous T cell adoptive therapy trials65-67,
      but the dose has been modified based on the toxicities observed in adult patients with
      morphologic evidence of relapsed B-ALL treated on MSKCC IRB 09-114. Patients will be treated
      with different doses of T cells depending on the amount of disease at the time of T cell
      infusion. Patients in Cohort 1 (&lt;5% blasts in the bone marrow) will receive 3 x 10^6 19-28z+
      T cells/kg. Patients in Cohort 2 (≥5% blasts in the bone marrow) will receive 1x10^6 19-28z+
      T cells/kg.

    <description>Patients with no morphologic evidence of disease at the time of T cell infusion, (&lt;5% blasts in the bone marrow) as assessed by morphology. Cohort 1 patients will receive conditioning chemotherapy followed by 3x106 19-28z+ T cells/kg. T cells will be infused in a fractionated manner: approximately 1/3 dose on the first day and then the remaining dose on the next day. During formulation of EOP T cells, under or over estimation of CAR modified T-cells may occur. Patients may receive an altered fractionation of the total doses (e.g. ½ on Day 0 and ½ on Day +1) or up to 20% over total cell dose with approval by the participating site PI. In both cohorts, patients will be allowed to receive a 2nd infusion of 19-28z+ T cells if they benefited from the first infusion and did not experience any non-hematologic grade 4 toxicities.</description>

             to be eligible for infusion of modified T cells.

          -  Please note ≥5% blasts by morphology and/or flow cytometry constitutes a bone marrow
             relapse on this protocol. Patients must also fulfill one of the following criteria to

                  neurologic dysfunction) within 28 days of treatment. Prophylactic intrathecal
