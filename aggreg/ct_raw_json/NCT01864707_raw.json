We\n      want to include 141 patients with multiple sclerosis and fatigue. Participants will be\n      randomised into three groups to compare 1) usual care, 2) usual care plus standardised\n      acupuncture, and 3) usual care plus mindfulness-based stress reduction. Treatment duration\n      will be 12 weeks. The primary outcome is the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) after 12 weeks,\n      follow-up measurement will be performed after 26 weeks. Secondary outcomes include other\n      fatigue specific parameters, other MS specific parameters, cost, and physiological,\n      immunological and functional magnetic resonance imaging parameters."
