Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive home-based telephone counseling by a personal nutritionist and\n           a personal trainer.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive home-based standard health telephone counseling in unrelated\n           areas of cancer care (e.g., sun exposure, screening, and falls prevention).\n\n      In both arms, counseling continues every 2 weeks for 6 months.\n\n      Patients are followed at 6 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 420 patients (210 per arm) will be accrued for this study."
