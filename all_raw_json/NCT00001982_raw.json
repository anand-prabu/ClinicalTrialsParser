However, researchers\n      would like to study the long-term effects of this disease.\n\n      Volunteer blood donors diagnosed with chronic hepatitis C viral (HCV) and various levels of\n      liver enzyme activity will be offered a complete medical evaluation and liver biopsy.  The\n      tests will enable researchers to provide the patients with an idea of how severe their liver\n      disease is.  The virus and patient will be studied in order to understand why patients with\n      hepatitis C develop different levels of liver damage."
