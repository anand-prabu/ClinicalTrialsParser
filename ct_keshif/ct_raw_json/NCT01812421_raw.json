The patients will be classified as different adherence\n      level at the end of the study according to their adherence condition.\n\n      This study is aimed at testing the hypothesis that controlling hypertension and its risk\n      factors was more effective than those do not receive HHEP  in reducing the recurrence of\n      stroke and cardiovascular diseases."
