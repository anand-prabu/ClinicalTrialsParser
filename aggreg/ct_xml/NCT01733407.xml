  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type 1 (HSAN1) the investigators recently
      discovered the accumulation of two neurotoxic sphingolipids. It appears that these lipids
      arise as the mutant enzyme has a reduced affinity for its normal preferred substrate
      L-serine. The investigators now plan to perform a two year study of L-serine supplementation
      to correct the biochemistry and neurological disease in humans with HSAN1. In the course the
      investigators will also establish correlations between an existing neurological rating scale
      of sensory neuropathy and intraepidermal nerve fiber density.

      The study objective is to evaluate the efficacy of L-serine in subjects with hereditary
      sensory neuropathy type 1 (HSAN1). Hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type I
      (HSAN1) is a progressive and debilitating illness for which currently no treatment exists.
      The investigators recently identified two novel deoxysphingoid bases (DSB) that accumulate
      in plasma of HSAN1 patients and mutant transgenic HSAN1 mice. The disease is caused by
      missense mutations in the SPTLC1 gene encoding a subunit of the enzyme serine
      palmitoyltransferase (SPT). In normal circumstances the SPT enzyme catalyzes the reaction of
      palmitoyl-CoA with serine to form sphinganine. The two newly identified DSB,
      deoxysphinganine and deoxymethylsphinganine, arise from condensation of palmitoyl-CoA with
      alanine and glycine respectively, suggesting that HSAN1 mutations alter amino acid
      selectivity of SPT. In support of this hypothesis the investigators have shown that levels
      of DSB in humans and mice can be lowered by supplementation with the enzyme's normal
      substrate, serine.

      In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled cross over study the investigators will
      enroll 20 research participants with HSAN1 with 10 subjects assigned to L-serine
      (400mg/kg/d) and 10 assigned to placebo who are each treated for 12 months. The 10 subjects
      assigned to placebo will then be crossed over to active L-serine for the remaining 12
      months. The progression of HSAN1 will be measured by the change in an established clinical
      rating scale and measures of intraepidermal nerve fiber density (IENFD) on skin biopsy.
      L-serine levels will be measured using 24-hour pharmacokinetic blood sample at 12-month
      intervals. The investigators will assess the percentage of failures (clinical decline of &gt; 1
      point on CMTNS or &gt; 30% decrease in IENFD) at 6 month intervals. Regardless of CMTNS score,
      all subjects who are on placebo for the first year will be switched to active study drug in
      year two.

          -  HSAN1 patients with prominent sensory loss with foot ulcers or shooting pains and
             con-firmed mutations in SPTLC1.

          -  Males and females of 18 years or older

          -  All patients will be able to provide informed consent and comply with oral dietary
             supple-mentation and study activities. Compliance with supplementation will be
             monitored through measurement of DSB levels.

          -  Subjects must not have taken L-serine for at least 30 days prior to randomization
             (L-serine-na√Øve subjects are permitted in the study).

          -  Women must not become pregnant for the duration of the study and must be willing to
             use two contraceptive therapies and have a negative pregnancy test throughout the
             course of the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any cause of neuropathy other than HSAN1 (such as diabetes or drug-induced
             neuropathy), medical history of kidney stones, or history of poliomyelitis or
             radiotherapy.

          -  Pregnant women, breastfeeding, or not using adequate contraception; for women
             included, an accepted method of contraception will be used throughout the study.

          -  Active drug or alcohol use or dependence that, in the opinion of the site
             investigator, would interfere with adherence to study requirements.

          -  Patients on blood-thinners such as warfarin (Coumadin) or heparin will not be
             biopsied until they have held the medication for 5 days. Following the biopsy they
             will resume the maintenance dose of their medication.

          -  Serious illness (requiring systemic treatment and/or hospitalization) until subject
             either completes therapy or is clinically stable on therapy, in the opinion of the
             site investigator, for at least 10 days prior to study entry.

          -  The presence of unstable psychiatric disease, cognitive impairment, or dementia that
             would impair ability of the subject to provide informed consent, according to PI
             judgment, or a history of active substance abuse within the prior year.

          -  Subjects who are non-ambulatory.

          -  Subjects with uncontrolled diabetes.

          -  Patients who are unable or unwilling to give consent will not be enrolled in the
             study.
