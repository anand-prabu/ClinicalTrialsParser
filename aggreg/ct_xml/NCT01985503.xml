  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Turku PET Centre, there have been 3 positron emission tomography studies on brown adipose
      tissue (BAT) activity in healthy adults. BATPET was performed between 2008 and 2009. FATBAT
      started in 2011 and Dixon-BAT in 2012 and they are both currently ongoing. In the current
      study, participants of BATPET, FATBAT and Dixon-BAT studies are recruited for a follow-up
      study to examine associations between obesity, cardiovascular risk factors, serum metabolic
      profile and BAT structure at baseline and during follow-up several years later. 43 BATPET
      participants will be called for follow-up in 2013 with a follow-up period of 5 years and 52
      FATBAT and Dixon-BAT participants in years 2014 and 2015 with a follow-up period of 3 years.
      The aim of this study is to examine longitudinal associations between BAT function and
      structure, liver adiposity and cardiovascular risk factors at baseline and during follow-up.

    <description>Brown adipose tissue activity is determined with FDG-PET imaging at baseline in 43 subjects and 5 years later the subjects participate a follow-up visit where lipoprotein levels are measured in mmol/l from serum samples. Correlation between brown adipose tissue activity and serum lipoproteins are examined with Pearson's correlation.</description>
