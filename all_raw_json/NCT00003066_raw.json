Determine the response rate, duration of response, duration of survival, and\n      quality of life effects of docetaxel and estramustine combination in women with metastatic\n      breast cancer.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients receive estramustine 3 times a day for 3 days. Docetaxel begins on day 3\n      after the a.m. dose of estramustine and is given as a 1 hour infusion intravenously. Courses\n      repeat every 21 days. If disease responds or is stable, treatment continues at the highest\n      tolerance percentage of prescribed dose until appearance of disease progression. If complete\n      response is documented, an additional 2 courses are given. Patients should receive a minimum\n      of 2 courses unless rapid progression or unacceptable toxicity occur. Patients are followed\n      monthly.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 40 patients will be accrued for this study."
