The alternate test arm will be allocated to a No\n      Intervention group and will be given no test products or instruction other than to change\n      none of their typical at home oral hygiene habits.\n\n      The aim of this study is to investigate how an AF and MTB oral hygiene intervention will\n      affect a population of irregular flossers using the residual protein concentration method as\n      an interproximal plaque efficacy assessment.  Gingivitis reduction will be assessed using\n      the Modified Gingival Index (MGI) and Gingival Bleeding Index (GBI) indices"
