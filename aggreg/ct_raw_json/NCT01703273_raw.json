One of the underlying reasons might be the\n      lack of adequate treatment options.\n\n      In this multicenter study, we aim to test a new, low key group intervention focusing on\n      improving compliance and psychosocial functioning. The study is a subproject of the Medical\n      and psychosocial implications of adolescent extreme obesity - acceptance and effects of\n      structured care, short: \"Youth with Extreme obesity Study (YES)\", which aims at improving\n      the medical care and social support structures for youth with obesity and extreme obesity in\n      Germany.\n\n      Obese youth and young adults (BMI \u2265 30kg/m2) between the ages of 14 and 21 years are\n      eligible to participate. Participants will be asked to complete a series of questionnaires\n      on their general health, psychosocial situation and wellbeing, and will be offered a\n      thorough medical evaluation. Individuals who complete the baseline evaluations will be\n      invited to participate in 6 group sessions over a 3 months period. Group assignment to the\n      psycho-social intervention vs. routine care group will be at random, like throwing a dice.\n      After 6 months, participants will complete further questionnaires to evaluate the effects of\n      the interventions on quality of life and psycho-social functionning.\n\n      The study will show the acceptance and effectiveness of a new intervention focusing on\n      improving compliance and psychosocial functioning in adolescents with extreme obesity, and\n      thereby inform the development of new treatment and support options for these adolescents.\n      If interested, participants are invited to participate in additional components of YES, and\n      to receive medical care and psycho-social support."

The underlying reasons are poorly understood, but\n      patient inherent factors and the lack of adequate treatment options may play a role.\n\n      In this multicenter study, we aim to assess the acceptance and effectiveness of a manual\n      based low key group intervention focusing on improving compliance and psychosocial\n      functioning in adolescents with morbid obesity (BMI\u226535kg/m2), in comparison to routine care.\n      Youth with more moderate degrees of obesity (BMI 30-34.9kg/m2) will serve as an additional\n      control group. The study is part of the Medical and psychosocial implications of adolescent\n      extreme obesity - acceptance and effects of structured care\", short: \"Youth with extreme\n      obesity Study (YES), which also comprises the recruitment and characterization of obese (BMI\n      30-34.9kg/m2) and extremely obese (BMI \u2265 35kg/m2) youth from different healthcare- and non\n      healthcare settings, a structured prospective evaluation of adolescent bariatric surgery,\n      economic assessments of the financial burden of extreme adolescent obesity on the healthcare\n      system, and a long-term prospective observation study.\n\n      Based on the current state of knowledge, we will test the a priori ordered hirarchy of\n      hypotheses:\n\n        1. The compliance rate 6 months after randomization is higher in subjects in the low key\n           intervention group compared to the standard care group.\n\n        2. Covariant-adjusted changes in quality of life (assessed by DISABKIDS scale) between\n           baseline and the 6 months follow up will be more pronounced in the low key intervention\n           group compared to the standard care group.\n\n      The five participating university centers are distributed across 4 geographic regions in the\n      North (Berlin), in the West (Essen/Datteln), in the East (Leipzig) and in the South (Ulm) of\n      Germany, and will therefore render data that are representative of Germany as a whole. We\n      will screen a 600 adolescents age 14 to 21 years with extreme obesity (BMI \u2265 35 kg/m2) and\n      600 adolescents with obesity (BMI 30-34.9 kg/m2) over a 24 months period. A total of 350\n      subjects will be enrolled. Baseline assessments include an array of standardized\n      questionnaires and validated instruments to assess health, psycho-social situation,\n      psychiatric co-morbidities and health related quality of life, as well as an in-depth\n      medical evaluation. Individuals who complete the baseline evaluations will be invited to\n      participate in 6 group sessions over a 3 months period. Group assignment to the low key\n      intervention vs. standard care group will be at random. The effects of the interventions on\n      health related quality of life and psycho-social functioning will be assessed via\n      questionnaires after 6 months. Subsequently, subjects will be invited to participate in\n      additional components of YES.\n\n      The project will reveal the effectiveness and safety of a manual based low key group\n      intervention focusing on improving compliance and psychosocial functioning in adolescents\n      with morbid obesity, and thereby inform the development of new treatment and support options\n      for these adolescents in Germany."
