At the same time, one of the most consistent factors of favourable post-treatment\n      outcome is treatment completion. In spite of the serious and continuous challenge dropout\n      represents the phenomena is not well understood and there is a need to explore more of the\n      factors that influence dropout and how it can be counteracted. As also stated: \"\u2026effective\n      methods for reducing the problem of dropouts from treatment is one more area in need of\n      further research\" (NOU 2003:4, s 77).\n\n      For the general field of mental health one of the most important innovations involves\n      providing therapists with patient feedback about their progress. The most well-established\n      and widely researched feedback system is the Outcome Questionnaire (OQ-45.2). The system has\n      been shown to improve treatment outcomes, including reduced treatment dropout and length of\n      treatment, but the system is yet to be utilized with a substance abusing patient group. The\n      aim of the present study is to examine the usefulness of OQ-45.2 with substance abusing\n      patients."

The condition were feedback is withheld from the therapist, will correctly identify\n      patients who will dropout.\n\n      Research Question: Is there variation in the accuracy of dropout prediction as a function of\n      age, gender differences or type of substance abuse?\n\n      2.   The OQ-45.2 feedback will be effective in reducing dropout in outpatient substance\n      abuse treatment.\n\n      2a. The feedback condition will result in less dropout than the no-feedback condition.\n\n      Research Question: Is there a variation in the OQ-45.2 preventive dropout effect due to age,\n      gender or type of substance abuse?\n\n      3.
