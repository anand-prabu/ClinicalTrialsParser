      This study is a Phase IIa, randomized, multi-site, two-arm, double-blinded study to evaluate
      the safety, tolerability, and acceptability of GSK1265744 long acting injectable formulation
      (744 LA) in adult male subjects.  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of the injectable
      agent, 744 LA (800 milligrams (mg) dose administered at three time points at 12 week
      intervals) through Week 41 in HIV-uninfected men.  Eligible participants will be randomized
      in a 5:1 ratio to receive 744 LA or matching placebo.  Participants will receive daily oral
      744 (30 mg tablets) or matching placebo for 4 weeks during the Oral Phase of the study,
      followed by a one week washout period.  Following safety lab assessments from the Oral
      Phase, participants will enter the Injection Phase and receive Intramuscular (IM) injections
      of 744 LA or placebo at three time points at 12 week intervals.  IM injections will consist
      of 800 mg of 744 or a matching control

             Investigator will interfere with study participation.

          -  History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof or a
             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or Medical
             Monitor, contraindicates their participation.

          -  Any of the following laboratory values during the screening period. Positive
             Hepatitis C antibody result Positive Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) Hemoglobin
             less than 11 gram (g)/deci liter (dL) Absolute neutrophil count less than 750

        QRS duration-greater than 120 msec. QTc interval (B or F)-greater than 450 msec. Evidence
        of previous myocardial infarction (does not include ST segment changes associated with

        branch block, AV block [2nd degree or higher], Wolf Parkinson White [WPW] syndrome).

        Sinus Pauses greater than 3 seconds. Any significant arrhythmia which, in the opinion of
        the principal investigator and medical monitor, will interfere with the safety for the
        individual subject.

        Non-sustained or sustained ventricular tachycardia (greater than or equal to 3 consecutive
        ventricular ectopic beats).

          -  Ongoing intravenous drug use - episodic use or any use in the past 90 days is
             exclusionary (as assessed by the study investigator).

          -  The subject has a tattoo or other dermatological condition overlying the gluteus
             region which may interfere with interpretation of ISRs.

          -  Use of high dose aspirin or any other anticoagulant or antiplatelet medication that
             would interfere with the ability to receive intramuscular injections.

          -  Active skin disease or disorder (i.e., infection, inflammation, dermatitis, eczema,
             drug rash, psoriasis, urticaria).  Mild cases of localized acne or folliculitis or
