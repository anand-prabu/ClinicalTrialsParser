  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Weight gained during pregnancy is referred to as gestational weight gain (GWG).  Excess GWG
      is a widespread problem that occurs in 55-75% of Canadian women who enter pregnancy
      overweight or obese (a group that represents over 50 % of all pregnant women) and about 40%
      women of normal weight. Excess GWG is associated with complications of pregnancy, such as
      post-partum weight retention, type 2 diabetes, elevated fats in the blood, and high blood
      pressure and may also lead to problems with the health of the newborn child.   Our research
      aims to find ways to control GWG by developing new and practical approaches to diet and
      exercise targeted to overweight pregnant women that hold promise of improving their health
      both during pregnancy and thereafter. The experimental intervention is a diet of higher
      protein provided by dairy foods combined with an exercise program modified to the abilities
      of overweight pregnant women; and the control is the usual advice given by their primary
      care providers, information on healthy pregnancy from Health Canada, and a focus group
      session exploring women's experiences with exercise, nutrition, and gestational weight gain.
      The results of this study will allow us to design future large clinical studies in all
      pregnant women to help control the weight gain in all pregnant women.

      This will be a 2-arm randomized 1-site trial. Recruitment will be within the community care
      clinics by poster and flyer advertisements.

      Primary research question: Among pregnant women, does introducing a structured and monitored
      nutrition and exercise program (treatment) in early pregnancy compared with Usual Prenatal
      Care (control) increase the likelihood of attaining gestational weight gain within the
      Institute of Medicine (IOM) guidelines over the pregnancy period?

      Experimental and Control groups: Both groups of mothers and their health care providers will
      be given the Health Canada materials on &quot;Healthy Weight Gain during Pregnancy&quot;, &quot;Eating Well
      with Canada's Food Guide&quot; and the &quot;Pregnancy Weight Gain Calculator&quot;. Baseline information
      will be recorded for eligible and consenting women after which they will be randomized to
      Experimental or Control group. Nutrition intake, physical measures and physical activity
      will be recorded at baseline, 26-28 weeks and 36-38 weeks of gestation and 6 months post
      partum in the same manner for both groups. All mothers will receive the study promotional
      materials and small incentives. Also, all mothers will be followed by their primary care
      provider and have usual access to Public Health.

    <description>Nutrition intervention: The proposed nutrition plan is a high protein (25% energy) diet providing low fat dairy foods and individualized to energy needs. Dairy foods are accepted by women during pregnancy as a healthy choice (from pilot study) and in our recent birth cohort study, women consumed an average of 3 or more servings of dairy per day.  Exercise intervention: In most previous studies and published guidance the focus has been on aerobic exercise. Walking is the easiest physical activity to undertake and also to implement in terms of setting goals of steps and monitoring of adherence using accelerometer-type devices as demonstrated in our previous studies. Walking was demonstrated most practical since women reduced moderate and vigorous physical activity during pregnancy but levels of walking were maintained.</description>
