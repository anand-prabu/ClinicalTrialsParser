  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During the first four days of life, intestinal fatty acid binding protein (iFABP) is
      elevated in the urine of premature babies who go on to develop necrotizing enterocolitis
      (NEC) days to weeks later.  This study aims to determine whether the withholding of feedings
      in babies with an elevated urinary iFABP can reduce the incidence of NEC.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Necrotizing enterocolits (NEC) occurs with an incidence of 3-7% in very low birth weight
      (&lt;1500g) infants and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Earlier
      detection of a subclinical prodrome in NEC might allow for the institution of measures that
      could prevent or attenuate the severity of disease.  We have demonstrated that levels of
      urinary intestinal fatty acid binding protein (iFABPu), a sensitive and specific marker for
      intestinal mucosal injury, were elevated in the first 4 days of life in all infants who
      subsequently developed NEC.  We hypothesize that, in the context of an elevated iFABPu in
      the neonatal period, a significant proportion of NEC cases could be averted by not
      initiating feedings.

      The proposed study will be a three-year prospective trial of iFABPu monitoring during the
      neonatal period in 220 infants of gestational age less than 33 weeks.  Urine will be
      collected in 12-hour aliquots over the first four days of life and the iFABPu will be
      measured.  On the afternoon of day of life four, infants in whom iFABPu exceeded 1000 pg/ml
      at any time will be continued with no feedings, iFABPu will continue to be measured, and
      trophic, breast milk feedings will only be initiated after iFABPu has normalized for five
      days.  Infants with non-elevated iFABPu over the first four days of life will have feedings
      initiated on day of life four, in the absence of other contraindications.  All subjects will
      have urine collected daily over their entire hospital stay for iFABPu assay.  However, after
      the active study period (after feedings have been initiated) iFABPu findings will not be
      communicated to the physicians caring for the subjects, but will be evaluated
      retrospectively in order to better define the utility of iFABPu as a marker for impending
      NEC later in newborn life.

      If iFABPu monitoring is shown to be effective in reducing the incidence of NEC it would
      revolutionize the care of premature infants by providing physicians with a tool that would
      permit feeding decisions to be based directly upon the viability of the intestine, rather
      than intuition.
