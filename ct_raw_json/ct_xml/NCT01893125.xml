    <textblock>
      To investigate the effect of repeat oral dosing of CNV2197944 75 mg tid on the pain
      experienced in diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) as measured by changes in PI-NRS after
      three weeks of treatment compared to the baseline period.

    <textblock>
      A 3 week randomised crossover study to investigate the effect of repeat oral dosing of
      CNV2197944 75 mg tid versus placebo for on the pain experienced in diabetic peripheral
      neuropathy (DPN). Each 3 week treatment period is seperated by a 2 week washout period. The
      primary outcome measure is the change from baseline in the PI-NRS after three weeks of
      treatment. Secondary outcome measures include pain responder rates, clinical and patient
      global impressions of pain, and the Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory.
