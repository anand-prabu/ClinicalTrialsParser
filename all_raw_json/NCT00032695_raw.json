With prolonged survival and improved quality of life of\n      HIV-infected patients, myelopathy is increasingly becoming a common source of disability.\n      The cause of AIDS-myelopathy is unknown, but it is probably an indirect effect of the\n      long-term presence of the HIV virus in the nervous system rather than the result of a direct\n      infection.   The purpose of this study is to determine whether methionine, an amino acid\n      present in low doses in the normal diet, can improve myelopathy or stop its progression."
