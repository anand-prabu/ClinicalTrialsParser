They will be randomized after\n      stratification of the Yang-Xu score and the AMS history to receive Chinese medicine during\n      one ascent and placebo during the other ascent. We will take them in Hehuan mountain for two\n      days hike (24 hours) and an overnight over 3,000m. One month before the study, the subjects\n      will fill the \"Body Constitution Questionnaire BCQ\" in order to evaluate their body\n      constitution. Before, during and after the two days hike we will measure their blood\n      pressure, heart rate and arterial oxygen saturation. The incidence of AMS will be measured\n      by the Lake Louise Self Report (Lake Louise Score \u22654 with headache), we will also report the\n      Lake Louise Clinical Assessment score and Lake Louise Functional Score."
