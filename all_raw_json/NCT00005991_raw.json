Determine the objective response rate, duration of response, time to disease progression,\n      and duration of survival of women with metastatic breast cancer when treated with\n      gemcitabine and doxorubicin HCl liposome.\n\n      II. Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxicity and reversibility of toxicity of\n      this treatment regimen in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients receive gemcitabine intravenous (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8 and\n      doxorubicin HCl liposome IV over 2.5 hours on day 1. Treatment continues every 21 days in\n      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed at 3\n      weeks.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 22-46 patients will be accrued for this study within 20\n      months."
