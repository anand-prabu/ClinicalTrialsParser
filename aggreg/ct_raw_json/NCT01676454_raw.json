Even some moribund patients with \"irreversible\" shock survived severe\n      hemorrhagic shock after administration of vasopressin.  This suggests that at least some\n      patients suffering severe trauma could benefit from AAVP administration.  Recently, many\n      clinicians and notable research consortiums have suggested that AVP shows promise for human\n      resuscitation and have called for further human studies.\n\n      This is a prospective, single-center observational study designed to evaluate (1) whether\n      vasopressin is depleted in severe, but not minor, trauma; and (2) the degree to which\n      endogenous vasopressin levels predict the occurrence of ARDS, sepsis, or death.   To test\n      the first hypothesis, serum vasopressin levels (continuous independent variable) will be\n      assessed at enrollment (time 0), 6, 12, 18, and 24 hours later, and correlated with the two\n      levels of trauma (categorical dependent variable).  To test the second hypothesis, serum\n      vasopressin levels (now a continuous dependent variable) will be correlated with each of\n      three outcomes-death, ARDS, and sepsis."
