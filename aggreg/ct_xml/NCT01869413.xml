  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A cystectomy is the removal of the bladder and adjacent organs in patients with bladder
      cancer. This often results in significant blood loss, and about 60% of patients will require
      a blood transfusion during or up to 30 days after surgery. Significant blood loss may result
      in cardiovascular morbidity, and the use of blood products are expensive and expose patients
      to risk.

      Tranexamic acid reduces breakdown of hemostatic blood clots and it has therapeutic benefit
      when used in other surgical procedures to reduce blood loss and the need for transfusion.
      The current study will be the first to evaluate whether tranexamic acid is effective and
      safe to use during radical cystectomy. The results of the study will have an immediate
      impact on patient care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Removal of the bladder and adjacent organs in patients with bladder cancer (radical
      cystectomy) often results in significant blood loss, and approximately 60% of patients
      require peri-operative blood transfusion. Reducing blood loss and the frequency of
      transfusion offers several benefits, including donor blood conservation, health care cost
      reduction, and avoidance of blood product exposure. Tranexamic acid is an amino acid lysine
      derivative with strong antifibrinolytic clotting properties that can be administered
      systemically. This medication has been used in a variety of operative procedures, notably in
      high risk cardiac surgery, to decrease peri-operative blood loss, and it is associated with
      an acceptable risk of adverse events. Systemic anti-hemorrhagics are infrequently used
      during radical cystectomy, and to the investigators knowledge their effects have not been
      evaluated in a clinical trial.

      Overall objective: To conduct an internal pilot study to determine feasibility of a
      randomized controlled trial of systemic tranexamic acid compared to placebo in reducing the
      number of blood transfusions in patients undergoing radical cystectomy for bladder cancer.

      Design: An internal pilot study, employing the protocol of the full multi-center,
      randomized, double-blinded, placebo controlled trial.

      Study population: Consenting patients 18 years of age and older undergoing a radical
      cystectomy for bladder cancer, excluding those who: are unwilling to receive blood products
      due to personal reasons, are pregnant, have active angina, have a known allergy to
      tranexamic acid, or have a known personal history of deep venous thrombosis, atrial
      fibrillation, coronary stent, sub-arachnoid hemorrhage, pulmonary embolism, thrombotic
      stroke and / or acquired disturbance of colour vision. The pilot study will recruit the
      first 55 patients of 354 patients required for the full study from Dalhousie University,
      McGill University, Université de Montreal, Université Laval, University of Ottawa,
      University of Western Ontario and University of Alberta.

      Intervention:

      Tranexamic Acid arm: Tranexamic acid will be administered as an intravenous infusion of 10
      mg/kg over 10 minutes (loading dose) before surgical incision, followed by 5 mg/kg/hour
      continuous maintenance infusion for the length of surgery (typically 4 to 8 hours). For
      example, an 80 kg patient would receive 800 mg prior to incision and a 400 mg/hour infusion
      for the duration of surgery. For a 6 hour procedure, the total dose administered would be
      3200 mg.

      Placebo arm: As there is no standard of care concerning administration of antifibrinolytic
      agents in cystectomy procedures, controls will follow the same dosing and schedule described
      above, but with 0.9% saline infusion.

      Outcomes: The principal research questions for the investigators internal pilot (current
      application) pertain to feasibility of enrollment of cystectomy patients using the full RCT
      protocol of tranexamic acid vs. placebo. The pilot will address feasibility of site-specific
      enrollment, feasibility of multiple site start-ups, and feasibility of institutional ethics
      approval, protocol administration, and multicenter coordination.

      The primary research objective for the investigators full RCT is whether the use of systemic
      tranexamic acid compared to placebo reduces the proportion of radical cystectomy patients
      requiring red blood cell transfusion up to 30 days post-operative (from a 50% transfusion
      rate with placebo to 35% with tranexamic acid). Secondary questions for the investigators
      full trial are: Will use of systemic tranexamic acid compared to placebo result in
      reductions in: i) intraoperative blood loss, ii) amounts of transfused blood products, and
      iii) post-operative complications? The safety (thrombotic events) of tranexamic acid will
      also be evaluated.

      Importance of this study: A successful pilot will encourage us to continue with the full RCT
      that will determine whether tranexamic acid reduces blood loss and subsequent transfusions
      during radical cystectomy. If tranexamic acid reduces the number of blood transfusions,
      there will be an immediate impact to cystectomy patients, and surgeons may consider the
      routine use of systemic tranexamic acid during similar abdomino-pelvic procedures associated
      with significant blood loss.
