      The purpose of this study is to assess the effects of administration of daratumumab when
      combined with VELCADE (bortezomib) and dexamethasone compared with bortezomib and
      dexamethasone alone, for participants with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label (physicians and participants know the identity of the assigned
      treatment), randomized (the study medication is assigned by chance), multicenter,
      active-controlled study comparing daratumumab, VELCADE, and dexamethasone (DVd) with VELCADE
      and dexamethasone (Vd) in participants with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.
      Approximately 480 participants will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either
      DVd or Vd. Randomization will be stratified by International Staging System (ISS), number of
      prior treatment programs (1 vs. 2 or 3 vs. &gt;3), and prior VELCADE treatment (&quot;no&quot; vs.
      &quot;yes&quot;). Within each stratum, participants will be randomized to one of the treatment
      groups.The study will consist of a Screening Phase, a Treatment Phase, and a Follow-up
      Phase. Participants will be treated until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or
      other reasons to discontinue the study.
