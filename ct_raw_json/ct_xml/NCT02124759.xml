  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of high fat consumption on the
      intestinal microbiome, metabolic endotoxemia, and insulin action, in lean normal glucose
      tolerant subjects.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will test the hypothesis that a high fat diet given to lean, normal glucose tolerant
      subjects will modify gut microbiome composition and enhance intestinal permeability, which
      will increase plasma LPS concentration, induce an inflammatory response in peripheral
      tissues (skeletal muscle), and impair insulin signaling and sensitivity. Also we will test
      the hypothesis that the inflammatory response and insulin resistance caused by high fat
      ingestion can be ameliorated by administering

        -  a synbiotic (bifidobacterium and oligofructose) which protects the intestinal
           epithelial barrier and decreases intestinal translocation of LPS; and

        -  sevelamer, an agent which sequesters LPS in the gastrointestinal tract limiting its
           translocation into the circulation.
