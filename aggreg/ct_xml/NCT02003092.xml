  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this dose-finding, open-label, single-agent study of RX-5902, subjects will be treated
      for up to 6 cycles of therapy. RX-5902 will be administered orally once a week for 3 weeks
      followed by 1 week of rest in each cycle. All subjects will be followed for at least 30 days
      after the last dose of study agent for safety.
