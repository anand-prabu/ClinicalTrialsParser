This feasibility study\n      is intended to provide proof of concept in the incorporation of monitoring devices within\n      the PHR for pediatric patients and their families. Additionally, the investigators will\n      examine whether the PHR helps to empower pediatric patients, their families and the health\n      care team to more effectively monitor the patient's behavior change. Participants will be\n      randomized to receive, or not receive, augmented communication with the health care team\n      between clinical in person visits."

Consensus on the need for comprehensive, behavioural interventions\n      exists, but the nature of these interventions vary considerably. The intensity of the\n      intervention (i.e. number of contact hours) may be a key determinant of efficacy, but little\n      detail on the characteristic of these contact hours for optimal delivery is currently\n      available.\n\n      In this proof of concept study, we will evaluate the enhancement of behavioural change\n      strategies utilizing technology that provides direct feedback on behaviour change. These\n      devices will be incorporated into a PHR and supplemented with a related e-learning module.\n\n      This study will examine the feasibility and perceived usefulness of incorporation of a\n      personal electronic device to encourage behaviour change in children and youth enrolled in a\n      weight management program. We intend to incorporate this device within an established PHR\n      and supplement with evidence-based e-learning.\n\n      This is a prospective, randomized pilot study of children and youth (ages 5-17 years)\n      enrolled in a multidisciplinary pediatric weight management program (at McMaster Children's\n      Hospital) for 4 months. This pilot study will include 10 children/youth and parent dyads\n      from each of 3 age groups: 5-9 years, 10-13 years and 14-17 years. All families will utilize\n      a personal electronic device that they can utilize with the individualized PHR. Participants\n      will be randomized to receive, or not receive, regular communication with and access to the\n      clinical team outside of their routine clinical visits, this will occur through a secure\n      portal in the PHR."
