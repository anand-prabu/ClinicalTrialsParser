We evaluate the effect of warm-up exercises on\n      operative laparoscopic performances in gynecologic laparoscopic procedures.\n\n      Methods: The surgical team operates on a consecutive series of 20 patients and perform\n      laparoscopic salpingo-oophorectomy. Patients are randomly allocated in 2 groups: group A to\n      be operated on without warm-up exercises and group B to be operated on after a short-term\n      warm-up. All patients are operated on by the same surgical team. The full-time records of\n      the operation were analyzed by 2 independent reviewers.  Laparoscopic procedures are\n      recorded and assessed by 2 independent observers using the generic OSATS rating scale. A\n      training module using the Lap Sim simulator was designed for the warm-up."
