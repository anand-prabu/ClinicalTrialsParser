      This is local prospective multicenter observational non-interventional local study. Primary
      study objective is investigate and describe prescription pattern of neurologists in
      secondary stroke or non-CNS (non-Central Nervous System) systemic embolism prevention in
      patients with AF (Atrial fibrillation) and prior stroke or TIA (Transient Ischemic attack)
      who treat with rivaroxaban at an initial visit and three follow-up visits.
