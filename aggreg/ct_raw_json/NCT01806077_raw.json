Aspirin is allowed.\n\n          -  The subject has previous history of anaphylaxis to drugs or any environmental stimuli\n             including foods or hymenoptera (e.g., ants, bees, wasps) stings.\n\n          -  Asthma requiring bronchodilator/inhaler therapy.\n\n          -  Currently smoking \u22652 pack/day.\n\n          -  Herbal supplements (i.e., Fish Oil/Omega-3, St. John's Wart, Ginseng, Garlic, Ginkgo,\n             Saw Palmetto, Echinacea, Yohimbine, Licorice, and Black Cohosh) are prohibited from 1\n             week prior to dosing through 24 hours post dosing.\n\n          -  Prior history or clinical suspicion of cerebral vascular malformations, intracranial\n             tumor, transient ischemic attack, stroke, gastric ulcers and any form of bleeding\n             disorder.\n\n          -  Prior history of myocardial infarction within the last 3 months or unstable angina.\n\n          -  Thrombocytopenia defined as a platelet count of <130,000/mm3 or low hematocrit\n             defined as <30%.\n\n          -  Renal function:  serum creatinine >1.5 x ULN. However, subjects with an estimated\n             creatinine clearance eGFR \u226560 mL/min, calculated using the Cockcroft-Gault formula,\n             are eligible.\n\n          -  Liver enzymes \u2265 3 x upper limit of normal.\n\n          -  Alcohol consumption within 48 hrs prior to dosing, and for the duration of the\n             in-house study period.\n\n          -  Evidence of history of substance or alcohol abuse at screening, including positive\n             urine test results for drugs or positive breath test for alcohol.\n\n          -  Uncontrolled hypertension or hypotension defined as a sustained supine systolic\n             pressure >160 mmHg or <100 mmHg; or a diastolic pressure >90 mmHg or < 50 mmHg.\n\n          -  International normalized ratio (INR) >1.5\n\n          -  Poor venous access (i.e., insufficient for intravenous drug delivery).\n\n          -  History of hepatitis or HIV.\n\n          -  The subject has undergone an invasive surgical procedure within the last 3 months, is\n             anticipating one during the course of their study participation or is planning to\n             have one within 1 month post dosing with the study drug.\n\n          -  The subject has any condition which could interfere with or for which the treatment\n             might interfere with the conduct of the study, or which would, in the opinion of the\n             Investigator increase the risk of the subject's participation in the study.  This\n             would include, but is not limited to alcoholism, drug dependency or abuse,\n             psychiatric disease, epilepsy or any unexplained blackouts, previous hypersensitivity\n             to drugs, and severe asthma."
