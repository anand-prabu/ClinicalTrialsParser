  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study hypothesis is informing patients that they are given the antidepressant drug
      because of their dyspepsia symptoms when prescribing would receive best compliance to the
      antidepressant drug.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Antidepressive agents have been proved to be effective in the treatment of functional
      dyspepsia (FD) patients. However, one of the factors that limit therapeutic benefit is the
      poor compliance with prescribed drugs. The possible reasons for lack of compliance include
      the patient's health beliefs (e.g., that people who took such agents is possibly considered
      insane in China), lack of knowledge about antidepressants (that they are addictive or can be
      stopped on recovery), and aversion to side effects. The investigators propose to examine
      whether different prescribing behaviors could affect adherence to antidepressant drugs in
      functional dyspepsia patients.

    <description>At each visit (weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12), the patient bring back the drug bottle, then the physician recorded the number of pills remaining in the bottle. Patients were categorized as compliant if they returned less than 20%. Pills remained more than 20% or seven days of consecutive abstinence were adopted as the criterion for identifying therapy noncompliance.</description>

    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Dyspepsia symptoms were evaluated with a self-recorded questionnaire at baseline and each visit. The symptom questionnaire consisted of 8 questions related to upper gastrointestinal tract symptoms: belching, bloating, early satiety, epigastric pain, burning, nausea, postprandial fullness and vomiting . They were rated according to 4 grades: 0 = absent, 1 = mild (do not affect work or life), 2 = middle (affect work and life) and 3 = severe (cannot endure). The symptom scores were calculated as severity grade Ã— frequency per week.</description>
