  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of the study is to investigate the effects of high-dose octreotide on
      flushing, diarrhea, and quality of life in patients whose disease-related symptoms are
      inadequately controlled by the maximum approved dose of octreotide LAR.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study population will consist of patients with advanced (metastatic or unresectable)
      neuroendocrine tumors with suboptimally controlled carcinoid syndrome. While the majority of
      patients will have primary tumors of the ileocecum (midgut), any serotonin-producing
      neuroendocrine tumors will be eligible (including pancreatic, lung and unknown primary).

      All patients will be followed for adverse events and serious adverse events for 28 days
      following the last dose of above-label octreotide, or until resolution or stabilization of
      the event, whichever comes first.

    <description>The frequencies of flushing, diarrhea, and carcinoid syndrome control rating (scale 1-5) will be measured and compared. These measurements will be compared using two-sided non-parametric paired Wilcoxon signed-rank test controlling type I error at 0.05 based on 2000 Monte Carlo simulations.</description>

    <description>Progression-free survival, defined as the time from the date of first study treatment to the date of the first documented disease progression, by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1) or death due to any cause.  Progressive disease (PD): at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum longest diameter recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Metastatic neuroendocrine tumors that are considered well or moderately
             differentiated (or low to intermediate grade). Patients with poorly differentiated
             neuroendocrine carcinomas or small cell carcinomas are excluded from the study.

          -  Elevated urine 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA)

          -  More than 2 bowel-movements per day OR more than 4 flushing episodes per week on
             average

          -  Patient currently on octreotide LAR 30mg every 3 or 4 weeks (for at least 3 cycles
             prior to screening)

          -  Age ≥ 18 years

          -  Minimum of four weeks since any major surgery, liver-directed therapy (embolization,
             etc.) or systemic cancer treatment other than octreotide LAR

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤2

          -  Life expectancy &gt; 12 weeks

          -  Reliable contraception should be maintained throughout the study and for 3 months
             after study drug discontinuation.

          -  Signed informed consent to participate in the study must be obtained from patients
             after they have been fully informed of the nature and potential risks by the
             investigator (or his/her designee) with the aid of written information.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known hypersensitivity to somatostatin analogues

          -  Patients with poorly differentiated neuroendocrine cancers

          -  Patients with liver cirrhosis

          -  Patients receiving hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis

          -  Patients with cachexia who, in the opinion of the investigator, may have difficulty
             tolerating intramuscular injection

          -  Patients with symptomatic cholelithiasis or biliary events within past five years
             (who have not undergone cholecystectomy)

          -  Patients with recent history (within 5 years) of pancreatitis

          -  Patients with uncontrolled diabetes (HgA1c &gt;8.0 despite adequate therapy)

          -  Women of child-bearing potential, UNLESS they are using two birth control methods

          -  Women who are pregnant or lactating

          -  HIV positive patients

          -  History of sustained ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, advanced
             heart block, idiopathic syncope thought to be related to ventricular arrhythmia, or
             congenital long QT syndrome

          -  Risk factors for Torsades de Pointes such as cardiac failure, clinically
             significant/symptomatic bradycardia

          -  Patients who have any severe and/or uncontrolled medical conditions or other
             conditions that could affect their participation in the study

          -  History of noncompliance to medical regimens or unwillingness to comply with the
             protocol

          -  Patients who were unable to tolerate or did not benefit from above-label dose
             octreotide (&gt;30mg) in the past

          -  Concomitant use of other cancer treatments or carcinoid syndrome treatments (whether
             standard or experimental). Patients should discontinue any concomitant cancer
             medications more than two weeks prior to screening.
