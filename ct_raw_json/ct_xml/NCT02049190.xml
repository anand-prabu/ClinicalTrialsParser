  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate an extended-release (ER) formulation of onapristone in patients
      with prostate cancer in which Progesterone Receptor (PR) may be contributing to tumor
      progression. A companion diagnostic to select patients whose prostate cancer expresses the
      activated form of the PR (APR) is under development and will be implemented in this study;
      it may be used to further enrich the selection of the population based upon ongoing review
      of the results. Patients will be treated until occurrence of an intolerable safety issue,
      treatment failure, if patient elects to withdraw, or for non-compliance with either
      protocol-specified evaluations or onapristone treatment. An additional cohort of patients
      will be included at the recommended phase 2 dose to gain additional understanding of the
      onapristone safety profile and potential anti-cancer activity.
