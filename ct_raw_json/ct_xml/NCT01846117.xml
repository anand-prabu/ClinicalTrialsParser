  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are investigating whether the flax lignan, secoisolariciresinol
      diglucoside, decreases oxidative stress and inflammation. The flax seed lignan is believed
      to be broken down in the body to produce the health benefits of flax.  Flax lignan is
      separated from the whole flax seed as this compound is believed to have health effects.
      Decreasing oxidative stress and inflammation should improve a number of the problems
      associated with aging. This intervention consists of 600 milligrams of the flax lignan SDG
      daily or an equivalent amount of whey protein.

      The investigators are comparing lignan to a placebo (whey powder) to examine whether a
      dietary intervention (i.e. flax seed containing lignan) might decrease oxidative stress and
      inflammation.
