  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many tumor cells, in contrast to normal cells, have been shown to require the amino acid
      glutamine to produce energy for growth and survival.  To exploit the dependence of tumors on
      glutamine, CB-839, a potent and selective inhibitor of the first enzyme in glutamine
      utilization, glutaminase, will be tested in this Phase 1 study in patients with solid
      tumors.

      This study is an open-label Phase 1 evaluation of CB-839 in patients with advanced solid
      tumors.  The study will be conducted in 2 parts.  Part 1 is a dose escalation study
      enrolling patients with locally-advanced, metastatic and/or refractory solid tumors to
      receive CB-839 capsules orally three times daily.  In Part 2, patients with each of the
      following diseases will be enrolled: A) Triple-Negative Breast Cancer, B) Non-Small Cell
      Lung Cancer (adenocarcinoma), C) Renal Cell Cancer, and D) Mesothelioma.  All patients will
      be assessed for safety, pharmacokinetics (plasma concentration of drug), pharmacodynamics
      (inhibition of glutaminase), biomarkers (biochemical markers that may predict responsiveness
      in later studies), and tumor response.
