Of those enrolled in the study,\n      approximately eight (8) subjects will have mild to moderate symptoms and signs of dry eye\n      syndrome and approximately eight (8) subject will not have signs or symptoms of dry eye\n      syndrome.\n\n      On Visit IB, subjects will have VA and biomicroscopy performed. A basal tear sample of\n      approximately 5 \u00b5L will be collected via capillary tubes from the outer canthus of each eye\n      and stored on dry ice then placed in a -80c \u00b1 10\u00b0C freezer for storage. Photographic\n      assessments of the ocular surface may be taken. After waiting 5 minutes for the tear film to\n      stabilize, tear osmolarity may be measured in each eye.\n\n      Prior to entered the low humidity Environmental Exposure Chamber (EEC), subjects will be\n      asked to fill out their baseline symptoms. Subjects will then enter and remain in the EEC\n      for approximately 180 minutes and symptom diary cards will be completed after entry at\n      pre-specified timepoints. Throughout the EEC visit, subjects will be asked to complete\n      visual tasks on a digital screen to ensure the ocular surface is exposed to the airflow and\n      humidity levels in the room.\n\n      After approximately 180 minutes of exposure to dry eye conditions, prior to exiting chamber,\n      basal tears will be collected via capillary tubes for each eye and stored on dry ice then\n      placed in a -80\u00b0C \u00b1 10\u00b0C freezer for storage. Photographic assessments of the ocular surface\n      may be taken. After waiting 5 minutes for the tear film to stabilize, tear osmolarity may be\n      measured for each eye.\n\n      After exiting the EEC, subjects will remain in the medical clinic for an additional 60\n      minutes and will continue to conduct visual tasks during this period. Symptom diary cards\n      will then be completed at pre-specified time points after leaving the EEC.\n\n      Following 60 minutes in the clinic and prior to study exit, a final collection of basal\n      tears via capillary tubes will be taken and stored on dry ice and then placed in a -80\u00b0C \u00b1\n      10\u00b0C freezer for storage. Once again photographic assessments may be taken. Biomicroscopy\n      will be performed.\n\n      The tear samples collected before and after exposure to the chamber will be taken from\n      (-80\u00b0C) freezer storage and packaged on dry ice for shipment to the University of Waterloo\n      Centre for Contact Lens Research (CCLR) for analysis. A variety of proteins and cytokines\n      will be analyzed."
