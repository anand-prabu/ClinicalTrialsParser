All patients initially receive the same\n      dose of defibrotide IV over 2 hours every 6 hours on day 1. On day 2, patients are\n      randomized to 1 of 2 doses of defibrotide.\n\n        -  Arm I: On days 2-14, patients receive a lower dose of defibrotide IV over 2 hours every\n           6 hours.\n\n        -  Arm II: On days 2-14, patients receive a higher dose of defibrotide IV over 2 hours\n           every 6 hours.\n\n      In both arms, courses repeat every 14 days in the absence of disease progression or\n      unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 140 patients (70 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this\n      study."
