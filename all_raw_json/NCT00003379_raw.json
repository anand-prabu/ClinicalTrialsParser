Paclitaxel and\n      cisplatin may increase the effectiveness of radiation therapy by making the tumor cells more\n      sensitive to radiation. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells\n      from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining radiation therapy with chemotherapy may\n      kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of radiation therapy to the pelvis plus\n      paclitaxel and cisplatin in treating patients who have cervical cancer."

Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour immediately followed by cisplatin\n      concurrently with pelvic field radiotherapy on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, and 36. Patients\n      undergo low-dose rate (LDR) OR high-dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy. For patients undergoing\n      LDR brachytherapy, intracavitary implants are inserted 1 or 2 times within 3 weeks after\n      completion of external beam RT. For patients undergoing HDR brachytherapy, intracavitary\n      implants are inserted once a week for 5 weeks beginning during week 4 of external beam RT.\n      Patients may receive a parametrial boost.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of paclitaxel until the maximum tolerated\n      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2\n      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, additional\n      patients are accrued and treated at the MTD as above.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then\n      annually thereafter or at time of recurrence until death.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study within 3-7\n      years."
