            "textblock": "About one third of patients with hormone-receptor (HR)-positive, HER2-normal breast cancer\n      and residual disease after neoadjuvant chemotherapy have a substantial risk of relapse. The\n      clinical-pathologic stage - estrogen/grade (CPS-EG)  combining clinical stage before\n      neoadjuvant treatment, pathological stage after neoadjuvant treatment, grading and\n      estrogen-receptor status can be used to identify these high-risk patients. The CPS-EG score\n      was additionally validated in 2453 patients with HR-positive/HER2-normal tumors from the\n      German neoadjuvant studies' meta-database. 24% of these patients had a score of 3 or higher\n      and showed a 3-years DFS of 74% despite adequate local therapy and adjuvant endocrine\n      treatment.\n\n      Cyclin dependent kinases (CDK), a group of serine/threonine kinases, play a key role in\n      regulating cell cycle progression by interacting with specific cyclin proteins in\n      luminal-type tumors. , PD-0332991 (palbociclib) is an oral, highly selective inhibitor of\n      CDK4/6 kinase activity that prevents cellular DNA synthesis by prohibiting progression of\n      the cell cycle from G1 to S phase through blocking retinoblastoma (Rb) phosphorylation.\n      Preclinical studies identified luminal ER subtype, elevated expression of cyclin D1 and Rb\n      protein, and reduced p16 expression as being associated with sensitivity to palbociclib.\n\n      The PENELOPEB study is designed to demonstrate that in the background of standard\n      anti-hormonal therapy palbociclib provides superior invasive disease-free survival (iDFS)\n      compared to placebo in pre- and postmenopausal women with HR-positive/HER2-normal early\n      breast cancer at high risk of relapse after showing less than pathological complete response\n      to neoadjuvant taxane- containing chemotherapy. Considering the high risk of recurrence in\n      patients after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and a high CPS-EG score, palbociclib appears to be\n      an attractive option with a favourable safety profile for these patients."

In case of bilateral\n             breast cancer status has to be confirmed for both sides.\n\n          6. Centrally assessed Ki-67, pRB, and Cyclin D1 status assessed preferably on\n             post-neoadjuvant residual invasive disease of the breast, or if not possible, of\n             residual nodal invasion.\n\n          7.

Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory\n             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or\n             investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of\n             study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the patient\n             inappropriate for entry into this study.\n\n         11.
