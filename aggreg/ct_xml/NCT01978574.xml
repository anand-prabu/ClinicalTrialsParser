  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive problems are a primary concern for people with multiple sclerosis. In many cases,
      people with MS report these issues to be more debilitating than the motor symptoms that are
      targeted by most treatment strategies. For people with MS, impaired memory and thinking
      skills can interfere with the ability to function efficiently in multiple professional and
      personal roles. Finding ways to decrease, slow, or reverse declines in memory and thinking
      skills is a vitally important research priority. We now know that engaging in intellectually
      enriching activities helps protect against the negative impact of MS disease-related
      declines in memory and thinking. Such activities contribute to something called 'cognitive
      reserve,' which serves as a protection against disease-related declines in memory and
      thinking. Thus far, no one has created a treatment that aims to provide a concentrated
      'dose' of intellectual enrichment to build cognitive reserve. The present intervention aims
      to do precisely this. Here, we have developed a program of enriching activities that are
      delivered via a personal iPad. This allows for a 12-week 'treatment' that is entirely
      home-based, while also providing close personal contact between participants and our study
      personnel, who will communicate daily via emails. Week by week, participants choose from a
      menu of intellectually enriching activities such that their treatment is dynamic and
      customizable to fit their interests. The intervention is designed to be fun, as we hope the
      activities will be incorporated into people's lives beyond the period of the study itself.
      Given what we already know about the striking benefits of cognitive reserve to protect
      against disease-related declines in cognitive functioning, we expect to show that treatment
      with a daily, intense, intellectually enriching schedule of activities results in improved
      thinking and memory for people with MS. We will also investigate the positive impact of our
      treatment on the brains of people with MS through brain scans. We expect to see evidence for
      a shift toward more efficient processing in the brain, changes that translate to improved
      memory and thinking skills.
