      INTRODUCTION: Vascular ulcers are an important pathology in the daily medical practice in
      all the assistance levels, and they have big repercussion referring to individual, social
      and labour levels, supposing a big consumption of human and material resources.The cure with
      autologous platelet rich plasma (autologous PRP) has demonstrated in different studies a
      decrease in the cicatrization time comparing to conventional methods in hospital levels,
      which becomes interesting contrasting its efficacy in primary care.

      AIM:Evaluate the practicability, security and potential of the autologous PRP in the
      treatment of vascular ulcers, comparing to the conventional treatment ( cure with humid
      environment), in primary care patients with chronic venous insufficiency in C-6 degree (CEAP
      classification).

      DESIGN:A pilot study will be executed, which will consist in a randomized clinical test,
      multicentred, in parallel groups and opened. 40 patients suffering of venous vascular ulcers
      will be studied, who will be between the age of 40-80 years old, and who will be attached to
      five health centers. Variables for the identification, following, result and patient profile
      have been defined. Emphasize the variables of &quot;ulcer area decreasing&quot;, &quot;CIVIQ index&quot;, &quot;% one
      cure per week&quot; .

    <description>PRP treatment of vascular ulcers one a week PRP: a volume of 9-30 ml of blood will be collected from the patient (depending of the size of their ulcer) in sterile 4.5-ml tubes containing 3.8% sodium citrate, which will bind to the calcium ions, preventing clot formation we will add 50 μl of CaCl2 per ml liquid plasma. The extraction of the PRP fraction by sticking with a syringe and the adding of CaCl2 should be performed under sterile conditions.</description>

    <description>Patients in the control group will be treated following the recommendations of the Ezkerraldea-Enkarterri Health Region, that is, using a moist healing environment (as described in &quot;Uso racional de los productos de cura en ambiente húmedo. Plan de formación continuada de Osakidetza&quot;, 2011).
The type of material used to treat and dress the wound will be chosen after the assessment of the wound and surrounding skin, type and quantity of exudate and whether there are signs of infection. Wound care will be carried out every 48-72 hours, as is the current usual practice.</description>
