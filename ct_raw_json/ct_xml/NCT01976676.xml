  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent data indicates that 5 methyltetrahydrofolate (5MTHF) can reduce serum homocystein
      level more efficiently than folic acid. On the other hand, folic acid is currently an
      important part of treatment in idiopathic recurrent abortion. There is no study comparing
      the effectiveness of these supplements in the treatment of recurrent abortion. The aim of
      this study is to compare the efficiency of these two agents in the treatment of recurrent
      abortion. In this study, patients with idiopathic recurrent abortion, referring to Avicenna
      clinic will be randomly allocated into two groups of those taking either folic acid (5 mg)
      or 5 MTHF (5mg) from 8 weeks prior to conception until the 20th week of pregnancy. The serum
      level of folate, homocystein, and ongoing pregnancy will be analysed and compared in the two
      groups.
