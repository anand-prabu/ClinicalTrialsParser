Up to 700 consenting\n      sexually active, HIV-uninfected women aged 18 years and older who previously participated in\n      an antiretroviral (ARV) prevention study will be enrolled and followed for a maximum 30\n      months. All women will be provided with 1% tenofovir gel but will be randomised to either\n      receive their gel through a public sector family planning services with 2-3 monthly\n      provision (intervention arm) or through the CAPRISA research clinics with monthly provision\n      (control arm).\n\n      All women in the trial will be provided with the standard package of HIV prevention and\n      reproductive health services. Participants in both study arms will be provided with a supply\n      of single-use, pre-filled applicators of 1% tenofovir gel. While in the study, participants\n      will be advised and supported to follow the CAPRISA 004 pre- and post-dosing strategy,\n      namely BAT24, where the first dose of tenofovir gel is applied within 12 hours before\n      anticipated coitus and a second dose as soon as possible but within 12 hours after coitus,\n      with a maximum of two doses of gel in a 24-hour period.\n\n      The primary objective of this trial is to assess the effectiveness of an implementation\n      model for tenofovir gel provision through family planning services."
