SMT involves the use of a high velocity low amplitude thrust technique.45 However, for the purpose of this study we will allow the use of other types of MT, including non-thrust spinal mobilization and flexion-distraction technique. Allowing the use of a broader scope of manual therapy techniques reflects a more \"real world\" clinical intervention commonly performed by practitioners of chiropractic, osteopathy, and physical therapy. In addition to the use of these manual therapies, we have also allowed for the study chiropractor to provide instruction in home stretching exercises."

Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for pain management has three basic components. The first is a treatment rationale that helps patients understand that cognitions and behavior can affect the pain experience and emphasizes the role that patients can play in controlling their own pain. The second component of CBT-p is coping skills training. Training is provided in wide variety of cognitive and behavioral pain coping strategies. The third component of CBT-p involves the application and maintenance of learned coping skills. During this phase of treatment, patients are encouraged to apply their coping skills to a progressively wider range of daily situations."

Patient reported outcome measurement information system has developed a quality of life tool that provides an overall index score for quality of life. The main advantage of the PROMIS measures over other static health status measures is that the PROMIS domain item banks and scores allow flexibility in administration using either targeted short forms or computerized adaptive testing.
