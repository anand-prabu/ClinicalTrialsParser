  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and effectiveness of 2 doses of
      ustekinumab compared with placebo (inactive medication) in adult Japanese participants with
      severe atopic dermatitis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized (the study medication is assigned by chance), double-blind (neither
      physician nor participant knows the identity of the assigned treatment), placebo-controlled
      (one of the study medications is inactive), multicenter, parallel group study (each
      participant group receives different treatments simultaneously). Participants will be
      randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive either ustekinumab 45 mg, ustekinumab 90 mg,
      or placebo. The study will consist of a screening period, a 12-week double-blind treatment
      period, and a 12-week follow-up period.  During the double-blind treatment period,
      participants will receive one subcutaneous injection of study medication at Week 0 and Week
      4. Participants will return to the study center for 7 evaluation visits on Weeks 2, 4, 8,
      12, 16, 20, and 24. Clinical response will be evaluated by Eczema Area and Severity Index
      (EASI), Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA), photography, and Dermatology Life Quality
      Index (DLQI). Participants will record their itch condition twice daily using the
      participant daily diary from 2 weeks prior to randomization until Week 12. Blood samples
      will be drawn at time periods during the screening, double-blind treatment, and follow-up
      periods. Participant safety will be monitored throughout the study. Participants are
      permitted to use concomitant topical medications, as defined in the protocol and without any
      increase in dose, from 4 weeks prior to randomization through to the end of the treatment
      period.  After Week 12, additional treatment can be started or the dose of concomitant
      medications can be increased, if no improvement in clinical response is observed; in these
      cases EASI, IGA, and photography evaluations will be stopped. The study duration for each
      participant is expected to be approximately 30 weeks.   Ustekinumab (also known as STELARA)
      is an antibody medication that inhibits the inflammatory proteins IL-12 and IL-23 and is
      approved as a treatment for moderate to severe plaque-type psoriasis; this study will
      examine whether ustekinumab can provide benefit in atopic dermatitis and assess for any
      risks or side effects.

    <description>The EASI is a measure of the severity and extent of atopic dermatitis (AD). Each of the 4 body regions (head and neck, trunk, upper limbs, and lower limbs) are assessed for severity of disease using a scale ranging from 0 (no disease) to 3 (severe disease). In addition, the area of skin affected by AD in each of the 4 body regions is determined using a scale ranging from 0 (no eruption) to 6 (90 to 100 percent extent of the body region affected). The higher the total EASI score, the greater the severity and extent of AD.</description>

    <description>The IGA utilizes a 6-point scale ranging from 0 (clear) to 5 (very severe disease). &quot;Almost clear&quot; is given a score of 1.</description>

    <description>The ADIS will be used to assess itching twice daily (morning and evening) and uses a scale ranging from 0 (no itching at all) to 10 (worst possible itching).</description>

    <description>DLQI is a dermatology-specific quality of life instrument designed to assess the impact of the disease on a subject's quality of life.  The DLQI uses 10 questions which are each scored on a scale of 0 to 3; the higher the score, the more quality of life is impaired.</description>
