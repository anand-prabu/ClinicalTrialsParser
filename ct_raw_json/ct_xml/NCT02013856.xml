  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fruit and vegetable rich diets are associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease
      (CVD). The protective effect may be ascribed to compounds contained within these foods,
      called flavonoids. Flavanols (epicatechin and procyanidins) are a particular group of
      flavonoids and are found mostly in apples, berry fruits, dark chocolate, tea and red wine.
      There is evidence to suggest that ingestion of flavanol rich foods and beverages
      beneficially alter 'markers' of CVD risk (e.g. blood pressure). The aim of this study is to
      determine the acute and chronic effects of apple derived flavanols on some risk markers for
      CVD.
