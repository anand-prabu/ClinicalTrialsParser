  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the evolution of raltegravir concentration in the
      mother (between the 3rd trimester of pregnancy and one month post-delivery) and her neonate,
      when this drug is used to prevent mother-to-child HIV-1 transmission as part of a combined
      antiretroviral regimen.

      1. Objectives

             1. Principal objective

                  -  To study pharmacokinetic properties of raltegravir in pregnant women infected
                     by HIV-1, during the third trimester of pregnancy (between 30 and 37 weeks of
                     amenorrhea) and 1 month after childbirth (between W4 and W6 postpartum), as
                     well as in their neonate.

             2. Secondary objectives

                  -  Estimate the frequency of women receiving raltegravir and having indetectable
                     viral load at delivery (and those having a strictly indetectable viral load,
                     with no signal under the threshold of the technique used).

                  -  Describe the tolerance to raltegravir in pregnant women during the third
                     trimester and in her neonates

        2. Methodology

             -  National multicenter pharmacokinetic study conducted among pregnant women infected
                by HIV-1 and exposed to raltegravir during pregnancy.

        3. Statistical method

             -  Method of population pharmacokinetic with 5 samples: before the drug intake, 0.5,
                3, 8 and 12 hours after the intake at each of the 2 visits (between 30 and 37
                weeks of amenorrhea, and 4 to 6 weeks after delivery).
