  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has been shown in a pre-marketing clinical study that clinically relevant QT prolongation
      does not appear to be associated with a single dose of ADASUVE. The potential risk of QTc
      prolongation following repeat dosing is unknown. Therefore the current study will assess the
      potential effects on the QT interval of 2 consecutive doses of ADASUVE administered 2 hours
      apart, in relation to placebo and an active control in healthy volunteers.

      The study hypothesis H0: Placebo-subtracted max mean dQTc &gt; 10 msec
