      The aim of the present study is to compare patient's recovery times after elective
      colonoscopy employing remifentanil only vs conventional combination of midazolam and
      meperidine

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A regimen with combined administration of midazolam and meperidine has been widely used and
      provides quite satisfactory sedation as well as analgesia during colonoscopy. However, the
      relatively long duration of midazolam and meperidine often prolongs the recovery time after
      colonoscopy and delays discharge time. (Reimann FM , Samson U , Derad I et al. Synergistic
      sedation with low-dose midazolam and propofol for colonoscopies . Endoscopy 2000 ; 32 : 239
      - 44).

      Remifentanil, an ultra-short-acting opioid, provides excellent pain control during
      colonoscopy and its rapid onset and offset times are advantages over other conventional
      opioids including meperidine, in avoiding prolonged discharge time after the colonoscopy.

      A total 54 patients, aged 18-65 years in American Society of Anesthesiologists physical
      status 1 and 2, scheduled for elective colonoscopy under Monitored Anesthesia Care in a
      University Hospital, will be recruited after obtaining written informed consent.

      Patients are allocated into one of two groups, Group 1 and Group 2 (27 patients each)
      according to the patient identification number (PIN) at the recruitment.

      All colonoscopic procedure is going to be performed by one Gastroenterologist (endoscopist).

      At patients' arrival to colonoscopy room, basal values of heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen
      saturation, respiratory rate and BIS score are recorded before administering the
      investigational drugs and monitored every 2 min during the entire procedure in the
      colonoscopy room as well as recovery period after procedure in the recovery unit.
      Supplemental oxygen (3 L/min) is given through nasal prong with capnography transducer in
      all patients.

      Two min before the colonoscopy procedure, a bolus midazolam of 0.03 mg/kg with a bolus
      meperidine of 1.0 mg/kg are given intravenously over 60 sec in Group 1 or those of
      comparable amount of diluted remifentanil 0.4 mcg/kg are given in Group 2 at the colonoscopy
      room, and a continuous infusion of diluted remifentanil of 0.04 mcg/kg/min is followed in
      Group 2 or that of comparable amount of normal saline (placebo) is followed in Group 1.

      The patients are asked to rate the degree of pain and satisfaction by a 100 mm VAS (0 =
      minimum, 100 = maximum) just after passing the scope, during the scope, just after the
      completion of the colonoscopy and at the discharge from the recovery unit.

      After colonoscopy, the patients are transferred to the recovery unit and evaluated every 5
      min until ready for discharge from the 30 min stay in the recovery unit.

      The patients are considered recovered if when they achieved an Aldrete score of 10 (Aldrete
      JA , Kroulik D . A postanesthetic recovery score. Anesth Analg 1970; 49: 924 - 34), have
      stable vital signs, are able to tolerate oral fluids, have no nausea, vomiting, or itching,
      and can walk unaided.

      Assessment of readiness to ambulate is made by a blinded observer who remained with the
      patient for the duration of recovery unit stay.

      The observer is instructed that the patients are required to walk as if they were leaving
      the recovery unit unescorted.

      Time for achieving Aldrete score 10, patient's degree of pain, patient's satisfaction during
      and after colonoscopy, patient's ability to recall the explanations and instructions given
      during and before colonoscopy are determined and compared.
