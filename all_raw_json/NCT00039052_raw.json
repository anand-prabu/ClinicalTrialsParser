Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression,\n      unacceptable toxicity, or detection of neutralizing antibodies.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of NBI-3001 until the maximum tolerated\n      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2\n      of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 36 patients will be accrued for this study."
