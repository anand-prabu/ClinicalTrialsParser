IDSA recommended fluoroquinolones as prophylaxis in\n      neutropenia patients of high risks, while in China, major pathogens possess high resistance\n      to fluoroquinolones. It is not clear whether prophylaxis is of benefit, nor the appropriate\n      prophylaxis regimen.\n\n      The current study will evaluate the three different regimen:\n\n        1. No prophylaxic antibiotic\n\n        2. Piperacillin as prophylaxis for neutropenia patients. Piperacillin has anti-pseudomonas\n           activity.\n\n        3. Piperacillin/tazobactam as prophylaxis for neutropenia patients.\n           Piperacillin/tazobactam has highest susceptibility rate among common anti-pseudomonas\n           antibiotics."
