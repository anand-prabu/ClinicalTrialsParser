    <description>Forced Expiratiory Volume in 1 second (FEV1) is the amount of air which can be forcibly exhaled from the lungs in the first second of a forced exhalation. FEV1 will be measured pre-dose and over a 24 hours post-dose period.</description>

    <description>Forced Expiratiory Volume in 1 second (FEV1) is the amount of air which can be forcibly exhaled from the lungs in the first second of a forced exhalation, measured through spirometry testing. The trough in FEV1 is defined as the mean of two measurements at different time points.</description>

    <time_frame>Day 1 (24 hours)</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) is the amount of air which can be forcibly exhaled from the lungs after taking the deepest breath possible. FVC will be assessed via spirometry. A positive change from baseline in FVC indicates improvement in lung function.</description>
