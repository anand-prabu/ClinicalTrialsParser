            "textblock": "Surgical residents and fellows acquire operative knowledge and skills by assisting attending\n      surgeons in the operating room. Previous research has shown that practising technical skills\n      prior to operating on patients can improve how skillfully laparoscopic surgery can be\n      performed. Although an increasingly large number of patients are undergoing robotic\n      hysterectomy and other robotic surgical procedures, little is known on how to ensure patient\n      safety and treatment effectiveness when trainee surgeons participate in the operating room.\n      Our study aims to determine the impact of immediate preoperative warm-up on a robotic\n      surgery simulator by gynecologic surgical trainees on their intraoperative performance and\n      on patient outcomes. The investigators are randomly assigning gynecologic surgical trainees\n      at a major academic medical center to either warm-up immediately before surgery on a robotic\n      surgery simulator or to not warm-up. The attending surgeon supervising the trainee in the\n      operating room is unaware of whether the trainee was assigned to warm-up or no warm-up. The\n      investigators will compare standard robotic surgical skills assessments of the trainees by\n      the supervising attending surgeons and patient outcomes in the two groups."
