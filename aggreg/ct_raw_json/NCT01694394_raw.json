Alings Central Coordinating\n      Centre Population Health Research Institute Recruitment and Participating Clinical Sites 250\n      patients from approximately 30 Sites Phase/Regulatory Status Phase IV - Cohort Study\n      Hypothesis Among elderly patients with cardiovascular risk factors and a left atrial\n      diameter \u2265 4.4 cm, but without prior clinical AF, an implanted continuous ECG monitor (St.\n      Jude Medical Confirm\u00ae Implantable Cardiac Monitor) will detect subclinical AF (\u2265 5 minutes\n      in duration) in 12% or more of patients during an average follow-up of 12 months.\n\n      Study Objectives\n\n      Primary Objectives:\n\n      1. To determine the rate of detection of sub-clinical atrial AF (\u2265 5 minutes) within an\n      average of 12 months following implant of the St. Jude Medical Confirm\u00ae Implantable Cardiac\n      Monitor in patients with known cardiovascular risk factors and left atrial enlargement, but\n      without prior AF.\n\n      Secondary Objectives\n\n        1. To determine if the incidence of sub-clinical AF is higher among patients whose left\n           atrial volume is above the median value observed in this study.\n\n        2. To determine the relationship between left atrial volume (continuous variable) and the\n           risk of sub-clinical AF.\n\n        3. To evaluate other potential predictors of sub-acute AF in this population including:\n           baseline troponin-T, baseline NT-pro-BNP as well as clinical and other\n           echocardiographic parameters.\n\n        4. To develop a preliminary economic analysis to evaluate the potential cost-effectiveness\n           of screening this patient population with an Implantable Cardiac Monitor as a means of\n           preventing stroke.\n\n      Study Design Cohort study to determine the prevalence of sub-clinical AF in an elderly\n      population with common cardiovascular risk factors, such as hypertension and diabetes.\n      Patients with echocardiographic evidence of atrial enlargement will be enrolled and have the\n      St. Jude Medical Confirm\u00ae Implantable Cardiac Monitor (Confirm\u00ae ICM) subcutaneously\n      implanted. To reduce costs, in most cases the implant will be done in conjunction with other\n      planned surgery or heart catheterization.\n\n      PHRI: CONFIDENTIAL Final Version 2.0:2012-06-18 Page 4 of 24 Participants/Study Duration\n      Total of 250 participants will be enrolled over 16 months. The last patient enrolled will\n      have 9 months of follow-up, for a total study duration of approximately 25 months. Clinic\n      visits will occur at enrolment and months 3, 6 and 9.
