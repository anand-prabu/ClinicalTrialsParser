It is known that brief, repeated periods of ischemia followed by reperfusion, known\n      as Ischemic Preconditioning (IPC) cause a delay in cell injury in cardiac muscle as well as\n      in various other organs.\n\n      Therefore the purpose of this study is to:\n\n        1. Quantify the use of IPC in recovery following EIMD.\n\n        2. Identify any effect of IPC during recovery on muscle function"
