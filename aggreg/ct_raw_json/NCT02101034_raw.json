The decision of effective contraception will be based on the judgment of\n             the principal investigator or a designated associate.\n\n          -  Known HIV-positivity and on combination antiretroviral therapy because of the\n             potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with PD 0332991.  In addition, these\n             patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with\n             marrow-suppressive therapy.  Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients\n             receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated."
