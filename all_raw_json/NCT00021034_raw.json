Determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose of\n      taurolidine after positive second-look surgery in patients with recurrent ovarian, fallopian\n      tube, or primary peritoneal cancer. II. Determine the dose-limiting toxicity and safety of\n      this drug in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive taurolidine intraperitoneally\n      weekly on weeks 1-3 and 7-9 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n      Cohorts of 1-6 patients receive escalating doses of taurolidine until the maximum tolerated\n      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2\n      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 weeks for 9\n      weeks.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 15 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-18\n      months."
