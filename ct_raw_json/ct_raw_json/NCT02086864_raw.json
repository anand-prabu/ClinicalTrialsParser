            "textblock": "Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a developmental disorder that presents\n      during childhood, with at least some symptoms causing impairment before the age of seven. It\n      is characterized by developmentally inappropriate levels of inattention and/or\n      hyperactive-impulsive behavior, with significant impairment occurring in at least two\n      settings. It affects approximately 5.2 million children in the United States. Homeopathic\n      treatment has been shown to be a promising  intervention for ADHD, however the reasons for\n      that effectiveness is unclear. Specifically, it is unclear whether improvement is due to the\n      homeopathic medicine, the consultative process, or other non-specific effects.\n\n      This study has 3 primary objectives: 1. to determine if there are any specific effects of\n      homeopathic medicines in the treatment of ADHD, 2. to determine if there any specific\n      effects the homeopathic consultation alone in the treatment of ADHD, and 3. to determine if\n      there is an overall effect of homeopathic treatment (homeopathic medicines plus\n      consultation) in the treatment of ADHD.\n\n      This is a three arm study. Participants will be randomized to one of three arms:\n\n      Arm 1 (Verum group):  a treatment arm where the participant will receive homeopathic\n      consultation plus a homeopathic remedy Arm 2 (Placebo group): a treatment arm where the\n      participant will receive homeopathic consultation plus a placebo remedy Arm 3 (No\n      treatment/Usual care group): a wait list arm where the participant will not receive\n      homeopathic treatment as part of the study.\n\n      This study will also examine the impact that the homeopathic consultation, as well as the\n      participants' sense of mastery may have on outcomes. This will help our understanding of the\n      treatment process and whether different elements of the intervention have greater or lesser\n      effects.\n\n      This study is a follow-up to an open label pilot study of the homeopathic treatment of ADHD\n      using the same study team. Sample size was calculated based on the results of that study."
