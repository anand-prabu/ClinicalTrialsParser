Biological\n      therapies such as interferon alfa-2b use different ways to stimulate the immune system and\n      stop cancer cells from growing.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of rituximab or interferon alfa-2b in\n      treating patients who have chronic lymphocytic leukemia or multiple myeloma in remission."

Determine the toxicity of rituximab or interferon alfa-2b maintenance therapy\n      in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia or multiple myeloma in remission after\n      chemotherapy. II. Determine the progression free survival, failure free survival, and\n      overall survival of these patients from time of chemotherapy discontinuation to completion\n      of maintenance therapy. III. Compare the survival rates of these patients to similar\n      patients treated in published studies. IV. Determine the quality of life of these patients\n      on these regimens.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients enter one of two treatment arms: Arm I: Patients receive rituximab IV on\n      days 1, 8, 15, and 22 for course 1, and then once a month for 11 months or until disease\n      progression. Arm II: Patients receive subcutaneous interferon alfa-2b every other day three\n      times per week for 12 months. Quality of life is assessed monthly during therapy. Patients\n      are followed every 3 months for 1 year, and then annually for up to 5 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60-80 patients (30-40 per disease type) will be accrued for\n      this study."
