Because AZT is reported not to be active against cytomegalovirus (CMV), it is important\n      to see if it is useful to give GCV along with AZT.\n\n      Patients are placed into one of four groups at entry into study according to their previous\n      treatment:\n\n      I: Prior treatment with AZT up to the time of  developing CMV infection and not requiring\n      dose reduction of AZT for toxicity.\n\n      II: Prior treatment with AZT up to the time of developing CMV infection and requiring dose\n      reduction of AZT for toxicity.\n\n      III: Prior therapy with GCV for CMV infection. These patients should already be in the\n      maintenance phase, having completed a minimum of 2 weeks of induction therapy.\n\n      IV: No prior therapy with either AZT or GCV.\n\n      Treatment lasts 24 weeks and consists of two treatment plans:\n\n      A: Patients not previously treated with GCV are started on GCV for an additional 22 weeks.\n      GCV is given as a 1-hour infusion. All patients are started on AZT at the lowest dose. B:\n      For patients with chronic CMV disease who are receiving GCV maintenance, GCV is administered\n      as a 1-hour infusion 5 days/week.\n\n      AZT is added and treatment with GCV is standardized prior to beginning of the study."
