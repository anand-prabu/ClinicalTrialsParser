    <textblock>
      The etiology of parenteral nutrition-associated cholestasis(PNAC)although elusive is thought
      to be multifactorial, and proposed theories also include problems arising from lipid
      emulsions, leading us to explore alternative products available elsewhere.So we compare the
      different fat emulsion, and want to see if the olive oil lipid emulsions can improve hepatic
      tolerance in preterm infant.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parenteral nutrition (PN) has been widely and successfully used in the pediatric population
      for more than 40 years, the most serious and significant life-threatening complication today
      continues to be parenteral nutrition-associated cholestasis(PNAC). Parenteral
      nutrition-associated cholestasis is indeed the most worrisome complication because it is
      difficult to treat and may progress to eventual cirrhosis and liver failure namely
      parenteral nutrition-associated liver disease (PNALD).

      Two types of lipid emulsions are currently used for adult as well as pediatric patients: one
      lipid emulsions prepared from soybean oil that are composed of long-chain triacylglycerols
      (LCTs),  and the other lipid emulsions composed of 50% medium-chain triacylglycerols (MCTs)
      and 50% LCT soybean oil. A new lipid emulsion prepared from a mixture of soybean oil and
      olive oil contains only LCTs and has a lower proportion (20%) of polyunsaturated fatty
      acids(PUFAs)and 60% monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs). So we compare the different fat
      emulsion, and want to see if the olive oil lipid emulsions can improve hepatic tolerance in
      preterm infant.
