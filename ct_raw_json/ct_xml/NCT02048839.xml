      SUBJECTS:

      All participants in the RADIEL-study (2008-2011) who delivered (n=535), will be invited to
      this follow-up study, with their children (age 3-5 years) and the father. The investigations
      are carried out during two separate visits. The father receives mail questionnaires

      OVERALL OBJECTIVES:

        1. To determine the long-term effectiveness of a lifestyle intervention in high risk women
           and their offspring

             1. in reducing the incidence of T2DM and cardiovascular disease and    their risk
                factors

             2. in preventing obesity

             3. on biomarkers

             4. on genetic and epigenetics markers .

        2. To study the association between maternal diet during pregnancy and metabolic markers
           in the offspring at age 3-5 years.

        3. To study the association between maternal exercise habits during pregnancy and
           metabolic markers in the offspring at age 3-5 years.

        4. To study the association between maternal a) glucose-insulin metabolism b) lipid
           metabolism c) adipoinsulinar axis and d) inflammatory markers and birth size and later
           health outcomes in the mothers and their offspring.

        5. To study the association between gut microbiota and markers of offspring health

        6. To study the cost effectiveness of the intervention.

      METHODS:

      Maternal measurements

        1. Height, weight, waist and hip circumference

        2. Blood pressure, pulse

        3. Body fat percentage

        4. Blood tests e.g. markers of glucose metabolism and lipids, vitamin D, Calcium and bone
           markers, DNA sample and inflammation markers

        5. Fecal and hair samples

        6. Diurnal salivary cortisol assessment

        7. Background questionnaire: socioeconomic and health-related background

        8. Health-related quality of life (15-D).

        9. 3-day food diary and exercise diary

       10. ArmBand (acceleration sensor), assessment of physical activity and sleep for 7 days

       11. Psychological questionnaires

       12. Pulse wave velocity (PWV) will be assessed

       13. Advanced glycation endproducts - a marker of cardiovascular health will be assessed

      Paternal measurements

        1. Background questionnaire (incl. height, weight, age)

        2. DNA-sample (buccal)

        3. 3-day food diary

        4. Psychological questionnaires

      Measurements of children

        1. Body weight, height, blood pressure, pulse

        2. Body fat percentage

        3. Psychological questionnaires

        4. Food and physical activities diaries

        5. ActiGraph, assessment of physical activity and sleep for 7 days

        6. Blood samples e.g. glucose- and insulin metabolism, lipids,  vitamin D and Calcium,
           DNA-sample and samples for inflammation markers

        7. Fecal, urine and hair samples

        8. A copy of child welfare center card (e.g. data on growth, immunizations, health)

        9. Endothelial function and pulse wave velocity (PWV)

      TIMETABLE

      Follow up starts in September of 2013, and will continue until 2016. Data analysis starts in
      2016 and results will be reported from 2016 onwards in international peer-reviewed journals.

        Women who participated the Radiel intervention study, and were originally randomly
        assigned to either active lifestyle intervention group or control group. They were all
        high risk women with BMI &gt;30 or prior gestational GDM. To this follow up-study we invite
        also the children born during the intervention.
