Specifically, the investigators plan to perform\n      a randomised, double blind, cross-over human intervention trial using a blueberry drink to\n      investigate the dose-dependent effects of blueberry polyphenols on blood vessel function\n      using Flow mediated dilation (FMD) to measure endothelial function. The study will not only\n      measure the acute effects of flavonoid ingestion on vascular reactivity but will also assess\n      plasma polyphenol metabolite levels."
