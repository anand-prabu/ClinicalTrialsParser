The vaccines are\n      being compared to assess their ability to stimulated protection against shingles.  The study\n      will provide an opportunity to determine the safety profile of each vaccine in a single\n      trial.  The study will also look at the effect of age on the immune response to the two\n      vaccines and on the persistence of these responses."
