Hydrocortisone is the man-made version of the hormone\n      cortisol, which is released in the body following a regular daily pattern. The objective of\n      the study is to measure the levels of hydrocortisone that are absorbed into the bloodstream\n      once Chronocort\u00ae is taken and what affects it has on other hormones in the body. Since\n      Chronocort\u00ae is anticipated to mimic the same release pattern of cortisol in the body, it is\n      hoped that patients with CAH will be treated more effectively to manage their disease."

Females of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test initially and\n             at all visits. Females who are engaging in sexual intercourse must be using a\n             medically acceptable method of contraception (as defined in the protocol, section\n             10.5).\n\n          6. Plasma renin activity must be within the clinically acceptable range at screening\n             (less than 1.5 times upper normal range).\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          1. Co-morbid condition requiring daily administration of a medication that induces\n             hepatic enzymes or interferes with the metabolism of glucocorticoids.\n\n          2. Clinical or biochemical evidence of hepatic or renal disease. Creatinine above the\n             normal range or elevated liver function tests (ALT or AST) >  2 times the upper\n             limits of normal.\n\n          3. Females who are pregnant or lactating.\n\n          4. Women taking an estrogen-containing oral contraceptive pill and who have taken it\n             within 6 weeks of recruitment.\n\n          5. Patients taking spironolactone.\n\n          6. Patients on inhaled or oral steroids apart from treatment for CAH.\n\n          7. Patients with any other significant medical or psychiatric conditions that in the\n             opinion of the Investigator would preclude participation in the trial.\n\n          8. Participation in another clinical trial of an investigational or licensed drug or\n             device within the 3 months prior to inclusion in this study.\n\n          9.
