    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to examine target-controlled propofol infusion as a technique of
      anesthesia for surgery of hip fracture under ultrasound guidance lumbar and sacral plexus
      block or lumbar, sacral and paravertebral nerve block in the elderly; and to evaluate which
      regional anesthesia was more sufficient for the old.

      Eighty patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists（ASA） Ⅰ-Ⅲ older than 80 years are
      randomly assigned to 2 groups: a lumbar and sacral plexus block(LS) group with 20ml 0.5%
      ropivacaine at lumbar plexus(level L3-4) and 10ml 0.5%ropivacaine at sacral plexus; a
      lumbar, sacral plexus and paravertebral nerve block(LSP) group with 20ml 0.5% ropivacaine at
      lumbar plexus(level L3-4) , 10ml 0.5%ropivacaine at sacral plexus and 10ml 0.5%ropivacaine
      at paravertebral nerve(level L1). The target-controlled propofol infusion is started
      immediately after positioning the patient on the operating table. The initial target
      concentration was 0.5μg/mL. The infusion rate is adjusted every 5min by increasing or
      decreasing the target concentration by 0.2μg/mL steps based on the patients' respiratory
      rate(RR), blood pressure(BP), heart rate(HR), and level of sedation(score of 5 on Ramsay
      Sedation Scale ). The minimal, maximal, optimal target concentration, cumulative propofol
      dose, frequency of spontaneous movement and incidences of associated complications are
      recorded. Patients were phoned for followup and questioned for activity status in one year.
      If the patients were dead, date of death; if they survived, daily living activity
      questioned.
