  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the proposed study the investigators aim to evaluate the effect of the standard of care
      dose (40mg) of MMC mixed with TC-3 gel (with sustained release mechanism on the drug) on low
      risk recurrent NMIBC lesions and to compare our findings to instillation with the standard
      mode of instillation- 40mg MMC in water in order to examine our hypothesis that MMC mixed
      with TC-3 gel will have at least non-inferior and even superior results over the standard
      instillation mode

      The investigators believe that this study is of importance of several aspects:

        1. It evaluates a new mode of bladder instillation that may bypass the drawbacks of the
           current instillation mode.

        2. If proved effective this mode of treatment might save the need of TURBT performance and
           serve as a new mode of tumor ablation.

        3. Even if proved partially effective this mode of treatment will diminish tumors size or
           number thus enable a more limited TURBT procedure.

        4. This mode of treatment will enable immediate medical attendance to the patient's tumor
           recurrence without the waiting period (resulting from queues in the medical centers)
           for TURBT, which might improve the patient's prognostic outcome.

        5. If this experimental treatment will prove to have a better ablative effect, this could
           be translated to a better prophylactic effect of tumor recurrence.

      Non-muscle-Invasive Bladder cancer is mainly treated by tumor resection (Trans Urethral
      Resection - TUR), followed by series of intravesical instillations of prophylactic
      chemotherapeutic drugs as Mitomycin C (MMC) or BCG. This treatment approach is limited due
      to rapid dilution the chemotheraputic drug by the incoming urine and clearance by urination.

      TheraCoat core technology is based on a reverse thermal biodegradable gel (TC-3) (low
      viscosity at 5°C gel appearance at body temperature)for drug retention in the urinary
      bladder.

      Prior to instillation, the TC-3 hydrogel, in a liquid state, is mixed with MMC.TC-3 mixed
      with MMC is instilled to the bladder by a catheter. Following gel insertion to the bladder,
      the gel solidifies and forms a drug reservoir inside the bladder. Upon contact with urine
      the gel dissolves and is cleared out from the bladder.

      Intravesical MMC instillation using TheraCoat gel is expected to increase treatment
      efficiency due to prolongation of treatment duration and consequently improving bladder
      exposure to MMC.

      Treatment Protocol - Immediately following baseline cystoscopy and tumor diagnosis and
      patient undergoes 6 weekly instillations followed by 2-4 weeks healing period.

      1st Follow-Up Visit (Pre-Scheduled TURBT Visit): The patient will undergo a second
      Cystoscopy to compare to the Baseline status and after that a follow-up period: 3,6,9,12
      months.

    <description>Cystoscopic and pathological effect (evaluated during TUR-BT visit) of pre-TURBT intravesical instillations with 40 mg of MMC mixed with 60cc TC-3 Hydrogel on bladder lesion(s) of NMIBC patients. At To, which is the time of identification of a recurrent tumor  by cystoscopy, the number, size and location of the lesions will be documented and photographed. Each tumor size will be evaluated by photographing a ureter catheter adjacent to the tumor. Since the ureter catheter diameter is a pre-known variable, the tumor diameter can be calculated using specific software developed for study purposes. Photography of the tumor with a pre-known diameter ureter catheter will be performed during the same cystoscopy as described above and will be evaluated by a central clinic for uniformity of measurements, and the results of these measurements will serve for the post study evaluation of the change in tumor diameter</description>
