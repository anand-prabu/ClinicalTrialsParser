      This hypothesis-generating feasibility study to determine potential associations between a
      broad range of clinical neurological symptoms and Magnetic Resonance Image (MRI), data, and
      clinical findings involved in mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). These associations will be
      examined over the acute and sub-acute period (baseline to 3 months) following injury to
      provide information useful for optimization of MR pulse sequences for mTBI applications.

      The intent of this study is to broadly generate a range of potential mTBI biomarkers
      detectable using investigational MR pulse sequence technologies. Feasibility data attained
      in this study may be used for engineering program decision-making and in support of future
      scientific assessment, engineering development, published research databases or registries
      mTBI data and images, and other purposes determined by the Sponsor. The results of this
      study are not intended for use in regulatory submissions.

      Subjects will be examined on commercially available MR scanner using investigational or
      standard of care MR coils and a series of investigational Application Packs containing a
      predetermined set of MR pulse sequences optimized by Sponsor.
