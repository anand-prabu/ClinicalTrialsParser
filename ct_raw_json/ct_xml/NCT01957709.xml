    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies the effect of recombinant interferon gamma on tissue in
      treating patients with soft tissue sarcoma. Interferon gamma may interfere with the growth
      of tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether systemic administration of interferon (IFN) gamma (recombinant
      interferon gamma) will increase class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) expression in
      synovial sarcoma (SS) and myxoid/round cell liposarcoma (MRCL) tumors.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether systemic administration of IFN gamma will increase class II MHC
      expression in SS and MRCL tumors.

      II. To examine changes in the immune response to MRCL and SS by examining changes in the
      immune infiltrates, antibody response and antigen specific T cell response before and after
      IFN gamma treatment.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive recombinant interferon gamma subcutaneously (SC) every 7 days for 4 weeks
      before surgery or thrice weekly for 2 weeks before surgery.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 2 weeks post-surgery.

    <description>It is estimated that the true mean change in expression following IFN gamma will be 50% (for homogenous expression) with a standard deviation of 30%. Seven patients will provide 95% power to observe a change in expression (before IFN vs. after IFN) that is statistically significantly (at the 2-sided significance level of .05) different from a change of zero.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  A diagnosis of synovial sarcoma and myxoid/round cell liposarcoma

          -  All patients must have consulted with a surgical provider and are being considered
             for resection or biopsy of their tumor

          -  Available prior biopsy or tumor resection specimen of lesion to be resected (the
             target lesion) or biopsied confirming the diagnosis of that lesion and with tissue
             available for class I MHC staining

          -  Zubrod performance status of '0-2'

          -  No treatment with systemic anti-cancer treatment (chemotherapy or biologics) within 2
             weeks of starting interferon gamma

          -  Patients must have an electrocardiogram (EKG) performed within 2 weeks of enrollment;
             patients with a history of cardiac disease or abnormal EKG must have had a normal
             stress test within 180 days of starting IFN gamma

          -  Must have been off metformin for at least 2 weeks prior to starting IFN gamma

          -  No use of full dose, therapeutic anti-coagulation; however, low dose warfarin for
             catheter prophylaxis or acetylsalicylic acid are acceptable

          -  No thrombotic event within 6 months (deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism) of
             starting IFN gamma

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Active infection requiring oral or intravenous antibiotics

          -  Pregnant women, nursing mothers, men or women of reproductive ability who are
             unwilling to use effective contraception or abstinence; women of childbearing
             potential must have a negative pregnancy test within two weeks prior to entry

          -  Serum creatinine &gt; 1.5 mg/dL or glomerular filtration rate &lt; 50

          -  Serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) &gt; 150 IU or &gt; 3 x upper limit of
             normal

          -  Prothrombin time &gt; 1.5 x control

          -  Untreated central nervous system (CNS) metastasis; once CNS metastasis have been
             treated these patients may participate if they are otherwise good trial candidates

          -  Current treatment with steroids (must be discontinued 1 week before starting IFN
             gamma)

          -  Hemoglobin A1C &gt; 8.5%

          -  Uncontrolled hypertension, blood pressure (BP) &gt; 150/100mmHg; patients with elevated
             BP may enroll once BP is corrected

          -  Prior cancer/testis antigen 1B (NY-ESO-1) specific T cell therapy
