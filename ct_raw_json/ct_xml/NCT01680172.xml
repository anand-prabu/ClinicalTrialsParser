  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Depression is common in patients with cancer.  Current medications for depression, while
      effective, take several weeks to take effect.  Ketamine has emerged as a drug with promise
      for cancer patients.  In two reported cases, a single dose of ketamine induced rapid and
      moderately sustained symptom reduction in depression and anxiety with no adverse side
      effects.  Benefit was seen in as little as 1 hour and sustained up to 30 days.  This study
      is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled investigation testing whether a single
      dose of ketamine improves depression and anxiety relative to placebo in patients with
      cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Depression is common in patients with  cancer.  Current antidepressants, while effective,
      have an onset of action of at least several weeks.  Ketamine has emerged as a drug with
      promise for cancer patients.  It has been shown to potentiate opiate analgesic effects.
      Single dose parenteral and enteral administration studies in medically healthy
      treatment-resistant depressed patients have shown rapid relief of symptoms.  A recent two
      patient case series reported a rapid and moderately sustained symptom reduction in
      depression and anxiety in palliative care patients following a single dose of oral ketamine
      0.5 mg/kg, with no adverse effects.  Benefit was seen as little as 1 hour after the
      administration and sustained up to 30 days.  These case reports generate hypotheses of
      efficacy for ketamine in the treatment of depression and anxiety in patients with cancer.
      This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled investigation of these
      hypotheses.
