Phase II clinical\n      trials test how well an investigational drug works in treating a specific cancer.\n      \"Investigational\" means that the drug is still being studied and that research doctors are\n      trying to find out more about it. MLN0128 is not approved by the FDA.\n\n      The purpose of this study is to see what effects (good and bad) the study drug MLN0128 has\n      on the patient and the cancer. MLN0128 is a drug that belongs to a class of drugs called\n      \"mTOR kinase inhibitors\". A protein, called \"mTOR\" inside the cells in the body, plays a\n      role in controlling how cells grow. In some cancer cells, mTOR may be over-active. This\n      over-activity may cause some cancer cells to grow out of control. Research has shown that\n      mTOR inhibitors can block this overactivity and may help stop or slow down the growth of\n      some types of cancer cells."
