Neurocardiogenic syncope (NCS) is a benign condition characterized by a self\n      limited episode of systemic hypotension.  Patients are usually managed with education on\n      syncope, anxiety management, and coping skills.\n\n      It has been established that practice of Yoga could relieve stress and anxiety. In a\n      different study, they also found that Yoga positively influences cardiovascular function by\n      decreasing the heart rate and blood pressure. The main objective of Yoga is to achieve\n      control over the autonomic nervous system and able to control functions like heart rate,\n      blood pressure and respiratory rate.\n\n      Based on the findings that Yoga relieves stress and reduces heart rate, the investigators\n      propose to study if Yoga can decrease the frequency of NCS and also reduce the symptoms\n      associated with these episodes."
