    <textblock>
      The aim of this Phase I/II study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of dendritic cells
      (DC) vaccine combined with cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells in patients with renal cell
      carcinoma. Experimental recombinant adenovirus-transfected DC, which engineered to express
      MUC1 and Survivin are used for DC-based immunotherapy. Based on the results of our
      previously performed preclinical study with DC vaccine combined with CIK cells, the
      investigators plan to perform the clinical trial.
