Initially proposed in the sixty's, rehabilitation programs dedicated to\n      patients with PAD have recently been proved effective  and defined in many guidelines.\n      Supervised walking training on treadmill is recommended. Usually patients walk up to a mild\n      or moderate pain (evaluated at 3 or 4 on the claudication pain scale; maximum pain =5), then\n      stop until pain completely subsides and walk again .\n\n      The Artex study assesses the efficacy of a fractionated mode of training avoiding pain by\n      alternating short sequences of intensive training and active recovery (without rest)."
