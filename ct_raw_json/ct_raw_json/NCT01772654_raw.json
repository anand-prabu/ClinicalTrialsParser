Of note, all studies done in this area in regards to epilepsy\n      have been retrospective, small studies.  The investigators plan to perform a study that is\n      prospective, with a comparatively large sample of patients.\n\n      The study hypothesis is that in patients with refractory epilepsy, Arterial Spin Labeling\n      (ASL) MRI will show areas of abnormality in the brain to the same degree as SPECT and PET\n      studies."

This is especially true in \"MRI negative\" patients, whose lesion is not visible on\n      standard MRI techniques.  PET and SPECT studies have numerous disadvantages, including\n      radiation exposure, injection of contrast or isotopes, cost, and are often difficult to\n      access for many patients.\n\n      Arterial spin labeling (ASL) MRI sequences show perfusion related abnormalities without\n      using contrast, in a relatively short amount of time, and can be done during a normal MRI\n      for evaluation of epilepsy. This is of interest because if there is a good correlation, ASL\n      MRI sequences could be used in addition, or in place of, these other studies that require\n      injection of isotopes and radiation from CT scans."
