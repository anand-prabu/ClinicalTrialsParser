            "textblock": "Several studies have indicated that determining prevalence and number of circulating tumor\n      cells (CTCs) at various time points during treatment may be an effective tool for assessing\n      treatment efficacy in metastatic breast cancer (MBC). However, even if the prognostic value\n      of CTCs in MBC is well understood, the role of both CTC prevalence and CTC phenotype in\n      predicting treatment response needs further investigation. DETECT IV is a prospective,\n      multicenter, open-label, single arm phase II study aimed at postmenopausal patients with\n      hormone-receptor positive, HER2-negative MBC and exclusively HER2-negative CTCs. The primary\n      objective of the trial is to estimate the clinical efficacy of the mTOR inhibitor everolimus\n      in combination with endocrine therapy as assessed by progression-free survival (PFS).\n      Additional research on CTC dynamics and characteristics will provide a better understanding\n      of the prognostic and predictive value of CTCs and is one step into a more personalized\n      therapy for MBC."

                "textblock": "Inclusion Criteria: 1. Metastatic breast cancer (MBC), which cannot be cured by surgery or\n        radiotherapy. The primary tumor and/or biopsies must have been confirmed as cancer by\n        histopathology.\n\n        2. HER2 status (as investigated on all primary tumor tissue and/or biopsies from\n        metastatic sites or loco regional recurrences) must be negative. HER2-negativity is\n        defined as (i.e.: immunohistochemistry (IHC) score 0-1+ or 2+ and fluorescent in situ\n        hybridization (FISH) negative or just FISH negative, whichever was performed) in all\n        tissue samples.\n\n        3. Indication for an endocrine therapy. (Histological confirmation of estrogen receptor\n        positive (ER+) and/or progesterone receptor positive (PgR+) breast cancer) 4. Any\n        endocrine therapy in the history is allowed. 5. Disease progression following prior\n        treatment with endocrine therapy (endocrine therapy does not have to be the last therapy\n        before inclusion in the trial) 6. Evidence of CTCs. At least one CTC has been detected in\n        7.5 ml patient blood by means of the CellSearch\u00ae Circulating Tumor Cell Kit (Veridex LLC,\n        Raritan, USA).\n\n        7. HER2 negativity of all detected CTCs. HER2-negativity is defined as staining < HER2 3+.\n\n        8. Up to two lines of previous cytostatic treatment for MBC. 9. Adequate organ function\n        within 7 days before date of recruitment, evidenced by the following laboratory results: -\n        absolute neutrophil count \u2265 1500/\u03bcL, - platelet count \u2265 100000/\u03bcL, - hemoglobin \u2265 9 g/dL,\n        - ALT (SGPT)/AST (SGOT) \u2264 3.0 \u00d7 ULN, - bilirubin \u2264 2.0 \u00d7 ULN - creatinine \u2264 2.0 \u00d7 ULN -\n        serum cholesterol \u2264 2.0 \u00d7 ULN 10. Postmenopausal women. The investigator must confirm\n        postmenopausal status. Postmenopausal status is defined either by - Age \u2265 55 years and one\n        year or more of amenorrhea - Age < 55 years and one year or more of amenorrhea and\n        postmenopausal levels of FSH and LH - Prior hysterectomy and has postmenopausal levels of\n        FSH and LH - Surgical menopause with bilateral oophorectomy 11.

Tumor evaluation has been performed within 6 weeks before date of recruitment and\n        results are available.\n\n        14. Patients must have at least one not previously irradiated lesion that can be evaluated\n        according to RECIST version 1.1 (Eisenhauer 2009). Patients with measurable and\n        non-measurable disease are eligible. Presence of clinically and/or radiologically\n        documented disease.\n\n        15. Age \u2265 18 years. 16.

Concurrent disease or condition that might interfere with adequate assessment or\n             evaluation of study data, or any medical disorder that would make the patient's\n             participation unreasonably hazardous.\n\n          8. Other malignant diseases within the last 3 years apart from CIN of the uterine cervix\n             and skin basalioma.\n\n          9.
