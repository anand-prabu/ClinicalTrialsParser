  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recently, beneficial effects on Meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) of a single automated
      thermal pulsation with the Lipiflow® system have been reported in several case reports. In
      one study this treatment was compared with hyperthermia (iheat®) for 4 weeks. However,
      treatment recommendations for lid hygiene according to the MGD-report consist of
      hyperthermia followed by lid massage and lid margin cleansing over several months. To the
      best of the investigators knowledge this is the first randomized prospective study to
      compare automated thermal pulsation treatment with the new Lipiflow ® system with a standard
      lid hygiene regime.

      The investigators suggest that a single treatment with Lipiflow® is superior to a lid
      hygiene regime.

      Once a patient has been identified as a possible candidate for the study, he/she is first
      informed verbally and in writing about the study. After signing the consent form he/she will
      be randomized to either the Lipiflow® treatment (Lipiflow® group) or alternatively be given
      an instruction sheet and a verbal explanation for lid warming and massage (lid hygiene
      group). After 3 month a cross-over of the lid hygiene group to the Lipiflow® group is
      conducted.

      A full examination is performed before and 4 weeks and 3 months after therapy. All tests are
      performed by a physician or trained graduate students of the Department of Ophthalmology,
      Heinrich-Heine University. The examiner is blinded, i.e. he does not know which treatment
      the patient will receive or receiving.

      Treatment Lipiflow®:

      The automated thermal pulsation with Lipiflow® provides is a low risk therapy. After local
      anesthesia the applicators are inserted. These look like a kind of goggles and consist of
      two parts which embrace the eyelids from the front and from behind. Through the rear part
      heat is applied to a maximum of 42.5° C. By isolating the heat remains on the eyelid
      limited. Through the front part the gland a massage is performed. The treatment takes 12
      minutes per eye and can be done depending on the patient's wishes simultaneously or one eye
      after the other. The therapy is approved by the FDA as a medical technical innovation and
      has also been approved by ISO and CE Mark certification for use in Europe. Irritation or
      minor trauma of the eyelids and the conjunctiva and cornea, as well as a violation of the
      eyelids and the conjunctiva and cornea are theoretically possible, but extremely unlikely.
      Permanent damages to the eyes have not been reported in the literature.

      In the unlikely event, that complications occur during treatment, requiring an additional
      treatment, this is performed in the department of ophthalmology  of the Heinrich-Heine
      University Duesseldorf.

      Test parameters:

      At any time of investigation, the following parameters are evaluated:

      Lipiview®, Tear Lab®, Schirmer test, break-up time, corneal and conjunctival fluorescein
      staining, Meibomian gland evaluation (MGE), examination of the eyelids, Meibography, OSDI
      score, SPEED score

      All test parameters are established procedures and have in common a very low risk of harm to
      the patient. In detail:

      The Lipiview® is a device that quantifies the thickness of the lipid layer of the tear film
      using interferometry. For this the patient looks into a kind of camera while recordings of
      his tear film are made, which are then analyzed by a computer.

      Tear Lab® is a method for measuring tear film osmolarity. A pen-like instrument (the
      osmometer) is held on the tear meniscus and collects 100 nl tears within fractions of a
      second in the unit. There is no need for local anaesthesia. By electrical impedance
      measurement, then the tear film osmolarity is measured. The examiner can then read the
      values digitally.

      The Schirmer test consists of a strip of filter paper that is placed in the conjunctival sac
      of the patient for five minutes. The filter paper absorbs the tear fluid and the stained by
      the tear fluid line serves as a measure of tear secretion.

      Tear break-up time is the time between a blink and the tear film shows signs of breaking up.
      In this study this is measured non-invasive with the Oculus-Keratograph 5 M®.  The patient
      looks into a kind of camera while recordings of his tear film are made which are then
      analyzed by a computer.

      Vital corneal and conjunctival epithelium cannot be stained by fluorescein. The dye adheres
      to nonviable cells. The degree of staining, can be judged by the investigator by slit-lamp
      examination.

      For evaluation of the secreting meibomian glands a specialized device (Meibomian gland
      evaluator) is used, that provides a defined pressure to the lid. The examiner observes the
      ducts of the Meibomian glands and assesses how many glands are yielding secretion.

      Examination of the eyelids is done using a slit lamp to assess a thickening or a significant
      vascularisation the lid margin.

      To perform meibography the lids are illuminated by infrared light. Functional acini of the
      glands become clearly visible and can be differentiated from atrophic acini. The number of
      atrophic meibomian glands can be counted by a score.

      OSDI (Ocular-Surface-Disease-Index) and SPEED (Standard Pattern Evaluation of Eye Dryness)
      are questionnaires to quantify the symptoms of dry eye.
