<td colspan="2" class="bigdent">
<p>This trial is conducted in Europe.<br>
<br>The aim of this research study is to compare the efficacy (reduction in HbA1c and in blood glucose levels) of insulin detemir, insulin aspart and biphasic insulin aspart 30, when added to current OAD (oral anti-diabetic drug) treatment in subjects with type 2 diabetes and to verify the safety of use (number and severity of episodes of hypoglycaemia, body weight and side effects).</p>

The second is the percentage of subset of participants who achieved the target and did not have either minor or major hypoglycaemic episode within the four weeks prior to the month 12 exam. Minor hypoglycaemic episode is an episode in which the participant was able to treat her/himself and plasma glucose was below 3.1 mmol/L (56 mg/dL). Major hypoglycaemic episode is an episode in which the participant was unable to treat her/himself.</p>

Responses can be used to generate a single numerical value associated with a given health state. The scale of values is graded from -0.59 to 1.00, with lower scores indicating a poorer health status. A score of 0 represents no quality of life and scores less than 0 represent states perceived by the respondent to be worse than death.</p>

<p>Individually adjusted insulin detemir injected subcutaneously once daily before bed and administered in combination with current OAD treatment. Subjects had the option to add a second pre-breakfast basal insulin analogue injection if pre-breakfast but not pre-dinner meal plasma glucose targets were met. In the second and third years, a second insulin formulation was added if subjects failed to achieve or to maintain good glycaemic control, defined as two consecutive HbA1c measurements exceeding 6.5% or a single measurement exceeding 7.5%. Subjects randomised to insulin detemir once (or twice) daily were asked to add insulin aspart three times daily with meals i.e. a basal-bolus insulin analogue regimen.</p>
