This will provide\n           the basis for designing practical interventions to reduce the mortality of subjects\n           with sepsis and severe sepsis in the future.\n\n        -  To define the clinical outcomes of community-acquired sepsis and severe sepsis in\n           Southeast Asia.\n\n        -  To identify risk factors associated with sepsis or severe sepsis.\n\n        -  To determine the extent of antimicrobial resistance in organisms that cause\n           community-acquired sepsis and severe sepsis in Southeast Asia and to determine the\n           association between antimicrobial resistance and mortality.\n\n        -  To evaluate the accuracy of selected rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) in determining the\n           causes of community-acquired sepsis and severe sepsis compared to well-defined gold\n           standard tests.\n\n      As this is an observational study and not a clinical trial, researchers will not be involved\n      in the management, care and treatment of study subjects. This will remain the responsibility\n      of the attending medical staff according to standard of care (SOC) in the participating\n      hospitals. Therefore the research study will not influence patient management. SOC for\n      sepsis and severe sepsis in each subject will be recorded, and will be reported as summary\n      statistics at the end of the study. This will not be used to influence the management and\n      care of sepsis and severe sepsis cases at the participating hospitals during the study\n      period, but will be used to guide the improvement of the SOC after the study is complete.\n\n      NOTE: EACH INSTITUTION IN THIS STUDY IS ITS OWN SPONSOR AS LISTED BELOW:\n\n        1.
