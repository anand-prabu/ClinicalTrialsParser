Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor\n      cells. Combining more than one drug and combining chemotherapy with radiation therapy may\n      kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy followed by\n      radiation therapy in treating adult patients with brain cancer."

Treatment repeats every 42 days for up to 3 courses in the absence of disease\n      progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Within 4-6 weeks after the last chemotherapy course, patients undergo radiotherapy 5 days a\n      week for 6 to 7 weeks.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then\n      annually for 5-10 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 33 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years."
