They include instructing the participant in basic problem\n      solving techniques and encouraging re-engagement in rewarding activities.\n\n      Participants will be depressed, older adult clients of Westchester Jewish Community Services\n      or outpatient research subjects recruited by the Cornell Institute of Geriatric Psychiatry.\n      In addition to receiving therapy, study participants will also undergo research assessments\n      at the beginning of the study and then at weeks 6 and 9."
