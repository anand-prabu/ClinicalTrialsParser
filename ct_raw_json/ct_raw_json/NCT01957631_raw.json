The\n      study population consists of a total of 80 participants. They will be randomly assigned to\n      receive either a corticosteroid injection, or a platelet rich plasma injection. Data will be\n      collected through questionnaires and ultrasound findings. Patients will have a follow up at\n      3, 6, 12, and 24 weeks after they receive their injection."

A 30% reduction between baseline and endpoint score over a period of 6 months, without the use of analgesia beyond what is allowed according to protocol, use of adjunctive conservative therapy (excluding physiotherapy), or the patient seeking alternative therapy, will deem the treatment successful.
