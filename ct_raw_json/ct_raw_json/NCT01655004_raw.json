            "textblock": "Aromatase inhibitors have led to significant improvements in clinical outcomes for women\n      with postmenopausal hormone receptor-positive advanced breast cancer. However, there is a\n      notable absence of phase III comparisons among the three agents and therefore no clear\n      indication of the superiority of one AI over the others. Furthermore, there remains a\n      distinct lack of predictive biomarkers of AI efficacy and toxicity to inform clinical\n      decisions. The metabolic pathways of exemestane have recently been delineated and UGT2B17 is\n      the most active hepatic gluconoryltransferase responsible for the glucuronidation of the\n      crucial active exemestane metabolite, 17-dihydroxyexemestane. The UGT2B17*2/*2 deletion\n      genotype is associated with markedly reduced glucuronidation of 17-dihydroxyexemestane in\n      vitro and is found more commonly in Asians than Caucasians (60-70% vs less than 10%). Our\n      research group recently demonstrated significant reduction in glucuronidation of vorinostat,\n      a UGT2B17 substrate, with a trend towards improved clinical benefit rate and\n      progression-free survival in Asian breast cancer patients who were UGT2B17*2 homozygotes\n      treated with this compound. In-vivo studies correlating UGT2B17*2 genotype with exemestane\n      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics are lacking. We hypothesize that individuals with\n      UGT2B17*2/*2 genotype have reduced glucuronidation of 17-dihydroxyexemestane and therefore\n      have increased exposure to the active drug, resulting in improved treatment efficacy. We\n      propose a study of exemestane in hormone receptor positive post-menopausal advanced breast\n      cancer patients with prospective correlation of treatment outcome by UGT2B17 genotype. The\n      primary endpoint is the correlation of genotype (UGT2B17*2/*2 vs those with at least one\n      wild-type variant) with clinical benefit rate, and secondary endpoints include its\n      association with exemestane pharmacokinetics, progression-free survival, overall survival\n      and musculoskeletal toxicities."
