  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      -  Vascular inflammation is a key factor in both the pathogenesis and outcome of
           atherosclerosis. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) is a
           promising tool for identifying and quantifying vascular inflammation within
           atherosclerotic plaques.

        -  Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is closely associated with many
           cardiometabolic risk factors. NAFLD can be detected by measuring liver fat accumulation
           using computed tomography (CT).

        -  Also epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) volume as determined by computed tomography (CT)
           is an independent marker of cardiovascular events in the general population.

        -  Therefore, the purpose of this investigators study is to compare the NAFLD severity and
           EAT volume with FDG uptake measured by PET/CT.
