However, CTC positivity in breast cancer patients has been\n      recently recognized as an independent prognostic factor and proposed as an early indicator\n      for therapy response. In this respect, we postulated that changes in the proportion of\n      CTC-positive patients before and after general anesthesia would help to determine the effect\n      of anesthesia on tumor recurrence.\n\n        -  Trial with medicinal product"
