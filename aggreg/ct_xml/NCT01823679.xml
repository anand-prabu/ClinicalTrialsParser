    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well capecitabine works in treating patients with advanced
      or recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as
      capecitabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing
      the cells or by stopping them from dividing.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To establish the objective response rate, using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
      Tumors (RECIST) criteria, to capecitabine in patients with metastatic or
      unresectable/recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To establish the safety profile, progression free and overall survival of capecitabine in
      this patient population.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive capecitabine orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-14. Courses repeat
      every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 2 years.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have squamous cell carcinoma of the skin; patients with &quot;unknown
             primary lesions&quot; at the time of diagnosis, if metastatic disease present with a
             history of plausible primary skin site removed in the past, are eligible; for
             example, patients with squamous cell carcinoma in neck or parotid lymph nodes with no
             identifiable mucosal primary but with a history of the removal of one or more early
             stage squamous cell carcinomas of the skin in an anatomically relevant lymphatic
             drainage region would be eligible

          -  Patients must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be
             accurately measured in at least one dimension &gt;= 10 mm with computed tomography (CT)
             scan, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or calipers by clinical exam

          -  There is no limitation to prior treatments with local, regional, topical or systemic
             agents except for prior systemic treatment with 5- fluorouracil or prodrugs thereof;
             prior topical treatment with 5- fluorouracil is permitted; there is no restriction on
             timing of last treatments as long as patients have recovered from expected toxicities
             of greater than grade 1 and at least 5 half-lives of the last systemically
             administered agent have passed

             (ULN) if patient has Gilbert's syndrome (elevated unconjugated bilirubin from
             decreased UDP glucuronosyltransferase 1 family, polypeptide A1 [UGT1A1] activity)

          -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase
             [SGOT])/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase [SGPT])
             =&lt; 2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal or up to 5 X ULN if known to be caused
             by liver metastases

          -  Creatinine less than 1.3 mg/dL OR creatinine clearance &gt;= 30 mL/min/1.73 m^2 for
             patients with creatinine levels above institutional normal; note creatinine
             clearances between 30 and 49 mg/dL necessitate dose modification

          -  Patients must not be candidates for curative locoregional treatments; patients with
             recurrent locoregional disease following surgery and/ or radiation for which a
             resection is unacceptably morbid and unlikely to be curative are eligible

          -  Multi gated acquisition scan (MUGA)/echocardiogram must show ejection fraction (EF)
             &gt;= 50% for patients with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD)/myocardial
             infarction (MI)/congestive heart failure (CHF) or as clinically indicated (principal
             investigator [PI] discretion)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents or anti-cancer treatments

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to capecitabine

          -  While not excluded, patients taking Coumadin-derivative anticoagulants (warfarin) or
             phenytoin must have international normalized ratio (INR) or drug levels monitored
             frequently

          -  Uncontrolled concurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements

          -  Pregnant and lactating women are not eligible for this study

          -  Prior treatment with systemic capecitabine or fluorouracil (5-FU) therapy
