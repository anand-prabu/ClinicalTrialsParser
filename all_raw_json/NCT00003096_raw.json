Tumors are also screened for specific abnormalities by fluorescent in\n      situ hybridization (FISH), which detects chromosomal rearrangements, including balanced\n      translocations, deletions, amplifications, etc. PCR-based microsatellite polymorphism\n      analysis may also be performed.\n\n      Primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNETs) are screened by FISH with a distal 17p13.3 cosmid\n      and a 17q25 cosmid to identify tumors with a 17p deletion. Atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors\n      and PNETs without a 17p deletion are screened by FISH with a series of cosmids from 22q11.2.\n      PNETs are also screened by interphase FISH with cosmids from chromosome 6 to identify tumors\n      with deletions.\n\n      Patients do not receive the results of the genetic testing and the results do not influence\n      the type or duration of treatment.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: This study will accrue 360 specimens."
