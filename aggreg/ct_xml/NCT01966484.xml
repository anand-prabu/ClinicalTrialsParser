  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Succinylcholine is commonly used for neuromuscular relaxation for short procedures such as
      rigid bronchoscopy. A alternative is the application of low dose mivacurium, reversed with
      neostigmine. The investigators compare the intubating conditions, incidence of postoperative
      myalgia (POM), patient satisfaction and the postoperative performance with respiration
      exercise device for these two muscle relaxants.
