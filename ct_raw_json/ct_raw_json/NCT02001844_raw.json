Such systems, while popular,\n      still remain unproven. Recent studies in paediatric rheumatology have made a contribution in\n      developing guidelines with regards to pharmacological intervention in arthritic children. In\n      addition, specific drug therapy  protocols have been published to effectively help general\n      practitioners, physiotherapists and ophthalmologists to successfully treat children with JIA\n      patients (BSPAR 2006; Hull 2001; NICE guidelines 2002). A Cochrane systematic review on\n      treatment of pes planus, highlighted that children with JIA were excluded as a group from\n      most of the studies (Ashford et al. 2005). At present little evidence exists for the\n      podiatric management of children affected by this disabling pathology, especially for\n      orthotic management. This research has provided evidence to support the use of readily\n      available off-the-shelf FOs in treating JIA children."

The foot orthoses (FOs) prescribed to JIA children so far appeared to be\n      very expensive and required long time to manufacture before the fitting. This randomised\n      controlled trial (RCT) aimed to determine whether pre-formed FOs that can be prescribed at\n      chair side, impacted on pain, quality of life (primary outcomes) and/or gait-parameters\n      (secondary outcomes) in children affected by JIA.\n\n      Methods - The study took place at the Gait Analysis laboratory at Queen Margaret University\n      - Edinburgh and at the TORT Centre, Ninewells Hospital-Dundee. Children with JIA were\n      diagnosed according to the ILAR criteria. Intervention was blinded to the patients. The\n      trial group received Slimflex-plus FOs, with the addition of chair side corrections and the\n      control FOs supplied were made with leather board (1mm thick) only. Both FOs had the same\n      black EVA top cover. Primary outcomes were investigated using validated questionnaires (VAS,\n      CHAQ and PedsQL). Tekscan\u2122 equipment (F-Scan\u2122 and HR Walkway\u00ae) measured secondary outcomes\n      in-shoe pressure and force data with and without FOs intervention. Multiple foot strikes and\n      repetitive gait patterns were compared pre and post-treatment. Primary and secondary outcome\n      measures were recorded at baseline, 3rd and 6th month's period."
