Patients\n      remaining anovulatory by day 49 receive metformin or placebo plus escalating doses of oral\n      clomiphene citrate daily for 5 consecutive days, beginning on days 50, 80, and 110.\n      Following ovulation, treatment with clomiphene citrate and metformin or placebo continues\n      until 6 ovulatory cycles occur, pregnancy occurs, or anovulation persists. Patients\n      receiving the placebo arm who have not ovulated on the highest dose of clomiphene citrate\n      may be crossed over to receive metformin after a 6 week washout."
