    <textblock>
      This study will determine the safety of allogeneic stem cell therapy from healthy donors,
      for 2nd degree burn wounds of less than 20% Total Body Surface Area (TBSA), at four
      different dose levels.

      Clinical evaluation will take place at weekly intervals until wound closure and then monthly
      for a period of no less than 12 months.

      Once the safety and dose-response analysis in Specific Aim 1 is completed, an expanded trial
      will be initiated to better examine the efficacy of MSC therapy in 2nd degree burn wounds.
      Specific Aim 1 will establish the maximum safe dose that will be used in this Phase II
      efficacy tria

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will include a Phase 1 (Aim 1) and Phase 2 (Aim 2) trial. A tissue repository will
      be collected (Aim 3). The recipients in the Phases 1 and 2 of the study will be inpatients
      at Jackson. Their enrollment will continue into the outpatient setting, where the length of
      time is not expected to exceed 6-12 months. The donors will be recruited through the
      University of Miami (UM). The donors will present for 2 clinic visits with involvement being
      no more than 2 weeks.

      RECIPIENTS

      Recipients will be screened upon presentation to the hospital. To establish enrollment, the
      wound will be examined and measured. A complete medical history and physical exam will be
      performed. Blood will be collected to test for blood bourne pathogens, including hepatitis
      and HIV. A pregnancy test will be done for females. Once the patient is enrolled, MSC's will
      be applied according to the dose and frequency determined by the Phase 1 trial. At various
      intervals, skin biopsies, wound measurements, questionnaires and possibly bone marrow
      aspirate may be performed (see below).

      Study Design for Specific Aim 1:

      This will represent the Phase 1 portion of the study. It will asses the safety of delivering
      MSC's to burn wounds. A total of 20 patients will be recruited and divided into 4 groups.
      These groups will be taken through a dose escalation method, i.e. the first group will be
      started on the lowest dose. If there are no adverse reactions, the second group will receive
      a higher dose. This will be repeated for the third and fourth groups with each receiving a
      higher dose. If necessary, a second dose of MSC's will be given. Each administration will be
      given no less than 10 days apart but no more than 8 weeks apart. Second doses will not be
      given until it is evident that no significant adverse events occured from the first
      administration. There will be a maximum of 2 administrations of MSC's. At the end of each
      dose level, safety data will be presented to the Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB) and
      the Institutional Review Board (IRB). If there were no significant adverse events or
      concerns from either party, the protocol will continue to the next dose level.

      Rejection will be monitored with blood tests before and after receiving MSC's, as well as
      clinical evaluation. Upon discharge from the hospital, patients will be asked to come to
      clinic weekly during treatment. These visits may then occur at 1-4 week intervals depending
      on the course of the individual patient. Home nursing care may be arranged if necessary for
      dressing changes. During clinic visits, the wounds will be assessed and questionnaires done.
      During this time, the patients will also have necessary evaluations and sessions with
      physical and occupational therapy. Once the wound is considered healed, patients may be
      asked to return to clinic monthly to ensure that the wound remains healed.

      At the completion of the Phase 1 trial, all safety data will be sent to the DSMB, monitor,
      IRB and FDA. If no significant safety issues arise, the study will progress to Phase 2 (Aim
      2).

      Study Design for Specific Aim 2:

      Once approval to proceed is obtained, the study will progress to the Phase 2 portion, which
      will assess the efficacy of MSC's. Eighty patients will be randomized to one of two groups:
      (i) standard of care with MSC's or (ii) standard of care alone. These patients will undergo
      the same screening process used for the Phase 1 trial. Upon discharge, care will be similar
      to that of the Phase 1 trial with weekly clinic visits and eventually monthly clinic visits.
      The dose and frequency of MSC application will be dependent on the results of the Phase 1
      trial.

      Specific Aim 3:

      During the course of the study, many samples will be taken. These include serum, blood
      cells, tissue and skin cells. These samples may be taken from donors and recipients. These
      sample may be able to provide insight into biomarkers which may be used to predict healing
      and scarring. As such, they may be stored for further, non-clinical research in the tissue
      repository. Patients would have signed away their rights to these samples.

      SCHEDULE FOR RECIPIENTS (all Phase 1 patients and those receiving MSC's in Phase 2.

      Week 1:

      Health and medications will be recorded. A sample of blood will be drawn for safety and
      research purposes. A skin biopsy from the wound will be performed and the wound will be
      evaluated/measured. As an inpatient, MSC's will be applied to the wound. A film dressing to
      hold the cells in place may be applied. This dressing would be removed 12-48 hours
      post-operatively. The wound will be dressed with the appropriate dressing for the specific
      type of wound. Wounds will also be photographed.

      Week 3 to 26:

      Patients will return to clinic. An additional sample of blood may be obtained for research
      purposes. If this is the case, only one blood draw will occur during this period.
      Questionnaires will be completed with inquiries into changes in health and medications.
      Wounds will be evaluated and measured, as well as photographed. Dead tissue will be cleaned
      if necessary. Appropriate dressing changes will be done. If needed, MSC's will be applied to
      wounds on multiple occasions. Each application will be no less than 10 days apart but no
      more than 8 weeks apart. Again if cells are applied, a film dressing to hold the cells in
      may be applied. This dressing can be removed in 12-48 hours.

      Signs of rejection will be monitored. A blood test will be done 1 hour prior to and again
      1-2 weeks after receiving the second dose of MSC's. Skin biopsies will also be performed. If
      there is no evidence of rejection or reaction, patients will continue in the study and be
      eligible to receive more donor cells. However, if rejection or reaction is suspected,
      patients will no longer be eligible to receive any more donor cells.

      Week 26 - 52 or End of Treatment Visit:

      If the wound is healed, a biopsy of the wound may be done. A sample of blood to be drawn for
      research purposes. These patients will return to clinic monthly to ensure that the wound
      stays closed. If the wound remains unhealed, it will be measured and photographed. A skin
      biopsy from the wound will be performed. Note that patients with healed wounds may refuse
      biopsy. Appropriate dressing changes will be done. Questions about health and medications
      will be asked. During healing, patients will come to clinic weekly.

      DONORS

      Approximately 10 donor will be used to harvest MSC's. Initially, potential donors will
      present for a screening visit. Here, a physical exam will be done, in addition to a
      screening questionnaire. Medical history will be collected. Blood samples will also be taken
      to be tested for blood bourne pathogens, including hepatitis and HIV. A urine sample will be
      collected as well. If a potential donor meets the screening criteria, they will return for a
      second, 'donation' visit. At this visit, vital signs will be recorded and a bone marrow
      aspirate will be done. The bone marrow aspirates will be done by Dr. John Byrnes, a
      hematologist/oncologist who routinely performs these aspirates for the stem cell trials here
      at UM. This second visit will take place within 2 weeks of the initial visit. An optional
      biomarker test may be involved. The evaluation of specific biomarkers may help to determine
      the effect of stem cell delivery to burn wounds. In order to provide this type of
      examination, removal and analysis of nucleic acids derived from donor materials may be
      needed. If the donor agrees, a separate genetic research consent will be provided to the
      donor.

      GENETIC TESTING

      The optional biomarker/genetic tests may be performed on materials obtained from both donors
      and recipients. The samples could include bone marrow aspirate, blood and tissue. The tests
      will be performed primarily to detect the expressions of levels of genes important for
      healing, tissue repair and inflammation.
