Cholesterol\n      lowering medications are a medically proven intervention that dramatically reduces the risk\n      of primary and secondary cardiovascular outcomes.However, the literature shows that at one\n      year only half of the patients prescribed this medication continue to take a statin. One\n      well known risk factor shown to be a predictor for non adherence is belonging to a racial/\n      ethnic minority group.\n\n      The focus of the proposed study is to examine a non-traditional care-management approach\n      delivered by a large commercial health benefit carrier in the prevention of cardiovascular\n      disease among minority populations who have cardiovascular risk factors and who have been\n      started in cholesterol lowering therapy. In particular, we seek to determine if a culturally\n      tailored phone based intervention (Motivational Interviewing) delivered to Latino and\n      African American enrollees living in predominantly minority neighborhoods in Florida, is\n      effective at improving adherence to Statins.\n\n      Specific Aims\n\n        1. To prospectively identify 1200 Latino or African American residing in Florida who have\n           received a new prescription for statin therapy, evaluate their adherence to the statin\n           and determine if the reasons for non-adherence are similar or different from other\n           studies of adherence to cardiovascular medications.\n\n        2. Conduct a randomized control trial to compare the effectiveness of a motivational\n           interviewing telephonic intervention to usual care on the primary outcome of statin\n           adherence among minority subjects living in Florida.\n\n      In addition, among the tobacco users at baseline we will evaluate the impact of our phone\n      based MINT intervention on tobacco cessation in this minority populations."
