Life-time incidence of urolithiasis is estimated to be between 5%- 12%.\n      The treatment of kidney stones depends on stone type and size, symptom severity, and the\n      presence of obstruction.\n\n      URS is a common ambulatory procedure as improved technological advances and increased\n      clinical utilization have helped decrease postoperative complications.  Despite an overall\n      reduction in the perioperative complication rate, post operative pain management after URS\n      remains a major factor delaying discharge of patients.\n\n      Post operative pain after URS is usually treated with opioids and non steroidal anti\n      inflammatory drugs.  Intranasal ketorolac (SprixTM) is an FDA approved pain formulation for\n      short term management (5 days) of moderate to moderately severe pain that requires analgesia\n      at the opioid level.  The efficacy of intranasal ketorolac formulation was demonstrated in\n      placebo-controlled studies in patients following major surgeries.\n\n      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the role perioperative usage of\n      single-dose of intranasal ketorolac on immediate post operative opioid requirements.\n      Secondary objectives of the study are to (a) evaluate the post operative pain score 30\n      minutes after surgery, 1 hour after surgery, and 2 hours after surgery, (b) find the\n      incidence of immediate (until discharge) and 24hrs post operative side effects in the target\n      population, (c) find the level of anesthesia satisfaction in the target population, (d) find\n      the time to discharge in the target population, (e) compare the two groups post anesthesia\n      discharge score."
