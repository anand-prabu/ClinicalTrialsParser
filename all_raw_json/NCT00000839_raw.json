Although ddI has been approved for use in HIV-infected adults and older\n      children, the safety and pharmacokinetics of ddI in pregnant women has not yet been\n      determined.\n\n      Patients receive a single IV dose of ddI on day 1 and pharmacokinetics values are\n      determined. At least 48 hours but no more than 1 week after the IV dose, patients receive an\n      oral dose, and oral pharmacokinetics are obtained for 8 hours. Oral ddI is then administered\n      every 12 hours until labor commences and then after delivery, every 12 hours until 6 weeks\n      postpartum. During labor and delivery, patients receive a loading dose of ddI followed by\n      continuous infusion. Pharmacokinetics are obtained during infusion and also at 6 weeks\n      postpartum.
