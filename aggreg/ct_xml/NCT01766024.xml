  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized double-blind crossover study of pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and
      tolerability of BCD-033 (interferon beta-1a manufactured by CJSC BIOCAD, Russia) and Rebif®
      (Merck Serono S.p.A.., Italy) in healthy volunteers. The purpose of the study is to
      demonstrate the non-inferiority of pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and tolerability
      parameters  after single subcutaneous injection. Each dtug will be administered to each
      volunteer at a dose of 44 µg as a single subcutaneous injection with an interval of at least
      14 days.
