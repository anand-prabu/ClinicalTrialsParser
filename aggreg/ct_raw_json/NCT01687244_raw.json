The pharmacodynamics of\n      INSTILADRIN will also be studied by measuring the interferon (IFN\u03b12b) levels excreted in the\n      urine.  rAd-IFN is a non-replicating recombinant adenovirus type 5 (Ad5)-vector encoding the\n       interferon alpha-2b (IFN\u03b12b) gene. Syn 3 is clinical surfactant excipient which enhances\n      the ability of the adenoviral vector to transfect cells in the bladder wall."
