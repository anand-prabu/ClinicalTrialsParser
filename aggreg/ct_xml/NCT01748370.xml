  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low total testosterone (TT) is present in about 30% of men aged &gt;60 years and in up to 7% of
      younger men. Male hypogonadism is associated with metabolic and cardiovascular diseases as
      well as with increased mortality. There is evidence showing a relationship of TT with
      vitamin D in men. We aim at evaluating the effect of vitamin D supplementation on TT and
      metabolic parameters in hypogonadal men. We will study the effects of 20,000 IU vitamin D
      weekly in a 12 wk randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 100 men with TT &lt;3.0
      ng/ml and 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) &lt;30 ng/ml (patients) as well as in 100 men with TT
      ≥3.0 ng/ml and 25(OH)D &lt;30 ng/ml (controls). Vitamin D supplementation might be a safe
      therapeutic approach improving TT levels as well as metabolic parameters in hypogonadal men.
      Further the effects of vitamin D on androgens will be evaluated in eugonadal men.
