            "textblock": "Background:\n\n      - Present treatment for hepatitis C includes the use of a weekly injection and two different\n      pills. This treatment is associated with serious side effects. Drugs that can be taken by\n      mouth and cure HCV infection without serious side effects would be a great help to the large\n      number of people infected with HCV. GS-7977 and GS-5885 are new medications being developed\n      to treat the hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. They are still being researched and are not\n      approved by the Food and Drug Administration. They are being developed as treatment for\n      hepatitis C as a single pill taken once a day.\n\n      Objectives:\n\n      - To determine whether a combination of the two study drugs can safely and effectively treat\n      HCV infection in people with HIV infection and who do not have cirrhosis of the liver.\n\n      Eligibility:\n\n      - Individuals who have HIV infection and have liver disease caused by infection with HCV.\n\n      Design:\n\n        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood samples\n           will be collected. Urine samples will be collected from participants who might become\n           pregnant. If a participant has not had a liver biopsy in the past 3 years, one will be\n           required.\n\n        -  Participants will take one pill daily for 12 weeks. This pill will be a combination of\n           the two study drugs.\n\n        -  Treatment will be monitored with frequent clinic visits and blood tests over a total of\n           60 weeks."

            "textblock": "Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major public health problem with an estimated\n      180 million people infected worldwide. In the US an estimated 4.1 million people are\n      infected with HCV which is the principal cause of death from liver disease and leading\n      indication for liver transplantation. Significant advances have been made with the approval\n      of directly acting antivirals (DAA) namely the protease inhibitors, telaprevir (TVR) and\n      boceprevir (BOC) which have been shown to significantly improve rates of sustained virologic\n      response (SVR).  Response rates to these new combinations in HIV/HCV are also very\n      promising, however treatment has been characterized with high rates of toxicities.\n\n      Recently several trials have confirmed the efficacy of potent DAA therapy without\n      concomitant IFN in the treatment of HCV monoinfected individuals. Given the improved\n      response rates achieved with a combination of DAAs with fast HCV suppression and improved\n      side-effect profiles; and the need for better therapy for HIV/HCV co-infected subjects, we\n      propose a study to determine the safety, tolerability and efficacy of 12 weeks of treatment\n      with a fixed dose combination of GS-7977 and GS-5885 in HIV/HCV Genotype 1 (GT-1) subjects.\n      We hypothesize that anti-HCV therapy that does not rely on the host immune system will\n      provide an enhanced rate of SVR among HIV/HCV GT-1 coinfected subjects. The findings from\n      this study will aid in our understanding of determinants of response to an IFN-free regimen\n      in HIV/HCV coinfected individuals."
