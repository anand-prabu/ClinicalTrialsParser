Drugs used in\n      chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or\n      die. It is not yet known whether surgery plus radiation therapy is more effective than\n      chemotherapy plus radiation therapy for head and neck cancer.\n\n      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying surgery and radiation therapy to see\n      how well they work compared to chemotherapy and radiation therapy in treating patients with\n      stage III or stage IV head and neck cancer that can be removed during surgery."

Patients are stratified according to primary site of\n      disease (oral cavity/oropharynx vs larynx/hypopharynx vs others) and nodal status (node\n      negative vs positive).\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients undergo resection of the tumor, followed no more than 6 weeks later by\n           radiotherapy to the primary tumor and upper neck once a day, 5 days a week, for 6\n           weeks.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients undergo radiotherapy in addition to chemotherapy with fluorouracil and\n           cisplatin. Radiotherapy is given once a day, 5 days a week, for 6.5 weeks to the\n           primary tumor and upper neck. Fluorouracil and cisplatin are administered by continuous\n           infusion for 4 days beginning on day 1 of the first week of radiotherapy. A second\n           course of fluorouracil and cisplatin is given on day 28.\n\n      Patients who have failed or are suspected to have failed chemo-radiotherapy should be\n      considered for salvage surgery.\n\n      Patients are followed once a month for the first year, every 2 months for the second year,\n      every 3 months for the third year, and every 6 months thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 200 patients will be accrued over a 4-5 year period."
