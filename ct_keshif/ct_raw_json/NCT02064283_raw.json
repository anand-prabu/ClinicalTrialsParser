Researchers\n      are using this new MRI technology to track the diffusion, or movement, of water through\n      tumor tissue, and map these changes as a cancer patient undergoes treatment. Early research\n      seems to indicate that tumor cells restrict the movement of water, so as tumor cells die,\n      the movement of water changes within the tumor. These changes in the movement (diffusion) of\n      water may help doctors determine earlier than traditional tests whether a patient's cancer\n      is responding (getting better) to treatment. This study will evaluate the feasibility of\n      identifying changes in diffusion MRI characteristics of bone that correlates with response\n      to therapy in men with metastatic prostate cancer."
