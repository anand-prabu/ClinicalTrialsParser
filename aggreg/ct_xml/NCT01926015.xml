  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate the immunogenicity of the Diphtheria, Tetanus, Pertussis and
      Inactivated Poliovirus Vaccine (DTP-IPV) with concomitant administration of V260 (RotaTeq™)
      in healthy Japanese infants. The hypothesis to be tested is that the antibody response rates
      to DTP-IPV with concomitant administration of V260 are non-inferior to those with staggered
      administration of V260.
