Tumor progress during intensified\n           Perioperative chemotherapy is likely to indicate a particularly poor prognosis\n           suggesting that these patients would not have benefitted from immediate surgery.\n\n        -  Assess tumor response/downsizing using nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine also at the molecular\n           level\n\n        -  Can we achieve a better systemic tumor control or reduce the metastatic spread using\n           nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine compared to adjuvant gemcitabine\n\n        -  Examining the effect of a more efficacious chemotherapy regimen\n           (nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine) in the adjuvant setting\n\n        -  Defining the impact of a perioperative or adjuvant chemotherapy with\n           gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel on DFS and 3-year Overall survival (OS)\n\n      Histopathological tumor regression will be evaluated in addition to tumor size measurement\n      according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST). We will establish a\n      histopathological tumor regression score to evaluate the efficacy of the Perioperative\n      treatment. For this score we will examine tumor core biopsies obtained prior to\n      Perioperative treatment and histological tumor specimen after surgery in both arms.\n\n      To reliably determine R0 resections, the resected specimen will be prepared for pathology in\n      a defined manner according to the procedure set out in the German S3 guidelines for\n      pancreatic cancer.\n\n      This current trial provides a unique opportunity for translational research in pancreatic\n      cancer since we can obtain tumor tissue prior to and after surgery for biomarker analysis\n      and correlation with outcome. Tumor core biopsies will be used to compare pre- and\n      post-intervention DNA mutation profiles in the tumor tissue. In addition, we will obtain\n      blood samples for tumor DNA analysis in the perioperative and the adjuvant study,\n      respectively."
