Subject has clearly visible fat on intended treatment area, which in the\n             investigator's opinion, may benefit from the treatment(s).\n\n          3. Subject has not had weight change exceeding 10 pounds in the preceding month.\n\n          4. Subject with body mass index (BMI) less than 30. BMI is defined as weight in pounds\n             multiplied by 703 divided by the square of the height in inches.\n\n          5. Subject agrees to maintain his/her weight (i.e., within 5 pounds) by not making any\n             major changes in their diet or lifestyle during the course of the study.\n\n          6. Subject has read and signed a written informed consent form.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria\n\n          1. Subject presents a significant asymmetry of intended treatment areas.\n\n          2. Subject has had a surgical procedure(s) in the area of intended treatment in the past\n             5 years..\n\n          3. Subject has had an invasive fat reduction procedure (e.g., liposuction,\n             abdominoplasty, mesotherapy) in the area of intended treatment in the past 5 years.\n\n          4. Subject has had a non-invasive fat reduction and/or body contouring procedure in the\n             area of intended treatment within the past 6 months.\n\n          5. Subject needs to administer, or has a known history of subcutaneous injections into\n             the area of intended treatment (e.g., heparin, insulin) within the past month.\n\n          6. Subject has a known history of cryoglobulinemia, cold urticaria, or paroxysmal cold\n             hemoglobinuria.\n\n          7. Subject has a known history of Raynaud's disease, or any known condition with a\n             response to cold exposure that limits blood flow to the skin.\n\n          8. Subject has a history of bleeding disorder or is taking any medication that in the\n             investigator's opinion may increase the subject's risk of bruising.\n\n          9. Subject is taking or has taken diet pills or weight control supplements within the\n             past month.\n\n         10. Subject has any dermatological conditions, such as moderate to excessive skin laxity,\n             or scars in the location of the treatment sites that may interfere with the treatment\n             or evaluation (stretch marks is not an exclusion).\n\n         11. Subject has an active implanted device such as a pacemaker, defibrillator, or drug\n             delivery system.\n\n         12. Subject is pregnant or intending to become pregnant in the next 5 months.\n\n         13. Subject is lactating or has been lactating in the past 6 months.\n\n         14. Subject has a history of hernia in the areas to be treated.\n\n         15. Subject is unable or unwilling to comply with the study requirements.\n\n         16. Subject is currently enrolled in a clinical study of any other unapproved\n             investigational drug or device.\n\n         17. Any other condition or laboratory value that would, in the professional opinion of\n             the investigator, potentially affect the subject's response or the integrity of the\n             data or would pose an unacceptable risk to the subject."
