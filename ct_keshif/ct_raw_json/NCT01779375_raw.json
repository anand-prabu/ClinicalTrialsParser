Pediatric participants (ages 10-19) will be randomized to one of the following\n      treatment regimens: (1) metformin alone or (2) early intensive treatment with basal insulin\n      glargine followed by metformin.\n\n      The primary clinical question RISE will address is: Are improvements in \u00df-cell function\n      following 12 months of active treatment maintained for 3 months following the withdrawal of\n      therapy?  Secondary outcomes will assess durability of glucose tolerance following\n      withdrawal of therapy, and whether biomarkers obtained in the fasting state predict\n      parameters of \u00df-cell function, insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance and the response to\n      an intervention."
