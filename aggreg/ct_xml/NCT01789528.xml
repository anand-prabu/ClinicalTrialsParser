    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of administration of CAZ-AVI and CXL
      on the intestinal flora of male and female healthy volunteers after multiple administrations
      over 7 days. An assessment of the effect on intestinal flora is an important aspect to
      understand for the safe clinical use of the investigational products and is expected by
      regulatory agencies.

             procedures

          2. Healthy male and female volunteers aged 18 to 45 years (inclusive) with suitable
             veins for cannulation or repeated venepuncture.

             Females: Female healthy volunteers are authorised to participate in this study if
             both of the following criteria are met:

               1. A negative serum pregnancy test BOTH at screening AND at admission to the study
                  centre.

               2. Agrees not to attempt pregnancy while receiving investigational product and for
                  a period of 7 days after last investigational product administration, and agrees
                  to the use of  acceptable methods of contraception (according to instructions)
                  prior to, during, and for 7 days after the last investigational product
                  administration.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History or presence of gastrointestinal, hepatic, or renal disease or any other
             condition known to interfere with the absorption, distribution, metabolism, or
             excretion of drugs.

          2. Any clinically significant abnormalities in physical examination, ECG, clinical
             chemistry, haematology, coagulation, or urinalysis results, as judged by the
             investigator.

          3. Pregnant or breastfeeding female healthy volunteers.

          4. History of any clinically significant disease or disorder which, in the opinion of
             the investigator, may either put the healthy volunteer at risk because of
             participation in the study, or influence the results or the healthy volunteer's
             ability to participate in the study.

          5. Known history of Clostridium difficile infection in last 3 months.
