This study will be conducted in 3 parts (Part 1, Part\n      2, and Part 3). The study consists of 3 phases including, the screening phase (within 21\n      days prior to the start of study medication), treatment phase (Part 1: 20 days; Part 2: 12\n      days; Part 3: 16 days), and the follow-up phase (Part 1 and Part 2: approximately 14 days\n      after the last administration of study medication and Part 3: 14 days after the last\n      administration of ketaconazole). Approximately 36 participants will be enrolled in the study\n      (12 participants in each part). Part 1 is randomized (study medication is assigned by\n      chance) and 3-way cross-over (method used to switch participants from one treatment arm to\n      another in a clinical study) part of the study. Participants in Part 1 will be randomly\n      assigned to 1 of 3 treatment sequences (Period 1, Period 2, and Period 3) to receive single\n      dose of 3 formulations of JNJ-40411813 (Formulation A: hard gelatin capsule filled with\n      beads; Formulation B: immediate release tablet; and Formulation C: nanosuspension\n      formulation) without food. Each period will be separated by a wash out period (no treatment)\n      of at least 1 week. Part 2 is randomized and 2-way cross-over part of the study.\n      Participants in Part 2 will be randomly assigned 1 of 2 treatment sequences (Period 1 and\n      Period 2) to receive single dose of the selected solid dose formulation of JNJ-40411813 from\n      Part 1 without food and with food separated by a wash out period of at least 1 week. Part 3\n      is single-arm sequential (carried out in a staged approach) part of the study. Participants\n      in Part 3 will receive single dose of the selected solid dose formulation of JNJ-40411813\n      from Part 1 on two occasions (Day 1 and Day 10) without food along with ketoconazole from\n      Day 6 to Day 14 with food. Safety will be evaluated by the assessment of adverse events,\n      vital signs, physical examination, 12-lead electrocardiogram, and clinical laboratory tests\n      which will be monitored throughout the study. The total duration of study participation for\n      a participant will be 8 weeks."
