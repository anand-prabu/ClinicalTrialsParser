In this study,\n      patients with stable rheumatoid arthritis will undergo a simple examination of their joints\n      to look for any swelling or tenderness followed by an ultrasound scan to look for joint\n      inflammation. Half of the patients will also complete an interview to assess their views and\n      opinions of arthritis drug treatment. The study will be completed in a single patient visit\n      - no invasive tests will be performed, and no changes to treatment will be made.\n\n      This study is being conducted as part of a Masters degree from Newcastle University. The\n      results of this study will be used to inform the feasibility of inclusion of ultrasound\n      assessment within the design of a future PhD study to investigate potential markers of\n      remission in patients with rheumatoid arthritis."
