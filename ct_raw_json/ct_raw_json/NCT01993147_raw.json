Each participant will also perform some computer tasks that\n      have been shown in previous studies to require effortful control while undergoing an fMRI\n      (functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging) which takes a special kind of picture of the brain.\n      Our goal is to learn more about the brain mechanisms by which methylphenidate improves\n      effortful control."

The first\n      visit will require one to complete various questionnaires regarding behavior and general\n      health and takes about 1 hour to complete. The second visit will be scheduled approximately\n      2 to 7 days after the first study visit and includes the fMRI scanning session. The second\n      visit will last about 3 hours."
