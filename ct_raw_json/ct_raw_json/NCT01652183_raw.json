Each patient received patient-controlled intravenous analgesia by meperidine (10 mg bolus, 20-minute lock-out, no infusion dose and 4 hour limit) for postoperative analgesia. All patients were planned to receive tenoxicam 20 mg intravenously as a rescue analgesic when visual analogue scale (VAS) was >3."

Catheter-related bladder\n      discomfort (CRBD) symptoms associated with indwelling urinary catheter are similar to\n      overactive bladder symptoms such as discomfort in the suprapubic region, urinary urgency,\n      frequency, burning sensation with or without urge incontinence. Paracetamol is a drug with\n      proven efficiency for the management of mild and moderate postoperative pain. In this study,\n      the investigators hypothesized to address the effect of single-dose intravenous paracetamol\n      on postoperative CRBD following percutaneous nephrolithotomy surgery (PNL)."
