We hypothesize that the use of mobile technology (iBGStar\u00ae\n      technology [iPhone\u00ae plus the BGStar\u00ae]) will result  in improvement in Patient Reported\n      Outcomes (PRO), and Treatment Satisfactions with a possible reductions of glucose\n      excursions, A1c, and severe hypoglycemia as compared to routine clinical care using\n      traditional glucose meter SMBG-Accu-chek\u00ae.  This study aims to demonstrate the efficacy of\n      these technologies in a clinical setting with a hope to improve outcomes and health care\n      cost savings.\n\n      The study will enroll 100 patients from the Barbara Davis Center Adult clinic over the age\n      of 18 years who will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to intervention group using mobile\n      technology (iBG Star) vs. continued routine clinical care (control) using SMBG-Accu-chek\n      meter.  All subjects will be followed for study visits with similar frequency at baseline,\n      1-week, 1-month, 3-months, and 6-months and wear a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) using a\n      DexCom SEVEN Plus\u00ae system in a blinded mode for 7 days at baseline (wk0), 1mo, 3mo, and 6mo.\n\n      Laboratory analysis for A1c will be performed at baseline, 1-month 3-months, and 6-months.\n      Routine blood tests will be performed in all subjects at baseline, 3months, and 6-months.\n      Blinded CGM data will be analyzed for mean blood glucose values, time spent in hyperglycemic\n      (>240, >300mg/dl) and hypoglycemic (<50, <70, <80 mg/dl) ranges and various indices of\n      glycemic variability."
