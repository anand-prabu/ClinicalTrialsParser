The protocol was approved from the ethics committee. Selected patients gave their\n      written informed consent. The family practitioners agreed and obtained the collected data\n      and analysis. Analysis of collected data was performed by a single-blinded author (without\n      knowledge of the used test drug and time of collection of data).\n\n      Study Hypothesis: Compare the effect of digoxin and ivabradine in chronic heart failure with\n      permanent atrial fibrillation (ischemic etiology).\n\n      Multiple Time Frames: Primary Outcome is measured before and after each medical\n      intervention.\n\n      Measurements at baseline and after 3 month of therapy (twice, with the 2 different drugs):\n\n      Measurements Severity of dyspnea. Digoxin serum concentration. ECG: Heart rate at rest and\n      during 6-min walking test. Cardiac function (echocardiography): systolic function (ejection\n      rate, left trial size,diastolic function.\n\n      Participants were followed (ambulatory observation) for at least 3 months"
