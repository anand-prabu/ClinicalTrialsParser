            "textblock": "Acute pain is responsible for unnecessary suffering. Among elderly patients, acute pain is\n      frequent and underestimated, especially when these patients have cognitive disorders. The\n      expression of pain is then modified and the conventional tools for evaluating pain cannot be\n      used. Thus the existence of pain must be detected on the basis of a behavioural assessment.\n\n      It is nonetheless necessary to have the assistance of standardised and validated tools. In\n      France, the Doloplus Group has proposed a scale called Doloplus, validated in January 1999,\n      and is now proposing a new scale for acute pain, Algoplus that has been validated in French\n      (4). Doloplus has been recently translated and validated in 5 languages and an identical\n      methodology will be used in this protocol.\n\n      Internationally, although several teams are working on the development of scales that can be\n      used for non-communicating elderly subjects, there is as yet no validated tool for acute\n      pain assessment.\n\n      Considering 1- the lack of tools at an international level and 2- the frequent request from\n      many practitioners worldwide, the Doloplus group has offered to validate the Algoplus\u00ae scale\n      in 5 foreign languages, English, German, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese. A rigorous\n      methodology with the help of a statistician will be used in this validation process."
