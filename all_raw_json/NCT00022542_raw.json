Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.\n\n      Patients receive BMS-247550 IV over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days in the\n      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving complete\n      response receive 2 additional courses.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 4 months for 1 year, and then every 6\n      months for 3 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-29 patients will be accrued for this study within 8 months."
