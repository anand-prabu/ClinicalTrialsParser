Treatment with mBACOD has been promising, but\n      the toxicity is very high. Patients treated with mBACOD have very low white blood cell\n      counts. GM-CSF has increased the number of white blood cells in animal studies and\n      preliminary human studies. It is hoped that including GM-CSF among the drugs given to\n      lymphoma patients will prevent or lessen the decrease in white blood cells caused by mBACOD."

It is hoped that including GM-CSF among the drugs given to\n      lymphoma patients will prevent or lessen the decrease in white blood cells caused by mBACOD.\n\n      Patients admitted to the study receive chemotherapy in 21-day cycles. The length of therapy,\n      2 - 8 months, depends on how the tumor responds to treatment. Four medicines are given on\n      day 1 of each cycle by vein (IV) (doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, bleomycin, vincristine).\n      Dosages of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide are increased in later groups of patients if\n      toxicity in the first group is tolerable. A fifth medicine (dexamethasone) is given by mouth\n      (PO) on days 1 - 5 of each cycle and the sixth medicine (methotrexate) is given IV on day 15\n      of each cycle. Leucovorin is given after methotrexate to prevent methotrexate side effects.\n      GM-CSF treatment is started on day 3 and continued for 11 days. To prevent the spread of the\n      tumor, a spinal tap is done on 4 occasions to inject cytosine arabinoside directly into the\n      spinal fluid. If tumor cells are present in the spinal fluid, the patient also takes\n      cytosine arabinoside by spinal tap 3 x/week until the tumor cells disappear and then at\n      monthly intervals for 1 year. Patients with tumor cells in the spinal fluid are also given\n      radiation treatment to the head."
