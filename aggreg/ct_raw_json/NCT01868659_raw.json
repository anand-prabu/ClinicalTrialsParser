We know how these faulty thinking processes lead to diagnostic errors,\n      but we know little about how to resist them. Faulty thinking has plagued other high-risk,\n      high-reliability professionals, such as airline pilots and nuclear plant operators. These\n      professions have learned from their mistakes and have developed checklists to help prevent\n      them. The medical profession has started to use checklists and time-out periods in the\n      operating room and intensive care unit, but these strategies have not been used to reduce\n      diagnostic errors. The most common reason that physicians fail to make the correct diagnosis\n      is that they never consider it. This failure could potentially be prevented if the physician\n      took a time-out to review a checklist. Our broad long-term goal is to reduce diagnostic\n      errors by developing interventions that help counter faulty diagnostic thinking. The\n      specific aims of this project are to (1) determine the feasibility of taking a diagnostic\n      time-out in the acute outpatient setting (urgent care clinic and emergency department), (2)\n      determine if new diagnostic possibilities are seriously considered as a result of the\n      time-out and checklist, and (3) compare the initial differential diagnosis with the new\n      differential diagnosis following the time-out, and with the discharge diagnosis documented\n      in the medical record, and with the \"final\" diagnosis based on a one-month follow-up. To\n      achieve these aims, the investigators will ask 5 urgent-care physicians to complete a\n      time-out procedure for 10 diagnostically challenging adult patients and 5 physicians will\n      serve as controls (no time out) for 10 diagnostically challenging patients (total of 100\n      patients). The investigator will ask the intervention physicians to take a 2-minute time-out\n      to review a complaint-specific differential-diagnosis checklist, which includes the\n      differential diagnosis for 60 common presenting complaints, such as dyspnea and chest pain.\n      The time-out will occur at the conclusion of the history and physical exam. We will use\n      descriptive statistics and qualitative methods to characterize physicians' reactions to the\n      time-out and checklists. We will use this pilot project to plan a larger study that will\n      determine the risks and benefits of diagnostic time-outs and checklists."
