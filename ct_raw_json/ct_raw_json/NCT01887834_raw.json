            "textblock": "The Canadian College of Naturopathic Medicine is conducting a research study on Irritable\n      Bowel Syndrome (IBS), a common condition in North America. It is a long term, recurring\n      gastrointestinal disorder that is estimated to affect 30% of the general population. IBS is\n      characterized by abdominal pain and cramps, and bowel dysfunction such as diarrhea and\n      bloating.\n\n      The medicines that are currently used to help people with IBS are not as effective as we\n      would like them to be. These medicines are usually only prescribed to reduce the pain of IBS\n      and not actually treat the disorder itself. Recently, scientists have found that probiotics\n      (beneficial bacteria that live inside humans) may help reduce the painful symptoms and\n      diarrhea that are part of IBS.\n\n      This research is being conducted to determine whether this particular combination of three\n      probiotic bacteria (named Lactobacillus gasseri, Bifidobacterium bifidum and Bifidobacterium\n      longum) will reduce the symptoms of severe IBS."
