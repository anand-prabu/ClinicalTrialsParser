            "textblock": "Background:\n\n      - There are two forms of chronic hepatitis B. The difference between the forms is whether or\n      not a viral protein called hepatitis B e antigen is present in the blood. Standard\n      approaches to treating both forms of chronic hepatitis B involve different drugs. One drug\n      is called peginterferon, another is called tenofovir DF. These drugs are often given\n      separately and used for different forms of the disease. However, researchers want to see if\n      combining peginterferon and tenofovir DF will be a more effective treatment than tenofovir\n      DF alone.\n\n      Objectives:\n\n      - To see whether combining tenofovir DF and peginterferon, or using tenofovir DF alone, is a\n      more effective treatment of chronic hepatitis B.\n\n      Eligibility:\n\n      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have chronic hepatitis B and are in the Hepatitis\n      B Research Network Cohort study.\n\n      Design:\n\n        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood, urine,\n           and liver tissue samples will be collected. Bone and liver imaging studies will also be\n           performed.\n\n        -  Participants will be divided into two groups. One group will have tenofovir DF alone\n           for 192 weeks (about 4 years). The other group will have tenofovir DF and peginterferon\n           for 24 weeks (about 6 months), and then tenofovir DF alone for 168 weeks (about 3.5\n           years).\n\n        -  Participants will take the study drugs on the schedule determined by their study\n           doctors. They will keep a diary to record their doses and any side effects.\n\n        -  Participants will have three study visits 4 weeks apart after the starting the\n           treatment. At these visits, they will have a physical exam and provide blood samples.\n           They may also provide urine samples and have imaging studies.\n\n        -  After the first three study visits, participants will continue to have study visits\n           every 12 weeks until the treatment ends at week 192. These visits will have many of the\n           same tests as the first three visits. At some of these visits, they may fill out\n           questionnaires about their quality of life.\n\n        -  Participants who do not respond to the study drugs may have their medications changed.\n           They may also be asked to stop treatment."

A liver biopsy will be obtained at the end-of\n      treatment (week 180-192) to assess improvement in histology.
