In order to\n      alleviate the pain various combinations of pharmaceuticals and administration methods are\n      employed. So as to reduce the extent of surgical trauma and, consequently, correlated pain\n      various operation techniques are used. In traditional thoracotomy epidural anesthesia\n      remains a golden standard. Epidural anesthesia however demands high skills to be performed\n      correctly and presents an increased risk of grave complications. In videothoracoscopic\n      (VATS) operations paravertebral blockade can be employed, yet there is no certainty if its\n      efficacy after lung lobectomy. We therefore designed a prospective, randomized, parallel\n      group, single site study to test the hypothesis, that continuous paravertebral blockade is\n      as efficient in postoperative pain reduction as continuous epidural blockade and possesses a\n      higher safety profile."
