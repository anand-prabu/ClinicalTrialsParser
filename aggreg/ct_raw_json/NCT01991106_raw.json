            "textblock": "In today's society, we see a global obesity epidemic in both children and adults, which are\n      mainly related to poor diet and inactivity. Obesity in children has tripled between\n      1960-1990, which is approximately double that observed in adults. The risk of developing\n      type I and II diabetes increases with increased body mass index (BMI). Obese children /\n      adolescents has also decreased blood vessel function, aerobe capacity and impaired insulin\n      and glucose regulation. Recent studies have shown that obese children and adolescents are\n      increasingly experiencing complications of excess weight as previously only associated with\n      obesity in adults. These findings have created considerable concern about the current\n      epidemic of obesity, which might give today's obese children and adolescents a shorter life.\n\n      Exercise interventions in obese children and adolescents has proved positive in terms of\n      improving blood vessel function, physical capacity and decrease in BMI .\n\n      The possibility healthcare providers have to extract gains from prevention is so far not\n      exploited sufficiently by preventing more to repair minor. Part of the reason for this is\n      that there is no specific advice on how health professionals can provide information on\n      training for the cause of health. The World Health Organization's Commission on\n      Macroeconomics and Health (2001) show that investments in health provide significant\n      economic gains globally, and that the benefits of health measures is three times as large as\n      investments.\n\n      Goal: To compare the effects of moderate exercise and high-intensity endurance training when\n      it comes to risk factors for heart / cardiovascular disease and cardiac function in obese\n      children / adolescents.\n\n      Method: The project uses standard methods, modern ultrasound and genetic engineering of data\n      collection and data processing.\n\n      Scientific Significance : Based on a solid scientific foundation project is expected to\n      result in simple, concrete and feasible advice on effective training for health 's sake to\n      prevent cardiovascular disease as well as training advice for individuals from the studied\n      population. The project is expected to help identify the role of exercise for improving\n      cardiovascular function, and may provide new points of attack for treatment of\n      cardiovascular disease"
