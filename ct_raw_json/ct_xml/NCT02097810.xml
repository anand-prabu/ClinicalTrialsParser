  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      RXDX-101 is an orally available inhibitor of the tyrosine kinases TrkA, TrkB, TrkC, ROS1,
      and ALK. Molecular alterations to one or more of these targets are present in several
      different tumor types, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), colorectal cancer
      (CRC), prostate cancer, papillary thyroid cancer, pancreatic cancer, and neuroblastoma.
      Patients with locally advanced or metastatic cancer with a detectable molecular alteration
      in targets of interest may be eligible for enrollment.

      Phase 1 will assess safety and tolerability of RXDX-101 via standard dose escalation scheme
      and determine the recommended Phase 2 dose.

      Phase 2 will assess treatment efficacy and safety of RXDX-101.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of locally advanced or metastatic
             solid tumors that have a TrkA, TrkB, TrkC, ROS1, or ALK molecular alteration.

          -  Measurable disease according to RECIST version 1.1.

          -  Prior cancer therapy is allowed, including crizotinib and investigational drugs. At
             the time of treatment start, at least 4 weeks must have elapsed, or in absence of
             toxicity, 7 days, since completion of prior cancer therapy (at least 6 weeks for
             nitrosureas, mitomycin C and liposomal doxorubicin).

          -  Prior radiotherapy is allowed if &gt;14 days have elapsed since end of treatment,
             provided that no more than 25% of bone marrow reserve has been irradiated.

          -  Patients with controlled asymptomatic central nervous system involvement are allowed
             in absence of therapy with anticonvulsants.

          -  Patients who have received brain irradiation must have completed whole brain
             radiotherapy at least 14 days prior and gamma knife at least 7 days prior to
             enrollment.

          -  Resolution of all acute toxic effects (excluding alopecia) of any prior anti-cancer
             therapy to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events
             (NCI CTCAE) Version 4.03 Grade &lt; 1.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) â‰¤ 2.

          -  Adult patients age 18 years or older.

          -  Life expectancy of at least 3 months.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Current participation in another therapeutic clinical trial.

          -  Known symptomatic brain metastases or leptomeningeal involvement as assessed by MRI
             or contrast CT scan examination.

          -  History of previous cancer, except squamous cell or basal-cell carcinoma of the skin,
             or any in situ carcinoma that has been completely resected, requiring therapy within
             the previous 3 years.

          -  Incomplete recovery from any surgery prior to treatment.

          -  Any of the following in the past 6 months: myocardial infarction, unstable angina,
             coronary/peripheral artery bypass graft, symptomatic congestive heart failure,
             cerebrovascular accident or transient ischemic attack, pulmonary embolism, deep vein
             thrombosis.

          -  History of prolonged QTc interval (e.g., repeated demonstration of a QTc interval &gt;
             450 milliseconds).

          -  History of additional risk factors for torsade de pointes (e.g., heart failure,
             family history of long QT syndrome).

          -  Use of concomitant medications that increase or possibly increase the risk to prolong
             the QTc interval and/or induce torsades de pointes ventricular arrhythmia.

          -  Known active infections (bacterial, fungal, viral including HIV positivity).

          -  Gastrointestinal disease (e.g., Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, or short gut
             syndrome) or other malabsorption syndromes that would impact on drug absorption.

          -  Known interstitial lung disease, interstitial fibrosis, or history of tyrosine kinase
             inhibitor-induced pneumonitis.

          -  Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory
             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or study
             drug administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in
             the judgment of the Investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for entry into
             this study or could compromise protocol objectives in the opinion of the Investigator
             and/or the Sponsor.
