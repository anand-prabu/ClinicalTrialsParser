Patients initially received mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), 2 g/d orally, unless the investigator chose to administer \u22651 doses intravenously The first MMF dose was administered preoperatively; subsequent doses were administered in 2 or 3 divided doses, every 8-12 hours, beginning as soon as the patient was able to tolerate medications by mouth.

After Day 85, these subjects were reallocated and dosed to achieve projected trough serum concentrations of either  2 or 0.25 \u03bcg/mL (5 mg/kg every 4 or 8 weeks starting on Day 113). Participants initially received mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), 2 g/d orally  or \u22651 doses intravenously (IV),depending on the investigators decision. The first MMF dose was administered preoperatively; subsequent doses were administered in 2 or 3 divided doses, every 8-12 hours, beginning as soon as the participant was able to tolerate medications by mouth. All participants also received induction therapy (2 doses) with basiliximab IV and daily corticosteroids.",
