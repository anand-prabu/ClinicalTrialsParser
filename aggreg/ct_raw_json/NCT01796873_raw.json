Platelet\n      activity can be measured by a machine called VerifyNow.\n\n      The purpose of this study is to see whether Hispanic women and White non-Hispanic women have\n      the same platelet response to a commonly used drug, Plavix (clopidogrel).  Recent studies\n      have shown that platelets may be more active in Hispanics, making it more difficult to\n      prevent clots from forming, even when using Plavix.   In addition, studies have shown that\n      women may also have more active platelets than men.  There have been no studies of Hispanic\n      women and the effect of Plavix on platelet activity."
