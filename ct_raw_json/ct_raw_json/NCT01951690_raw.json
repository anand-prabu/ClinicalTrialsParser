NSCLC with a KRAS mutation is required for study entry and subjects will be\n      enrolled into 1 of 4 cohorts based on the status of their INK4a/Arf and p53 mutations. The\n      purpose of this study is to demonstrate if VS-6063 (defactinib) improves PFS within each\n      cohort.  The safety and tolerability of VS-6063, tumor response rate, progression free\n      survival and overall survival will also be assessed.  The pharmacodynamic effects of VS-6063\n      (defactinib) will be examined in a tumor biopsy and a blood sample."
