Subjects will be seated in front of a computer screen and eye tracking device connected to the computer. The eye tracking device consists of infrared cameras, which captured eye movements by tracking the reflections of infrared reference lights on the subjects' retinas. Before the start of the experiment, they will begin by watching a moving target on the computer screen to calibrate the system.  Then, the subject completes a computerized version of the K-D test.  The K-D test requires that the subject rapidly read aloud the numbers presented on the three test cards.  Reading the three test cards requires less than two minutes to complete.  The number of errors will be counted.  Oculometric data will be collected during the test and analyzed offline.  The total time required to complete all three test cards is the completion time for the entire K-D test.",
