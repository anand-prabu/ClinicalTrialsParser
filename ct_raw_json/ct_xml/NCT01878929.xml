  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subcutaneous allergen immunotherapy (SCIT) is a widely used and effective treatment modality
      for allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and asthma. SCIT starts with a build-up phase during which
      a patient receives frequent, escalating doses of the allergens they are allergic to until
      they reach a predetermined maintenance dose. This is followed by a maintenance phase during
      which the allergen dose is kept constant and administered at greater intervals.  Maximum
      clinical improvement is generally not seen until a patient is in the maintenance phase.
      Anecdotal evidence of possible reactions to SCIT administered during a patient's pollen
      season has led to dosage freezes during a patient's pollen season which extends the length
      of the build-up phase by many months.   Prolonging the buildup phase increases the time
      required to obtain maximal benefit from SCIT, and at the same time, can decrease patient
      compliance with therapy due to the prolonged period of time when frequent injections are
      required.

      The aims of this study are to determine if adverse reactions to pollen SCIT are increased if
      doses are increased during pollen season.

      Subcutaneous allergen immunotherapy (SCIT) is a widely used and effective treatment modality
      for allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and asthma. SCIT starts with a build-up phase during which
      a patient receives frequent, escalating doses of the allergens they are allergic to until
      they reach a predetermined maintenance dose. This is followed by a maintenance phase during
      which the allergen dose is kept constant and administered at greater intervals.  Maximum
      clinical improvement is generally not seen until a patient is in the maintenance phase.
      Anecdotal evidence of possible reactions to SCIT administered during a patient's pollen
      season has led to dosage freezes during a patient's pollen season which extends the length
      of the build-up phase by many months.   Prolonging the buildup phase increases the time
      required to obtain maximal benefit from SCIT, and at the same time, can decrease patient
      compliance with therapy due to the prolonged period of time when frequent injections are
      required.

      The aims of this study are to determine if adverse reactions to pollen SCIT are increased if
      doses are increased during pollen season.

      Specific Aim 1:  To determine if escalating pollen SCIT doses during the pollen season is
      associated with an increased rate of immediate reactions in comparison to holding SCIT doses
      constant.

      Hypothesis:   There will not be an increased rate of immediate reactions to SCIT in build up
      phase received during the pollen season in comparison to SCIT held for pollen season.

      Strategy:  In a prospective trial, 245 subjects will be randomized to receive monthly (doses
      held constant) or weekly (doses built up) injections.  Rate of immediate local and systemic
      reactions per injection will be compared between the two groups.

      Specific Aim 2: To determine if escalating pollen SCIT doses during the pollen season is
      associated with an increased rate of delayed reactions in comparison to holding SCIT doses
      constant.

      Hypothesis:   There will not be an increased rate of delayed reactions to SCIT in build up
      phase received during the pollen season in comparison to SCIT held for pollen season.

      Strategy:  In a prospective trial, 245 subjects will be randomized to receive monthly (doses
      held constant) or weekly (doses built up) injections.  Rate of delayed reactions per
      injection will be compared between the two groups.

      BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE

      Immunotherapy is one of the most effective therapies for allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, but
      the protocol dosing during pollen season is based on limited data.  Immunotherapy is given
      in increasing dosage during the build up phase in order to build tolerance.  After the build
      up phase, there is a maintenance phase that is used for the remainder of therapy.  At this
      time, there is little data to support the common practice of not increasing the dosage of
      immunotherapy during pollen seasons.

      The recent allergen immunotherapy practice parameter references 2 articles that have noted
      no increased systemic reactions to SCIT during pollen season. ,  In one prospective study,
      it was concluded that there was no direct correlation of reactions to SCIT and pollen
      season.3 They did note a correlation between the mean monthly mold counts in August to
      October and the rate of systemic reactions. The other study referenced is a prospective
      study which did not observe a statistically significant difference in the rate of systemic
      reactions to grass or ragweed pollen during their respective pollen seasons.4 However, the
      conclusions of these studies are conflicted by another study which consists of surveys
      retrospectively sent to members of the American Academy of Allergy Asthma and Immunology.
      The surveys in this study identified 46% of near fatal reactions to SCIT as occurring during
      peak allergy season.   Though the immunotherapy standard parameters are not defining pollen
      season as a contraindication, we will consider it more that minimal risk for this study.

      It is still common practice to stop the buildup phase and not escalate SCIT dosing during
      pollen season due to the conflicting available data and limitations in study design of many
      of the studies (retrospective, questionnaire based).  A further look into SCIT dosing during
      pollen season will allow for more standardized practice and potentially improved patient
      outcomes.
