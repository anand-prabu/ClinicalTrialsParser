In Group Trp and Group Dxm, the same protocol will be\n      applied unless silicone covers attached to both electrodes.\n\n      A standardized anesthetic protocol will be followed. After induction, dexamethasone 10mg\n      i.v. will be given in all groups.  All patients will receive intravenous lactated Ringer's\n      solution based on calculated preoperative deficits, surgical procedure, and estimated\n      intraoperative blood loss. Parecoxib 40mg i.v. during surgery and incision infiltration of\n      0.5% ropivacaine at the end of surgery will be used for post-operative analgesia. After\n      surgery, analgetic therapy will continue with morphine upon patient's request.After\n      extubation, patients will be transported to PACU and observed for no less than 30 min.\n      Metoclopramide 10mg i.v. will be administered as a rescue therapy to any patient who\n      experiences an episode of moderate or severe nausea, an episode of vomiting, and requests\n      rescue medication.\n\n      At the start of skin closure, a prefilled syringe which contains 5 ml of a solution will be\n      administered intravenously to the patient. It will contain either saline (Group Acu and\n      Group Dxm) or tropisetron 5mg (Group Trp).The syringe with the drug will be prepared by a\n      study coordinator according to group allocation.\n\n      The patients, the anesthesiologists, and the nursing staff shall be unaware of the group\n      assignments.\n\n      An anesthesiologist and an anesthetic nurse, who are trained for the study and blinded to\n      the randomization, will collect the data."
