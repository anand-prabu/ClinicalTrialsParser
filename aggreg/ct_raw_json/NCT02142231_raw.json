            "textblock": "Test anxiety is a well-known phenomenon in general population, but only few scientific\n      advances have been made in order to fully understand and prevent this circumstance.\n\n      The number of students which use neuro enhancement to improve their performance and to\n      prevent test anxiety, is increasing. A US-survey estimated that almost 7% of students in US\n      universities have used prescription stimulants against anxiety, and that on some campuses,\n      up to 25% of students had used them in the past year.\n\n      Acupuncture might act as an alternate. Several trials could demonstrate, that different\n      forms of acupuncture could relieve symptoms of pre-exam anxiety syndrome significantly and\n      that this therapy was highly safe. In special, the investigation of single point effects in\n      test anxiety could be of general interest. The acupuncture point with the most convincing\n      evidence up to date is Heart 7. Yet, its effectiveness has mainly been chosen in combination\n      with other acupuncture points and not as single remedy in test anxiety. Therefore we\n      establish a trial investigating the immediate needling effects at Heart 7 on the reduction\n      of test anxiety.\n\n      Therefore qe implemented a validated stress test, the Trier Social Stress Test TSST, which\n      is known to provoke serious stress responses in healthy subjects. 24 medical students with\n      test anxiety in there history will be randomised to two interventional groups (verum\n      acupuncture and laser acupuncture), being treated and then pass this test. Main outcome is\n      the increase of cortisol in saliva, which is the standardized measure of stress response\n      used in this paradigm."
