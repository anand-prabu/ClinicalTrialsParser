In the test group, after the patients were\n      enrolled in the group, clean the wound surface regularly and wash with normal saline, spread\n      the test drug on the wound surface, bandaging with sterilized vaseline gauze, change the\n      drug product every two or one day according to the effusion. In the reference control group,\n      after the patients were enrolled in the group, clean the wound surface regularly and wash\n      with normal saline, bandaging with iodophor gauze, change the drug product every two or one\n      day according to the effusion. Whole treatment were lasted till the wound surface was\n      healing completely, if it is not recovered in 4 weeks, calculate and record the healing\n      rate. The secondary part of the study was a multicenter, open study, to investigate the\n      safety of rhGM-CSF on deep 2nd burn patients. Totally 2329 patients were enrolled in this\n      part of the study."
