      Primary Objective:

      To assess efficacy aflibercept + FOLFIRI by objective response rate (ORR)

      Secondary Objective:

      To assess the following:

        -  safety profile

        -  progression free survival (PFS)

        -  overall survival (OS)

        -  pharmacokinetics (PK)

        -  immunogenicity

      Screening is up to 24 days. Treatment period will continue until disease progression,
      unacceptable toxicity, or patient's refusal. Follow up period will continue until death,
      patient's refusal, or end of study, whichever comes first.

      This trial is being conducted in Japan, where the INN designation for the study molecule is
      &quot;aflibercept&quot; and this term is therefore used throughout the synopsis. In the US, the US
      proper name is &quot;ziv-aflibercept&quot;.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria:

        Histologically or cytologically proven adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum. Metastatic
        disease that is not amenable to potentially curative treatment. Patients with measurable
        disease. One prior chemotherapeutic regimen (containing oxaliplatin) for metastatic

        Group (ECOG) performance status &gt;1. Brain metastases, uncontrolled spinal cord
        compression, or carcinomatous meningitis.

        Other prior malignancy. Pregnant or breast-feeding women. Uncontrolled hypertension.
        Inadequate bone marrow function, liver function, or renal function.

        The above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a
        patient's potential participation in a clinical trial.
