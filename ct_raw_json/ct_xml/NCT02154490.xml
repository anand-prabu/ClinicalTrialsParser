    <textblock>
      This screening and multi-sub-study randomized phase II/III trial will establish a method for
      genomic screening of similar large cancer populations followed by assigning and accruing
      simultaneously to a multi-sub-study &quot;Master Protocol&quot;. The type of cancer trait (biomarker)
      will determine to which sub-study, within this protocol, a participant will be assigned to
      compare new targeted cancer therapy, designed to block the growth and spread of cancer, or
      combinations to standard of care therapy with the ultimate goal of being able to approve new
      targeted therapies in this setting. In addition, the protocol includes a &quot;non-match&quot;
      sub-study which will include all screened patients not eligible for any of the
      biomarker-driven sub-studies. This sub-study will compare a non-match therapy to standard of
      care also with the goal of approval.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      Screening component:

      To establish a National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN) mechanism for genomically screening
      large but homogeneous cancer populations and subsequently assigning and accruing
      simultaneously to a multi-sub-study &quot;Master Protocol.&quot;

      Sub-study-specific objectives:

      Phase II objectives:

      II. To evaluate if there is sufficient evidence to continue to the Phase III component of
      the sub-study by comparing progression-free survival (PFS) between targeted therapy (TT) or
      targeted therapy combinations (TTC) versus standard therapy (SoC) in patients with advanced
      stage refractory squamous cell carcinoma (SCCA) of the lung. (Phase II Biomarker-Driven
      Sub-Studies) III. To evaluate if there is sufficient evidence to continue to the Phase III
      component of the sub-study by comparing progression-free survival (PFS) between the
      non-match therapy (NMT) versus standard therapy (SoC) in patients with advanced stage
      refractory squamous cell carcinoma (SCCA) of the lung. (Phase II Non-Match Sub-Study) IV. To
      determine if there is both a statistically and clinically-meaningful difference in PFS among
      advanced stage refractory SCCA of the lung randomized to receive TT/TTC versus SoC. (Phase
      III Biomarker-Driven Sub-Studies) V. To compare overall survival (OS) in patients with
      advanced stage refractory SCCA of the lung randomized to TT/TTC versus SoC. (Phase III
      Biomarker-Driven Sub-Studies) VI. To determine if there is both a statistically and
      clinically-meaningful difference in PFS among advanced stage refractory SCCA of the lung
      randomized to receive NMT versus SoC. (Phase III Non-Match Sub-Study) VII. To compare
      overall survival (OS) in patients with advanced stage refractory SCCA of the lung randomized
      to NMT versus SoC. (Phase III Non-Match Sub-Study) VIII. To determine whether a statistical
      and clinically-meaningful difference in PFS exists between all patients randomized to
      GDC-0032 (PI3 kinase inhibitor GDC-0032) versus docetaxel. (S1400B) IX. To determine whether
      a statistical and clinically-meaningful difference in OS exists between all patients
      randomized to GDC-0032 versus docetaxel. (S1400B)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare response rates (confirmed and unconfirmed, complete and partial responses)
      among patients with measurable disease randomized to receive TT/TTC/NMT versus SoC. (Phase
      II) II. To evaluate the frequency and severity of toxicities associated with TT/TTC/NMT
      versus SoC. (Phase II) III. To compare the response rates (confirmed and unconfirmed,
      complete and partial) among patients with measureable disease randomized to receive
      TT/TTC/NMT versus SoC. (Phase III) IV. To evaluate the frequency and severity of toxicities
      associated with TT/TTC/NMT versus SoC. (Phase III) V. To compare PFS and OS between the
      programmed cell death ligand 1 (PDL-1) positive patients randomized to MED14736 (anti-B7H1
      monoclonal antibody MEDI4736) versus chemotherapy. (S1400A) VI. Comparison of response rates
      between the treatment arms. (S1400B) VII. Comparison of the frequency and severity of
      toxicities between the arms. (S1400B)

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the screen success rate defined as the percentage of screened patients that
      register for a therapeutic sub-study.

      II. To evaluate the treatment arm randomization acceptance rate within each treatment arm of
      each sub-study defined as the percentage of patients randomized to a treatment arm that
      receive any protocol treatment.

      III. To identify additional predictive tumor/blood biomarkers that may modify response or
      define resistance to the TT beyond the chosen biomarker.

      IV. To identify potential resistance biomarkers at disease progression. V. To establish a
      tissue/ blood repository from patients with refractory squamous cell cancer.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to sub-studies according to biomarker positivity.

      S1400A: Patients with tumors that do not match one of the currently active drug-biomarker
      combinations are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive docetaxel IV on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      S1400E: Patients with tumors positive for met proto-oncogene (MET) are randomized to 1 of 2
      treatment arms.
