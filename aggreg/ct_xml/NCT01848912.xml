  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find a way of detecting infection earlier in patients
      receiving bone marrow transplant. This is accomplished by continuous individualized
      monitoring of heart rate, respiratory rate and temperature variability in this patient
      population.  The investigators are collecting data to determine whether or not subtle
      differences in heart rate, respiratory rate and temperature will help physicians to detect
      infection earlier in order to begin faster treatment before a patient's condition
      deteriorates.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this prospective observational study, patients receiving bone marrow transplant are
      selected for continuous monitoring of heart rate, respiratory and temperate variability.
      Data is collected as per standard practice using the Zephyr Bioharness device. The fabric
      chest strap is properly placed around and above the patient's chest and the Zephyr monitor
      is clipped onto the strap.

      The patient is asked to wear the Zephyr BioHarness device for approximately 23 hours a day,
      beginning the day before he/she begins bone marrow transplant.  The patient is asked to
      continue wearing the device for a period of up to 10 days or until he/she is no longer
      experiencing any fever.  The Zephyr BioHarness device records heart rate, respiratory rate
      and temperature for calculation of heart rate variability (HRV), respiratory rate
      variability (RRV) and temperature variability (TV) using the Continuous Multiorgan
      Individualized Variability Analysis (CIMVATM) software engine. The variability outcomes will
      look at the presence, rapidity and severity of change in variability prior to the onset,
      diagnosis and treatment of infection.
