  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effect of TEAS pretreatment and treatment on
      hypotension after spinal anesthesia in patients undergoing cesarean section
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients were randomly assigned to two groups, receiving TEAS before and after spinal
      anesthesia respectively. 1.4 ml of bupivacaine mixed with 0.2ml of 50% glucose was given for
      spinal anesthesia under lateral position. Then the patient was switched to supine position
      and the OR table was tilted to the left for 15 degree. The sensory loss level was assessed.
      The blood pressure and heart rate every 2min were recorded for 30min after spinal
      anesthesia. The adverse events and use of ephedrine adverse events were recorded as well.
