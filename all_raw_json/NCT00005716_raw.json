All participants enrolled in the A+ Asthma Program.  Primary care practitioners\n      of these students were randomized to a minimal contact program or to the A+ asthma\n      physician partnership.  They were offered a menu of educational offerings to improve their\n      knowledge and skills.  The primary outcome measure was emergency care use.  Secondary\n      measures included physician practices, hospitalization, health care utilization, restricted\n      activities, medication  use, school absences and coping skills."
