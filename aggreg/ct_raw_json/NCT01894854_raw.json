The investigators have earlier evaluated the\n      classical Furlong HAC total hip prosthesis and a first design change Furlong Active. Now a\n      further development, Furlong Evolution, is to be evaluated. This prosthesis, furthermore,\n      comes with and without a collar, and the investigators are going to randomize between the\n      two. The investigators hypothesize that the new design will be easier to implant and will\n      present equal or less migration than the older designs which would imply a favourable\n      outcome in the long term. The investigators further hypothesize that the collar play no\n      major part for the long term migration and bone remodelling."
