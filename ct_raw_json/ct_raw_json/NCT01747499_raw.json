For this reason and because category D agents as well\n             as other therapeutic agents used in this trial are known to be teratogenic, women of\n             childbearing age must have a negative serum pregnancy test (\u00df-human chorionic\n             gonadotropin) within 72 hours prior to initiating the conditioning regimen and be\n             willing to not become pregnant by using effective contraception while undergoing\n             treatment and for at least 3 months after the last dose of azacitidine.\n\n          -  Men must be willing not to father a new child while receiving therapy. They must use\n             an effective barrier method of contraception during the study and for 3 months\n             following the last dose.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  Must not have myelofibrosis or other disease known to prolong neutrophil engraftment\n             to > 28 days after transplant.\n\n          -  Must not be receiving any other investigational agents within 14 days of first dose\n             of azacitidine (Day 7).\n\n          -  Must not have myeloablative conditioning as defined below:\n\n               -  TBI < or = Gy +/- purine analog\n\n               -  Flu + Cy +/- ATG\n\n               -  Flu + AraC + Ida\n\n               -  Cladribine + AraC\n\n               -  Total Lymphoid Irradiation + ATG\n\n          -  Must not receive antithymocyte globulin as part of pre-transplant conditioning\n             regimens.  Antithymocyte globulin is excluded due to its potential impact on\n             modulating the incidence of GvHD or GvL.\n\n          -  Must not have uncontrolled intercurrent illness including ongoing or active\n             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, or\n             psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study\n             requirements.\n\n          -  Must not be pregnant or breastfeeding.  Pregnant women are excluded from this study\n             because azacitidine is a Category D agent with the potential for teratogenic or\n             abortifacient effects.  Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse\n             events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with azacitidine,\n             breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated azacitidine.  These\n             potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study.\n\n          -  Must not have a known or suspected hypersensitivity to azacitidine, mannitol, or\n             compounds of similar composition to azacitidine..\n\n          -  Must not have an advanced malignant hepatic tumor.\n\n          -  Must not be HIV, HBV, or HCV positive."
