Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop\n      cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Peripheral stem cell transplantation\n      may allow the doctor to give higher doses of radiation and chemotherapy drugs and kill more\n      cancer cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of radiolabeled monoclonal antibody\n      therapy plus etoposide followed by peripheral stem cell transplantation in treating patients\n      who have advanced myelodysplastic syndrome or refractory leukemia."

Peripheral blood stem cells or bone marrow are reinfused on\n      day 0. Patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously beginning on day 1 until\n      hematopoietic recovery.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of Y90 MOAB M195 until the maximum\n      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 3\n      of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicities.\n\n      Patients are followed between days 10 and 14 and then monthly for 6 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-24 patients will be accrued for this study within 12 months."
