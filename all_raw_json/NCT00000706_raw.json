Part II studies the effect of\n      probenecid and quinine on the same aspects.\n\n      Because AZT leaves the bloodstream quickly, patients must take the drug frequently to keep\n      adequate amounts in their bodies. Probenecid and quinine may slow down the rate at which AZT\n      leaves the body. Therefore, taking these drugs along with AZT may reduce the amount of AZT\n      needed for treatment."

Part II studies the pharmacokinetics of AZT in eight patients receiving AZT\n      at 1 of 2 doses and then at the lower dose of AZT plus probenecid with or without quinine."
