Its primary goal is to\n      promote physical activity and reduce sedentary time to improve childrens' cardiometabolic\n      profile. To do so, the intervention relies on gathering data on mobility and physical\n      activity using wearable sensors. These data provide a detailed picture of real-life\n      conditions and physical activity levels, improving the health care professional's ability to\n      tailor counseling. The investigators are presently in the implementation phase of this\n      intervention."
