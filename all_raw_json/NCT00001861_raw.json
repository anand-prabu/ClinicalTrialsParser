            "textblock": "This screening protocol is designed to help recruitment patients for National Eye Institute\n      (NEI) studies on nystagmus and strabismus.  Patients must meet specific requirements of a\n      research study, and this protocol serves as a first step for admitting patients to an\n      appropriate program.\n\n      Candidates will undergo a medical history, physical examination, eye examination and blood\n      test.  The eye examination includes measurement of eye pressure and dilation of the pupils\n      to fully examine the lens, vitreous and retina.  Specialized tests will be done only if\n      needed to determine eligibility for a nystagmus or strabismus study.  These include routine\n      laboratory tests, non-invasive imaging, questionnaires, and other standard tests.  If\n      needed, a test called oculography may be done to record eye movements.  There are two\n      procedures for recording and documenting these movements.  In the infrared system, the\n      patient wears a pair of glasses or goggles and looks at a red light while the head is kept\n      steady.  In the search coil system, the eye is numbed with anesthetic eye drops and a soft\n      contact lens is placed on the eye.  Then the  patient looks at a red light while the head is\n      held still.  Each oculography session lasts 20 to 30 minutes.  Photographs of the eye may be\n      taken.\n\n      When the screening is completed, patients will be informed of their options to participate\n      in a study.  Patients who are ineligible for a current study will be informed of alternative\n      treatments or options.  No treatment is offered under this protocol."
