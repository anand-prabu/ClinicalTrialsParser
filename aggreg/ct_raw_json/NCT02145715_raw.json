In previously untreated patients VTD demonstrated clear\n      superiority to TD as induction therapy prior to planned tandem autologous stem cell\n      transplant.\n\n      The rationale of this trial is to combine a 'gold standard' antiMM combination with the HDAC\n      inhibitor Panobinostat. There is emerging data to support the concept of clinical synergy\n      between BTZ and HDACi's.\n\n      The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and estimated\n      response rates of panobinostat, administered in combination with VTD, in subjects with\n      relapsed and relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma."
