During the course of Part 1, each\n      subject will participate in a screening phase, a baseline phase, a treatment phase and a\n      follow-up visit. There will be a total of 7 cohorts, each of which consists of a different\n      dose level, with 8 subjects per cohort. In each cohort, 6 subjects will receive a dose of\n      CC-220 and 2 subjects will receive placebo depending on the randomization schedule. A single\n      dose will be administered to each subject. This study design allows safety and tolerability\n      data to be gathered in a stepwise fashion. Administration of study drug at the next higher\n      dose level will not begin until the safety and tolerability of the preceding dose have been\n      evaluated and deemed acceptable by the investigator and sponsor's medical monitor. Part 2 is\n      an open-label, randomized, 2-period, 2-way crossover study. During the course of Part 2,\n      each subject will participate in a screening phase, a baseline phase in each study period, a\n      treatment phase in each study period and a follow-up visit. A total of 10 subjects will\n      receive a single dose of 1 mg CC-220 in each of 2 study periods, once without food and once\n      with food, depending on the treatment sequence to which they are randomized. The CC-220 dose\n      in each study period will be separated by a washout of 11 to 14 days."
