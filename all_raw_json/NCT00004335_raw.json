Evaluate the sleep-entrained patterns of gonadotropin-releasing hormone\n      (GnRH) and sex steroid secretion in normal and hypogonadal children.\n\n      II.  Examine the acute effects of sex steroids on the sleep-entrained patterns of GnRH\n      secretion in pubertal children and normal adults, either by stimulation of endogenous\n      production with pulsatile injection or by intravenous infusion of GnRH.\n\n      III.  Examine the role of endogenous opioids by means of opioid receptor blockade in the sex\n      steroid regulation of GnRH secretion in pubertal children and normal adults."

Growth\n      hormone secretory patterns and responses to provocative stimuli are studied as clinically\n      indicated.\n\n      Selected participants undergo an assessment of pituitary responsiveness following T, E2,\n      and/or naloxone infusions.  The suppressive effects of E2 are also studied during the early\n      follicular phase of the menstrual cycle.\n\n      Endocrinologically normal children and normal adult men and women are also studied."
