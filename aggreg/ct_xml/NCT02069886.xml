  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The CENTAurus trial is a prospective clinical study designed to address systematically some
      of the relevant endocrine complications in an iron overloaded thalassemic population,
      primary objective being the assessment of the effect of deferasirox therapy on glucose
      metabolism/homeostasis. Other endocrine parameters complementary or supportive to the
      primary objective will be assessed and analyzed during this study. A number of lab
      parameters related to other axes of the endocrine system will be collected and analyzed.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline of glucose blood level measured after 2 h after receiving a glucose-equivalent oral challenge</measure>
    <time_frame>36 months</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The primary efficacy variable is the change (mg/dl) from baseline to 36 months of glucose plasma levels measured 2 hr post glusose equivalent oral challange.
After a 12-hour overnight fasting, at zero time (baseline) blood sample will be drawn and afterwards patients will receive a glucose-equivalent oral challenge (75 grams).  After glucose loading plasma samples will be drawn at 30, 60, 90, 120 minutes for determination of plasma glucose. This will be repeated every 6 month till end of study</description>

    <description>change in of glucose metabolism during deferasirox treatment measuring the change versus baseline of 2-hr and fasting glucose plasma level of OGTT.After a 12-hour overnight fasting, at zero time (baseline) blood sample will be drawn and afterwards patients will receive a glucose-equivalent oral challenge (75 grams).  After glucose loading plasma samples will be drawn at 30, 60, 90, 120 minutes for determination of plasma glucose . This will be repeated every 6 months till end of study</description>

    <description>Change in insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity at every measurement versus screening. Stumvol Formula will be applied to values of 2hr glucose OCTT to calucolate insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity. After a 12-hour overnight fasting, at zero time (baseline) blood sample will be drawn and afterwards patients will receive a glucose-equivalent oral challenge (75 grams). After glucose loading plasma samples will be drawn at 30, 60, 90, 120 minutes for determination of insulin concentration.</description>

    <description>- Blood samples wiil be drawn to measure levels of serum calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, vitamin D levels (25-hydroxycholecalciferol), serum calcium, parathormone (intact 1-84 PTH) from baseline to the end of study. Blood samples will be drawn to assess also Vitamin D and parathormone at baseline and then every six months. The intact parathormone will be assessed by evaluating the 1-84 PTH form. Inorganic phosphorus, serum calcium will be assessed at baseline and then monthly; alkaline phosphatase will be evaluated at baseline, every two weeks during the first month of treatment and monthly thereafter till EOS.</description>
