    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well lenalidomide and dexamethasone work in treating
      patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. Biological therapies, such as
      lenalidomide, may stimulate the immune system in different ways and stop cancer cells from
      growing. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as dexamethasone, work in different ways to stop
      the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.
      Giving lenalidomide together with dexamethasone may kill more cancer cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the confirmed response rate of the combination of lenalidomide (Revlimid®), and
      dexamethasone in patients with relapsed myeloma who have previously become refractory to
      lenalidomide or pomalidomide.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the toxicity of the combination in patients with relapsed myeloma who have
      previously received lenalidomide or pomalidomide.

      II. To assess time to progression and overall survival.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive lenalidomide orally (PO) on days 1-21 and dexamethasone PO on days 1, 8,
      15, and 22. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months.
