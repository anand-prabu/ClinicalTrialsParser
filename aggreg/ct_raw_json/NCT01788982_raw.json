            "textblock": "For the treatment of thyroid cancer with the so called targeted therapy the angiogenesis\n      pathway has several potential targets. The Receptors for Vascular endothelial growth factor\n      (VEGF) and especially VEGFR-2 is considered to be crucial for the initiation of the\n      formation as well as the maintenance of tumor vasculature.\n\n      In thyroid cancer these VEGF receptors (VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2), VEGF itself and receptors of the\n      fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and for the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) are often\n      overexpressed. Other cells as pericytes and smooth muscle cells that are also involved in\n      tumor angiogenesis express these receptors as well.\n\n      Inhibitors of the VEGFR or PDGFR pathway have been tested in thyroid cancer with positive\n      results. However there is no treatment that is generally considered as standard of care for\n      patients with differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) or medullar thyroid cancer (MTC) who have\n      progressed on one line of therapy. The classical cytotoxic chemotherapy has not shown a\n      clinically meaningful benefit yet.\n\n      Nintedanib is a triple angiogenesis inhibitor which inhibits receptors of VEGF, FGF and\n      PDGF. Therefore it might act not only on endothelial cells but also on pericytes and smooth\n      muscle cells. Nintedanib also interacts with other kinases such as RET. Because of this\n      multi-kinase activity rationale exists to investigate the effect in MTC and DTC.\n\n      Because it targets these three major angiogenesis signaling pathways it might prevent\n      further tumor growth and related tumor escape mechanisms. Therefore nintedanib may be active\n      in patients who have progressed on agents that target only one pathway."
