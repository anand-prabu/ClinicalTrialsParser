            "textblock": "Background:\n\n      - Resveratrol is a compound found in the skin of red grapes. It is being tested to see if it\n      can have positive effects on human health. Lab studies show that it may help lower blood\n      sugar, improve heart and blood vessel health, and prevent cancer. Researchers want to test\n      different dose levels of Resveratrol to see what kind of effects it has on older overweight\n      people. It will be tested in healthy volunteers at least 50 years of age.\n\n      Objectives:\n\n      - To test the effects of different dose levels of Resveratrol on heart and blood vessel\n      health.\n\n      Eligibility:\n\n      - Healthy overweight nonsmoking volunteers at least 50 years of age.\n\n      Design:\n\n        -  This study will involve a screening visit and four study visits. Some of the study\n           visits will involve overnight inpatient stays.\n\n        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood and urine\n           samples will be collected. They will be given a list of foods that they should avoid\n           eating while on the study.\n\n        -  Participants will be separated into three groups. Two groups will take different dose\n           levels of the study drug. The third group will take a placebo.\n\n        -  At the first study visit, participants will stay in the clinical center overnight for 2\n           days of tests. They will provide blood and urine samples and have body scans to measure\n           fat and muscle mass. They will also have exercise tests. A muscle biopsy will also be\n           performed. At this visit, they will receive their dose of the study drug. They will\n           continue to take this dose for as long as they are on the study.\n\n        -  The second visit will be 16 weeks after the first one. It will take only 2 hours, and\n           repeat most of the tests from the screening visit.\n\n        -  The third visit will be 16 weeks later. It will involve an overnight stay. Most of the\n           tests from the second visit will be repeated.\n\n        -  The fourth and final visit will be 16 weeks later. It will involve an overnight stay.\n           Most of the tests from the initial study visit (including the scans and the exercise\n           tests) will be repeated."

            "textblock": "Resveratrol is found in the leaves and skin of grapes, in peanuts and in the roots of the\n      plant polygonum cupsidatum. Although used since early years in Indian Ayurvedic and Chinese\n      medicine, it came into prominence in the 1990   s as it was believed to be the major reason\n      for the positive effect of wine on cardiovascular health and the French Paradox. Since then,\n      studies have shown that resveratrol affects a number of key cellular pathways and molecular\n      targets with a wide range of biological effects. Noted among these are its effects on the\n      blood vessels, cancer, blood clotting, blood sugar control, muscle activity and\n      inflammation. Resveratrol also may produce some of the same effects as decreased food\n      intake, perhaps through its action on a molecule in the body called Sirtuin, which is\n      important because this is one of the only approaches that has consistently demonstrated\n      beneficial effects on the aging process.\n\n      Resveratrol   s action and pharmacology has been extensively studied in test tubes, cells,\n      and animals but is only now being explored fully in people. The animal studies include a\n      recent NIA-conducted study in monkeys that demonstrated a reduction in the stiffness of\n      blood vessel over several weeks. Phase 1 and 2 clinical studies in healthy human volunteers\n      or in patients with type II diabetes mellitus have begun to identify possible roles for\n      resveratrol as a nutritional supplement and the compound appears to have no harmful effects\n      at doses up to 5 grams per day.\n\n      We will perform a 12-month, Phase 1/2 trial of resVida (an oral preparation of resveratrol)\n      in 90 overweight/obese people over the age of 50 (30 in each group). The primary endpoint\n      will be vascular stiffness (as measured by Pulse Wave Velocity) and the secondary endpoint\n      will be exercise capacity as measured by oxygen utilization (VO2max). Testing will be done\n      on the levels of resveratrol in the blood with different doses of the compound. The study\n      will also include measurements of changes in blood glucose levels, inflammation, and\n      exercise capacity. These studies will provide necessary information for further testing of\n      resVida as a compound that could promote healthy aging."
