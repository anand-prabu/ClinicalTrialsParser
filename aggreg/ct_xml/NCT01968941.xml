  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A multi-centre randomized controlled open-label trial in medically inoperable patients with
      biopsy-proven early stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Eligible and consenting
      patients will be randomly allocated to receive stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) or
      conventional radiotherapy (CRT) in a 2:1 ratio. Radiotherapy will be administered as soon as
      possible following randomization and subjects will be followed for 5 years
      post-randomization for cancer recurrence, toxicity and survival. The primary outcome is
      local control (LC). The trial will be conducted at 16-20 clinical centres throughout Canada.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. T1/T2a N0 M0 NSCLC, either by: (a) preferably histological confirmation (squamous
             cell, adenocarcinoma, large cell carcinoma, or not specified) and CT and PET/CT
             evidence, or (b) a suspicious growing nodule on serial CT imaging, with malignant PET
             Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) avidity, for which a biopsy would be extremely risky.

          2. Deemed medically inoperable (as reviewed by a thoracic surgeon and defined as
             surgically resectable but, because of underlying physiological medical problems [e.g.
             chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), heart disease], surgery is
             contraindicated) or Radiotherapy is preferred by the patient due to high operable
             risk.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Less than 18 years of age.

          2. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 3 or higher.

          3. Prior invasive malignancy within the past 5 years (excluding non-melanomatous skin
             cancer).

          4. History of ataxia telangiectasia.

          5. Previous radiotherapy (RT) in the vicinity of the tumour, such that significant
             overlap could occur.

          6. Diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.

          7. Planned for other anticancer therapy (chemotherapy, biological targeted therapy).

          8. Female, who is currently pregnant or lactating.

          9. Geographic inaccessibility for follow-up.

         10. Unable to provide informed consent.
