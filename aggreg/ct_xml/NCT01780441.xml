      The investigators are enrolling 3-9 month old infants with a diagnosis of tuberous sclerosis
      complex (TSC) for a new study on early markers of autism. The study is looking for early
      signs for autism in a population (TSC) where autism is common. The goal of this project is
      to use behavioral testing, MRI and EEG techniques to identify children at risk for
      developing autism starting at 3 months of age and continuing until 36 months of age.
      Throughout the study, the investigators will recommend Early Intervention services for any
      child who shows early signs of autism.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a five-year multi-site study using MRI and EEG technologies to identify
      developmental precursors of Autism Spectrum Disorder in patients with Tuberous Sclerosis
      Complex (TSC).  The study will be enrolling infants at five TSC centers throughout the
      country, including Boston Children's Hospital, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical
      Center, University of Alabama at Birmingham, University of Texas at Houston and University
      of California Los Angeles.  The main goal of this study is to identify early signs of autism
      in children with TSC looking at the brain through MRI/diffusion tensor imaging, EEG and
      behavioral/neuropsychological methods.  Eligible infants between the ages of 3-9 months will
      be evaluated longitudinally at regular visit intervals up to 3 years of age.

      Study Objectives

        1. To characterize the developmental precursors of ASD in a large number of TSC infants
           using a prospective multi-center design: Infants with TSC will be evaluated
           longitudinally at ages 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24 and 36 months. At each age, children will
           undergo standardized evaluations, using cognitive and adaptive measures. At age 24 and
           36 months, formal assessment for autism will be performed. Clinical data including
           medication use, seizure history, EEG activity, genotypic variation, and co-morbidities
           will be recorded to determine if specific clinical factors modify the course of
           development.

        2. To identify biomarkers with advanced diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) that help predict
           development of ASD in TSC infants: The investigators hypothesize that decreased white
           matter integrity performed annually for each of the first 3 years of life, including
           DTI sequences with tractography. Radial, axial, and mean diffusivity and fractional
           anisometry will be calculated for each time point and change over time correlated with
           development of ASD to determine relative risk. Individual measures at each time point
           will be compared between ASD and non-spectrum groups to assess the individual impact of
           each measure and timing.

        3. To identify biomarkers with quantitative EEG that help predict development of ASD in
           TSC infants: The investigators hypothesize that altered functional connectivity, as
           measured by qEEG coherence and high frequency oscillations, will correlate with
           development of ASD in TSC. Quantitative EEG (qEEG), EEG coherence/gamma frequency
           (30-50Hz), and high frequency oscillations encompassing both ripples (80-250H) and fast
           ripples (250-500 Hz) will be measured at each time point. Changes over time will be
           correlated with development of ASD to determine relative risk, as will comparison of
           individual measures between the two groups. EEG findings will also be correlated with
           MR results obtained to further couple functional connectivity as measured by EEG with
           structural connectivity measured by DTI.

Brain tissue segmentation will be based on structural images derived from T1- and T2-weighted and FLAIR sequences using automated software tools designed for these tasks. White matter integrity and organization will be inferred from DTI imaging sequences. Structural connectivity networks will be delineated by DTI tractography assessment.</description>

        A total of 150 evaluable infants with TSC will be recruited.  Diagnosis of TSC will be
        based on established clinical criteria and will not require genetic testing prior to
        participation. The target age of entry into study is 3-6 months, but infants up to age 9
        months (less than or equal to 10.5 months) will be included.
