  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mild traumatic brain injuries (mTBI) or &quot;concussions&quot; are an increasingly prevalent injury
      in our society. Patients with post-concussion syndrome have been shown to have deficits on
      tests of short term memory, divided attention, multi-tasking, information processing speed,
      and reaction time, as well as alteration in mood and emotional functioning.  Many patients
      have other vague complaints including fatigue, dizziness, irritability, sleep disturbances,
      and chronic headaches. Furthermore, sleep disruption of one of the most common complaints in
      patients suffering from traumatic brain injuries, with as many as 40 to 65% of patients with
      mTBI complaining of insomnia.  Sleep problems in these patients are associated with poorer
      outcome, while resolution of the sleep disturbance is associated with improvement in
      cognitive functioning.

      Despite recent evidence of the correlation between sleep quality and recovery from traumatic
      brain injury, and the well-established role of sleep in neural plasticity and neurogenesis,
      there have been virtually no direct studies of the causal effects of sleep on recovery
      following mTBI.  However, it is quite likely that sleep plays a critical role in recovery
      following brain injury.

      A particularly promising non-pharmacologic approach that shows potential in
      improving/modifying abnormalities of the circadian rhythm and sleep-wake schedule is bright
      light therapy. For the proposed investigation, we hypothesize that bright light therapy may
      be helpful in improving the sleep of patients with a recent history of mTBI and may also
      have other mood elevating effects, both of which should promote positive treatment outcome
      in these individuals. Bright light therapy may increase the likelihood that they will
      recover more quickly, benefit more extensively from other forms of therapy, and build
      emotional and cognitive resilience.
