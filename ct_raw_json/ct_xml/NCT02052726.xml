    <textblock>
      This study will investigate a clostridium difficile vaccine in healthy adults aged 50 to 85
      years, who will each receive 3 doses of vaccine. Subjects will receive their vaccine doses
      at either months 0, 1, and 3 or days 1, 8, and 30. Subjects will be divided into 2 age
      groups (50-64 and 65-85 years of age). The study will assess how safe and tolerable the
      vaccine is, and also look at subjects' immune response to the vaccine.
