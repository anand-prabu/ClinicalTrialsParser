The hernioplasty in children is an outpatient procedure, and the\n      possibility of postoperative analgesia with fewer systemic adverse effects such as nausea\n      and vomiting make the tramadol  infiltration a technique of interest. There is controversy\n      about its effectiveness.\n\n      The local effect of tramadol in hernioplasty was also studied by researchers with some\n      better postoperative analgesia than with local anestetic .\n\n      There are few studies with administration of tramadol for hernioplasty, Which led to the\n      interest in this study."
