In this study all\n      participants will be injected with a standard of care intra-articular dose of ropivacaine\n      HCl, .2% (Naropin) prior to transfer to the Post Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU).    Each will\n      be randomized 1:1 to receive IV acetaminophen in 100ml of 0.9% NS (treatment group) or a 100\n      ml 0.9 % NS placebo (control).\n\n      The PACU nursing staff will periodically ascertain the participants' pain scores on a 0-10\n      scale.  All other pain medication or related treatment will be recorded.   Statistical\n      analysis will be done to determine if there is a difference in pain scores between the\n      treatment versus control group.    Further evaluation will examine if opioid consumption and\n      total time in PACU differs between groups."
