The overall objective of this project is to develop this intervention, modify\n      it based on piloting and feedback to ensure its feasibility and acceptability, and obtain\n      preliminary data supporting its efficacy. These objectives will be accomplished by pursuing\n      the following specific aims: 1) develop a group-based distress tolerance treatment for\n      weight concern (DT-W) in female smokers and a comparison health education (HE) program and\n      pilot both treatments with three groups of 10 (total N = 30) female weight-concerned smokers\n      (2 DT-W groups, 1 HE group), 2) conduct a preliminary randomized controlled trial (RCT) (N =\n      60) comparing DT-W to a Health Education (HE) comparison intervention, in which both groups\n      also receive standard behavioral smoking cessation treatment (ST) including counseling and\n      transdermal nicotine patch (TNP), and 3) examine potential mechanisms that may underlie the\n      efficacy of DT-W in improving smoking outcomes at 1-, 3-, and 6-month follow-ups."
