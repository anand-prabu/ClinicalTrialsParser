  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sarcopenia is a syndrome characterised by progressive and generalised loss of skeletal
      muscle mass and strength with a risk of adverse outcomes such as physical disability, poor
      quality of life and death (Goodpaster et al, 2006; Delmonico et al, 2007). The contributing
      factors are those related to ageing process, non-optimal diet, bed rest or sedentary
      lifestyle, chronic diseases and certain drug treatments. Most of these factors are present
      in the older population with comorbidity, frequently institutionalized to receive a
      professional long-term care.

      Since the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People (Cruz-Jentoft et al, 2010)
      recommends using the presence of both low muscle mass and low muscle function (strength or
      performance) for the diagnosis of sarcopenia, interventions should be focused in both
      criteria. The aim of this study is to prevent loss of skeletal muscle mass and strength in
      institutionalized elderly with sarcopenia.

      To this purpose, the investigators study undertakes two physiotherapy interventions to
      preventing/treating Sarcopenia, namely, improvement of strength in peripheral muscle, and
      improvement of strength in respiratory muscle. Both interventions are common in the
      following features: supervision, duration, frequency and intensity of the training program.

      The primary outcomes are those related to muscle function: strength and performance.
      Secondary outcomes will be related to costs and health status: number of falls and
      fractures, exacerbations of chronic diseases, hospitalizations and deaths during the year
      after concluding the physiotherapy interventions.

    <description>MIP is probably the most frequently reported non-invasive estimates of inspiratory muscle strength. Ever since Black and Hyatt (1969) reported this technique it has been widely used in patients, healthy control subjects across all ages, and athletes. Pressure is recorded at the mouth during a quasi-static short (few seconds) maximal inspiration. The manoeuvre is generally performed at Residual Volume (RV).

Ever since Black and Hyatt (1969) reported this technique it has been widely used in patients, healthy control subjects across all ages, and athletes. Pressure is recorded at the mouth during a quasi-static short (few seconds) maximal expiration. The manoeuvre is generally performed at Total Lung Capacity (TLC).

    <safety_issue>Yes</safety_issue>
    <description>This ventilatory test is a non-invasive technique and is a measure of both inspiratory and expiratory muscle endurance. The MVV is the largest volume that can be breathed in and out of the lungs during a 12 -15 second interval with maximal voluntary effort.

    <safety_issue>Yes</safety_issue>
    <description>The 10-Meter Walk Test (10mWT) is a measure of gait speed. The walking course consist of 14 m in a hallway: a 2 m warm-up, 10 m use for the speed measurement, and 2 m for slowing down to stop. Participants can use the assistive device (eg, cane, walker) or orthotic device (eg, ankle-foot orthosis) that they use &quot;most often&quot; (if any) at each time point.

    <safety_issue>Yes</safety_issue>
    <description>The incremental arm ergometry test begins with 1 minute warm-up and continues for 5 minutes (20 rpm) with a power (W) adapted to the participant's weight: Power = Weight (kg) * 0,2 W
The test will be interrupted if the heart rate achieves 80% of maximum theoretical heart rate (220-age) and/or inability to maintain 20 rpm.
