  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess the safety and pharmacokinetics of DU-176b administered to non-valvular atrial
      fibrillation patients with severe renal impairment, compared with DU-176b administered to
      non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) patients with normal renal function or mild renal
      impairment (Normal/MiRI).
