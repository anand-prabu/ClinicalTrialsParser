All subjects currently on\n      intrathecal opioid treatment will be converted from their current intrathecal therapy to\n      intrathecal hydromorphone hydrochloride according to standard medical practice.  After an\n      optimal dose for pain relief is achieved, subjects will remain on therapy for a total of 12\n      months or until discontinuation from the study. During this continuous dosing period, dose\n      adjustments (up or down) are permitted to manage pain or side effects provided a maximum\n      dose of 5 mg/day is not exceeded.  Subjects will be assessed for pain intensity using a\n      VASPI instrument at each study visit.\n\n      Subjects will be evaluated for side effects and clinical complications associated with the\n      use of intrathecal hydromorphone.  Events will be classified by intrathecal drugs used and\n      concentrations."
