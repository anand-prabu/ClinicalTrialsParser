In Part B, patients will be administered\n      MLN4924 via a 1-hour (\u00b1 5 minutes) IV infusion in combination with either docetaxel or\n      carboplatin + paclitaxel, the three of which would also be administered intravenously.\n\n      This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States.
