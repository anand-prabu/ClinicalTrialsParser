People participating in this study will be asked to either\n      review a paper printout of their medication list or a computer program with their\n      medications.  The program will show the names and pictures of the medications.  In either\n      situation, participants will be asked to indicate if they are taking the medications as\n      prescribed. We will then compare reported adherence between each medication review process.\n      Participation may help the program developers improve the product."
