      This is a Phase I Dose-Escalation Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, and
      Pharmacokinetics of CM082 tablets in Chinese Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors. After the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or the optimal biological dose is identified, an expansion
      cohort of ~20 advanced renal cell carcinoma patients will be enrolled to further
      characterize the safety and tumor response by CT.
