The\n      study will consists of 2 phases: screening phase (which comprises of pre-operative and\n      post-operative stages) and an open label treatment phase. The participants will be treated\n      with 40 microgram (mcg) of fentanyl transdermally per on-demand dose; each delivered over 10\n      minutes for a maximum of 6 doses (240 mcg) per hour for 24 hours and a maximum of 80 doses\n      (3.2 milligram [mg]). Each system will inactivate at 80 doses or 24 hour, whichever occurs\n      first. A new system will be applied every 24 hours unless the participant has used 80 doses\n      in less than 24 hours. Maximum treatment duration of 72 hours is allowed. Participants will\n      be expected to require parenteral (administration by injection) opioids (morphine like\n      medications) for at least 24 hours post-operatively. This study will evaluate participant's,\n      nurse's and physician's assessment of fentanyl-ITS under routine conditions. Participants'\n      safety will be monitored throughout the study."
