            "textblock": "This research study is a Phase II clinical trial, which tests the safety and effectiveness\n      of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a specific cancer.\n      \"Investigational\" means that the drug is being studied. It also means that the FDA has not\n      yet approved sunitinib for your type of cancer.\n\n      Sunitinib has been approved by the FDA for treatment of gastrointestinal stromal tumors,\n      advanced renal cell carcinoma and advanced pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. While most\n      chemotherapies work by interfering with cancer cell replication, sunitinib works by blocking\n      certain protein signals within the cell. Because sunitinib works differently from standard\n      intravenous chemotherapies, we call it a \"targeted therapy.\" This drug has also been used in\n      other research studies and information from those other research studies suggests that this\n      agent may help to slow the growth of some NSCLC tumors.\n\n      In this research study, we are looking to see if sunitinib may stop certain NSCLC tumors\n      from growing. The study focuses on a type of NSCLC, adenocarcinoma, which has previously\n      been found to be more sensitive to other kinds of oral targeted therapies. This study will\n      focus specifically on (1) adenocarcinoma tumors that do not carry a mutation in a known\n      cancer gene (EGFR, KRAS, or ALK) and occur in patients that never smoked (less than 100\n      cigarettes in their lifetime) or (2) adenocarcinoma tumors that have a mutation in the RET\n      gene."

            "textblock": "If you are willing to participate in this research study you will be asked to undergo some\n      screening tests and procedures to confirm that you are eligible. Many of these tests and\n      procedures are likely to be part of regular cancer care and may be done even if it turns out\n      that you do not take part in the research study. If you have had some of these tests or\n      procedures recently, they may or may not have to be repeated. These tests and procedures\n      will include: a medical history, complete physical exam, performance status, assessment of\n      your tumor, routine blood tests, urine pregnancy test, urine test, electrocardiogram, and an\n      echocardiogram. In order to screen for and participate in this study, your tumor sample must\n      have been tested for genetic alterations in EGFR, KRAS and ALK and been found to have\n      negative results. Alternatively, you must have had testing that determined that your tumor\n      sample has a RET mutation. You will not be eligible to screen on this study unless these\n      testing requirements have already been met. In addition to the above requirements, before\n      starting other screening for the study, it must be confirmed that there is adequate tumor\n      tissue left from a previous surgery or biopsy for required study-related tests. This tumor\n      specimen is stored in a pathology department in a paraffin block. If adequate tumor tissue\n      isn't available, you may be able to have a new biopsy of our tumor to obtain this tissue. If\n      the required tests and procedures show that you are eligible to participate in the research\n      study, you will begin the study drug. If you do not meet all of the eligibility criteria,\n      you will not be able to participate in this research study.\n\n      If you take part in this research study, you will be given a study drug-dosing diary for\n      each treatment cycle. Each treatment cycle lasts 42 days (6 weeks), during which time you\n      will be taking the study drug daily (at home, by mouth) for 28 days (four weeks), followed\n      by 2 weeks off sunitinib. On Day 1 of each cycle, you will be given a 28 days supply of\n      study drug. The diary that you will be given on Day 1 of each cycle will also include\n      special instructions for taking the sunitinib.\n\n      There is a possibility that the following tests or procedures may need to be done at times\n      other than those listed below. These may be done if your research doctor determines they are\n      medically necessary to monitor your illness or any side effects you may be experiencing. It\n      is important that you call your research doctor if at any time you are experiencing side\n      effects you cannot tolerate.\n\n      During Cycle 1, you will be seen every two weeks on Days 1, 15 and 29 and during Cycles 2-3,\n      you will be seen on Days 1 and 29. Starting with Cycle 4, you will only have a clinic visit\n      on Day 1 of every six-week cycle.\n\n      During all cycles you will have a physical exam and you will be asked questions about your\n      general health and specific questions about any problems that you might be having and any\n      medications you may be taking. At different times throughout the study you will also undergo\n      the following: side effect review, current medication review, weight, vital signs, physical\n      exam, performance status, blood sample collection, review of drug diary and ECG.\n\n      We will assess your tumor(s) by CT scans ever six weeks (at the end of each cycle). CT scans\n      will also be repeated at the End of Study if they weren't done within the previous 30 days.\n\n      During the study, your tumor sample will be tested and analyzed for genomic changes (changes\n      in your tumor genes) that may be associated with the effectiveness of sunitinib. As a\n      comparison, your blood will also be tested for changes in these genes. These genomic tests\n      will be for research only and you will not be informed of their results. If you withdraw\n      from the study and yuor tumor sample has already been tested, the remaining tumor material\n      will be sent to the pathology department that first tested your tissue for cancer. However,\n      the collected information related to your participation in this study and your genomic\n      testing will remain part of the overall research data and used for the analysis.\n\n      We would like to keep track of your medical condition for the rest of your life. We would\n      like to do this by calling you on the telephone once a year to see how you are doing.\n      Keeping in touch with you and checking your condition every year helps us look at the\n      long-term effects of the research study."
