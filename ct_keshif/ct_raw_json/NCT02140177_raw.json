            "textblock": "Background:\n\n      - Suicide is the 10th leading cause of death for U.S. adults. Medically ill people are at an\n      increased risk of suicide. Most people who have killed themselves went to a healthcare\n      provider within 3 months of their death. More and more, hospitals are being asked to assess\n      people for signs of suicide risk so that they can get the help they need. If nurses and\n      doctors can find out who is at risk they can make sure these people get help in the\n      hospital.\n\n      The asQ   em (Ask Suicide-Screening Questions to Everyone in Medical Settings) is a brief\n      questionnaire. It was created to detect suicidal thoughts and behaviors in hospitalized\n      people. Researchers would like to further develop this tool and figure out which are the\n      best questions to ask patients.\n\n      Objective:\n\n      - To determine the best questions for healthcare providers to ask people with medical\n      illnesses to see if they are having suicidal thoughts or planning to hurt themselves.\n\n      Eligibility:\n\n      - NIH Clinical Center patients over age 18.\n\n      Design:\n\n        -  Participants will be asked questions about how they have been feeling in the past few\n           weeks. They will be asked questions about depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts\n           and behaviors. They also will be asked some background questions.\n\n        -  It will take approximately 15 to 30 minutes to answer the questions."

            "textblock": "This study will initially be comprised of medically ill inpatients at the NIH CC. We plan to\n      expand the study to two other sites: the University of North Carolina   s North Carolina\n      Cancer Hospital (UNC) and Rhode Island Hospital (RIH). The total sample size will be 540\n      (180 per site). We will administer several short measures of suicide risk: the 20 asQ   em\n      (Ask Suicide-Screening Questions to Everyone in Medical Settings) candidate items; a\n      criterion standard Adult Suicidal Ideation Questionnaire (ASIQ); two questions which assess\n      for suicidal behavior from a second criterion standard, the Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation\n      (BSI); a brief depression screen, the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9); and an\n      exploratory variable questionnaire, to all eligible inpatients aged 18 years and older. The\n      ultimate goal of this project is the development of a validated risk of suicide screening\n      instrument that can be administered rapidly by non-mental health clinicians to medical\n      inpatients and in turn, connecting those in need with mental health services. Future studies\n      will focus on examining the practical implications of nurses administering the asQ   em as\n      standard of care during the admission process on a medical inpatient unit and validating the\n      asQ   em in non-English speaking patients, addressing a critical gap in suicide prevention\n      research. In addition, examining the long-term clinical impact of screening general medical\n      patients for suicide risk with the asQ   em and linking those in need with mental health\n      services and/or other interventions will be important next steps."
