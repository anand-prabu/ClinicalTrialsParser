    <textblock>
      The Morphea in Adults and Children (MAC) cohort is the first registry for both children and
      adults with morphea (also known as localized scleroderma) in the country. The purpose of the
      registry is to learn more about morphea, specifically:

        -  How morphea behaves over time

        -  How frequently specific problems occur along with morphea (for example, arthritis)

        -  Whether morphea has an autoimmune background

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient must have a clinical diagnosis of morphea confirmed by the primary
             investigator and by histopathological examination.

          2. Ages 0-90 years old

          3. Children must weigh more than 20 lbs. in order to satisfy Children's Medical Center
             policy for the maximum amount of blood drawn in a 24 hour period.

          4. Patient or legal guardian must be able to speak and read at a 6th grade reading
             level.

          5. Both male and female patients will be eligible

          6. All races and ethnic backgrounds will be included

          7. Relationships to proband: All patients with morphea will be included. A patient's
             family history will be reviewed and if there is a family history of morphea or
             systemic sclerosis then we will give the study patient the investigator's contact
             information and ask the family member to call the study team to answer any questions
             and enroll them in the study if they choose to do so.

          8. Ability to give informed consent: Patients must be able to give informed consent or
             they will give assent with parent or guardian consent as a minor to be a part of the
             morphea registry.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        - Patients who have been coded as morphea (701.0), but do not have morphea/localized
        scleroderma (examples: steroid atrophy, acquired keratoderma, keloids, nephrogenic
        fibrosing dermopathy, systemic sclerosis, lichen sclerosis)
