Patients are stratified by prior radiotherapy to the\n      indicator lesion(s) (yes vs no).\n\n      Adenovirus p53 is injected directly into an endobronchial lesion via bronchoscopy or into\n      locoregional tumors via multiple percutaneous punctures under fluoroscopic, ultrasonic, or\n      CT scan guidance on days 1, 3, and 8. Patients undergo radiotherapy beginning on day 2 and\n      continuing for a total of 10 days.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then\n      annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year."
