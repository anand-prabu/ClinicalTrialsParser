  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Women with low ovarian reserve typically respond less well to the drugs used to stimulate
      the ovary during IVF treatment and produce fewer eggs and, as a result, are less likely to
      fall pregnant either naturally or after fertility treatment. The ideal stimulation regimen
      for poor responders is currently unknown.

      Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) has been reported to improve pregnancy chances for poor
      responders, and is now utilized by approximately one third of all IVF centers world-wide.
      However, the current clinical evidence for DHEA on improvement of ovarian response and IVF
      outcome is insufficient. The validity of the results of the former studies, especially the
      varied inclusion criteria used to specify poor responders, is a subject of debate. Recently
      a uniform definition on poor ovarian response, the Bologna criteria, has been proposed by
      the European Society for Human Reproduction and Embryology(ESHRE). However, no studies have
      been performed study to evaluate the potential effects of DHEA supplementation according to
      these standards.

      The purpose of this study is to assess the impact of DHEA supplementation on IVF outcome of
      poor ovarian responders that fulfill the Bologna criteria.

        All patients were stratified according to the Bologna criteria for poor ovarian response.
        Poor responders were classified with at least two of the three following criteria: (I)
        advanced maternal age (≥40 years) or any other risk factor for POR; (II) a previous POR(≤3
        oocytes with a conventional ovarian stimulation protocol); and (III) an abnormal ovarian
        reserve test (ORT): antral follicle count (AFC) &lt; 5-7 or serum anti-Mullerian hormone
        (AMH) &lt;0.5-1.1 ng/mL, as described by the Bologna criteria
