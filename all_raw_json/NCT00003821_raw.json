Determine the quantitative and qualitative toxic effects of aminopterin in\n      this patient population. III. Determine the overall patient survival and time to progression\n      of these patients. IV. Assess the pharmacokinetic profile of these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral aminopterin every 12 hours twice weekly. Treatment continues\n      for up to 15 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients\n      are followed every 3 months until death.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-25 patients will be accrued for this study."
