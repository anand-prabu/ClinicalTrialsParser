  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Bio-SHiFT study aims to investigate whether disease progression in individual patients
      with chronic heart failure (CHF) can be accurately assessed by serial measurements of
      disease-related (novel) biomarkers. Secondary objectives of the study include comparison of
      2D- with real-time 3D-echocardiography in CHF patients and comparison of Speckle tracking
      with tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) in CHF patients, and relating these echocardiographic
      measurements to clinical outcome.

      Bio-SHiFT is a prospective, observational, multi-center, cohort study in men and women, aged
      18 years or older, visiting the outpatient clinic. Blood samples are taken at the day of
      inclusion and at follow-up visits, which are performed every 3 months until the end of the
      scheduled follow-up. Clinical data are collected at baseline and at each 3-month follow-up
      visit. Echocardiography including TDI, Speckle tracking and 3D-echocardiography is performed
      in a subset of patients, at baseline and during follow-up at 6-month intervals. The primary
      endpoint is the composite of cardiovascular death, cardiac transplantation, left ventricular
      assist device implantation, and re-hospitalization for the management of acute or worsened
      heart failure.

      Blood (EDTA plasma, citrate plasma, serum, DNA) and urine samples are taken at the day of
      inclusion and at follow-up visits, which will be performed every 3 months, until the end of
      the scheduled follow-up, or until the patient dies. The maximum total number of samples per
      patient is 11 (in patients with 30 months follow-up).
