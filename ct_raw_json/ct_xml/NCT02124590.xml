  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a longitudinal study supported by Pfizer and is a collaboration between DMPI (Duke
      Molecular Physiology Institute) and DIAL (Duke Image Acquisition Laboratory) to measure the
      effects of carnitine supplementation and acute exercise on carnitine and acylcarnitine
      levels in the muscle and on insulin sensitivity in the plasma.  This pilot study seeks to
      determine whether carnitine supplementation might be beneficial for elderly individuals who
      are overweight or obese, specifically by: 1. Reducing damaging excess protein acetylation
      (measured in muscle biopsy), 2. Improving the acylcarnitine/carnitine ratio (measured by
      MRS), 3. Improving overall mitochondrial function as reflected in reduced phosphocreatine
      recovery time (measured by MRS) and 4. Increasing insulin sensitivity as measured by a
      4-hour oral glucose tolerance test.  Investigators intend to use the results of this study
      to show feasibility in measuring mitochondrial function at Duke for a larger federal grant
      submission.  Investigators hypothesize that carnitine insufficiency might contribute to
      mitochondrial dysfunction and obesity-related impairments in glucose tolerance and insulin
      action.
