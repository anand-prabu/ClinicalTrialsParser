However, many patients experience primary or secondary response failure,\n      suggesting that individualization of treatment regimens may be beneficial. It has been shown\n      that the clinical response to two anti-TNFalpha biological agents (infliximab, adalimumab)\n      closely follows the trough drug levels and the presence of antibodies directed against the\n      drugs. This study was undertaken to investigate whether serologic monitoring of etanercept\n      bioavailability and immunogenicity in individual patients with JIA would be useful in\n      optimizing treatment regimens to improve efficacy and tolerability"
