And it is reported to be able to reduce the intraoperative anesthetic requirement.\n      However, so far there is few evidence from randomized controlled studies to confirm the\n      assistant anesthetic effect of acupuncture. Electroacupuncture (EA) is a modern non-invasive\n      technique of traditional acupuncture. Compared to traditional acupuncture, EA is more\n      practicable, more easily to be accepted by patients and operated by physicians. Nasal sinus\n      surgery and mammaplasty, especially breast augmentation, mostly belong to the scope of day\n      surgeries, which demand a rapid, smooth recovery from anesthesia with minimum adverse side\n      effects (e.g.: pain, PONV, etc)."
