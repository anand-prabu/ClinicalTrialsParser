The investigators propose to: investigate the changes in bladder function in\n      response to long-term bladder conditioning by FMS; further optimize the FMS technology and\n      parameters for effective bladder emptying in SCI; evaluate the role of the external\n      sphincter muscle fatigue by FS in facilitating bladder emptying; critically evaluate the\n      relative response of FMS data to existing information using functional electrical\n      stimulation;further develop criteria that will be used to predict which SCI patients are\n      optimally suitable for FMS; establish a comprehensive stimulation criteria that will reflect\n      the safety and effectiveness of structures associated with the bladder that are exposed to\n      the electro-myographic field."
