Determine the response rate in patients with measurable disease treated with this drug.\n\n      III. Determine the frequency and severity of toxic effects of this drug in these patients.\n\n      IV. Measure epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression, EGFR gene amplification, and\n      other activation products in the EGFR signaling pathway in tumor samples and correlate with\n      clinical outcomes in patients treated with this drug.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.\n\n      Patients receive oral erlotinib once daily on days 1-28.  Courses repeat every 28 days in\n      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed every 6 months for 2 years and then annually for 1 year.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 55 patients will be accrued for this study within 14-18\n      months."
