Determine the feasibility of high-dose cyclophosphamide and filgrastim\n      (G-CSF) in patients with stage IV, relapsed, or progressive low-grade follicular\n      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. II. Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients,\n      including those with marrow involvement. III. Determine the rates of complete remission (CR)\n      and partial remission and time to failure in previously treated and untreated patients. IV.\n      Determine the effectiveness of this regimen in eradicating bcl-2 rearrangements, as\n      determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), in previously untreated patients. V.\n      Correlate the duration of CR to PCR results in responding patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to prior treatment (yes vs no). Patients receive\n      cyclophosphamide IV over 90 minutes on day 1 and filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously beginning\n      on day 3 and continuing until blood counts recover. Treatment continues every 2 weeks for 4\n      courses in the absence of disease progression or stable disease. Patients who achieve\n      complete remission (CR) after completion of course 4 receive 2 additional courses. Patients\n      who achieve partial remission (PR) after completion of course 4 receive 2 additional\n      courses, and those who achieve CR after completion of course 6 receive 2 additional courses.\n      Patients are followed every 2 months for 6 months, every 6 months for 2 years, and then\n      annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients (30 per stratum) will be accrued for this study."
