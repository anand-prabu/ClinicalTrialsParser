            "textblock": "Background Lung cancer is one of the most frequently occurring cancer diagnoses in both men\n      and women having the highest death rate. Lung cancer is divided into Small-Cell Lung\n      Carcinoma (SCLC) and Non-Small Cell Lung Carcinoma (NSCLC). Surgery is at present the\n      primary treatment for NSCLC. Modern surgical treatment includes both minimal invasive\n      surgery, e.g. Video-Assisted Thoracoscopic surgery (VATS), and open surgery such as\n      thoracotomy.\n\n      Improved surgical techniques combined with effective adjuvant chemotherapy, has led to a\n      better survival in individuals with NSCLC. The treatment of NSCLC and other cancer diseases\n      are after all still complex and potentially lethal.  Accordingly, side-effects to the\n      treatment of the lung cancer disease are clinically very important and comprise physical and\n      psychological as well as social distress with symptoms such as reduced physical capacity,\n      numbness, pain, tiredness (fatigue), anxiety, and depression. These side-effects are\n      long-lasting or even chronic and may result in a limitation in activity of daily living and\n      reduced quality of life.\n\n      Study aim:\n\n      The rationale for the study PROLUCA is to identify the optimal timing of exercise to improve\n      recovery after surgery in patients operated for lunge cancer with focus on physical capacity\n      and quality of life. The specific study aim are to compare a home based exercise program\n      (carried out before surgery), combined with exercise initiated as early as two weeks after\n      surgery, with usual care (exercise initiated six weeks after surgery).\n\n      Who can participate? Both men and women with an age above 18 years and diagnosed with lung\n      cancer and referred for operation. Participation in this study is not possible if Danish is\n      not spoken or understood, or if the participants by a doctor are advise not to do strenuous\n      exercise.\n\n      What does the study involve? The intervention consists of a combination of (1) exercise\n      before surgery and (2) exercise after surgery for lung cancer.\n\n        1. Exercise before surgery is a home-based exercise program is individually designed. The\n           goal of the home-based exercise program, carried out before surgery, is to encourage to\n           perform physical exercise (could be walking, cycling,climbing stairs) for at least 30\n           minutes every day until surgery. The home-based exercise program varies in length due\n           to number of days until surgery, and the intention is not exceed 14 days.\n\n        2. The exercise initiated two weeks and 6 weeks after surgery consists of a 12 weeks\n           rehabilitation program containing 24 group-based exercise sessions, three individual\n           counseling sessions, and three group based lessons in health promoting behavior.\n           Special needs in terms of smoking cessation, nutritional counseling or patient\n           education, this is also offered.\n\n      The exercise consists of individually prepared supervised strength - and fitness exercise in\n      a team, two sessions of 60 minutes/week. Containing the following elements: Warm-up (five\n      minutes) and cycling exercise (25 minutes) on ergometer bike, individually prepared strength\n      exercise (25 minutes) carried out using five strength machines (whole body). Trained\n      physiotherapists and cancer nurse specialists supervise the training program following the\n      recommended principles. All exercise sessions will at the end include supervised breathing\n      exercises combined with stretching and relaxation techniques (five minutes).\n\n      What interventions will be compared? A home-based exercise program (carried out before\n      surgery), combined with exercise initiated as early as two weeks after surgery, will be\n      compared with usual care (exercise initiated six weeks after surgery).\n\n      Will all participants receive the same treatment?\n\n      By draw it is decided which of the 4 groups the participants will attend to in the study:\n\n        -  Group 1: Home-based exercise before surgery and rehabilitation initiated as early as\n           two weeks after surgery\n\n        -  Group 2: Home-based exercise before surgery and rehabilitation initiated six weeks\n           after surgery\n\n        -  Group 3: Rehabilitation initiated as early as two weeks after surgery\n\n        -  Group 4: Rehabilitation initiated six weeks after surgery (Usual practice as control\n           group)\n\n      What are the possible benefits and risks of participating? There are no risks or side-\n      effects of participating other than muscle soreness and exercise is beneficial when it comes\n      to recover from an operation from lung cancer."
