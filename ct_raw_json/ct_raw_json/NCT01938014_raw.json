To date, however, there is no established system for evaluating the\n      health status, developmental status, behavioral outcomes or functional outcomes of these\n      preschool-aged children across time and differing settings.  The primary objective of this\n      study is to develop a valid and reliable telephone-based data-gathering system for obtaining\n      health status data, developmental status data, behavioral outcomes data, and functional\n      outcomes data which reflect skills of daily living including feeding, moving, communicating\n      and responding to others.\n\n      The secondary objective of this study is to assess the validity of several early-childhood\n      standardized assessment tools as compared to the standard neuropsychological assessment\n      battery specified by the Lysosomal Disease Network's 'Neurobehavioral Core.'\n\n      The third objective of this study is to describe the impact of lysosomal disease upon the\n      families of lysosomal disease-affected children."
