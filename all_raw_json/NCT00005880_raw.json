The use of budesonide may be an effective way to\n      prevent bronchial dysplasia.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized double-blinded phase II trial to determine the effectiveness of\n      budesonide in treating former or current smokers who have bronchial dysplasia."

            "textblock": "OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the efficacy of inhaled budesonide on the number and grade of\n      bronchial epithelial dysplastic lesions in former and current smokers. II. Compare the\n      effect of inhaled budesonide vs placebo in modulating several intermediate biomarkers (i.e.,\n      proliferation, apoptosis, morphometric, and methylation markers) in this patient population.\n      III. Correlate the regression of bronchial dysplasia (number and grade) and improvement in\n      sputum cytology (morphometric grade of atypical cells) with the modulations in molecular\n      biomarkers in this patient population. IV. Compare the stability of the chemopreventive\n      effect of these treatment regimens at six months after completion of these regimens in these\n      patients. V. Compare the safety of these treatment regimens in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Patients are\n      stratified according to gender, smoking status (current vs former), and morphometric index\n      (no greater than 3.4 vs greater than 3.4). Patients are randomized into one of two treatment\n      arms. Arm I: Patients receive inhaled budesonide twice daily. Arm II: Patients receive an\n      inhaled placebo twice daily. Treatment continues for 6 months in the absence of disease\n      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed at 7 months and 12 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 110 patients (55 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this\n      study within 15 months."
