            "textblock": "-  Acute heart failure is a critical illness for which current treatments are suboptimal.\n\n        -  The various symptoms are related to inadequate cardiac output and usually include left\n           ventricular overload with pulmonary oedema, interstitial fluid accumulation and tissue\n           oedema (as indicated by frequent hyponatremia and hypoalbuminemia) and insufficient\n           peripheral perfusion frequently manifesting as cold extremities and low urine output.\n\n        -  The current treatment of this syndrome is based on diuretics, vasodilators and/or\n           inotropes, but fluid administration is also required to optimise the intravascular\n           volume state and to reverse shock if present. Therefore management of body fluid\n           balance remains a challenge since treatment aims to simultaneously maintain or improve\n           intravascular volume and decrease body fluid excess and oedema.\n\n        -  The purpose of the present study is to assess in a prospective randomised trial the\n           efficacy and safety of a newly designed crystalloid solution, 0.5 M sodium lactate,\n           with properties potentially able to improve multiple pathophysiological aspects of AHF,\n           as compared to the use of standard crystalloid solution Compound Sodium Lactate (mildly\n           hypoosmolar ~ 274 mOsm/L and isotonic)."
