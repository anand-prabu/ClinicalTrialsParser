            "textblock": "Implementation of colorectal screening programs has been shown to decrease, the incidence of\n      colorectal cancer due to the early detection and removal of pre-cancerous colonic polyps.\n      Colonoscopy is therefore one of the most common medical procedures performed in the United\n      States with 14 million procedures performed in 2003.  Aside from screening, colonoscopy is\n      also essential for other aspects of colorectal cancer management including post-resection\n      surveillance and palliative treatments.  Use of computer simulation models showed that the\n      demand for colonoscopy in the United States exceeds current capacity regardless of screening\n      strategy. The incidence of colorectal cancer has been increasing in Hong Kong and has been\n      associated with progressive increase in the colonoscopy waiting times in the public health\n      care system.  The progressive increase in the demand for colonoscopy therefore poses a\n      significant burden on the healthcare systems of all developed countries.  Methods to\n      increase the capacity and efficiency of the colonoscopy service are needed.\n\n      Non-attendance rates of gastrointestinal endoscopy appointments may range from 12% to 27%\n      5-6 and results in inefficient use of healthcare resources, delay in diagnosis and an\n      increase in waiting times.  Adams et al. conducted a prospective cohort study which showed\n      that younger age, long waiting times and referral from a non-gastroenterologist were\n      significantly associated with non-attendance.  In an another prospective cohort study,\n      Sola-Vera et al. also showed that the waiting time and source of referral were independent\n      predictive factors for non-attendance 7.  Studies on gynecological endoscopy non-attendance\n      revealed that predictors of non-attendance include unemployment, current smokers, younger\n      age, long follow up periods, lower social class, lower education levels and lack of\n      understanding of the endoscopic procedure 8-10.\n\n      Telephone reminders have been used to improve non-attendance rates; Adams et al. had\n      decreased the non-attendance rate from 12.2% to 9% after introduction of telephone reminder\n      1 week prior to the examination.  The Mayo clinic open-access endoscopy system, which\n      incorporates a standard telephone reminder 3-7 days prior to the procedure, has a\n      non-attendance rate of only 4.1%."
