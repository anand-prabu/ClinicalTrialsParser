            "textblock": "Systemic control of pancreatic cancer remains a clinical unmet need. The recent superiority\n      of 5-FU based combination therapies over the historical standard gemcitabine represents an\n      opportunity to develop novel combinations of synergistic and effective cytotoxic and\n      biologic targeted therapies. Src excess activity has been demonstrated in pancreatic cancer\n      and is implicated in the invasive and metastatic phenotype clearly represented by this\n      disease. Inhibition of Src activity is associated with numerous biologic modifications\n      capable of positively modifying this phenotype and appears to have synergy with restoring\n      inherent chemosensitivity. The addition of dasatinib to FOLFOX (FOLFOX-D) represents a novel\n      therapeutic regimen in pancreatic cancer with safety and pharmacokinetic data already having\n      been established in colorectal cancer. This protocol will test the safety and activity of\n      this combination in pancreatic cancer where current clinical outcomes remain far from\n      optimal."
