            "textblock": "Lumbar disc herniation (LDH) is a common pathological process leading to spinal surgery.\n      Open discectomy used to be a widespread procedure for surgical treatment for symptomatic\n      LDH. Currently, with rapid progress of endoscopic techniques, several minimal invasive\n      endoscopic surgeries have been developed to perform discectomy. Percutaneous transforaminal\n      endoscopic discectomy (PTED) and microendoscopic discectomy (MED) are two widely used\n      minimal invasive surgical procedures, the effectiveness of which has been proved to be\n      comparable to conventional open discectomy. As difference in operative approaches and\n      iatrogenic injury, the clinical outcome might be dramatically different from each other.\n\n      In this study, a multicenter randomized controlled trial will be performed to evaluate the\n      effectiveness of two minimal invasive endoscopic discectomy, PTED and MED, for the treatment\n      of symptomatic LDH. We will conduct the study at 3 affiliated hospitals of Sun Yat-Sen\n      University.\n\n      Two groups of patients will be investigated; 1) patients diagnosed with lumbar disc\n      herniation undergoing PTED, and 2) patients diagnosed with lumbar disc herniation undergoing\n      MED.\n\n      The primary endpoints of the study will be changes in Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) as\n      measured at pre- and post-operation, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and annually thereafter.\n      Secondary outcomes include Visual Analog Scale (VAS), the SF-36 Health Survey, as well as\n      post-operative radiological assessment. Treatment effect is defined as the difference in the\n      mean change from baseline between the two groups.\n\n      On the basis of the results of this trial we will, for the first time, have scientific\n      evidence as to the relative effectiveness of PTED versus MED for minimal invasive surgical\n      treatment for symptomatic lumbar disc herniation."
