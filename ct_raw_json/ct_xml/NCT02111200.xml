  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will study and compare how effectively two drugs (sodium phenylbutyrate
      and sodium benzoate) help excrete nitrogen in urea cycle disorders patients. Subject
      participation will require two, separate, four-day study periods at least one week apart.
      During one study period (also called a treatment arm), subjects will take sodium
      phenylbutyrate, and during one study period, they will take sodium benzoate.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The research will be performed as an outpatient over a four-day period at Texas Children's
      Hospital and the Metabolic Research Unit, of the CNRC. On Day 1 of both treatment arms,
      subjects will be asked to arrive at the Clinical Care Center of TCH early in the morning
      having fasted (had nothing to eat or drink) since midnight. Study staff will draw 6 mL
      (slightly over 1 teaspoon) of blood. From this sample, red and white blood cells will be
      measured. This is to rule out anemia (too few red blood blood cells) or infection (which
      often causes a high number of white blood cells). The chemistries in the blood will also be
      measured. This is to be sure that the levels of certain substances like sodium and potassium
      are normal, that the blood sugar is not too high or too low, and that the subject's liver
      and kidneys are working well. The blood will also be sent to the lab to test the subject's
      ammonia level (the by-product of protein breakdown). A physical examination will be
      performed, and a medical history will be taken. During the physical examination, an
      investigator will listen to the subject's chest and abdomen with a stethoscope, test his/her
      reflexes and look in his/her nose, mouth, and ears. In addition, arms and legs, skin,
      muscles, joints, and spine as well as the subject's ability to walk and move will be
      assessed. Vital signs, including heart rate, blood pressure, rate of breathing and
      temperature, and height and weight will be measured.  A urine pregnancy test will be
      performed on all women able to have children.

      Investigators will place study participants on one of the study medications (either sodium
      phenylbutyrate or sodium benzoate) and a protein-restricted diet. Study staff will closely
      monitor everything subjects eat during each treatment arm by providing them with
      pre-measured meals three times a day for Days 1-3. Subjects may take all their meals for
      Days 1-3 with them or pick up their meals daily at the CNRC. Study medications will be in
      powder form, and prescribed at a dose based on the subject's weight. The study medication
      must be taken in equal doses, at breakfast,(8 AM), lunch (1 PM), and dinner (7 PM). The
      powder may be mixed in a flavored syrup and water and given by mouth or gastrostomy tube, if
      the subject has one. Subjects will be discharged on Day 1 with a scale, instructions on how
      to weigh out the powder, and enough study medication to last until their next study visit on
      Day 4. After the Day 1 clinic visit, subjects will be able to return home if they live
      locally. If they would prefer, or live too far from the Medical Center, study staff may
      arrange for them to stay in a local hotel between study visits.

      For the next visit, on Day 4, subjects may be admitted to the Metabolic Research Unit of the
      CNRC at 7 AM in the morning. If it is more convenient, study staff will arrange for them to
      be admitted the evening before. In the morning of Day 4, after an overnight fast, study
      staff will put a small tube (catheter) into a vein in the subject's hand or arm. This
      catheter will be taped to their hand or arm and remain there for the next 8-9 hours. If
      preferred, a numbing cream may be placed on the skin before inserting the catheter to lessen
      the pain felt. A sample of urine will be collected before breakfast and then urine will be
      collected every two hours for 8 hours.

      When the catheter is placed, study staff will draw 5 ml (about one teaspoon) of blood. From
      this sample, blood ammonia, plasma amino acids and stable isotopes levels will be measured.
      Once the catheter is in place, subjects will have breakfast of a protein drink (Ensure)
      containing 15N labeled protein plus one half of their daily protein allowance. In addition,
      subjects will receive a small dose of a stable isotope of urea through their vein over five
      minutes. Stable isotopes are non-radioactive, non-toxic and already present in the body.
      After the infusion is finished, study staff will draw blood (5 mL, approx. a teaspoon) every
      30 minutes for 3 hours, and then hourly until the end of the study (8 hours). Subjects will
      be offered a low protein snack at lunchtime.

      A total of 67 mL (~13.5 teaspoons) of blood will be drawn during the entire study.

      All procedures conducted during this study are being performed for research purposes, and
      participation in the study ends when subjects are discharged on Day 4 of the second
      treatment arm.
