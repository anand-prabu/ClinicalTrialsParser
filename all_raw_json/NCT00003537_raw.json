Treatment continues for at\n      least 2 months in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Patients\n      achieving stable disease or partial response may continue treatment. Patients achieving\n      complete response (CR) continue treatment for an additional 8 months after CR.\n\n      Tumors are measured at 1 month, every 1-2 months for 2 years, every 3 months for the third\n      year, every 4 months for the fourth year, every 6 months for the fifth year, and then\n      annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study."
