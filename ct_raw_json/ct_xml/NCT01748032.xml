      The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of the alternative uses training (AUT)
      and word association training (WAT) on cognitive functions and mood symptoms in late-life
      depression (LLD).

      The hypotheses are:

        1. post-training cognitive performance will be superior to pre-training cognitive
           performance

        2. post-training depressive symptomatology will be less severe as compared with
           pre-training clinical severity and

        3. AUT group will show better post-training cognitive performance and improved mood
           symptoms when compared with the WAT group.
