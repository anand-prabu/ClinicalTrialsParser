            "textblock": "Background and Overview\n\n      This study will evaluate the efficacy of a newly developed self-management program, Health\n      Mechanics, to develop and improve bladder and bowel management skills among persons with new\n      and chronic SCI. Program participation is expected to prevent bladder and bowel related\n      medical complications (e.g., constipation, leakage), leading to enhanced social\n      participation and QOL. Health Mechanics was designed by the study PI, Dr. Meade, between\n      2007 and 2009 with funding from the Paralyzed Veteran's of America Education Foundation to\n      assist persons with SCI develop and transfer the necessary skills to keep their bodies\n      healthy while managing the many aspects of SCI care.\n\n      This study will investigate the effectiveness of a telehealth version of Health Mechanics to\n      enhance self-management skills related to neurogenic bladder and bowel management in an\n      attempt to prevent associated complications and improve QOL. The study makes a unique\n      contribution to rehabilitation by emphasizing the concepts of personal responsibility and\n      control over one's health and life as a whole. By selecting a telehealth approach (here\n      defined as telephone-based) for program implementation, the investigators also attempt to\n      address the high cost of care delivery and lack of health care access to underserved\n      populations with SCI living in remote areas of the State of Michigan.\n\n      The Health Mechanics program is designed based on the needs and strengths of individuals\n      with SCI while being responsive to identified gaps and challenges of health care provision\n      in this population. The program focuses on enhancing skills, encouraging positive health\n      behaviors and empowering people within their own environments, recognizing that people have\n      different resources and abilities. For this study, the Health Mechanics program has been\n      adapted to specifically focus on bladder and bowel management related concerns and to be\n      administered via telephone, thus better addressing the needs of the rural population and\n      transportation-related challenges.\n\n      By teaching skills to better manage bladder and bowel health, this self-management program\n      should not only reduce the occurrence of complications but it should also result in higher\n      levels of social integration and QOL. Since the skills taught - attitude, self-monitoring,\n      problem-solving, communication, organization and stress management - will be addressed in\n      the context of performing the behaviors necessary to enhance bladder and bowel health, we\n      expect them to generalize into other areas such that improvements in these skills result in\n      better overall health and participation.\n\n      Purpose and Objectives\n\n      The proposed study's overall purpose is to evaluate the effects of Health Mechanics in\n      preventing bladder and bowel complications and to improve QOL. The program specifically\n      targets newly injured individuals for early prevention of complications, as well individuals\n      with chronic injuries for later treatment and prevention of complications. Objectives are:\n      1) to improve self-management skills, including problem-solving, knowledge of health\n      behaviors, and attitude about disability; 2) to increase adherence to recommended bladder\n      and bowel management behaviors; 3) to improve bladder and bowel health and related QOL; and\n      4) to determine the extent that program improvements in terms of skills acquired are\n      sustained over time. Short-term refers to 3 and 6 months assessments while long-term refers\n      to the 12 month assessment. All hypotheses posit that, following the intervention,\n      differences will exist such that participants in the Health Mechanics program will perform\n      better than the control group (an assessment of between group differences) and that these\n      differences will be sustained over time (an assessment of within and between group\n      differences). It is expected that individuals with new injuries will improve over time\n      regardless of group assignment, while individuals with chronic injuries are stabilized prior\n      to admission to the study. Because of these naturally occurring differences in trajectory,\n      we will be examining within and between group differences.\n\n      Research Hypotheses\n\n      H1: Program participants will show greater improvements in problem solving skills, healthy\n      attitudes about disability and knowledge of SCI management skills than will the control\n      group; these improvements will be sustained over time within and between groups.\n\n      H2: Program participants will have greater adherence to recommended bladder and bowel\n      management behaviors than the control group; these improvements will be sustained over time\n      within and between groups.\n\n      H3: Program participants will have fewer bladder and bowel complications than the members of\n      the control group; these differences will be maintained over time within and between groups.\n\n      H4: Program participants will have higher levels of QOL than the control group; these\n      differences will be sustained over time within and between groups."
