  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study intents to provide an initial evaluation of the utility of positron emission
      tomography and magnetic resonance (PET/MR) imaging measures for the prediction of
      immunological response to Sipuleucel T (SipT) therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent studies of treatments of prostate cancer through stimulation of adaptive immune
      response have indicated the linear measurements by computed tomography (CT) and nuclear
      scans used to assess tumor response by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)
      were inadequate and the value of progression-free survival (PFS) as a predictive surrogate
      endpoint of survival was lost.

      The objective of this study is to provide an initial evaluation of the utility of PET/MR
      imaging measures for the prediction of immunological response to SipT therapy. Investigators
      expect to identify an&quot;imaging-signature&quot; of response to SipT based on changes in metabolism,
      perfusion, oxygenation and cellularity of metastasis and its correlation with immunological
      and clinical response. This approach will help elucidate the mechanism of activity and
      dynamics of immune antitumor responses to SipT in vivo and to identify new parameters of
      tumor response and predictive value than current RECIST and PFS standards.
