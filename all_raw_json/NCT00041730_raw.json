            "textblock": "The purpose of this study is to evaluate the ability of patients treated with Rituxan\u00ae plus\n      FavId\u2122 and GM-CSF to mount an immune response (humoral and/or cellular) to KLH and their\n      idiotype.  Secondary objectives are the determination of overall objective response rate,\n      duration of response and time to progression. B-cell malignancies express a unique antigen,\n      the immunoglobulin idiotype (Id), on their surface. Each B-cell harbors a unique genetic\n      sequence used in production of unique Id protein. No normal B-cells possess that Id on their\n      cell surface. Hence, Id protein should serve as an ideal target for individualized active\n      immune therapy of NHL. Many of the antigens expressed by tumors (including Id) are only weak\n      immunogens. To augment the immune response against Id, the Id protein must be chemically\n      coupled to a strongly immunogenic protein. keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) is a commonly\n      used protein carrier capable of augmenting the body's immune reaction against Id protein.\n      For vaccines which produce primarily an antibody response, there is a concern that combining\n      immunotherapy with Rituxan\u00ae, which produces a rapid and sustained (up to 6 to 9 months\n      post-treatment in 83% of patients) depletion of circulating and tissue-based B-cells, would\n      blunt any antibody response.  For vaccines that induce strong T-cell responses like Id-KLH\n      plus GM-CSF, there is evidence in mice that depleting the host of B-cells could actually\n      increase the T-cell response to the vaccine. GM-CSF is a hematopoietic growth factor that\n      stimulates T-cell proliferation.  T-cell response to both the patient's Idiotype and KLH\n      will be measured during this trial."
