Comprehensive assessment of the patient's and family's needs\n\n        2. Coordinated care plan based on integrated care guides\n\n        3. \"Multimorbid Action Plan\" for patients\n\n        4. All-inclussive patient centered care and caregiver support\n\n        5. Proactive monitoring according to the plan.\n\n      Patients in the control groups will receive usual care in their primary care clinics. The\n      Usual Care Survey control group will complete study questionnaires at 6, 12 and 24 months\n      after enrollement.\n\n      The Usual Care Blinded group will be assessed only retrospectively based on deidentified\n      information from Clalit's admistrative databases."
