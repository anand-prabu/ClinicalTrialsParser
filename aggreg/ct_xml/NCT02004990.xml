  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this study is to improve the standard of care in treating young children
      who often suffer from chronic caries (dental decay).  Current standard of care for children
      under 12 years old includes a dental cleaning and fluoride treatment.  Often this dental
      cleaning includes a 'dental prophylaxis' with a pumice based paste delivered by a small
      rubber-like cup that rotates on a slow-speed dental handpiece.  The procedure of this dental
      prophylaxis removes the gross levels of plaque around the supragingival tooth surfaces.
      After this prophylaxis, a fluoride treatment is delivered.  The National Maternal and Child
      Oral Health Resource Center at Georgetown University has published (Bertness J, Holt K) an
      extensive publication proving that 5% sodium fluoride varnish has become the 'standard of
      care' for fluoride treatment in children.  This study includes this fluoride standard of
      care.

      Prior to the administration of this standard of care fluoride treatment, a separate step of
      cleansing the tooth after the dental prophylaxis is added.  This study uses a cleansing
      procedure of 10% povidone iodine (PI) cleansing prior to fluoride varnish (FV) application.

      The primary aims of this study are:

        1. to measure the changes in overall plaque levels after using a 10% povidone iodine (PI)
           cleansing prior to fluoride varnish (FV) application.

        2. to measure the short term changes in the oral microbial ecology of dental plaque after
           10% povidone iodine (PI) cleansing prior to fluoride varnish (FV) application.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Inclusion criteria: Ages 6-12 years age.  Recent history (&lt; 24 months) of childhood
             caries, weight â‰¥ 15 kg, and current dental radiographic films within standard of care
             practices.  At this time, we are looking for longitudinal changes within this cohort

             fluoride varnish; antibiotics within the past 3 months; thyroid disease; significant
             past or current medical problem history, especially conditions that may affect
             salivary flow, dietary intake patterns, or routine oral hygiene.
