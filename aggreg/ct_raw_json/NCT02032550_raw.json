The investigators will employ values markers to\n      represent clusters of values for particular aspects of treatments that are valued most by\n      individual patients. The investigators will test if the concordance between values markers\n      and treatment received is predictive of objective outcomes and subjective outcomes. The\n      study hypothesis is that conjoint task may help in treatment choice and prostate cancer\n      patients whose treatment is more concordant with their values markers will have improved\n      outcomes."
