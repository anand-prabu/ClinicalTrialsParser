The immune abnormalities\n      cause patients with WAS to be very susceptible to infections. Depending on the specific type\n      of primary immune deficiency diseases, there are effective treatments, including\n      antibiotics, cellular therapy and gene therapy, but studies of large numbers of patients are\n      needed to determine the full range of causes, natural history, or the best methods of\n      treatment for long term success.\n\n      This multicenter study combines retrospective, prospective and cross-sectional analyses of\n      the transplant experiences for patients with WAS who have already received HCT since 1990,\n      or who will undergo Hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) during the study period. The\n      retrospective and prospective portions of the study will address the impact of a number of\n      pre and post-transplant factors on post-transplant disease correction and ultimate benefit\n      from HCT and the cross-sectional portion of the study will assess the benefit of HCT 2 years\n      post-HCT in consenting surviving patients."
