Our sample will be\n      comprised of caregivers who provide unpaid care for a family member diagnosed with\n      Alzheimer's disease or other dementia. Participants in the study will be highly stressed and\n      inactive male and female caregivers of family members with Alzheimer's disease or other\n      dementia. All eligible participants will complete one week of ecological momentary\n      assessments (EMA) to examine whether (1) previously unfit, high-stressed caregivers benefit\n      psychologically from becoming active, (2) this benefit is derived through changes in how\n      caregivers react to and recover from stressful events, and (3) whether these salubrious\n      psychological effects mediate changes in biological outcomes (e.g., cellular aging). Next,\n      participants will participate in a one-week run-in period of stretching 30 minutes on 4\n      separate days prior to randomization to guarantee that the investigators are randomizing\n      well-informed participants that are willing and able to complete the expected exercise.\n      Next, participants are randomized into the aerobic exercise or wait list control arm. In the\n      24th week of the study, participants complete a second week of the EMAs sub-study, and\n      return after week 24 for a final blood draw.\n\n      Research study assessments consist of self-report questionnaires, body composition, physical\n      performance and fitness tests, and a fasting blood draw. The follow-up visit, 24 weeks\n      later, consists of a repeat of the same morning health visit."
