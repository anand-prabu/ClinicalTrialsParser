            "textblock": "RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Drugs used in\n      chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or\n      die. Combining chemotherapy with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells and allow\n      doctors to preserve the part of the body where the cancer started. It is not yet known\n      whether radiation therapy with combination chemotherapy is more effective than radiation\n      therapy alone in treating cancer of the oropharynx or hypopharynx that cannot be surgically\n      removed.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of radiation therapy plus\n      cisplatin and fluorouracil with radiation therapy alone in treating patients who have\n      advanced cancer of the oropharynx or hypopharynx that cannot be surgically removed."

Patients are stratified according to\n      center and primary site of disease (oropharynx vs hypopharynx)\n\n      Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients undergo radiotherapy twice a day, 6 hours apart, 5 days a week, for 7\n           weeks.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients undergo radiotherapy as in arm I, plus concurrent chemotherapy\n           consisting of cisplatin IV on day 1 and fluorouracil by continuous infusion over 24\n           hours on days 1-5. Courses are repeated every 3 weeks for 3 courses.\n\n      Patients are followed every month for 1 year, every 2-3 months for 2 years, then every 6\n      months for at least 2 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 160 patients (80/arm) will be accrued for this study within\n      4.5 years."
