The purpose of the\n      study is to examine the immune responses and subsequent decline in serum and breast milk\n      antibody titers over two years of observation.  The clinical trial will involve women (aged\n      18 - 45 years) who have just delivered full-term infants (greater than or equal to 37\n      completed weeks of gestation) at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.  One particular\n      population at Vanderbilt to target will be the \"centering prenatal care group\" that has\n      breastfeeding rates as high as 75 percent at hospital discharge and maintained at 20 percent\n      at 6 months.  The enrollment period will be fifteen months. The subjects, staff assessing\n      subjects, and laboratory personnel will be aware of receipt of the vaccine. Since only a\n      single vaccine product is being utilized, there is no blinding needed of the subjects or\n      staff."
