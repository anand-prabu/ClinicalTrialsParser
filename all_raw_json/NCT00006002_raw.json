Dexamethasone may be effective in slowing the growth of prostate cancer cells.

Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral dexamethasone once a day 6 days a week. Treatment\n           continues until disease progression, at which time patients cross over to arm II.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral dexamethasone as in arm I followed by SU5416 IV over 60\n           minutes twice weekly for 4 weeks. A smaller dose of dexamethasone is administered the\n           day after SU5416. Treatment continues for a minimum of 2 courses in the absence of\n           unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients (30 per arm) will be accrued for this study within\n      16 months."
