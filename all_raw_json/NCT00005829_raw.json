Determine the rate and duration of complete and partial remission in patients\n      with recurrent B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia treated with gemcitabine. II. Assess the\n      toxicities of this regimen in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats\n      every 4 weeks for a minimum of 3 courses. Patients achieving clinical complete remission,\n      complete remission, nodular partial remission, or partial remission following 3 courses of\n      therapy, receive 2 additional courses of therapy. Patients achieving complete remission or\n      further improvement following the 2 additional courses of therapy, receive another 2 courses\n      of therapy. Patients are followed every 3 months until disease progression or relapse.\n      Patients achieving complete remission are followed every 6 months for 1 year.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 6-12\n      months."
