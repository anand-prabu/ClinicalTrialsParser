      The study is designed to assess the accuracy of patient breast reproducibly using the
      revised BCID. This study would provide data for target verification and quality assurance to
      eventually allow treatment of breast cancer patients for either a TBB or accelerated partial
      breast irradiation. The BCID is a low-risk device similar to immobilization devices used
      routinely in radiotherapy for other disease sites.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breast conserving therapy (BCT) has become the standard of care for treating early-stage
      breast cancers based on six prospective randomized trials with 20 years of follow-up data
      (Fisher). During lumpectomy, the surgeon removes the tumor and a surrounding rim of normal
      tissue (margin), leaving surgical clips to help designate the resection bed. Radiation
      treatment is directed at the whole breast for 5 1/2 weeks and is generally followed by a 1-2
      week boost directed at the lumpectomy site plus a margin of normal breast tissue.  The
      benefit of adding the tumor bed boost, (TBB) has been shown in two studies to decrease local
      failures [Romestaig; Bartelink].

      Studies have evaluated the role of radiation following lumpectomy in very select groups
      which have not been able to define a group who do not benefit from the addition of
      radiotherapy.  In the group of patients who received surgery alone, 85% of the breast
      recurrences occurred in the tumor bed.  Due to these two facts, radiotherapy directed only
      at the tumor bed has been evaluated.  Treating this smaller tumor volume has allowed higher
      doses of radiation to be delivered safely shortening the treatment course from 6-7 weeks to
      one week.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The patient must consent to be in the study and have signed an IRB-approved consent
             form.

          2. The patient must have a diagnosis of invasive or non-invasive breast  cancer.

          3. The patient must be planned for or have already had breast conservation surgery (i.e.
             lumpectomy).

        4  Age &gt; 18. 5. There are at least two metal clips in the surgical cavity placed at the
        time of surgery for guiding the radiation oncologist in delineating the target of
        irradiation; or one radiographic clip placed at the time of stereotactic core needle
        biopsy with the intact tumor.

        6. Patients who have already been treated by radiation therapy and are being seen in
        follow-up can also participate

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Male gender

          2. Patients who cannot be set up comfortably in the prone position (e.g. physical
             disability)

          3. Tumor/lumpectomy site located in a portion of the breast that cannot be visualized
             easily on the CT scan (e.g. superior portion of the upper outer quadrant).

          4. Mastectomy was or is the recommended surgical approach.
