Monoclonal antibodies such as trastuzumab can locate tumor\n      cells and either kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming\n      normal cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of liposomal doxorubicin and\n      trastuzumab in treating women who have locally advanced, inflammatory, or metastatic breast\n      cancer."

Treatment continues\n      every 21 days in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.\n\n      Patients are followed for at least 3 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study."
