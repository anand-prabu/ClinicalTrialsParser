  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare the 2 methods of weaning of nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) in
      premature babies born between 26 and 32 weeks
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To study the weight and the post menstrual age (PMA) at the time of NCPAP  wean utilizing
      the method of sudden wean as compared to gradual wean.

      Methods: A prospective randomized trial was conducted comparing sudden weaning with gradual
      weaning from NCPAP in neonates with gestational age between  26  and 32 weeks. The patients
      were randomized to one of the two methods of weaning from NCPAP and their success was
      compared
