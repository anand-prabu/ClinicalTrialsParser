Luminal A-like breast cancer (primary or metastatic tumor), defined as: ER-positive,\n             PR-positive (> 20%), Her-2 negative and Ki67 <14%.\n\n          4. Advanced breast cancer is eligible:\n\n               -  Endocrine therapy-naive patients with locally advanced disease, who are not\n                  suitable for radical surgery or radiotherapy (the decision made by the\n                  multidisciplinary breast cancer team). Prior first-line cytotoxic chemotherapy\n                  is  acceptable. or\n\n               -  Patients with recurrent or metastatic disease, who have not received adjuvant\n                  endocrine therapy or who have been 2 years or longer after stop of adjuvant\n                  endocrine therapy. Patients who had disease progression from first-line\n                  cytotoxic chemotherapy are allowed.\n\n          5. At least one lesion (measurable and / or non-measurable) can be assessed at baseline,\n             and is suitable for repeated assessments with CT and/or MRI.\n\n          6.

ECOG 0, 1 or 2.\n\n          8. Patients with good compliance.\n\n          9. Must be able to swallow tablets.\n\n         10.

Have received any systemic treatment other than first-line cytotoxic chemotherapy.\n\n          3.

Use any other anti-cancer therapy at the same time (except bisphosphonate).\n\n          5. Previous endocrine treatment for advanced breast cancer.\n\n          6. Current or previous malignancy ( except for breast cancer, basal cell or squamous\n             cell carcinoma of the skin with adequate treatment, cervical carcinoma in situ).\n\n          7. Inadequate blood or liver or renal function within one  week  prior to randomization:\n             Platelets < 80 \u00d7 10^9/L; Total bilirubin > 1.5 \u00d7 (ULRR) (patients with Gilbert's\n             syndrome is eligible); or ALT or AST > 2.5 \u00d7 ULRR (without liver metastases) or > 5 \u00d7\n             ULRR (with liver metastases).\n\n          8.
