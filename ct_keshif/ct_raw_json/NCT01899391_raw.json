One of the factors is whether the\n      person can repair damage to the genetic material (DNA/RNA) caused by the RT. There is some\n      evidence that a certain protein called Gamma H2AX is involved in DNA damage and repair and\n      this can be used to predict the sensitivity of individual patients. The investigators will\n      be studying this protein: Gamma H2AX) in the blood samples of prostate cancer patients\n      exposed to both computed tomography (CT) scan and RT treatment.  This will help us to\n      understand why different individuals show differences in side effects following RT."
