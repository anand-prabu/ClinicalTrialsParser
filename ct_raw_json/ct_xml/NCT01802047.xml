  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Initiating and sustaining breastfeeding are common challenges in neonatal units.

      It is known that  hindmilk expressed at the end of the expression session has a higher fat
      content.

      Previous studies have shown that simultaneous pumping is more effective at producing milk
      than sequential  pumping. However this approach is often felt uncomfortable by the mothers,
      and sequential pumping is preferred.

      The purpose of this study is to determine which modality of milk expression by electric pump
      is the most efficient and productive when sequential pumping is used.This is done by
      assessing  the milk volume expressed per expression and its macronutrients content.

      The study will last for 6 days. Each mother will express breast milk following two designed
      modalities in a random fashion, for two days each.

      The two designed modalities are:

        1. Complete pumping of one breast (first left) for 15 min, followed by complete pumping of
           the right breast for 15 min, until the breast is empty.

        2. Pumping both breast simultaneously for 15 min.

      At day one of the study, the mothers will follow the standard pumping modality in practice
      at our department.

      In between the two studied procedures at day 4 of the study, the mothers will again follow
      the standard pumping modality.

      On each day of the study, in the morning after the first expression of the day, a sample of
      2 ml of pumped breastmilk will be taken, and the total volume of the daily expressed milk
      will be recorded.
