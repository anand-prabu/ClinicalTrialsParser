  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is the third phase (feasibility and impact) of a three-phase project designed to
      derive, validate and test the feasibility and impact of implementing clinical decision
      support to safely limit the use of CT and its accompanying radiation and cost in emergency
      department patients with suspected renal colic.

      Hypothesis: Using a before and after model, integration of a clinical prediction rule into
      decisions about imaging in patients with suspected renal colic will result in a reduction of
      between 25-50% of radiation received from CT scanning in this population, without adverse
      affects on patient-centered outcomes.

      Patients that a clinician deems a CT Flank Pain Protocol for suspected kidney stone is
      warranted based on their usual practice will be eligible for enrollment. Clinicians will be
      encouraged to page the Research Associate (RA) prior to ordering the CT, and an automatic
      page will go out for all CT flank pain protocols that are ordered via EPIC. RAs will
      approach eligible subjects for written informed consent. Subjects who are incapable or
      unwilling to provide informed consent, including non-English speaking patients will be
      excluded.

      Following written informed consent, eligibility for the S.T.O.N.E. score will be determined.

      Subjects that consent to enrollment but have exclusion criteria will be enrolled
      observationally to determine the performance of the S.T.O.N.E. score and outcomes in these
      groups, but will not be eligible for alternate imaging pathways.

      Subjects who do not have any of the above exclusion criteria will be placed in one of three
      groups based on the S.T.O.N.E. score (which may be supplemented by gestalt clinician
      pre-test probability and/or point-of-care ultrasound for hydronephrosis). The groups are
      low, moderate, or high and correspond to the likelihood of the patient having a kidney stone
      as described in results from phases I and II.Subjects in the &quot;high&quot; likelihood of stone
      group will be eligible to get either ULDCT or &quot;expectant management&quot;. The choice will be
      determined by the primary clinician in conjunction with the patient. If ULDCT is elected,
      the scan will be read diagnostically by the radiologist and the clinician will treat the
      patient based on these results. If the expectant management option is chosen, no CT will be
      done during the ED visit and they will be treated as if they have a kidney stone. We will
      attempt to contact these patients at ~1 week after their ED visit, and they will also have
      the option to contact our study team. If symptoms are persistent for a week or more,
      subjects may of course pursue further clinical care with the clinician of their choice and
      this will not be billed to the study.

      Subjects in the &quot;moderate&quot; likelihood of stone group will be given the option to receive
      either a standard dose CT or ULDCT. Again, the decision of which imaging option to choose
      will be made by the primary clinician in conjunction with the patient.

      In the &quot;low&quot; likelihood of stone group the RA will present the data from the stone score to
      the physician and explain that patient is unlikely to have a kidney stone and they will be
      advised that probability of a stone is very low and that alternate imaging choices may be
      warranted. If they still choose to order a CT Flank Pain Protocol they will be asked to
      provide reasoning and the patient will receive a regular dose CT Flank Pain Protocol.

      All subjects will be followed during their ED course and follow-up care (records in EPIC),
      with an attempt to contact the patient at ~90 days after the initial ED visit. Outcomes will
      include the number of eligible patients that receive regular dose CT, ULDCT, or the
      expectant management option. Radiation dose received will be measured with comparison of
      both the expected radiation dose if regular CT had been performed in all eligible patients
      and using a before and after model from phases I and II. We will also follow all patients to
      determine the prevalence and timing of diagnosis and/or intervention for kidney stone or
      other pathology. We will qualitatively compare the prevalence of alternative causes of
      symptoms and incidental findings (and follow-up) for regular and low dose CTs.
