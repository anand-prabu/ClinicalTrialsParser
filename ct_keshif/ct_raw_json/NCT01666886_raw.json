All patients underwent\n      polysomnography with MAD in situ to evaluate the effect of the MAD on severity of sleep\n      apnea. If the results of the polysomnography with MAD are unsuccessful (defined as a\n      reduction in AHI with the MAD in situ of less than 50% compared to baseline), the therapy\n      needs to be adjusted. Finding the most effective protrusion should be a weighted compromise\n      between efficacy and side-effects of MAD therapy.\n\n      In patients with insufficient results on the polysomnography with the MAD at 75% of maximal\n      protrusion, the MAD will be further adjusted until 90% of the maximal protrusion measured at\n      the follow-up visit after the polysomnography with the MAD. After habituation and adaptation\n      period but within 2 months after the first polysomnography with MAD, a new polysomnography\n      will be performed to assess the effect of the 90% protruded position."
