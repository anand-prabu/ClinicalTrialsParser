  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our main hypothesis is that self-propelled Percutaneous Endoscopic Gastrojejunostomy tube
      (PEG-J) that has a balloon on it's tip is associated with lower J-tube retrograde migration
      rate, and lower rates of short- and long-term complications when compared to standard PEGJ
      feeding tubes.

    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Patients` quality of life will be assessed using a specific scoring system for digestive diseases.4 The score is based on the results of a self-administered questionnaire using 36 items related to digestive symptoms and quality of life, including nausea, bloating, abdominal pain, regurgitation and appetite. Each item is rated from 0 to 4 (0=extremely severe, 1=severe, 2=moderate, 3=mild and 4=absent). The overall GIQLI score is calculated by adding the scores for each item and varies from 0 (worst quality of life possible with severe digestive symptoms) to 144 (optimal quality of life without symptoms). Patients will fill GIQLI at baseline and 1, 2 and 3 months after procedure.</description>
