  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the study is to evaluate via a prospective, blinded, randomized clinical trial,
      whether ultrasound-guided single femoral and lateral femoral cutaneous nerve blocks with
      ropivacaine 0.5% with epinephrine (1:200,000) as a tracer for intravascular injection (total
      30 ml) vs. saline with epinephrine (1:200,000) (total 30 ml), given just prior to same day
      elective hip arthroscopy, is effective in reducing acute postoperative pain (NRS scores),
      postoperative opiate consumption, and time to discharge from the postanesthesia care unit.
      Differences between groups with respect to postoperative quality of life and functional
      scores will also be evaluated.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether ultrasound (using sound waves to produce an
      image)-guided regional anesthesia (local numbing medicine) to the hip area given in addition
      to general anesthesia just prior to same day elective hip arthroscopy, is effective in
      reducing acute postoperative pain, and time to discharge from the post anesthesia care unit.
       In addition, the study aims to examine whether this regional anesthesia medication has any
      effect on the study subjects' use of pain medication both during and after the procedure,
      return to function, and quality of life in the 6 month period after the surgical procedure.
      Although hip arthroscopy is a routine procedure, the best method for pain control is not
      well established, and is the purpose of this study.

  <why_stopped>
    Study Surgeon indicates that study subject recruitment is too difficult and he forsees that
    will not improve, and therefore requested we terminate the study.
