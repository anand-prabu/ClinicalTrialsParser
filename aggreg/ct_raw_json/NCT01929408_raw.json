Investigators will look at the rate of\n      undergoing allogeneic HCT among older and medically infirm AML and high-risk MDS patients\n      compared to younger and relatively healthier patients. Investigators will also compare the\n      characteristics and outcomes of patients who did versus did not proceed to allogeneic HCT. A\n      number of outcomes will be assessed including mortality, morbidity, and quality of life\n      (QOL). Baseline information will be collected on different domains of QOL, geriatric\n      assessment, health status measures, AML features, and socioeconomic status. Information will\n      help physicians and patients to decide on best treatment choices for AML and high-risk MDS\n      in older and medically infirm patients."
