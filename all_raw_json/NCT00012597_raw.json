The system incorporates all\n      data requirements for assessment recommended by AHCPR's Clinical Practice Guideline,\n      Treatment of Pressure Ulcers.\n\n      Objectives:\n\n      The primary objective of this pilot study was to evaluate the clinical accuracy of a\n      telemedicine system for assessing the status of pressure ulcers, both chronic and those\n      which have been surgically repaired.  The principal hypotheses were:  (1) use of the\n      telemedicine system results in the same diagnoses as does in-person patient assessment; and\n      (2) patients are satisfied with the telemedicine system.\n\n      Methods:\n\n      Two VA medical centers and two specialties participated in the study:  Ann Arbor (plastic\n      surgery) and Augusta (plastic surgery, physical medicine and rehabilitation).  They\n      contributed inpatients and outpatients with a pressure ulcer of stage II, III, or IV over a\n      one-year enrollment period.   All study patients were assessed both in-person (the \"gold\n      standard\") and with the telemedicine system.  The in-person and telemedicine physicians\n      provided yes/no responses to four diagnostic questions concerning wound healing and\n      infection, based on AHCPR guidelines, and they were blinded to each other\ufffds assessments.\n      Patient satisfaction data were collected using a specially designed, self-administered\n      questionnaire to measure perceptions regarding the burden of the telemedicine system,\n      confidence in the evaluation, and absence of direct contact with a physician.\n\n      Status:\n\n      Completed"
