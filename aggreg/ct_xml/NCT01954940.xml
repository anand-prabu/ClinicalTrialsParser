  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Whole-body vibration therapy (WBVT) is a novel, non-pharmacological intervention aimed at
      improving muscle strength and endurance as well as bone density.  It holds promise for
      children with neuromuscular disorders such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) since muscle
      weakness results not only from muscle breakdown but also physical inactivity and muscle
      disuse atrophy.  Weak DMD patients may increasingly limit their physical activity due to
      fear of falling or loss of independence (e.g. difficulty rising to stand without
      assistance).  Prolonging the length of time boys with DMD are ambulatory is important for
      delaying complications of this disease (lung hypoventilation, scoliosis) as well as
      maintaining bone health. We propose to conduct a pilot study of WBVT in young boys with
      Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD).  The primary outcome will be to document safety and
      feasibility of WBVT in this patient population.  The secondary outcomes will evaluate
      changes in muscle strength and endurance. Bone health will also be examined as part of
      routine clinical care.  The study will include 20 ambulatory boys with DMD; patients will be
      randomized (1:1 allocation) into 2 groups: WBVT treatment or no WBVT treatment (controls).
      Treatment groups will consist of 10 boys undergoing daily WBVT in an 8-week, open-label
      trial.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Diagnosis of Duchenne muscular dystrophy confirmed by at least one of the following:
