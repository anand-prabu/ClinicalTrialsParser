Alterations in these pharmacokinetic parameters of the LNG-EC regimen in obese women\n           affect the primary mechanism of action, which is inhibition of ovulation.\n\n        2. Obesity may affect other factors that alter levels of LNG, such as sex-hormone binding\n           globulin (SHBG) and albumin, which bind LNG and potentially lowers the amount of free\n           LNG."
