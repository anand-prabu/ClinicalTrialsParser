To evaluate the impact of the FOLFOX-based chemotherapy treatment on peripheral blood\n      lymphocyte telomere length.\n\n      II. To evaluate the association between pre-treatment geriatric assessment tools scores,\n      telomere length, and the incidence of chemotherapy related adverse events among older early\n      stage or metastatic CRC patients.\n\n      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. To evaluate the association between pre-treatment levels of serum interleukin-6 (IL-6),\n      C-reactive protein (CRP) and D-dimer and incidence of chemotherapy related adverse events.\n\n      II. To evaluate the correlation between pre-treatment telomere length, levels of other\n      biomarkers of aging (IL6, CRP, D-dimer), and rates of adverse events with FOLFOX-based\n      chemotherapy.\n\n      OUTLINE:\n\n      Patients undergo blood sample collection for analysis via real-time polymerase chain\n      reaction (PCR) at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months.\n\n      After completion of study, patients are followed up every 3 months for up to 2 years."
