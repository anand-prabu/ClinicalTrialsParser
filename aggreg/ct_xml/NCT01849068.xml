  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ezetimibe has been shown to inhibit cholesterol absorption and several lines of evidence
      from in vitro systems and animal models suggest that this effect is associated with an
      increase in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor expression in the small intestine. The
      impact of a treatment with ezetimibe on intestinal gene expression and protein mass levels
      of LDL receptor and other key genes involved in intestinal cholesterol homeostasis will be
      examined in dyslipidemic men with insulin-resistance. In the present study, gene expression
      studies and protein mass levels will be assessed on duodenal biopsies by real-time
      polymerase chain reaction (rt-PCR) and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS),
      respectively. The primary objective of this proposal is to examine the effects of ezetimibe
      on intestinal gene expression (rt-PCR) and protein mass levels (LC-MS/MS) of LDL receptor in
      dyslipidemic men with insulin-resistance. The secondary objective is to examine the impact
      of ezetimibe treatment on intestinal gene expression and protein mass levels of sterol
      regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)-2, Niemann-Pick C1-Like1 (NPC1L1), ATP binding
      cassette gene (ABCG)-5/8, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) and
      3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA (HMG CoA) reductase.

      Primary hypothesis Treatment with ezetimibe 10 mg/day will significantly increase duodenal
      mRNA and protein mass levels of LDL receptor in dyslipidemic men with insulin-resistance.

      Secondary hypothesis Treatment with ezetimibe 10 mg/day will significantly increase duodenal
      mRNA and protein mass levels of SREBP-2, NPC1L1, ABCG5/8, PCSK9 and HMG CoA reductase in
      dyslipidemic men with insulin-resistance.
