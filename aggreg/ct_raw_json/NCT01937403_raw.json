A secondary purpose is to systematically track subjective and\n      objective outcomes on patients following ACL reconstruction to help identify differences\n      between those who have  subsequent knee problems and those who do not. The study hypotheses\n      are the following:\n\n      1) The Sportcord Test will provide a valid and reliable measure of functional performance\n      following ACL reconstruction. 2) Patients who have subsequent knee problems in the 12 month\n      study period will exhibit different scores on clinical special tests compared to those who\n      do not."
