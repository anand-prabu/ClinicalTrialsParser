  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People who suffer a stroke are often left with disabilities such as weakness, or problems
      with speech, thinking, or control or bodily functions.  Severe strokes often result in
      death.  The results of a recent European study indicated that patients who commence mobility
      training very early after a stroke (Day 1) recover the ability to walk more quickly and
      return home sooner and in greater numbers than those who start training one week or later
      after stroke. Recently a phase II (pilot) AVERT study was conducted in which the
      investigators tested the safety and feasibility of very early mobilisation (European model)
      Stroke patients in this study randomly received either standard care or very early
      mobilisation (VEM).  The study showed that there was no harm to patients in the VEM group
      compared to those who had standard care and that delivering VEM was feasible.  Consequently,
      a grant to conduct the larger phase III study, to test the effectiveness of the intervention
      was obtained.

      In this next phase III trial, the investigators aim to look at 2104 patients across stroke
      care units in city and regional hospitals.  Each hospital will be asked to include between
      30 and 60 patients per year to the study. All stroke patients admitted to the hospital
      Stroke Unit or ward at the hospital will be invited to participate.  Medical clearance will
      be obtained for all potential participants. Those unconscious or too ill, together with
      those already participating in acute drug trials will be excluded.  Patients who are able
      will provide their own consent to participate.  Those who are not able to consent for
      themselves will have a third party (usually a relative) acknowledge their participation in
      the study.  As this is a blinded controlled trial, keeping the assessor and patients unaware
      of their treatment group is important. The investigators will inform patients that they will
      have a 50% chance of receiving one of two rehabilitation types during their hospitalization
      if they decide to participate.  Patients in the VEM group will commence treatment within 24
      hours of admission to hospital. VEM will be provided by a trained AVERT physiotherapist, and
      AVERT study nurse and aims to improve functional mobility.  The mobilization activities will
      depend on the patient's functional ability and tolerance to exercise.  Patients will be
      closely monitored prior to mobilization and will only be mobilised if they meet requirements
      for blood pressure and other vital signs.  The number of sessions and the time spent for
      each patient will vary, however specific targets are to be met according to the intervention
      protocol.  The content and timing of all treatment received by participants in either group
      will be recorded.  The treatment period for this study is from the time of the patients
      consent, until day 14 or discharge from the stroke unit or ward.  (Whichever is earlier).
      All participants will be assessed at admission to the study, 3 months, and 12 months after
      their stroke. Information collected by the AVERT physiotherapists and nurses and the
      assessor will be recorded on individual case record forms and on a secure web based data
      base.  Therapists also add some information to a palm pilot, and then download it onto the
      secure website.  All information collected from patients will be treated as confidential in
      line with international guidelines and local law.

      The primary outcome measure for the study is the number of patients dead and disabled at 3
      months after stroke.  Other secondary outcome measures include the safety of patients,
      quality of life, and cost effectiveness.  An independent Data Monitoring committee will
      monitor the safety, conduct and efficacy of the trial. In addition, an independent outcomes
      committee will be reviewing all events that are reported as serious.
