  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cesarean deliveries are prevalent. Unlike other operations, quick recovery is required for
      the mother to nurture the newborn child and establishing an appropriate mother-child
      bonding. Therefore, effective pain management is crucial. In this study we would like to
      compare between two pain relievers' administration protocols: (1) pain relievers'
      administration in fix protocol (type of medications, dose and intervals) or (2) pain
      relievers' administration following demand (the same type and doses, however, medications
      will be given only following patient's request).

      The primary outcome will be patient satisfaction, pain control and the necessity of
      additional medications (rescue doses).

      The protocols will be used for the first 48 hours following surgery.
