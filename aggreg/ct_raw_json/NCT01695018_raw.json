To investigate the clinical predictive value of p16 methylation diagnostic\n      reagents in the early diagnosis of oral cancer, the investigators carried out the\n      prospective multi-center double-blind cohort study.\n\n      Methods:180 patients with histologically confirmed mild or moderate OED were included in the\n      present study. The investigators using p16 methylation diagnostic reagents to analysis of\n      the p16 methylation status in these patients. Building two follow-up queue by p16-methylated\n      and p16-unmethylated. The Statistical analysis used SAS6.12 software. All P-values were\n      two-sided. P<0.05 was considered to test for statistical significance difference."
