To determine the duration of in vivo persistence of adoptively transferred T cells, and\n      the phenotype of persisting T cells.\n\n      II. To determine if adoptively transferred T cells traffic to the bone marrow and function\n      in vivo.\n\n      III. To determine if the adoptive transfer of CD19 CAR-T cells results in depletion of CD19+\n      B cells in vivo as a surrogate for functional activity.\n\n      IV. To determine if the adoptive transfer of CD19 CAR-T cells has antitumor activity in\n      patients with measurable tumor burden prior to T cell transfer.\n\n      V. To determine if the adoptive transfer of CD19 CAR-T cells is associated with tumor lysis\n      syndrome.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of autologous CD19 CAR T-cells.\n\n      Patients receive anti-CD19-CAR lentiviral vector-transduced autologous T cells intravenously\n      (IV) over 20-30 minutes on day 0. Treatment may be repeated in 30 days if there is\n      persistent disease in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 15 years."
