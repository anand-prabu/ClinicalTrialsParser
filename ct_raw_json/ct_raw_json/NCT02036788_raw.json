The correct positioning of the catheter (usually at the medium third of the\n      esophagus) is crucial for an accurate measurement of esophageal pressure. Usually the\n      correct positioning of the catheter is verified with an occlusion test (If the patient is\n      breathing spontaneously) or with thoraco-abdominal compressions (if the patient is sedated\n      and paralyzed). Aim of this study is to compare the accuracy of these two methods at\n      different PEEP and esophageal catheter positions."
