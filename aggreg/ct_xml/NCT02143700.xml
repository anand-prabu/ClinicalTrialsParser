  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic condition involving an impairment
      in functionality and in the execution of activities of daily life. The hypothesis of this
      study is to examine the relationship between cognitive status and clinical profile
      (respiratory, sleep quality, nutritional status) in patients with chronic obstructive
      pulmonary disease in two different moments: exacerbation or stable situation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is a pathology with a systemic impact with a
      progressive evolution that is characterized by the presence of chronic airflow obstruction.

      Patients with COPD may have problems with cognitive functioning, either globally or in
      single cognitive domains, such as information processing, attention and concentration,
      memory, executive functioning and self-regulation.

      Several studies have determined the prevalence of cognitive impairment in COPD compared to
      healthy control subjects, reaching very high levels, 36% of COPD patients with mild
      cognitive impairment compared with 12 % non- COPD subjects.

    <safety_issue>Yes</safety_issue>
    <description>The cognitive impairment will be measured using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment is a test designed as a rapid screening instrument for mild cognitive dysfunction. It assesses different cognitive domains: attention and concentration, executive functions, memory, language, visuoconstructional skills, conceptual thinking, calculations, and orientation.</description>

    <description>Mini Nutritional Assessment  has been designed and validated to provide a single, rapid assessment of nutritional status in elderly patients in outpatient clinics, hospitals, and nursing homes. It is composed of simple measurements and brief questions that can be completed in about 10 min</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>Yes</safety_issue>
    <description>Comorbidities are going to be measured with the Charlson comorbidity index. The Charlson comorbidity index predicts the ten-year mortality for a patient who may have a range of comorbid conditions, such as heart disease, AIDS, or cancer (a total of 22 conditions). Each condition is assigned a score of 1, 2, 3, or 6, depending on the risk of dying associated with each one.</description>
