Lipid emulsions are essential for\n      these patients as they are a source of non glucose fuel calories, and they contain\n      (essential) fatty acids which are important as structural component for many  cells in the\n      human body. Home parenteral nutrition patients are at risk for essential fatty acid\n      deficiency. Data are lacking that indicate the optimal amount of essential fatty acids\n      required for these patients. The latter seems especially relevant for patients receiving\n      lipid prescriptions which are low in essential fatty acids, like ClinOleic\u00ae. Long-term\n      parenteral nutrition dependent patients successfully use ClinOleic\u00ae. It is however unknown\n      whether these patient remain to have an adequate essential fatty acid status in the long\n      run."
