Oxidative\n      stress is also known to adversely impact corneal endothelial cells, and may be a factor\n      resulting in the acute decrease in corneal endothelial cell density following ocular\n      surgery. While corticosteroids provide potent anti-inflammatory efficacy in a wide range of\n      acute and chronic inflammatory ocular diseases, their use is limited by their side effect\n      profile, which includes the potential to elevate IOP and induce cataract formation. In\n      addition, most available ophthalmic anti-inflammatory treatments, including corticosteroids,\n      do not directly protect against the underlying oxidative stress component of the disease\n      process. Consequently, there is a clinical need for agents that protect against oxidative\n      stress and provide anti-inflammatory efficacy without inducing steroid-like side effects.\n\n      This study will assess the safety and efficacy of RTA 408 Ophthalmic Suspension (0.5% or 1%)\n      versus vehicle for the prevention of corneal endothelial cell loss in patients undergoing\n      cataract surgery."
