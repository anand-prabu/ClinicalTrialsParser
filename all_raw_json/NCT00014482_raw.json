Patients are stratified according to whole body or\n      whole lymphatic irradiation (yes vs no) and diagnosis (non-Hodgkin's lymphoma vs Hodgkin's\n      lymphoma vs myeloma/amyloidosis). Patients are randomized to one of two arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive individualized music therapy over 20-30 minutes beginning on\n           day 0 and continuing over 16 days for a maximum of 12 sessions during high-dose therapy\n           and autologous stem cell transplantation.\n\n      Patients complete a Profile of Mood States (POMS) quality of life and pain questionnaire on\n      days -2, 0, 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, and 16.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive standard psychosocial support during high-dose therapy and\n           autologous stem cell transplantation. Patients complete POMS and mucositis pain\n           questionnaires as in arm I.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 80 patients (40 per arm) will be accrued for this study."
