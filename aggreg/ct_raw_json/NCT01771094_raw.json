Breakfast will be served at 9.30 on every occasion\n      and preload stimuli will be offered exactly 60 minutes after breakfast (at 10.30). Lunch\n      will be provided at 13.00.

After lunch (time 8), participants will complete the last\n      set of ratings and will bring a food diary to record all food and fluid intake until 00.00\n      that day."
