  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have previously demonstrated utilizing a validated tool, that the quality
      of referrals from nurse practitioners (NP) and physician assistants (PA) is less than
      referrals from physicians.  The investigators hypothesize that with local physician input,
      the quality of referrals from nurse practitioners and physician assistants will improve.
      This is a prospective study comparing patient referrals from nurse practitioners and
      physician assistants with and without prior discussion with a local physician.
