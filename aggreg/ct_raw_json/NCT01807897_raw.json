            "textblock": "Chronic heart failure (HF) is a highly prevalent disease, with a lifetime risk of\n      approximately 20%.  Sleep apnea is a common co-morbid condition, occurring in approximately\n      half of patients with chronic HF, and often has predominantly central or mixed obstructive\n      and central characteristics.  Although it is associated with increased mortality in patients\n      with HF, sleep apnea is usually asymptomatic and patients are therefore often unwilling to\n      accept standard therapy with positive airway pressure.  There are three treatment modalities\n      currently recommended by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine for the treatment of\n      predominantly central sleep apnea in HF patients: nocturnal supplemental oxygen (NSO),\n      continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and adaptive servo-ventilation (ASV).  There are\n      only limited data on the comparative efficacy and tolerability of these three modalities.\n      The present study is designed to compare these modalities with respect to effects on\n      ventricular function, exercise capacity, and other measures of cardiovascular risk."
