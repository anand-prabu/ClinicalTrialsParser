    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well standard systemic chemotherapy followed by
      intensified radiochemotherapy or standard radiochemotherapy preceded by intensified systemic
      chemotherapy works compared to standard systemic chemotherapy followed by standard
      radiochemotherapy in treating patients with pancreatic cancer that cannot be removed by
      surgery. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine hydrochloride or FOLFIRINOX, work
      in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by
      stopping them from dividing. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells.
      Drugs, such as capecitabine, may make tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy.
      Giving radiation therapy in different ways and adding chemotherapy may kill more tumor
      cells. It is not yet known whether standard systemic chemotherapy followed by standard
      radiochemotherapy is more effective than standard systemic chemotherapy followed by
      intensified radiochemotherapy or standard radiochemotherapy preceded by intensified systemic
      chemotherapy in treating pancreatic cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if intensified radiochemotherapy in patients with unresectable pancreatic
      cancer will show a signal for improved 2-year overall survival (OS) from 10% to 22.5%.

      II. To determine if intensified systemic therapy in patients with unresectable pancreatic
      cancer will show a signal for improved 2-year OS from 10% to 22.5%.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate patterns of failure (local and systemic progression) by SMAD family member 4
      (SMAD4) status and intensity of therapy.

      II. To evaluate the impact of intensified radiotherapy on OS for the subset of SMAD4 intact
      patients.

      III. To evaluate the impact of intensified chemotherapy on OS for the subset of SMAD4 lost
      patients.

      IV. To evaluate adverse events associated with the treatments. V. To evaluate correlation
      between SMAD4 status determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and genetic SMAD4 status.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days
      1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for 3 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning 3-5 weeks later, patients undergo high-dose
      intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) 5 days a week for 6 weeks (28 fractions) and
      receive concurrent capecitabine orally (PO) twice daily (BID) 5 days a week for 6 weeks.

      ARM II: Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride as in Arm I. Beginning 3-5 weeks later,
      patients undergo standard-dose 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT) 5 days a
      week for 6 weeks (28 fractions) and receive capecitabine as in Arm I.

      ARM III: Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours, irinotecan hydrochloride IV over 90
      minutes, leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours on day 1, and fluorouracil IV continuously over
      46-48 hours on days 1-2. Treatment repeats every 14 days for 6 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning 3- 5 weeks later, patients undergo
      3D-CRT as in Arm II and receive capecitabine as in Arm I.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 month, every 3 months for
      years 1 and 2, every 4 months for year 3, and then annually thereafter.
