      Hypothesis: High sensitivity cTnI assays will have improved diagnostic accuracy for type 1
      MI compared to contemporary cTnI assays.

      The primary objective of the study is to determine the performance of a high sensitivity
      cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI) assay compared to a contemporary cTnI assay for the diagnostic
      accuracy of type 1 acute myocardial infarction (AMI).

      The diagnostic performance of Abbott's hs-cTnI assay will be evaluated. Investigators will
      assess the assay's ability to diagnose AMI earlier and to rule out AMI earlier. The
      sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of the
      hs-cTnI assay will be evaluated with both a universal cut off as well as with gender and
      potentially age derived 99th percentile upper reference limits (URL).

      Investigators will evaluate delta hs-cTnI values (pre-specified absolute concentration and
      percent changes over time) for their ability to contribute to the negative predictive value
      and hence potentially lead to an earlier rule out of AMI (improved specificity).
      Additionally, investigators will assess delta changes of the hs-cTnI assay for their
      potential contribution to the clinical differentiation of type 1 and type 2 (supply demand
      mismatch) MIs.

      Lastly, investigators will compare the diagnosis of AMI based on the currently used
      contemporary assay to the hs-assay, to assess both the incidence of AMI as well as for the
      time to diagnosis.
