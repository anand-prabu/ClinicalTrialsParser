Upon enrollment, subjects will be given an\n      Ipad-based computerized questionnaire that assesses their risk perception, demographics,\n      risk behavior, and perception of whether they are a candidate for PrEP. Upon completion of\n      the survey they will be randomized into 1 of 2 arms. Subjects in the intervention arm will\n      receive the results of their risk score based on a risk calculator developed at UCSD and the\n      Center for Disease Control and Prevention's tool for Assessing Risk for Contracting HIV\n      (ARCH, formerly known as the HIV Incidence Risk Index for MSM, or HIRI-MSM), whereas\n      subjects in the control arm will not receive this information. Both groups will receive\n      standard risk reduction counseling. Subjects will be contacted by phone 2 months after\n      enrollment to determine whether they initiated PrEP or not, to re-assess their risk\n      perception, and to provide a link to a final online survey. If subjects have not completed\n      the survey 4 weeks after being provided with the link, they will receive a text-message\n      reminder.\n\n      The analysis of the data will begin 12 weeks after the last study subject is enrolled."
