    <description>Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) are used to determine objective clinical response. Complete Rresponse (CR) is the disappearance of all target lesions, partial response (PR) is at least a 30% decrease in the target lesions, progressive disease (PD) is at least a 20% increase in the target lesions or appearance of one or more new lesions, and stable disease (SD) is neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD.</description>
