The long-term use should be\n      restricted due to adverse effects of cyclosporine, such as hypertension and nephrotoxicity.\n\n      Mycophenolate mofetil for steroid-dependent nephrotic syndrome has been reported to have\n      similar efficacy and fewer undesirable effects to other drugs in mainly observational\n      studies. To determine the efficacy of mycophenolate mofetil in the management of\n      steroid-dependent nephrotic syndrome, the investigators designed this prospective randomized\n      controlled study."
