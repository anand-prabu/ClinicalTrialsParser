  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      By doing this study, the investigators hope to learn whether patients with difficult to
      obtain IV access who are treated with IO access are more satisfied with their care and have
      better outcomes.  The investigators are specifically studying the time difference between
      groups and the difference in the number of attempts required to obtain vascular access and
      begin to treat with fluids and medications. The study will also measure patient satisfaction
      and procedural pain, the frequency of central line placement, the length of stay in the
      hospital and emergency department, and adverse events to intravascular access to determine
      whether IO access can improve these measures.

      The investigators hypothesize that the use of a protocol utilizing an IO device for select
      patients with failed IV access will reduce the time requirements to obtain vascular access,
      reduce the number of attempts needed to obtain IV access, reduce the ED LOS, and have no
      negative impact on patient satisfaction compared to the current ED practices.

    <description>If you are assigned to this group, you will be treated with whatever procedures your doctor feels are most appropriate to obtain vascular access.  This may include additional attempts at an IV in your arms or legs with or without the use of an ultrasound, or your doctor may decide to attempt to place an IV in your neck or groin.</description>

    <description>If you are assigned to this group, you will receive an IO line at the location deemed most appropriate by your doctor.  IO lines are placed in the shoulder, the shin below the knee, or, less commonly, in the ankle bone.  IO lines are placed using an FDA-approved device called an EZ-IO®.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. 18 years of age or older

          2. Presenting to the York Hospital ED in need of IV access

          3. Patient will have no IV access despite 2 separate attempts at peripheral IV access by
             2 different nurses.

          4. In addition, the IV team will have been consulted to place an IV and been
             unsuccessful.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients requiring immediate IV access for whom waiting until the IV team  arrives is
             unacceptable

          2. Patients requiring central line for one of the following reasons:

               -  Hemodynamic monitoring

               -  Frequent blood draws

               -  Administration of parenteral nutrition or vasoactive medications

               -  Transvenous pacing or hemodialysis

               -  Multiple lumen availability for administration of incompatible medications

          3. Patients not suitable for IO access based on one of the following reasons:

               -  Fractures at preferred IO sites

               -  Previous orthopedic procedures (prosthetic limb or joint) near preferred IO
                  sites

               -  IO needle in the preferred IO sites in previous 48 hours

               -  Infection at the preferred IO sites

               -  Inability to locate landmarks for placement at the preferred sites due to
                  excessive tissue

          4. Inability to provide informed research consent (intoxicated, altered mental status,
             non-English speaking)
