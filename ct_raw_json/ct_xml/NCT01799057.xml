    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of metformin on functional capacity
      (pain-free and maximum walking times) in individuals with peripheral artery disease
      (PAD)-related intermittent claudication and abnormal glucose metabolism.

      Background and Rationale:

      Metformin has demonstrable efficacy in slowing or reversing the progression of various
      insulin-resistant disease states - most notably type 2 diabetes and pre-diabetes. In seeking
      to establish proof-of-concept that insulin resistance is a suitable pathophysiological
      target in the treatment of PAD-related intermittent claudication (pain in the leg muscles
      during walking, which resolves on exercise cessation), this study will determine whether the
      known insulin-sensitizing effects of metformin translate to alleviation of the functional
      limitations imposed by claudication.

      Since type 2 diabetic individuals with PAD often rely on metformin as part of standard risk
      factor management (glycemic control), the current study will enrol only those with
      pre-diabetes or non-pharmacologically treated, well-controlled type 2 diabetes. In view of
      the prevalence of disorders of glucose metabolism in PAD (approximately two-thirds of
      unselected individuals), this mechanistic study should have far-reaching clinical
      implications.

      Study Design:

      A total of 80 individuals with PAD-related intermittent claudication and abnormal glucose
      metabolism will be randomised (1:1) to either metformin  or matching placebo for 16-18 weeks
      (double-blind, parallel group design). The maximum daily dose of metformin will be 2000mg
      (up-titrated from half this dose at 2 weeks if tolerated).

      Primary Hypothesis:

      Improvement in functional capacity follows metformin therapy in individuals with PAD-related
      intermittent claudication and abnormal glucose metabolism. Change in functional capacity
      will be assessed by the co-primary endpoints of pain-free and maximum walking times during a
      standard graded treadmill exercise test.

      Secondary Aims:

      Exercise testing for functional performance will be complemented by assessments of perceived
      physical functioning / quality of life in the daily life setting (using standard
      questionnaires). As previous studies have indicated cardiovascular effects of metformin
      incremental to blood glucose-lowering, this study will also investigate potential mechanisms
      of efficacy relating to the primary endpoints, including changes in endothelial function,
      blood flow responses to various stimuli (including insulin and acute exercise), insulin
      sensitivity, and physical activity / sedentary behaviours. Changes in relevant clinical data
      (including ankle-brachial index and limb hemodynamics by duplex scanning) will also be
      determined.

      Outcomes and Significance:

      The unmet clinical need of efficacious medical therapies for intermittent claudication is a
      growing problem given the increasing prevalence of PAD worldwide. If positive, this study
      will identify a new potential treatment that is already widely available. The study will
      also inform on novel mechanistic targets with relevance to existing and future therapeutic
      strategies.
