After administration of low-dose Norzyme\u00ae (25000 IU),\n      some patients showed weight gain, but statistically significant conclusions were not\n      obtained mainly because of various types of pancreatectomy and low supplementary dosage of\n      pancreatic enzyme.\n\n      Therefore, the investigators design this study to find out  the effect of high-dose Norzyme\u00ae\n      (40000 IU) on weight gain, quality of life, stool habit change, and nutritional status in\n      patients with pancreaticoduodenectomy. The investigators will evaluate the effectiveness and\n      adequacy of high-dose pancreatic supplementary treatment through a randomized,\n      placebo-using, single-blinded, and multicenter study."
