      The primary aim of the current study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a Cognitive
      Behavioral Therapy intervention in the treatment of menopause-associated insomnia and
      nocturnal hot flashes.

      This study aims to develop and evaluate a primary care-based intervention for insomnia and
      nocturnal hot flashes (nHF) in peri- and postmenopausal women. Menopause-associated insomnia
      is associated with adverse consequences including reduced quality of life, increased health
      care utilization, and risk for psychiatric disorders and medical conditions. The poor
      benefit/risk ratio of estrogen and progesterone replacement therapy and concerns about
      long-term effects of sedative hypnotics has left women desperate for new approaches to
      resolve menopause-related health problems, including poor sleep. The proposed intervention
      aims to develop and evaluate a much-needed safe treatment of menopause-associated insomnia
      that combines and enhances cognitive behavioral therapies for insomnia and hot flashes. To
      maximize the public health impact, improve access, and reduce treatment barriers (stigma and
      transportation issues), we propose to evaluate the efficacy and effectiveness of the
      intervention delivered by nurses in gynecology clinics, where women receive routine care.
      Primary outcomes, for which the study is optimally designed and sufficiently powered, are
      subjectively- and objectively-measured sleep and nHF.

      The Aims of this research are to:

        1. To explore feasibility, acceptability (willingness to be randomized and dropout rates)
           of CBTMI, and indications of efficacy/effectiveness of CBTMI in a randomized,
           placebo-controlled, pilot study.

        2. To explore the effects of CBTMI on the number and duration of arousals/awakenings that
           follow nHFs. If effective, the intervention has the potential to improve the quality of
           life in peri- and postmenopausal women and reduce the significant costs to society.

    <description>CBTMI is a combination of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBTI) and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Hot Flashes (CBTH). Includes education about sleep, sleep restriction, stimulus control, cognitive restructuring of sleep interfering thoughts, and relapse prevention; while also addressing women's beliefs about and reactions to hot flashes.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Women in menopausal transition (defined by standardized criteria as variable cycle
             length seven days different from their normal cycle or &gt;2 skipped cycles and an
             interval of amenorrhea of 2-12 months) or postmenopausal (defined as &gt;12 months since
             last menstrual period).

          -  Meet Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV (DSM-IV) criteria for
             insomnia assessed by Duke Structured Interview for Sleep Disorders.

          -  Score &gt;14 on the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) or &gt;8 on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality
             Index (PSQI).

          -  Have at least one nocturnal hot flash/night sweat on 3 or more nights a week (based
             on 2 weeks of daily hot flash diaries).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Chemotherapy/radiation-induced menopause.

          -  Presence of any unstable medical disorder assessed by medical tracking form.

          -  Traumatic brain injury or cognitive impairment defined by a score &lt; 25 on Mini Mental
