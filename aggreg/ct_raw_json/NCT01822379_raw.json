This procedure is known as MKTP\n      (Melanocyte Keratinocyte Transplantation Procedure).  Multiple studies have found this\n      procedure to be both safe and effective for the treatment of vitiligo.  The majority of\n      these studies utilized trypsin to help isolate melanocytes and keratinocytes.  Trypsin is\n      enzyme that helps to separate the different layers of skin.  However, some cell biologists\n      believe that the enzyme dispase (which can be used to separate the epidermis from the\n      dermis) is less toxic to cells of the epidermis and can result in a greater number of viable\n      melanocytes and keratinocytes for transplantation.\n\n      This study will look at the repigmentation rates of MKTP using trypsin to isolate cells,\n      versus MKTP using dispase to isolate cells."
