            "textblock": "The 5 q minus syndrome is a condition that occurs due to a missing segment of chromosome 5\n      in the normal genetic make-up of the cells responsible for forming blood cells.  The\n      condition causes patients to have the inability to make blood normally.  Many patients with\n      this syndrome need transfusions of red blood cells, platelets, and/or white blood cells.\n      Low levels of platelets may cause the patient to bleed easily and low levels of whit blood\n      cells make the patient susceptible to infections.  A small number of patients with 5 q minus\n      syndrome develop leukemia, which is often untreatable with chemotherapy.\n\n      Researchers believe that one of the genes missing in 5 q minus syndrome is the gene\n      responsible for making folic acid active in the body.  Folic acid is a vitamin required for\n      normal blood production.\n\n      The purpose of this study to test the effectiveness of a drug called leucovorin for the\n      treatment of 5 q minus syndrome.  Leucovorin is an active form of the vitamin folic acid\n      that does not require the missing genes to activate it.\n\n      Patients participating in this study may or may not improve with leucovorin treatment.\n      However, the study will improve researchers understanding of the disease and may lead other\n      potential therapies for the disease."
