            "textblock": "Multi-agent chemotherapy has value for patients with advanced pancreatic-biliary cancers\n      leading to responses in a substantial minority and increasing survival. The use of the\n      FOLFIRINOX regimen is limited by its' intensity and toxicity. Previous protocol and clinical\n      experience within the University of Michigan Pancreatic Program leads to an expectation of\n      tolerance and efficacy of the proposed regimen. Advantages of the proposed regimen relative\n      to FOLFIRINOX include:\n\n        1. Substitution of gemcitabine for irinotecan. Single agent activity of gemcitabine is at\n           least as good as irinotecan (probably better, especially when delivered by FDR\n           infusion) and gemcitabine is much better tolerated with less diarrhea, nausea/emesis,\n           myelosuppression and alopecia.\n\n        2. Deletion of leucovorin infusion and 5FU bolus injection will lessen myelosuppression,\n           mucositis and diarrhea.\n\n        3. Substitution of cisplatin for oxaliplatin will reduce cost of therapy and avoid cold\n           aggravated dysesthesia.\n\n      Presuming evidence of efficacy and confirmation of tolerance with the proposed regimen, the\n      investigators believe this treatment may be more widely applicable to pancreatico-biliary\n      cancer patients, including those with advanced disease as well as being considered for use\n      in locally advanced and neo- and adjuvant settings."

Gemcitabine is an\n      inhibitor of ribonucleotide reductase, an enzyme needed for synthesis of deoxynucleotides,\n      and 5-FU interferes with dTTP synthesis by inhibition of thymidylate synthase (TS). It is\n      likely that concomitant administration of gemcitabine and 5FU results in increased\n      cytotoxicity by reducing intracellular dTTP thru two different mechanisms, thereby\n      inhibiting DNA replication and repair. Platinum compounds lead to cell death by forming DNA\n      adducts and causing double strand breaks. By inhibiting DNA synthesis and repair, both\n      gemcitabine and 5-FU potentiate the activity of cisplatin. These interactions underlie the\n      clinical synergism that has been observed with platinum/5FU and platinum/gemcitabine\n      combinations."
