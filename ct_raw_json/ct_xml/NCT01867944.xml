  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to test a non-medicinal technique for chronic constipation.
      The core of the technique is to have subjects repeatedly press on and massage their perineum
      before defecation to fragment and soften the stool before it passes the lower rectum and
      anus. The technique will be evaluated as a complementary treatment to standard treatment of
      constipation (patient educational materials about treatments such as stool softeners,
      laxatives fiber supplements, and increased exercise). Although this technique has been
      studied for other conditions (for example in pregnant women to prevent birthing-related
      injuries), and it is recommended anecdotally by some physicians, this would be the first
      time it will be studied for chronic constipation in a randomized, controlled clinical trial.

      $50 dollars in compensation is provided for about an hour of participant's time.
