            "textblock": "Patient satisfaction with physical therapy has become an important concern in health care,\n      used to monitor patient perceptions of the quality of physical therapy care services.\n      Measurement of patient satisfaction may provide useful information which may improve the\n      quality of health care. The \"MedRisk Instrument for Measuring Patient Satisfaction With\n      Physical Therapy Care\" (MRPS) is one of these instruments, which has undergone reliability\n      and validation testing.The MRPS is a 20-item (18 items and 2 global measures) questionnaire\n      which assess patient experience about therapist, registration process and convenience of\n      environment.\n\n      A survey on a consecutive sample of patients from various regions in Turkey who were\n      receiving outpatient physiotherapy programs was recruited.The study was divided into two\n      phases: Phase I, the cross-cultural adaptation, which involves the translation procedures\n      into Turkish and preliminary probe in the target population; and phase II, which involves\n      the reliability and validation study.\n\n      After providing informed consent, for test-retest reliability, all subjects were asked to\n      complete the MRPS twice; the first at least after receiving three sessions of physiotherapy\n      and the second four days later which could coincide with the date of their discharge but not\n      later. Subjects provided information regarding their age, sex, and location of primary\n      symptoms prior to completing the instrument.Factor structure.\n\n      The construct validity was evaluated by factor analysis method. An exploratory factor\n      analysis, using principal components analysis  with varimax rotation was performed.Criterion\n      validity was addressed by determining the correlation between two global measures of\n      satisfaction and each of the 18 items. The measurement properties of the potential factors\n      were investigated by determining correlations of the factors to the global measures and\n      10-cm Visual Analog Scale (VAS) which evaluates the level of patient satisfaction with\n      higher scores indicating better satisfaction. Pearson correlation coefficient was used to\n      assess the strength of the linear relationships. Test-retest reliability was examined by\n      calculating the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC). Internal consistency relates to\n      homogeneity of an instrument, which is assessed with Cronbach's alpha"
