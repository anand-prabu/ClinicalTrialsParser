            "textblock": "The National Register of Nephrology in 2007 shows, similarly to the European data, a\n      problem of a high mortality rate among Polish dialysis patients.\n\n      The main reason of death among chronically dialysis patients are cardio - vascular system\n      diseases. According to \"The Report on the Condition of Renal Replacement Therapy in Poland\n      in 2007\", these diseases are the cause of 53% deaths in Poland. The patients with chronic\n      kidney disease (PChN) are particularly at risk of cardio - vascular complications. These\n      complications occur on average 30 times more often than in the whole population, and among\n      young dialysis people, these complications occur 300 times more often. In the development of\n      cardio - vascular complications polyunsaturated Omega-3 acids (especially eicosapentaenoic\n      acid - EPA and docosahexaenoic acid - DHA) take a special position. The reaction of\n      polyunsaturated Omega-3 acids on the cardiovascular system results from the enrichment of\n      phospholipids of cell membranes within EPA and DHA. It should be noted that their impact is\n      dependent on the type of acid and on the dose. Docosahexaenoic acid reacts with lipids and\n      lipoproteins, blood pressure, heart rate, amount of glucose, and eicosapentaenoic acid is\n      responsible for antiplatelet effect.\n\n      This project is aiming at defining and elaborating on the connection between Omega-3 acids,\n      and cardiovascular complications, their influence on the functioning of the cardiovascular\n      system, and moreover, a better understanding of the effects of therapeutic and\n      pharmacological therapies in patients at different stages of chronic kidney disease.\n      Carrying out this project will be a good start to shape an international project in this\n      area."
