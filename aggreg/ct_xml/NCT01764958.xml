  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed research has the potential of contributing to the limited empirical literature
      on the relationship between maternal sensitivity and motor development of preterm infants.
      If indeed maternal attuned behaviors will be found to be associated with the quality of
      motor development, such a finding will support the effectiveness of physical therapy in
      guiding caregivers to attune their holding and touch of preterm infants.

      We hypothesize that mothers and infants' attunement during observed interaction will be
      related to the quality of preterm infants' spontaneous movements in the following ways:
      First, better maternal attunement to the infants needs, and in particular attunement of
      holding and touch will be associated with better quality of spontaneous movements of the
      infants. Second, more initiations and/or involvement of infants in interaction will be
      associated with better maternal attunement to the infant. Third, more initiations and/or
      involvement of infants in interaction will be associated with better quality of spontaneous
      movements and better achievements in developmental milestone. All hypotheses will be
      examined while controlling for maternal use of SSC method during hospitalization after birth
      and family demographic backgrounds.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sixty preterm infants at 3-4 months of corrected age and their mothers will be recruited.
      Infants will be evaluated for their spontaneous movements and their developmental milestones
      achievement, and mothers and infants will be evaluated for their attunement during observed
      interaction, especially on maternal attunement in holding and touching their infants.
      Mothers will report on demographic background of the family, temperament of their infants
      and previous Skin to Skin Contact treatment in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit.
