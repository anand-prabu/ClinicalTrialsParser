  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the effectiveness and safety of 3 mg
      glucagon (AMG504-1) administered as a puff into the nose compared with
      commercially-available glucagon given by injection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Glucagon, the treatment of choice for severe hypoglycemia outside of the hospital setting,
      is currently available only as a powder that must be mixed with a diluent immediately prior
      to administration by injection.  Although this is a very simple procedure for insulin-using
      individuals, subjects experiencing severe hypoglycemia cannot inject themselves with
      glucagon because of the disabling effects of severe neuroglycopenia.  For any non-medical
      person who is confronted with an emergency situation in which a patient with diabetes is in
      a hypoglycemic coma or suffering hypoglycemia-related convulsions, reconstitution and
      injection of the current injectable glucagon is a complex and daunting procedure.

      When used at the recommended dose of 1 mg by injection, glucagon often causes a substantial,
      although transient, hyperglycemia that is often accompanied by nausea and vomiting.  The
      data generated to date with AMG504-1 suggest the resulting glucagon pharmacokinetics (PK),
      although less than that observed with injected glucagon, results in a therapeutic blood
      glucose increment with a very low incidence of gastrointestinal adverse effects.

      The procedure to evaluate the efficacy of AMG504-1 consists essentially of inducing
      hypoglycemia by an intravenous (IV) infusion of regular insulin diluted in normal saline.
      The insulin infusion will be used to decrease the glucose to a target &lt;50 mg/dL.  The
      insulin infusion will be stopped once the plasma glucose is &lt;60 mg/dL.  Five minutes after
      stopping the insulin infusion, participants will be treated with either a 3 mg glucagon dose
      intranasally or 1 mg of glucagon administered by intramuscular (IM) injection in the deltoid
      muscle of the non-dominant arm.  During the 5-minute period after the insulin infusion has
      stopped, the glucose level is expected to continue to decrease an additional 15-20 mg/dL.

      It is believed that a nadir of &lt;50 mg/dL will be low enough to generate clinical symptoms in
      most participants yet high enough to avoid impairment of consciousness. Blood glucose levels
      and adverse events will be carefully monitored for 90 minutes post-dosing.  After a wash-out
      period of 7 days or more, participants will return to the clinic and the procedure repeated
      with each participant crossed over to the other treatment.  As such, each participant will
      undergo two episodes of insulin-induced hypoglycemia in random order and receive AMG504-1
      during one episode and commercially available glucagon (GlucaGen, Novo Nordisk) by IM
      injection during the other episode.
