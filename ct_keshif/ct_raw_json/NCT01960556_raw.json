The\n      investigators objective was to improve maintenance bundle compliance rates and nursing\n      competency surrounding central venous line (CVL) care in their pediatric intensive care unit\n      (PICU).\n\n      A multidisciplinary team developed a bedside simulation-based training program to improve\n      compliance with standard PICU CVL maintenance bundle.   The investigators then performed a\n      randomized comparison study comparing a standard CVL bundle education process for bedside\n      PICU nurses in a control group (CG) to an intervention group (IG) receiving bedside training\n      to simulate a CVL dressing change and maintenance bundle followed by intermittent\n      educational refresh. Groups were assessed for compliance with prescribed components of the\n      CVL bundle maintenance (CVL score).\n\n      CVL scores will be compared between groups"
