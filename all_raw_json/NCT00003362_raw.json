Combining vaccine therapy with immune\n      adjuvants, such as GM-CSF, Montanide ISA-51, or QS21, may be a more effective treatment for\n      advanced melanoma.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to study the effectiveness of gp 100-tyrosinase peptide\n      vaccine with one of the immune adjuvants GM-CSF, Montanide ISA-51, or QS21 in treating\n      patients who have stage III or stage IV melanoma."

Evaluate the immunogenicity of gp100-tyrosinase peptide vaccine with\n      sargramostim (GM-CSF), Montanide ISA-51, or QS21 as adjuvant in patients with advanced\n      melanoma. II. Determine the toxicity of this multiepitope melanoma peptide vaccine in\n      conjunction with these 3 adjuvants in these patients. III. Evaluate the antitumor effects of\n      this multiepitope melanoma peptide vaccine in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified according to age (65 years and\n      under vs more than 65 years) and previous systemic chemotherapy (yes vs no). Patients are\n      randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms: Arm I (Sargramostim (GM-CSF) as adjuvant): Patients\n      receive 3 monthly vaccinations with gp100-tyrosinase peptide vaccine administered\n      intradermally during weeks 1, 5, and 9. For each vaccination, GM-CSF is administered\n      intradermally on days 1-10; the vaccine is administered on day 7. Arm II (Montanide ISA-51):\n      Patients receive 3 monthly vaccinations with gp100-tyrosinase peptide vaccine mixed with\n      Montanide ISA-51 and administered subcutaneously (SQ) during weeks 1, 5, and 9. Arm III\n      (QS21 as adjuvant): Patients receive 3 monthly vaccinations with gp100-tyrosinase peptide\n      vaccine mixed with QS21 and administered SQ during weeks 1, 5, and 9. Patients with stable\n      or responding disease may receive 3 additional monthly immunizations beginning 3-6 months\n      following completion of 1 course of immunizations if there is evidence of T cell response\n      against either wild type peptide. Patients are followed at weeks 13 and 17.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 27 patients will be accrued for this study within 18-24\n      months."
