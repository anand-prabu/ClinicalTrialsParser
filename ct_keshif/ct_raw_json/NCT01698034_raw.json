The investigators hypothesized that\n      cardiovascular risk markers of C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), total\n      cholesterol, and body mass index (BMI) would be lower at post-intervention (4 months after\n      baseline) in the volunteer group compared to the control group. The investigators also\n      hypothesized that the intervention might work through pathways such as reducing negative\n      mood, improving self esteem, and increasing prosocial behaviors (empathy, altruism)."
