All persons completing at least 8\n      weeks of therapy on 081 will be offered the opportunity to participate in the nested study\n      (ACTG 981) of systemic antifungal therapy (fluconazole) versus local therapy (Clotrimazole)\n      for the prevention of serious fungal disease.\n\n      Persons with HIV disease who are receiving AZT are at risk for PCP, toxoplasmosis, bacterial\n      pneumonia, and other serious infections. It is therefore important to find drugs that can be\n      given along with AZT to control these infections. Aerosolized pentamidine (PEN) has been\n      shown to be useful in preventing PCP and is expected to lower the 2-year risk of PCP. Both\n      sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (SMX/TMP) and dapsone probably also provide effective\n      preventive treatment against PCP, and both may be useful in preventing toxoplasmosis and\n      extrapulmonary pneumocystosis."
