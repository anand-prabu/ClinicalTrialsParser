This project proposed by\n      bioinformatics prediction CLCF1 targeted regulation of miRNAs, and use the 3 'UTR dual\n      luciferase report system for target validation, aimed at the miRNA levels to explore\n      postmenopausal osteoporosis molecular mechanism with kidney Yin deficiency syndrome."
