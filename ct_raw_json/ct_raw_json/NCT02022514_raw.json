The 66\n      patients will be randomized in one to one ratio to an intervention group that received bone\n      marrow mononuclear cells by intracoronary autologous (0.5 to 1 x 10 9 total cells) and a\n      control group who receive only conventional medical treatment. The two groups of patients\n      will be followed, in the clinical trial, for 6 months. Once the test is complete, they will\n      follow according to standard clinical practice of Cardiology hospital for at least 24\n      months.\n\n      Patients will be assessed by clinical echocardiographic and Magnetic resonance methods. All\n      patients will be medically treated similarly with ACE inhibitors or angiotensine 1 receptor\n      (AT1) receptor antagonists of angiotensin II, beta-blockers and diuretics.\n\n      The main objective os the study is to determine the efficacy of intracoronary infusion of\n      mononuclear cells from autologous bone marrow in patients with chronic coronary occlusion\n      previously revascularized with stents in terms of improved ventricular function determined\n      by magnetic resonance.\n\n      Secondary objectives of the study are:\n\n        1. To design, in view of the results obtained, a more appropriate treatment protocol for\n           chronic coronary occlusion.\n\n        2.

To evaluate the safety of treatment, the analysis of possible cardiac events during the\n           6-month follow-up in the clinical trial and 24 months of additional clinical follow-up\n           (death, myocardial infarction, repeat revascularization) compared with the control\n           group.\n\n        4. To study changes in global and segmental left ventricular function by studying\n           myocardial deformation Speckle tracking echocardiography bidimensional (EST2D) and\n           three-dimensional echocardiography comparatively amongst patients along the track and\n           the two groups."
