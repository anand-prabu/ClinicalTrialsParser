It is estimated that with the\n      improvement in quality of life and treatment modulation, the incidence will continue to rise\n      in the coming years. Because the current available prospective studies often exclude\n      patients above 65 or 70 years old, the data and guidelines on head and neck treatment for\n      these patients population remain limited.\n\n      Treatment of elderly patients with advanced stage III-IV oropharyngeal squamous carcinoma\n      with intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) using RapidArc\u00ae or Helical Tomotherapy\u00ae at a\n      dose of 70 Gy in 33 fractions to the PTV (GTV) and 59.4 Gy in 33 fractions to the first\n      disease-free lymphatic relay bilaterally as well as a combination Cisplatin chemotherapy at\n      a reduced dose."
