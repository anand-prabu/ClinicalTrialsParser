            "textblock": "Posterior lumbar spinal surgical pain leads to a severe degree of pain, and, hence, various\n      means of pain management are required. Opioid pain medications such as morphine and fentanyl\n      are frequently used as intravenously administered medications. To reduce the use of opioids\n      for pain relief, a non-opioid form of pain relief, such as a Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory\n      Drug (NSAID), is often added to the regimen.\n\n      With the use of NSAIDs, however, the risk of systemic side effects such as bleeding,\n      gastroduodenal bleeding, and kidney damage are being reported, and there is also a report of\n      inhibition of spinal fusion; these risks limit the use of NSAIDs.\n\n      Nefopam, a new centrally-acting analgesic agent, has been reported in an animal study to\n      desensitize post-surgical pain, and when used with an opioid analgesic, it indirectly\n      controlled the NMDA receptor, which inhibited the generation of c-fos gene at the spine.\n      There are also reports that Nefopam managed pain by inhibiting the serotonin reuptake\n      receptors.\n\n      In clinical practice, the administration of Nefopam in patients who required post-surgical\n      pain management reduced the use of opioid analgesics by 20-50 % and also reduced the\n      prevalence of nausea and vomiting.\n\n      Therefore, the investigators considered whether the addition of Nefopam for intravenous\n      patient-controlled analgesia in patients with lumbar spinal surgery would reduce the side\n      effects seen in monotherapy with opioid analgesia and result in effective pain management.\n      This study was conducted to address this question."
