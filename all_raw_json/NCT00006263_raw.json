Colony-stimulating factors such as filgrastim may increase the\n      number of immune cells found in bone marrow or peripheral blood and may help a person's\n      immune system recover from the side effects of chemotherapy.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining carboplatin, temozolomide,\n      and filgrastim in treating patients who have newly diagnosed or recurrent high-grade glioma."

Patients are stratified according to disease category\n      (glioblastoma multiforme vs anaplastic astrocytoma vs several other high-grade mixed\n      gliomas).\n\n      Patients receive carboplatin IV over 4 hours on days 1-2; oral temozolomide every 12 hours\n      on days 1-5; and filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously or IV daily starting no earlier than day\n      7 and continuing until blood counts recover. Treatment repeats every 28 days for at least 4\n      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 102-222 (17-37 per each of 6 strata) will be accrued for this\n      study within 4 years."
