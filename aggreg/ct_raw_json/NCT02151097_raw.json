The surgery will be performed according to\n      standard-of-care. The resected prostatectomy specimens will be imaged using a CLI specimen\n      analyser, consisting of a light-tight box on which an ultra-sensitive lens and Electron\n      Multiplying Charged-Coupled Device (EMCCD) camera are mounted.\n\n      This study will measure the agreement between margin status of the prostatectomy specimen as\n      determined by CLI and by histopathology (reference method). This study will assess\n      feasibility before proceeding to pivotal studies to determine diagnostic performance."
