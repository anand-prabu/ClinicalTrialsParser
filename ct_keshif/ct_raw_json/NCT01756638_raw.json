The study consists of 3 phases: Screening phase (consists of 14 days before\n      study commences on Day -1); Treatment phase (consists of 28-daily dosing cycles wherein\n      abiraterone 1000 milligram [mg] once daily along with 5 mg prednisolone twice daily will be\n      given until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity is observed); and Follow-up phase\n      (up to 5 years or until survival after the first dose of study drug). Abiraterone will be\n      orally administered daily as at least 1 hour before the meal or 2 hours after the meal. Dose\n      reduction will be allowed at the Investigator's discretion but not lower than 500 mg per\n      day. Participants will discontinue study treatment at disease progression unless, in the\n      Investigator's opinion, it is deemed that the participants will continue to derive benefit\n      from abiraterone. Efficacy will be evaluated primarily through decline in prostate-specific\n      antigen (substance in blood that is measured to check for prostate cancer) after 12 weeks of\n      therapy. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study."
