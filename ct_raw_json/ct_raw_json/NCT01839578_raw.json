            "textblock": "Sepsis is responsible for 50% of all acute kidney injury (AKI) in intensive care units\n      (ICUs), contributing greatly to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). Special types of\n      continuous renal replacement therapies (CRRT) have been proposed as adjuvant therapies for\n      septic shock due to their ability to remove middle molecular weight molecules such as\n      inflammatory mediators involved in MODS pathophysiology. These therapies are called\n      extracorporeal \" blood purification \" therapies.\n\n      When CRRT is used, an anticoagulation is required to prevent clotting of the extracorporeal\n      circuit, possibly causing bleeding in selected patients. Many anticoagulation strategies\n      have been proposed and the most commonly used in 2013 is still unfractionated heparin.\n      Regional citrate anticoagulation (RCA) is an interesting alternative as it dramatically\n      decreases the bleeding risk.\n\n      The investigators hypothesize that the use of citrate with Super High Flux Continuous\n      Veno-Venus Hemodialysis (SHF-CVVHD) would be highly beneficial over time by preserving the\n      filter effectiveness via limiting protein adhesion (which subsequently reduces filter pore\n      sizes (protein cake)), as compared to heparin. Consequently, higher clearances of the\n      inflammatory mediators could be maintained over time with citrate as compared to heparin\n      anticoagulation. In other words, for the same duration of filter use, middle molecular\n      weight molecules and cytokines clearances would be greater with citrate as compared to\n      heparin. To test this hypothesis, the investigators will perform a clinical randomized\n      controlled trial which aim would be to compare middle molecular weight molecules and\n      cytokines clearances in SHF-CVVHD using RCA versus systemic heparin anticoagulation in\n      septic patients with AKI."
