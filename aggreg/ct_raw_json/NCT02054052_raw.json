            "textblock": "Malignant pleural effusion (MPE) is common in lung cancer, and intrapleural drugs injection\n      is important in the treatment. Non- cytotoxic drugs include those with a sclerosing effect\n      that produces pleurodesis, which is easy to  cause severe chest pain despite of no influence\n      on the following chemotherapy. Tumor angiogenesis is important in producing MPE. Bevacizumab\n      has been administrated locally in treating optic nerve sickness successfully by anti-VEGF\n      mechanism. So we hypothesize that intrapleural bevacizumab is also effective in treating\n      MPE."
