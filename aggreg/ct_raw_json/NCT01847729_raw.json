This will allow us to complete\n      patient's pharmacological characterization."

The two groups of patients\n      will be compared according to the presence or absence of co-addictions. For the quantitative\n      variables Student tests or non parametric tests will be used. For the qualitative variables,\n      we will use Chi-squared or Fisher tests.\n\n      Finally, multivariate analyses will be carried out. The factors that have been previously\n      identified as a being linked to co-addictions (with the threshold p = 0.2) will the be\n      incorporated into logistic regression models. The best model, wich enables explanation of\n      the co-addictions will then be selected using likelihood ratio tests."
