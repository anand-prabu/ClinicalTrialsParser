Correlation between AR expression and clinical and biological features (tumor size,\n           nodal status, histotype, grading, proliferative index, ER, PgR, HER2)\n\n        2.

Evaluation of ER, PgR, HER2 expression on tumor cells of metastatic site (when it is\n           possible) and comparison with the same features of primitive tumor.\n\n        4. CTCs analysis in term of molecular characteristics (gene expression and mutations) and\n           functionality (vitality and tumorigenicity).\n\n        5. Prognostic and predictive role of Circulating Tumor Cells (CTC) evaluated at baseline\n           before study treatment and at the moment of discontinuation of treatment.\n\n      Statistical Considerations:\n\n      The sample size required for each treatment arm will be predicted using a SIMON two-stage\n      design with a 10 percent alpha and beta error.\n\n      Assuming an acceptable minimum clinical benefit P0 equal to 10 percent and an auspicious\n      clinical benefit P1 equal to 30 percent, we plan to recruit 12 patients per group in the\n      first step.\n\n      If the number of responders is greater or equal to 2, recruitment will continue up to a\n      total of 35 patients (per group).\n\n      If the number of responders is greater or equal to 6, the combination will be considered\n      active and worthy of further evaluation.\n\n      If a subgroup population is discontinued at the end of the first step, the study will be\n      continued with the other subgroup."
