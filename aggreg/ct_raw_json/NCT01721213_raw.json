            "textblock": "As part of a European post-marketing commitment, GSK will conduct a survey of physicians'\n      and patients' understanding of the significant risks associated with Trobalt\u2122 (retigabine),\n      as described in the Patient Information Leaflet (PIL) and the Physician's Guide. The goal of\n      the surveys is to evaluate the effectiveness of the educational plan as specified in the\n      European Risk Management Plan (RMP).\n\n      The objectives of this study are to assess patients' and prescribers' understanding and\n      knowledge of the significant risks associated with Trobalt\u2122 use as evaluated by a survey\n      instrument.\n\n      This is a cross sectional survey of:\n\n        1. 250 patients recruited from across the following countries (United Kingdom, Sweden,\n           Denmark, Switzerland, Spain, Slovakia and Norway) and up to 100 patients from Germany\n           who are currently using or have filled a prescription for Trobalt\u2122 at least once in the\n           last 3 months.\n\n        2. 200 neurologists who have prescribed an anti-epileptic drug (AED) at least once in the\n           last 3 months, and who were on the list to which a letter containing the Physician's\n           Guide for Trobalt\u2122 was distributed from across the following countries (United Kingdom,\n           Sweden, Denmark, Switzerland, Spain, Slovakia and Norway). At least 75 of the\n           neurologists will have prescribed Trobalt\u2122. The survey will also aim to include up to\n           100 neurologists from Germany of which approximately 50 will have prescribed Trobalt\u2122.\n\n      Patients eligible for the survey will be asked to take the survey online or via a telephone\n      interview if the latter is preferred. Neurologists will be invited to take the survey\n      online.\n\n      The selected countries were the first five countries to launch Trobalt\u2122 (Germany, Denmark,\n      United Kingdom, Switzerland and Sweden) and an additional three countries with launch in\n      2011, but with relatively high rates of uptake of Trobalt\u2122 (Spain, Slovakia and Norway). The\n      selection of countries includes Switzerland, which is not part of the European Union.\n      However, the key messages regarding the risks with Trobalt\u2122 are in alignment. The rationale\n      for surveying the first five countries to launch is so that any issues identified from these\n      countries regarding the effectiveness of the Physician's Guide and PIL in communicating the\n      risks of Trobalt\u2122 can be addressed as soon as possible, and the key messages can be revised\n      in a timely manner. In addition, these countries are likely to provide the greatest number\n      of neurologists with experience of prescribing Trobalt\u2122, and their patients.\n\n      The primary outcome of the survey is the proportion of patients/neurologists providing\n      correct responses to a series of questions concerning the significant risks associated with\n      Trobalt\u2122. The risks evaluated will be those described in the Trobalt\u2122 PIL and in the\n      Physician's Guide."
