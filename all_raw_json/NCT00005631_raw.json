            "textblock": "RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies such as rituximab can locate cancer cells and either kill\n      them or deliver cancer-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Drugs used\n      in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing\n      or die. Combining combination chemotherapy with monoclonal antibody therapy may kill more\n      cancer cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of rituximab and combination chemotherapy\n      in treating patients who have relapsed or refractory large cell lymphoma."

            "textblock": "OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the complete response rate in patients with relapsed or refractory\n      CD20-positive diffuse large cell, immunoblastic, or anaplastic large cell lymphoma treated\n      with cytoreduction and mobilization with rituximab, ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide\n      (RICE). II. Assess the ability of this regimen to deplete the stem cell harvest of B-cells\n      and tumor cells in these patients. III. Assess the efficacy of this regimen to mobilize\n      peripheral blood progenitor cells in these patients. IV. Assess the safety and toxicity of\n      this regimen in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: Cytoreduction and mobilization: Patients receive ifosfamide IV over 24 hours and\n      carboplatin IV on day 4 and etoposide IV over 1 hour on days 3-5. Chemotherapy repeats every\n      2 weeks for 3 courses. Patients receive rituximab IV on day -2 before initiation of\n      chemotherapy and on day 1 of each course of chemotherapy. Patients receive filgrastim\n      (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) daily on days 7-14 of each course of chemotherapy. Patients with\n      complete or partial response after completion of course 3 continue to receive G-CSF SC daily\n      until peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) are harvested. When blood counts recover, PBSC are\n      harvested and selected for CD34+ cells. If sufficient numbers of CD34+ cells are not\n      obtained, patients undergo bone marrow harvest.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 36 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years."
