They must be able to provide\n        informed consent and weigh less than 300 lbs (due to limitations of the PET and MRI\n        scanners).\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n        In addition to the exclusion criteria used for PNAT trial [NCT01314001], participants in\n        this trial will be excluded if they meet the following criteria:\n\n        Imaging-Related Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          1. Weigh over 299 lbs.\n\n          2. Self-reported history of head trauma or brain (or CNS) tumor.\n\n          3. Self-reported history of claustrophobia (contraindicated for PET and MRI).\n\n          4. Cochlear implant or bilateral hearing aids.\n\n          5. Pacemakers, certain metallic implants, or presence of metal in the eye as\n             contraindicated for MRI.\n\n          6. History of gunshot wound (including BB guns).\n\n          7. Circumstances or conditions that may interfere with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).\n\n          8. CO reading greater than 15ppm at the PET Scan Session (or at least a 50% reduction\n             from the PNAT Intake Session).\n\n          9. BrAC reading greater than or equal to 0.01 at the PET Scan Session.\n\n         10. Positive urine drug screen for cocaine, phencyclidine, amphetamines,\n             methamphetamines, tricyclic antidepressants, opiates, methadone, benzodiazepines, or\n             barbiturates at the PNAT Intake Session or PET Scan Session.\n\n         11. Positive urine pregnancy (females only) screen at the PET Scan Session and/or MRI\n             Scan Session.\n\n         12. Inability to give blood at the PET Scan Session (blood samples are required to\n             analyze PET data).\n\n         13. Prior exposure to radioactive tracers in imaging studies or for medical reasons may\n             be exclusionary.\n\n        General Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          1. Any medical condition, illness, disorder or concomitant medication that could\n             compromise participant safety or treatment, as determined by the Principal\n             Investigator or Co-investigators.\n\n          2. Inability to provide informed consent or complete the study procedures within 10\n             hours and/or correctly, as determined by the Principal Investigator or\n             Co-investigators.\n\n          3. Any physical or visual impairment that would prevent completion of the cognitive\n             tasks.\n\n          4. Participation (within the last 6 months) in other studies at our center involving\n             similar cognitive testing procedures."
