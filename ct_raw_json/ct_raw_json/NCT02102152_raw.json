            "textblock": "The use of inhaled medications for the treatment of pulmonary diseases allows for the\n      delivery of a high concentration of a drug at the site of disease with reduced systemic\n      absorption and risk of systemic adverse effects. Inhaled Tobramycin has been successfully\n      used in the maintenance treatment of CF patients with chronic colonization with PA\n      (Pseudomonas aeruginosa). In the CF population TOBI has been proven to improve lung\n      functions, decrease the density of the PA in the sputum, decrease hospitalizations, and\n      reduce the risk of mortality.\n\n      Non CF Bronchiectasis share many features in common with CF, including frequent colonization\n      with PA that leads to deterioration in lung function and increased morbidity. A recent\n      Cochrane review concluded that there is a small benefit for the use of prolonged antibiotics\n      in the treatment of bronchiectasis, however further randomized controlled trials with\n      adequate power and standardized end points are required.\n\n      There have been reports in the literature describing the efficacy of inhaled tobramycin the\n      treatment of patients with non CF  bronchiectasis with eradication of PA, and significant\n      improvement in respiratory symptoms.  There were however patients who discontinued treatment\n      due to adverse events most commonly cough wheezing and dyspnea. (Scheinberg and Shore, Chest\n       2005).\n\n      TOBI Podhaler is a dry powder inhaler that was recently launched, and is much easier and\n      faster to use compared to nebulised Tobramycin. To the best of our knowledge Tobramycin dry\n      powder formulation has not yet been trialed in patients with non CF bronchiectasis.\n\n      The purpose of this trial is to assess the efficacy and tolerability of TOBI Podhaler in\n      patients with non CF bronchiectasis, and to gather more data on the benefit of continuous\n      antibiotic therapy in patients with non CF bronchectais."
