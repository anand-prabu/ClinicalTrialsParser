  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to evaluate the positive anesthetic properties such as reduce
      intraoperative analgesic requirement, time to extubation and recovery, and early
      postoperative pain of dexmedetomidine used as a hypotensive agent compared with
      nitroglycerin.

      The subject included the healthy patients who underwent orthognathic surgery and gave
      written the informed consent. The sample size was calculate from the amount of fentanyl use
      in orthognathic surgical case and difference more 30% was significant.  Randomization was
      done by random number table to 2 groups. Both groups received standardized controlled
      hypotensive anesthesia and surgery. D group used dexmedetomidine as the hypotensive drug and
      N group use nitroglycerin. The main outcome were the amount of fentanyl use, time to eye
      opening, follow simple command, extubation, early postoperative pain, and early
      postoperative amount of pain killer. All recorded by anesthesiologist on data sheet.

      compare statistical analysis used compare mean by unpaired student t test.
