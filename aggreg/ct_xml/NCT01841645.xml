  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to investigate the effects of Conjugated Linoleic Acid (CLA)
      from dairy products on fatty acid metabolism and human health. A CLA depletion-repletion
      study was carried out with healthy volunteers. CLA depletion was achieved through an
      eight-week dairy fat restriction, followed by an eight-week repletion period consisting of
      intake of a butter naturally enriched with CLA. Changes in body composition, fasting glucose
      and insulin, inflammatory mediators, cell membranes' stability, plasma lipid levels and
      fatty acid composition of lipid classes are evaluated after depletion and repletion phases.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After collecting baseline blood samples, CLA-depletion phase started with dietary
      orientation, by a registered dietitian, to the study subjects (n=29) to exclude from their
      diets any type of dairy fat for the following 8 weeks. Blood samples were taken at the end
      of CLA-depletion, and CLA-repletion phase was initiated by dietitians' instructions:
      volunteers returned to their regular diets, and additionally consumed a CLA-enriched butter
      for another 8-week period. Blood samples were taken at the end of the CLA-repletion phase.
      The effects of CLA on the following parameters were evaluated: inflammatory mediators; fatty
      acid composition of erythrocytes, plasma phospholipids and cholesterol esters; body
      composition; clinical factors associated with the metabolic syndrome and indicators of cell
      membranes' stability.
