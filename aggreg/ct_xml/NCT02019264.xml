  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study in
      overweight and obese subjects with CV disease and/or multiple CV risk factors.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 12,000 subjects will be randomized to two treatment groups in a ratio of 1:1,
      stratified by the presence of established CV disease (approximately 80%) or CV risk factors
      without established CV disease (approximately 20%). Subjects will receive lorcaserin HCl 10
      mg BID or placebo BID. The study will consist of 2 phases: Prerandomization and
      Randomization. The Prerandomization Phase will last up to 30 days and consist of one visit
      during which subjects will be screened for eligibility. The Randomization Phase will consist
      of two periods: Treatment and Follow-up. The Treatment Period will last for approximately 5
      years with approximately 18 visits and Follow-up period is 30 (+ or - 10 days) from the end
      of treatment visit.

             physical activity program

          3. Age greater than or equal to 40 years with established CV disease as defined by one
             of the following:

               1. History of documented MI or ischemic stroke

               2. History of peripheral artery disease

        OR

        Age greater than or equal to 55 years for women or greater than or equal to 50 years for
        men who have T2DM without established CV disease plus at least one of the following CV
        risk factors:

          1. Hypertension, or currently receiving therapy for documented hypertension

          2. Dyslipidemia, or currently taking prescription lipid-lowering therapy for documented
             dyslipidemia

          3. Calculated creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 30 to less than or equal to
             60 mL/min per the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI)

        Association (ADA) guidelines.

        All T2DM subjects must have an HbA[1c] less than 10% at Screening.  If subjects are being
        treated, or upon diagnosis need to be treated with antidiabetic agents, the T2DM treatment
        regimen must be stable for at least 3 months prior to randomization.

          3. Moderate or greater symptoms of pulmonary hypertension (PH)

          4. Known severe valvular disease Moderate renal impairment, severe renal impairment, or
             end stage renal disease (ESRD) (calculated creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min
             per the CKD-EPI equation based on ideal body weight)

          5. Severe hepatic impairment

          6. Use of other products intended for weight loss including prescription drugs,
             over-the-counter (OTC) drugs, and herbal preparations

          7. Use of more than one other serotonergic drug

          8. Use of drugs known to increase the risk for cardiac valvulopathy prior to Screening
             including, but not limited to:  cyproheptadine, amoxapine, TCAs, mirtazapine,
             pergolide, ergotamine, methysergide, cabergoline

          9. History or evidence of clinically significant disease (e.g., malignancy, cardiac,
             respiratory, gastrointestinal, renal or psychiatric disease)

         10. Use of lorcaserin HCl prior to Screening or hypersensitivity to lorcaserin HCl or any
             of the excipients
