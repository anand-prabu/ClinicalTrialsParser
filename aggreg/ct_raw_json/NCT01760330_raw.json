This study is a prospective randomized\n      double blinded placebo controlled study. The investigators will have two arms, one group of\n      patients will receive intravenous acetaminophen and one group that will receive a placebo at\n      a total of four doses over 24 hours. The results of this study may affect the intraoperative\n      anesthetic management as well as post-operative surgical management of this specific patient\n      population. The goal is to determine the benefit of adding a non-opioid analgesic and\n      hypothesizing that it may reduce the amount of narcotic consumption in the post anesthesia\n      care unit as well as during the post-operative stay."
