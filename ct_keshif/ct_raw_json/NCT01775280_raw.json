Non-resectability or borderline resectablily is based\n        closeness to essential nonresectable structures (f.e. the portal vein bifurca- tion or\n        hepatic vein trifurcation) or insufficient liver volume after resection, general\n        performance status of the patient.\n\n        Chemotherapy (mostly applicable to CRCM) should be termininated at least 4 weeks prior to\n        enrolling patients in the study.\n\n          -  Concomitant manoevers to manipulate liver volume like portal vein embolization or\n             ligation and two-stage resections are allowed\n\n          -  Male or female patients 18-99 years of age\n\n          -  Presentation of the case at the Multidisciplinary Meeting attended by hepatobiliary\n             surgeons, oncologists, hepatologists and radiologists\n\n          -  Written informed consent given by the patient\n\n          -  Adequate liver function or kidney function tests, including any of the following.
