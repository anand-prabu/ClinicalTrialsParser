            "textblock": "Theoretical Basis:\n\n      As far as the current research status, total colectomy or subtotal colectomy has become the\n      preferred type of surgery for slow-transit constipation treatment. There are different\n      opinions on intestinal anastomosis and the specific scope of excision. There is a type of\n      surgery reserving the ileocecum, as the ileocaecal valve has the function of postponing the\n      fecal evacuation. There's also a type of surgery excising the ileocecum , and establishing\n      the pouch, as reserving the ileocecum  may cause the recurrence of constipation, and\n      establishing the pouch has function of relieving the postoperative fecal incontinence. On\n      the basis, our own type of surgery is designed; ileocecum  is excised for preventing the\n      recurrence of constipation, while the anti-peristaltic ileosigmoid anastomosis  between the\n      small intestine and part of sigmoid is made for preventing the severe diarrhea.\n\n      Methods and techniques:\n\n      The data of patients with STC preformed surgery of laparoscopic subtotal colectomy with\n      anti-peristaltic ileosigmoid anastomosis during 2009.01-2014.05 was reviewed. The related\n      status such as frequency of defecation, course of constipation, laxatives use condition the\n      condition of using laxatives, and changes in weight were investigated. Changes of defecation\n      and weight, periprocedural complications (wound infection, lung infection and intestinal\n      fistula), long-term complication (malnutrition, abdominal pain, ileus), life satisfaction,\n      wexner score of pre-operation and postoperation ect were investigated in follow-ups.\n\n      Surgical operation process:\n\n      1,Laparoscope Sub-total Colectomy\uff1a After the entire colon mobilization,the ileum is resected\n      at 10cm from  ileocecum   and 10-15cm colon up to peritoneal reflection is reserved. The\n      ileocolic artery should be reserved carefully.2, Intestinal tract reconstruction: The\n      terminal ileum is turned over 180\u00b0in anti-clockwise direction along the superior mesenteric\n      vein long axis. To avoid the small mesenteric torsion, we should turn the broken edge\n      towards inside. The terminal ileum and 10-15cm colon anastomose in anti-peristaltic\n      direction,the anastomotic length is 8-10 cm.3, Sewn the space between anastomotic Intestine\n      and posterior peritoneum. A drain is placed in the abdominal cavity and another one is\n      placed in anal canal."
