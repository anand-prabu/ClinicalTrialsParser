While\n      221 millions cases were estimated in 2010, the prevalence would be 366 millions in 2030. It\n      is well recognized that regular consumption of fruits and vegetables can lower the incidence\n      of chronic diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and inflammatory\n      diseases. Recently, Drs Desjardins, Abrams and Marette's research team discovered a high\n      amount of a sesquiterpene in berries. This molecule is recognized for its ability to improve\n      glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity, and to lower pro-inflammatory profile of obese\n      mice. The aim of this study is to determine the effect of a polyphenol rich berries extract\n      mix on insulin sensitivity, glucose tolerance, pancreatic \u03b2-cells function, lipids and\n      inflammatory profile, and oxidative stress markers, on human obese subjects that have\n      insulin resistance."

This amount give the equivalent of 333 mg of polyphenols, thus corresponding to a daily consumption of one cup of berries. The placebo beverage is also a fruit taste beverage, but without polyphenols. Both beverage are isocaloric, with same appearance and taste.
