            "textblock": "Diabetic patients show a higher cardiovascular risk compared with non-diabetic patients. It\n      is therefore crucial that blood glucose lowering drugs reveal a favorable cardiovascular\n      risk profile independently of metabolic control.\n\n      EPCs are a subset of circulating mononuclear cells derived from the bone marrow. EPCs play a\n      fundamental role in the formation of new blood vessels (neo-endothelization) and repairing\n      of existing blood vessels (re-endothelization) in order to maintain endothelial homeostasis\n      and integrity. Endothelial damage and tissue ischemia, through the release of growth factors\n      and cytokines, represent a strong stimulus for the mobilization of EPCs from the bone\n      marrow. Reduced EPC number has been related to the presence of traditional risk factors for\n      cardiovascular disease and to the development of atherosclerosis and has been shown to\n      predict cardiovascular (CV)risk. Type 2 diabetes is known to be associated with an increased\n      CV risk and a reduced EPC number. Recent data suggest that DDP-IV inhibitors might be\n      involved in the mechanisms promoting bone-marrow EPC mobilization. This putative ancillary\n      effect of DPP-IV might have a favorable impact on type 2 diabetes, a condition\n      characterized by an increased CV risk.\n\n      This is a randomized, open-label, active-treatment-controlled, two parallel arm (2:1),\n      intervention trial comparing DPP-IV inhibitor Vildagliptin (100 mg daily) with Glibenclamide\n      (maximum daily dose of 10 mg). Treatment allocation and titration regimens are not blinded.\n\n      Primary end-point:Absolute and relative change in the EPC number at visit: V0\n      (randomization), V2 (month 4), V3 (month 8) and V4 (month 12).\n\n      Secondary end-point: Absolute and relative change in HbA1C compared to baseline."
