The oral bioavailability of curcumin is low due to its poor\n      aqueous solubility, limited gastrointestinal absorption, rapid metabolism and excretion.\n      Therefore, we tested, in a randomized crossover study, simultaneous application of\n      phytochemicals and micellar solubilisation, alone and together, as strategies to enhance the\n      absorption of curcumin into the body. Furthermore, we investigated age and sex differences\n      in curcumin pharmacokinetics."
