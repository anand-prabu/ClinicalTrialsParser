Patients repeat biopsy on days 3 and 28. If there is evidence of clinical benefit or\n      response without significant toxicity, patients may receive a maximum of 3 courses.\n      Treatment beyond 3 courses must be approved by protocol investigator.\n\n      Cohorts of 3 patients are treated at escalating dose levels of adenovirus p53. Patients in\n      each cohort are followed for dose limiting toxicity (DLT) for 2 weeks after completion of\n      one course before dose escalation proceeds in subsequent cohorts. If 1 of 3 patients at a\n      dose level experiences dose limiting toxicity (DLT), then 2 additional patients are entered\n      at the same dose level. If more than 1 of 5 patients experience DLT, the previous dose is\n      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). An additional 10 patients are treated at the MTD.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for the first 2 years, every 6 months for the next 3\n      years, and annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: There will be 15 patients accrued into this study over 1 year."
