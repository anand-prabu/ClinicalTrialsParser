We will conduct systematic dissolution testing of the brand\n      and all currently approved tacrolimus drug formulations using the FDA-recommended\n      dissolution method.  We propose to test and compare the 1mg capsule strength (3 production\n      lots/ manufacturer). In addition, we will compare the different formulations in terms of\n      potency, purity and other quality attributes. This work will be carried out in the\n      GMP-compliant facilities of The University of Iowa Pharmaceuticals and the University of\n      Colorado.  Based on these studies the two most disparate generic tacrolimus formulations\n      (Generic Hi and Generic Lo) will be selected and compared with the Brand (PrografR,\n      Astellas, Deerfield, IL) in the clinical trial.\n\n      This is an open label, prospective, multicenter, randomized, replicate, six-period,\n      three-sequence cross-over study to compare the steady state pharmacokinetics of PrografR to\n      Generic Hi to Generic Lo in stable kidney and liver transplant subjects. The PK assessor\n      will be blinded to the assigned treatment sequence and formulation.  The person analyzing\n      the levels and analyzing the results will be blinded to formulation sequence. Each subject\n      will be randomized to one of the three sequences where Generic Hi and Generic Lo represent\n      the two generics and B the brand, Prograf.  The blood samples will be collected at C0\n      (before morning dose) and then 20, 40, 60(1hr), 80, 100, 120(2hr), 140, 160, 180(3hr)\n      minutes, 4, 5, 6, 8 and 12 hour after dosing with each formulation. Adherence will be\n      monitored by patient diary, pill counts, and MEMS cap.  Safety and efficacy parameters will\n      be monitored weekly.\n\n      This study will be carried out in full compliance with the rules of Good Clinical Practice\n      (GCP) including development of an electronic database and monitoring plan.\n\n      Resulting pharmacokinetic parameters will be analyzed by a variety of pharmacokinetic tests\n      such as narrower acceptance intervals, individual and scaled average bioequivalence was well\n      as population pharmacokinetics."
