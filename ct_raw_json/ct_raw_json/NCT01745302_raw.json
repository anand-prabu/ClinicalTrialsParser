            "textblock": "At present, the third generation of platinum-based regimens (NCCN clinical practice\n      guidelines recommended the use of vinorelbine or gemcitabine, or Taxol, etc.) is the\n      first-line treatment for advanced lung cancer patients. Its effective rate  is 20-30%, the\n      median survival time is 7-9 months, 1-year and 2-year survival rate is 31-36% and 10-13%\n      respectively. The efficacy has reached the platform and it is difficult to have more\n      breakthroughs. Epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) such\n      as Iressa and Erlotinib have proved effective in first or second line therapy for advanced\n      non-small cell lung cancer(NSCLC).First-SIGNAL and IPASS research have laid first-line\n      status for gefitinib in treatment of NSCLC and the progression-free survival time was\n      maintained at 9-10 months. EGFR-TKIs treatment is simple, well tolerated, drug side effects,\n      etc. There are also a rash, diarrhea and other adverse reactions, affecting the quality of\n      life of patients with serious or even give patients a great deal of pain.Literature and our\n      preliminary studies have shown that traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) can prolong survival\n      time and improve quality of life QOL, but high-level evidences are needed.\n\n      The investigators perform a randomized, double-blind controlled, prospective study in\n      Advanced Pulmonary Adenocarcinoma patients with stage \u2162a\uff5e\u2163. Patients are randomized over\n      observational group (TCM granules plus first-line targeted therapy and TCM granules plus\n      second-line targeted therapy ), and control group (TCM placebo plus first-line targeted\n      therapy and TCM placebo plus second-line targeted therapy). The investigators will observe 6\n      months and after that regular follow-up will be arranged. The primary efficacy assessments\n      are: PFS (progression-free survival\uff09; Secondary efficacy assessments are: (1) OS(overall\n      survival); (2) Objective response rate; (3) TTP\uff08Time-to-Progression\uff09; (4) QOL (Functional\n      Assessment of Cancertherapy-lung, FACT-L4.0 scales;Lung Cancer Symptom Scale,LCSS); (5)other\n      efficacy assessments are: 1) TCM symptoms changes; 2) Toxicity, side effects and security of\n      the treatments will be assessed at the same time. The investigators expect that integrated\n      TCM combined with targeted therapy has a better efficacy on prolonging progression-free\n      survival time, overall survival, improving QOL of patients than that of targeted therapy.\n      Therefore our study can provide evidences for optimizing and promoting integrated TCM\n      combined with Western Medicine treatment."
