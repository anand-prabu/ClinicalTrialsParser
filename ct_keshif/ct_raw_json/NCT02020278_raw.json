The duration of administration of tolvaptan will be per medical need as determined by the Principal Investigator.  Subjects may have short-term treatment (ie, a few days of treatment needed per episode of hyponatremia) or long-term treatment (ie, treatment for weeks to months with concomitant medication).  All subjects will be followed for 6 months regardless of the need for treatment. Subjects can be treated with tolvaptan during and/or after the initial 6-month follow-up period."
