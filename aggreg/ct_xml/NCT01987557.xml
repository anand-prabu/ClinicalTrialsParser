  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treadmill training has been shown to be beneficial for reducing motor symptoms of
      Parkinson's disease (PD).  The mechanisms for the therapeutic effects of treadmill training
      remain unknown. However, specific types of intrinsic feedback generated from muscle spindles
      (detect changes in length of muscle) and golgi tendon organs (detect muscle force) seem to
      be an important factor for achieving the reductions in motor scores.  This study will
      compare a treadmill program that generates a high rate of intrinsic feedback to a treadmill
      program focused on generating a high magnitude of intrinsic feedback.

    <measure>Motor section of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale  (UPDRS-III)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre assessments are conducted in the week prior to the treadmill program.  Post are conducted during the week immediately following the program. Changes after the 6 week treadmill program are being examined</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>A measure of the motor symptom severity within Parkinsons.  UPDRS III is a qualitative assessment performed by a trained clinician. Specifically, a change in UPDRS III from pre to post is the main outcome measure.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Spatiotemporal aspects of gait</measure>
    <time_frame>pre test occurs within the week prior to the start of the treadmill training program.  Post testing will occur during the week immediately following the 6 week treadmill training program.</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Participants will walk on a pressure sensitive GAITRite carpet (Sparta, NJ), at both comfortable and fast paced walking speeds.  Changes in gait characteristics from pre to post are what is being examined.
Quantitative measures of gait such as step time, step length, walking velocity, and others will be used in the analysis.
Spotters are always present to ensure safety during this assessment.</description>

    <measure>Static Posturography (balance/postural control)</measure>
    <time_frame>pre test occurs within the week prior to the start of the treadmill training program.  Post testing will occur during the week immediately following the 6 week treadmill training program.</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>A Balance SD system from BIODEX (Shirley, NY) will be used to assess postural control.  Changes from pre to post are what is being examined.</description>
