Without any stimulation, no signal is sent to the brain and there is no need\n      for the healthy parts of the brain to adapt this function. Stimulation of the sensibility\n      over a period of time on both sides of the body, gives the brain signals and the opportunity\n      to compare how the signals should be recognized. New connection will be able to interpret\n      signals correctly."

It is important for rehabilitation to take advantage of this compensatory\n      qualities whit early intervention and mobilization. Only small gains can lead to big\n      improvements.\n\n      About half of stroke survivors gets reduced sensibility caused bye the stroke, and\n      sensibility is considered to be an important part of rehabilitation of function and\n      activities.\n\n      A Norwegian guideline concludes that the scientific knowledge is to week to recommend this\n      kind of treatment. There is some evidence for improvement of sensibility when specific\n      training and stimulation is given.  Achievements in sensibility can lead to some improvement\n      in function.\n\n      The project will be carried out as a randomized controlled trial. In this project, the\n      intervention group receive tactile senses stimulated twice daily over a period of 3 months,\n      while the control group receives standard treatment. The results from both groups are\n      measured before and after treatment."
