To create the vaccine, a tumor lesion is selected and caused to die by\n      a process called \"Radiofrequency Ablation\" or RFA. RFA causes the tumor to release its\n      internal contents to the surrounding environment, such contents include tumor-specific\n      antigens. Immune cells respond to the tissue damage and take-up these tumor antigens. The\n      injection of the experimental cell drug, AlloStim(TM) into the lesion is designed to cause\n      the responding cells to signal the immune system of the danger of the tumor, creating\n      tumor-specific immunity."

This is designed\n      to increase the circulating titer of allo-specific Th1 memory cells; the vaccination step\n      involves percutaneous radiofrequency ablation of a single liver lesion followed immediately\n      with an intratumoral injection of AlloStim(TM) into the ablated lesion, followed 3 days\n      later by an additional intratumoral injection into the previously ablated lesion with\n      AlloStim(TM). This step is designed to elicit tumor-specific Th1 immunity. The activation\n      step involves intravenous infusions of AlloStim(TM). This step is designed to cause the\n      activation and extravasation of circulating memory cells and the activation of innate immune\n      cells.  The booster step includes two monthly IV infusions of AlloStim(TM). This step is\n      designed to maintain an inflammatory cytokine storm designed to counteract immune suppressor\n      mechanisms and tumor immunoavoidance mechanisms."
