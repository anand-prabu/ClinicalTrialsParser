However, each of these tools has its advantages\n      and disadvantages but none of them provides a measure of all components dimensions that\n      characterize the associated PA and EE. The current scientific prospects for measurement of\n      PA tend to associate several measuring devices. To date, these perspectives are facilitated\n      by technological developments and miniaturization of various devices. Thus, the purpose of\n      the study is to evaluate wether GPS associated with accelerometer are able to assess the\n      humain locomotion and energy expenditure during exercises."
