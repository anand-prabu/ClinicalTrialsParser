Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to\n      stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining chemotherapy with\n      biological therapy may kill more tumor cells. It is not yet known if BCG is more effective\n      with or without mitomycin.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to compare the effectiveness of BCG plus mitomycin with\n      that of BCG alone in treating patients who have bladder cancer."

Patients are randomized to one\n      of two treatment arms.\n\n      Arm I:\n\n        -  Induction therapy: Patients receive intravesical mitomycin over 1 hour once weekly on\n           weeks 1-6 and intravesical BCG once weekly on weeks 7-12. Patients with visible lesions\n           or disease recurrence or progression undergo transurethral resection (TUR) during weeks\n           16-18 and receive one additional course of intravesical therapy.\n\n        -  Maintenance therapy:Patients with a complete response after either course of induction\n           therapy proceed to maintenance therapy comprising intravesical mitomycin once on week 1\n           and intravesical BCG once weekly on weeks 2 and 3. Maintenance therapy repeats every 6\n           months through year 3.\n\n      Arm II:\n\n        -  Induction therapy:Patients receive intravesical BCG once weekly on weeks 1-6 and 10-12.\n           Patients with visible lesions or disease recurrence or progression undergo\n           transurethral resection (TUR) during weeks 16-18 and receive one additional course of\n           intravesical therapy.\n\n        -  Maintenance therapy: Patients with a complete response after either course of induction\n           therapy receive maintenance therapy comprising intravesical BCG once weekly on weeks\n           1-3. Maintenance therapy repeats every 6 months through year 3.\n\n      Patients are followed every 6 months for 5 years and then annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 84-126 patients (42-63 per treatment arm) will be accrued for\n      this study within 3.5 years."
