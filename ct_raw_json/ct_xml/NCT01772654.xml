  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ASL sequences have been shown to localize certain epileptogenic abnormalities such as tubers
      in tuberous sclerosis.  A previous study demonstrated ASL changes inter- and post-ictally in
      one patient without other MRI changes.  This is a promising technique that has not been
      fully evaluated as of yet.  Of note, all studies done in this area in regards to epilepsy
      have been retrospective, small studies.  The investigators plan to perform a study that is
      prospective, with a comparatively large sample of patients.

      The study hypothesis is that in patients with refractory epilepsy, Arterial Spin Labeling
      (ASL) MRI will show areas of abnormality in the brain to the same degree as SPECT and PET
      studies.

    <textblock>
      Currently, in presurgical evaluation of epilepsy patients, PET and SPECT studies are
      utilized to evaluate metabolic and perfusion abnormalities respectively to localize seizure
      onset.  This is especially true in &quot;MRI negative&quot; patients, whose lesion is not visible on
      standard MRI techniques.  PET and SPECT studies have numerous disadvantages, including
      radiation exposure, injection of contrast or isotopes, cost, and are often difficult to
      access for many patients.

      Arterial spin labeling (ASL) MRI sequences show perfusion related abnormalities without
      using contrast, in a relatively short amount of time, and can be done during a normal MRI
      for evaluation of epilepsy. This is of interest because if there is a good correlation, ASL
      MRI sequences could be used in addition, or in place of, these other studies that require
      injection of isotopes and radiation from CT scans.

    <description>The arterial spin labeled MRI sequence is an MRI technique in which arterial blood undergoes spatially selective inversion to label the arterial blood.
This is a magnetic technique and does not require contrast.  The tagged blood is imaged and areas of hypoperfusion or hyperperfusion are revealed on the MRI sequence.</description>
