In patients\n      receiving conventional dialysis regimens, serum P may be lowered through dietary\n      intervention and use of P binders, though these have potentially important side effects and\n      may adversely impact quality of life. Whether lowering P, and / or targeting specific P\n      levels improve survival and clinical outcomes is unknown. Despite this uncertainty, over 90%\n      of patients with ESRD receive P lowering therapy and guidelines for the care of patients\n      with ESRD are increasingly calling for more aggressive phosphate lowering. This intensive P\n      lowering results in extra medications (and their associated side-effects), and higher health\n      care costs. We are uncertain whether the intensification of P control results in measurable\n      benefits to patients with ESRD. The overall goal of this pilot trial is to evaluate the\n      feasibility of conducting a randomized controlled trial of intensive vs liberalized\n      phosphate control among hemodialysis recipients."
