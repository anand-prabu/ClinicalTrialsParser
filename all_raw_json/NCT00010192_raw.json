Patients then receive low-dose\n      aldesleukin subcutaneously (SC) on days 29-39, 43-53, 57-67, and 71-81, and\n      intermediate-dose aldesleukin SC on days 40-42, 54-56, 68-70, and 82-84. Cohorts of 3-6\n      patients receive escalating doses of intermediate-dose pulse aldesleukin until the maximum\n      tolerated dose (MTD) is reached. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at\n      least 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year."
