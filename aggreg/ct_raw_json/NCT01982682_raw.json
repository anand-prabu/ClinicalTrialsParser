Giving total-body irradiation, donor lymphocyte infusion, and\n      chemotherapy before a donor stem cell transplant helps stop the growth of cancer and\n      abnormal cells and helps stop the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem\n      cells. When certain stem cells from a donor are infused into the patient they may help the\n      patient's bone marrow make stem cells, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.\n      Sometimes the transplanted cells from a donor can make an immune response against the body's\n      normal cells. Removing the T cells from the donor cells before transplant and giving\n      tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil may stop this from happening."

High risk is\n             defined as:\n\n               -  Any patient with a hematologic malignancy with residual disease after treatment\n                  with 1 or more chemotherapy regimens in whom achievement of remission with\n                  additional chemoradiotherapy is felt to be unlikely\n\n               -  Patients without morphologic evidence of disease but with high risk features\n                  which would predict for relapse despite remission at HSCT such as adverse\n                  cytogenetics, 3rd or greater CR, or failure to recover peripheral blood counts\n                  to normal ranges. While these patients do not have detectable disease by current\n                  methods, like all patients they have non-detectable disease which in their case\n                  is highly aggressive.\n\n          2. Patients must have one related donor who is HLA mismatched in the GVHD direction at\n             two or more HLA loci\n\n          3. Patients must adequate organ function:\n\n               -  LVEF of >50 %\n\n               -  DLCO (adjusted for hemoglobin) >50 % of predicted and FEV-1 >50 %\n\n               -  Adequate liver function as defined by a serum bilirubin <1.8, AST or ALT < 2.5X\n                  upper limit of normal\n\n               -  Creatinine clearance of > 60 ml/min\n\n          4. Karnofsky Performance Status of > 80% on the modified KPS tool\n\n          5. Patients must be willing to use contraception if they have childbearing potential\n\n          6. Able to give informed consent\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          1. Modified KPS of <80%\n\n          2. > 5 Comorbidity Points on the HCT-CI Index (See Appendix B)\n\n          3.

Pregnancy, or unwillingness to use contraception if they have child bearing potential\n\n          8. Patients with life expectancy of < 6 months for reasons other than their underlying\n             hematologic/oncologic disorder\n\n          9.
