  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a phone call from a nurse within 1-3 days
      after discharge from the Emergency Department (ED) decreases return visits to the ED/
      hospital admissions/ death (combined outcome) in patients age 65 and above. As secondary
      outcomes, time to follow up appointment with physician and economic impact of this
      intervention will be assessed.

      Patients 65 years of age and older will be randomized following discharge from the ED into
      one of three groups. Group 1(Intervention) will receive a phone call collecting information
      about understanding of ED discharge instructions and guiding patient through the discharge
      instructions, Group 2 (Placebo) will receive a follow up phone call for a satisfaction
      survey, and Group 3(Control) will receive usual care.

      We hypothesize return visits to the ED and readmission to the hospital will decrease as a
      result of the nurse phone call intervention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Procedures: All patients age 65 and above will be randomized to one of three groups within
      1-3 days after discharge from the UNC ED: 1) Interventional follow-up phone call; 2) Placebo
      phone call, implementing only a satisfaction survey; or 3) control group receiving no phone
      call.

      The intervention phone call will ask whether patients have obtained the newly prescribed
      medicines, ask if the patient understands the instructions for taking the medicines and
      inquire if a patient has made an appointment with his/her personal physician. The caller
      will attempt to answer questions about the medicines, and encourage patients to take the
      medicines as directed. The caller will also encourage the patients to follow-up with their
      own physician in a timely manner and offer to help with setting up follow up appointments if
      needed.

      Subsequently, 30-35 days after ED discharge, all patients will receive a phone call to
      evaluate rates of compliance with medicines and scheduling follow-up appointments. All calls
      will be made by trained nurses.

      Using an α 0.05 and β 0.80 we will need to enroll 2235 patients to detect a decrease in ED
      return visits/re-admission/ death of 6%.  There will be one interim analysis 1 year into the
      two year planned study.
