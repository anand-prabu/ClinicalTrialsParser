  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent reports have identified a specific oncogenic mutation L265P of the MYD88 gene in
      approximately 90% of the patients with Waldenström's macroglobulinemia.  MYD88 is a key
      linker protein in the signaling pathway of Toll Like Receptors (TLRs) 7, 8, and 9, and
      IMO-8400 is an oligonucleotide specifically designed to inhibit TLRs 7,8, and 9.  The
      scientific hypothesis for use of IMO-8400 to treat patients with Waldenström's
      macroglobulinemia depends on the inhibition of mutant MYD88 signaling in the TLR pathway,
      thereby interrupting the proliferation of cell populations responsible for the propagation
      of the disease.

      Eligible subjects will be enrolled and assigned to one of three dose cohorts. Treatment will
      be administered once weekly by subcutaneous injection. Subjects will receive treatment for
      24 weeks and then be followed for an additional 5 weeks.
