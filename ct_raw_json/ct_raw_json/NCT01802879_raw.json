Patients from multiple parent\n      studies will be transferred over to this protocol and will be continuing to receive single\n      agent panobinostat at the last assigned dose and regimen of the parent protocol. There will\n      be no screening period, and patients will have to visit the study center at least on a\n      quarterly basis. During these visits limited information on study treatment and occurrence\n      of SAEs will be collected for the clinical database. SAEs will be only reported to the\n      Novartis safety database.Other assessments and possibly more frequent visits will occur as\n      per standard of care at the site. Patients will continue treatment until they are no longer\n      benefiting from panobinostat treatment develop unacceptable toxicities, withdraw consent,\n      are non-compliant to the protocol, the investigator feels it is no longer in the best\n      interest to continue, the patient dies, or for other administrative reasons. An end of\n      treatment visit and a safety follow-up for 30 days after the last dose will be performed.\n      The study is expected to remain open for 5 years or until such time that enrolled patients\n      no longer need treatment with panobinostat, whichever comes earlier."
