If patients\n      have not remitted at the end of the 6 week aripiprazole trial, the aripiprazole will be\n      stopped and they will be started on bupropion for the remaining 6 weeks of the study. Both\n      aripiprazole augmentation and bupropion augmentation in depressed older adults have been\n      approved by the FDA. No study has compared the effectiveness of PST and medication\n      augmentation strategies for depressed older adults who are non-responders to an adequate\n      trial of antidepressant medication in the current episode of their depression."
