Standardization of study\n      endpoints. Inclusion of toxicity scoring and management for amylase and triglyceride\n      elevations. Clarification of concomitant medication use. Original design: To determine the\n      effectiveness of didanosine (ddI) in patients with AIDS or advanced AIDS related complex\n      (ARC) who have documented hematologic intolerance to zidovudine (AZT) therapy. To determine\n      if the efficacy of ddI increases with increasing doses.\n\n      AZT is effective in reducing mortality in patients with AIDS who receive the drug after the\n      first episode of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) and in patients with advanced ARC.\n      However, AZT therapy has been associated with significant toxicities. In addition, the\n      effectiveness of AZT appears to decrease during the second and third years of therapy. For\n      these reasons, the development of alternative therapy that would be at least as effective\n      but less toxic is of great importance. The drug ddI is an antiviral agent that inhibits\n      replication (reproduction) of HIV with less apparent toxicity than AZT. The major\n      dose-limiting toxicities found in the Phase I studies have been pains in the feet and legs\n      of 2 patients initially receiving 12 mg/kg/day and 12 patients receiving daily doses of 25.8\n      to 51.2 mg/kg; symptoms began 8 to 27 weeks after initiating ddI treatment. These\n      neuropathy-like symptoms have generally not been associated with significant abnormalities\n      in nerve conduction studies and patients have reported marked improvement in symptoms within\n      1 to 2 weeks of discontinuing ddI. Some patients have resumed ddI treatment at a reduced\n      dose after resolution of their symptoms. Studies indicate that ddI remains active in the\n      body for at least 12 hours. This indicates that benefits of ddI might be achieved with a low\n      frequency of drug administration."
