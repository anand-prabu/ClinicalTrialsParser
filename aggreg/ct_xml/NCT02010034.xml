    <textblock>
      This study is being done to determine if an investigational study drug called Omegaven can
      help to improve liver disease thought to be caused by Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN). TPN
      is intravenous feeding (IV feeding tube) that provides patients the nutrients when they are
      unable to drink fluid or eat food by mouth.

    <description>PN associated liver disease can be reversed or its progression halted by using a parenteral fat emulsion prepared from fish oil as measured by normalization of serum levels of hepatic enzymes and bilirubin
1. after reaching bilirubin levels &gt;2mg/dl, subjects receiving Omegaven will reach a bilirubin level &lt; 2mg/dL faster that patients receiving conventional fat emulsions.</description>

    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>Yes</safety_issue>
    <description>a. After starting Omegaven on PN, the rate of fatty acid deficiencies and imbalances will be as low as before Omegaven.  Also, the rate of triglyceride events &gt;400mg/dL with Omegaven will be similar to that seen with PN administration with soy oil Intralipid.
B. PN containing Omegaven will be safe for patients with respect to the risk of unexpected bleeding, coagulopathies, and other adverse events.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients must be 2 months -10 years of age

          2. Patients who are PN dependent (unable to meet nutritional needs solely by enteral
             nutrition) and are expected to require PN for at least another 30 days

          3. Patients considered eligible for study participation must have parenteral nutrition
             associated liver disease (PNALD) as defined by a direct bilirubin of &gt;2.0mg/dL. Other
             causes of liver disease should be excluded. A liver biopsy is not necessary for
             treatment

          4. 2 consecutive direct bilirubin test results &gt;2.0mg/dl

          5. The patient must have failed standard therapies to prevent the progression of liver
             disease such as surgical treatment, cyclic TPN, avoiding overfeeding,
             reduction/removal of copper and manganese from TPN, advancement of enteral feeding,
             and use of ursodiol (Actigall)

          6. Subjects who are currently under treatment for PNALD with Compassionate Use Omegaven
             and have a direct Bilirubin of&lt; 2, but who remain TPN dependent and require continued
             therapy with Omegaven

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Other known causes of chronic liver disease (hepatitis C, cystic fibrosis, biliary
             atresia and alpha 1 anti-trypsin deficiency)

          2. Enrollment in any other clinical trial involving an investigational agent (unless
             approved by the designated physicians on the multidisciplinary team)

          3. The parent, guardian, or child is unwilling to provide consent or assent

          4. Allergy to any fish product, egg protein, and/or previous allergy to Omegaven

          5. Active coagulopathies characterized by on-going bleeding or by a requirement for
             clotting factor replacement such as fresh frozen plasma or cryoprecipitate to
             maintain homeostasis

          6. Impaired lipid metabolism or severe hyperlipidemia with or without pancreatitis

          7. Unstable diabetes mellitus

          8. Stroke/embolism

          9. Collapse and shock

         10. Undefined coma status

         11. Active infection at time of initiation of OmegavenÂ® up until such time as child is
             afebrile with stable vital signs and one negative 48 hour culture
