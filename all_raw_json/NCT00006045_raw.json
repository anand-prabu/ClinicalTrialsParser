Monoclonal antibodies can locate tumor cells and either kill\n      them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. It is not yet\n      known if chemotherapy is more effective with or without monoclonal antibody therapy for\n      acute myelogenous leukemia.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy\n      with or without monoclonal antibody therapy in treating patients who have refractory or\n      relapsed acute myelogenous leukemia."

Compare the efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity of\n      mitoxantrone, etoposide, and cytarabine (MEC) with or without monoclonal antibody HuG1-M195\n      in patients with refractory or relapsed acute myelogenous leukemia.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified by age (under 50\n      vs 50 and over) and duration of previous complete remission (CR) (0-6 vs 7-12 months). All\n      patients receive induction chemotherapy comprised of cytarabine IV over 2 hours,\n      mitoxantrone IV over a maximum of 20 minutes, and etoposide IV over 1-2 hours on days 1-6.\n      On day 5 of induction, patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms: Arm I: Patients\n      receive day 6 of induction chemotherapy. Patients then receive monoclonal antibody HuG1-M195\n      (MOAB HuM195) IV over 4 hours on days 6-9 or 7-10. Treatment with MOAB HuM195 repeats every\n      2 weeks for 2 courses (courses 1 and 2) in the absence of disease progression or\n      unacceptable toxicity. During course 1, MOAB HuM195 begins 30 minutes to 24 hours\n      postchemotherapy. Patients who do not achieve CR by day 70 of induction and show evidence of\n      bone marrow progression (regimen failure (RF)) are taken off study. Patients without RF are\n      assigned to one of two consolidation groups based on response: Group A (CR): Patients\n      receive consolidation chemotherapy comprised of mitoxantrone IV over a maximum of 20 minutes\n      on days 1 and 2, and cytarabine IV over 2 hours and etoposide IV over 1-2 hours on days 1-4.\n      Patients with New York Heart Association class II heart disease preconsolidation receive no\n      mitoxantrone during consolidation. Patients receive MOAB HuM195 IV over 4 hours on days 4-7\n      or 5-8. Treatment with MOAB HuM195 repeats every 2 weeks for 2 additional courses (courses 3\n      and 4). During course 3, MOAB HuM195 begins 30 minutes to 24 hours postchemotherapy. Group B\n      (partial remission (PR), hematologic improvement (HI), or stable disease (SD)): Patients\n      receive MOAB HuM195 as in group A but no consolidation chemotherapy. Patients without RF\n      after treatment on group A or B receive maintenance MOAB HuM195 IV over 4 hours on days 1-4.\n      Treatment repeats every month for 8 additional courses (courses 5-12). Arm II: Patients\n      receive day 6 of induction chemotherapy. Patients receive no MOAB HuM195 during the entire\n      study. Patients without RF at day 70 of induction are assigned to one of two consolidation\n      groups based on response: Group C (CR): Patients receive consolidation chemotherapy as in\n      group A. Group D (PR, HI, or SD): Patients receive no further treatment. Patients may be\n      eligible to receive MOAB HuM195 on PDL Study 195-302. Patients are followed every 3 months\n      for 1 year, and then every 6 months thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 200 patients (100 per arm) will be accrued for this study."
