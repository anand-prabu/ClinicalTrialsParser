U.S. colleges/universities, enrolling >14 million students/year (40% of those aged\n      18 to 24), are an important venue to reach young adult smokers. While daily tobacco use in\n      the U.S. has declined to 18.1%, nondaily smoking (smoking on some days but not every day) is\n      increasing, particularly among young adults and African Americans. Moreover, young smokers\n      and nondaily smokers (half of young adult smokers), respectively, are less likely to seek\n      help in quitting; thus, innovative strategies are needed to assist cessation early in life,\n      particularly among those who may not be motivated to quit or seek help. Unfortunately, no\n      research has focused on developing a cessation intervention that addresses a broad range of\n      smoking patterns (nondaily to daily smoking) or diverse campus settings among ethnically\n      diverse student populations. Web-based interventions offer promise in helping college\n      students to quit, given high rates of Internet use and web capacity to provide tailored\n      cessation messages. A novel approach to delivering cessation information via the web might\n      be to address broader lifestyle issues and apply market research strategies to identify\n      market segments of smokers (groups of people with similar interests, goals, values) in order\n      to target and engage these groups more effectively. Applying this strategy to an online\n      cessation intervention should enhance both intervention use and processing of intervention\n      messages, leading to greater abstinence rates. The investigators aim to: (1) develop and\n      refine a tailored web-based intervention for smoking cessation targeting college students\n      with a range of smoking levels; (2) test the usability, acceptability, and feasibility of\n      the intervention among college student smokers; and (3) determine the potential effect of\n      the intervention on smoking cessation, smoking level, quit attempts, and contextual factors."

Phase 1 will involve the development\n      of the web-site infrastructure, securing incentives, developing website content (dramas,\n      stories), and developing the tailored feedback infrastructure. Phase 2 will involve expert\n      feedback, which will be integrated into the next program version. Phase 3 involves a 6-week\n      trial among a small sample of young adults at two college campuses (university;\n      community/technical college) in Georgia (N = 200). At end-of-intervention, we will assess\n      usability, acceptability, and feasibility of the program; smoking status and level; and\n      psychosocial factors related to smoking (e.g. alcohol use, mood). Assessments of smoking\n      status/level and psychosocial factors will also be conducted at 6 weeks post-intervention.\n      The primary outcomes in the trial are usability, acceptability, and feasibility\n      (self-reported and observed website utilization [check-in, activity]). Secondary outcomes\n      include: (1) message processing (self-reported attention to messages, perceived relevance,\n      and other message use items);19 (2) 7-day and 30-day point prevalence abstinence at\n      end-of-treatment (6 weeks) and at 6-week follow-up (12 weeks) in order to appropriately\n      examine cessation among daily and nondaily smokers; (3) smoking level at 6 and 12 weeks; (4)\n      number of quit attempts since baseline; and (5) change in other contextual factors (mood,\n      alcohol use, social aspects)."
