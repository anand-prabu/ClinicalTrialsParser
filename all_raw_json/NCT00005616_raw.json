Determine any toxicity associated with increasing single doses of monoclonal\n      antibody F19 (BIBH-1) administered by intravenous infusion in patients with colorectal\n      cancer scheduled for surgical resection. II. Compare the pharmacokinetics, biodistribution,\n      and imaging characteristics of increasing intravenous doses of iodine I 131 BIBH-1 in this\n      patient population. III. Compare the BIBH-1 related human antihuman antibody (HAHA) serum\n      concentration with immunologic related clinical effects in these patients. IV. Compare the\n      uptake of iodine I 131 BIBH-1 in tumor to the uptake of normal tissue when administered to\n      these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive monoclonal antibody F19 (BIBH-1)\n      combined with iodine I 131 IV over 60 minutes. Patients undergo surgical resection\n      approximately 7 days after BIBH-1 infusion. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses\n      of BIBH-1 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the\n      dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicities. Patients\n      are followed once during days 5-14 and then at day 30 after surgery.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12 patients will be accrued for this study within 4 months."
