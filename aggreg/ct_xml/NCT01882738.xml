  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      All consecutive pregnant patients in 2nd or 3rd trimester will be asked to participate.
      Cervical length will be assessed in all patients, once abdominally and then vaginally (that
      would serve as golden standard). Correlation would be assessed between accuracy of
      measurement to BMI

      This study will include pregnant women in either 2nd or 3rd trimester of pregnancy. All
      consecutive pregnant patients in 2nd or 3rd trimester who will attend our unit for routine
      ultrasound exam will be asked to participate. Cervical length will be assessed in all
      patients, once abdominally and then vaginally (that would serve as golden standard).
      Correlation would be assessed between accuracy of measurement to BMI. Accuracy would be
      defind as the delta of cervical length between abdominal and vaginal routs.

      BMI would be calculated prior to the ultrasound exam (by weighing and measuring all
      patients).

    <description>the golden standard for cervical length measurement is vaginal scan. Our outcome measure will be the accuracy of cervical length measurement - measured abdominally, according to BMI. I other words - was there a difference between measurement by vaginal probe and abdominal probe and whether this difference correlates with BMI</description>
