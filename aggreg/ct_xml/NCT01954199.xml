  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low back-related leg pain (LBRLP), although less prevalent than low back pain itself, is
      associated with higher economic and social burden, and consists in a predictor of chronicity
      and disability among subjects with low back pain. Numerous approaches are proposed for its
      management; however, evidence regarding the best therapeutic approach is lacking.

      Neurodynamic techniques are proposed to be effective to manage nerve trunk pain. In light of
      this, many techniques are described for the management of the dysfunctions of the sciatic
      nerve.

      Thus, this study aims to verify, through a randomized sham-controlled trial, the
      effectiveness of a single application of neurodynamic techniques on pain and disability in
      individuals with LBRLP.

    <description>With subjects lying in prone, an inclinometer will be positioned in the symptomatic (and therefore the treated) leg immediately after the intervention. Then, they will be instructed to raise their leg straightly. The mean range of motion (ROM) of 3 measures will be recorded.</description>

    <description>One week after the intervention, individuals will be asked to complete the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), which is a self-reported questionnaire that addresses functional restrictions in subjects with low back pain. This questionnaire is widely used, with good psychometric properties and excellent responsiveness and is also used in individuals with back-related leg pain.</description>
