Ninety percent of adults will\n      experience low back pain in their lifetime, 50% will experience recurrent LBP, and 10% will\n      develop chronic pain and related disability.\n\n      While there is growing evidence for the clinical effectiveness of alternative and\n      complementary therapies to treat low back pain, little is known on the physiologic\n      consequences and effects of these treatments. Further, additional data is needed to\n      understand how these different treatment techniques effect clinical changes in pain and\n      disability. The lack of empirical data hinders acceptance by the wider scientific and\n      health-care communities, and it also limits the development of rational strategies for using\n      alternative and complementary therapies."
