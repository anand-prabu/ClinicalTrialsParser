            "textblock": "Background: The acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) remains common (15% of ventilated\n      patients in the ICU), severe (30% of mortality) and have no specific treatment. Impaired\n      epithelial repair with fibroproliferation is observed in non resolutive form of ARDS.\n      Fibrocytes are cells that both express markers of hematopoietic cells (CD34+, CD45+) and\n      fibroblasts (collagen-1). Fibrocytes may be recruited directly from the pool of circulating\n      blood monocytes but also derive from monocytes in situ in absence of serum amyloid P (SAP or\n      pentraxin-2). In murine models of lung injury, it has been shown that fibrocytes were\n      recruited in the lung and contribute to the local fibrogenesis. Our team is the first to\n      have demonstrated during ARDS in human the presence of fibrocytes among the alveolar cells\n      obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) (Quesnel et al, Eur Resp J, 2010). In a second\n      single-center work enrolling 122 patients, we have shown that a percentage of alveolar\n      fibrocytes > 6% was associated with an increased risk of death (HR = 6.2 [2.8 to 13.6], p\n      <0.0001). However, this result remains to be confirmed in a second cohort because it was not\n      the main objective of the first study and because of the variable lead time of BAL sampling\n      in this cohort of patients with ARDS (Quesnel et al, CCM, 2012). Furthermore, the\n      correlation of the percentage of blood fibrocytes (Fsg%) with the percentage of alveolar\n      fibrocytes (Fal%) remains unknown and their kinetics remain to be studied during ARDS\n      evolution.\n\n      Hypothesis and Objective: We hypothesize that percentage of alveolar fibrocytes is a\n      prognostic marker during ARDS. Our main goal is to confirm in a validation cohort that the %\n      of alveolar fibrocytes measured in BAL fluid during the first 48 hours of ARDS evolution is\n      associated with 28-day mortality."
