          4. Signed informed consent

        Exclusion criteria:

          1. Any finding of the medical examination (including blood pressure, pulse rate and
             electrocardiogram) deviating from normal and of clinical relevance.

          2. Any evidence of a clinically relevant concomitant disease according to investigator's
             clinical judgement.

          3. Gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, respiratory, cardiovascular, metabolic,
             immunological or hormonal disorders.

          4. History of jaundice

          5. Surgery of the gastrointestinal tract (except appendectomy).

          6. Diseases of the central nervous system (such as epilepsy) or psychiatric disorders or
             neurological disorders.

          7. History of relevant orthostatic hypotension, fainting spells or blackouts.

          8. Chronic or relevant acute infections.

          9. History of relevant allergy/hypersensitivity (including allergy to drug or its
             excipients) according to investigator's clinical judgement.

         10. Intake of drugs with a long half-life (&gt;24 hours) within at least one month or less
             than 10 half-lives of the respective drug prior to administration or during the trial

         11. Use of drugs which might reasonably influence the results (pharmacokinetic) of the
             trial within at least 10 days prior to administration or during the trial.

         12. Participation in another trial with an investigational drug within two months prior
             to administration or during the trial.

         13. Smoking (&gt;10 cigarettes or &gt;3 cigars or &gt;3 pipes/day).

         14. Inability to refrain from smoking during the trial.

         15. Alcohol abuse (more than 60 g/day: e.g., 3 middle-sized bottles of beer, 3 gous
             [equivalent to 540 mL] of sake).

         16. Drug abuse.

         17. Blood donation (more than 100 mL within four weeks prior to administration).

         18. Excessive physical activities (within one week prior to administration).

         19. Any laboratory value outside the reference range that is of clinical relevance
             according to investigator's clinical judgement.

         20. Any history of relevant liver diseases (for instance, disturbances of liver function,
             Dubin-Johnson syndrome, Rotor syndrome, or previous liver tumours).
