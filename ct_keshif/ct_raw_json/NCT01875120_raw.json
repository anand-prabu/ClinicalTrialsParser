Physiological and psychological variables are assessed in female patients\n      with an increased risk for PONV prior to a planned surgical intervention with a 33-item\n      questionnaire composed of the ASI-3 and the PHQ-15. Postoperative evaluation includes the\n      occurrence of nausea and vomiting in the first 24 hours after surgery. It is hypothesized\n      that patients with high sum scores for somatic symptom load (measured with the Patient\n      Health Questionnaire, PHQ-15) and with increased levels for anxiety sensitivity (measured\n      with the Anxiety Sensitivity Index, ASI-3) experience more frequently postoperative nausea\n      and vomiting (PONV) than patients with low scores in both self-rating instruments."
