This study is conducted to evaluate subject's preference of several\n      inhaler-specific attributes individually between an existing MDI and the ELLIPTA a dry\n      powder inhaler. Subjects who have not used the ELLIPTA inhaler in the past 6 months and\n      their asthma must be controlled on their current therapy were enrolled. Subjects meeting the\n      eligibility criteria will be stratified according to their current inhaler use (stable for\n      the past 3 months): 1.) Currently using a DPI as an inhaled asthma controller therapy OR 2.)\n      Currently using an MDI as an inhaled asthma controller therapy (No fluticasone MDI use in\n      the last 3 months) OR 3.) Currently using no inhaled asthma controller therapy (this\n      includes patients using a LTM and/or SABA only). Once stratified, eligible subjects were\n      randomized (1:1) to one of two sequences for using the inhaler: ELLIPTA inhaler once daily\n      in Period 1 followed by MDI twice daily in Period 2 or MDI twice daily in Period 1 followed\n      by ELLIPTA inhaler once daily in Period 2 for for 5-9 days each. In addition, subjects will\n      be randomly assigned (1:1 allocation) to receive one of two sets of questions: Version 1\n      presents response options in the order of ELLIPTA inhaler, MDI, No preference; Version 2\n      presents response options in the order of MDI, ELLIPTA inhaler, No preference. At the end of\n      the second trial period, subjects answered questions which assessed their preference of\n      inhaler attributes.
