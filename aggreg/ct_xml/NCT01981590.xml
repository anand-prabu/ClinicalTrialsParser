    <description>To evaluate the feasibility of transvenous electrical stimulation of the phrenic nerves to elicit inspiration.
In more detail •Characterize inspiratory response to changes on stimulation parameters (electrode configuration, amplitude, frequency, and pulse width).
•Characterize other potential physiologic changes or side effects associated with transvenous nerve stimulation.</description>
