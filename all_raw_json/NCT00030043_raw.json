            "textblock": "Neurofibromatosis Type 2 (NF2) is characterized by multiple tumors of the cranial and spinal\n      nerves, and, in particular, by bilateral acoustic tumors. Surgical resection of these tumors\n      generally results in the transection of the VIIIth nerve, destruction of the cochlea and\n      auditory nerve, and total hearing loss. Due to the loss of the auditory nerve, these\n      patients are not candidates for cochlear implantation. The Auditory Brainstem Implant (ABI)\n      provides the only available intervention to restore some auditory sensation to these\n      patients. An ABI is an implantable prosthesis that produces sound sensation by electrical\n      stimulation of the ascending auditory pathway at the level of the cochlear nucleus.\n\n      The PABI may be placed surgically during tumor resection. Efficacy will be assessed using\n      psychophysical and standard speech reception measures."
