    <textblock>
      Patients will have their puncture closure randomly performed by one of these approved
      methods: Angio-Seal™ Closure device or Manual Compression.

      Patients will be enrolled in the study during 12 months, with a follow-up period of 2 weeks
      (± 1 week).

      The randomization will be stratified according to the type of procedure.
