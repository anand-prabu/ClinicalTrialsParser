Currently,\n      there are only a few treatments for influenza infection and none of these target\n      inflammation that can be caused by the virus.  This study will test whether the\n      anti-inflammatory effects of statins, a class of drugs most often used to treat high\n      cholesterol, will decrease the severity of illness in patients who are infected with\n      influenza by testing markers of inflammation in the blood and recording resolution of\n      influenza illness."
