  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to confirm whether the AngioDynamics BioFlo™ Peripherally
      Inserted Central Catheter (PICC) is associated with less formation of blood clots compared
      to another commercially available PICC.

      Purpose:

      To investigate whether the BioFlo™ PICC will be associated with a reduced incidence of
      catheter-related venous thrombosis (including both symptomatic and asymptomatic) compared to
      another commercially available PICC: the Bard® PowerPICC SOLO2®

      Design:

      This is a randomized, multi-center clinical study. The study is designed as a two-arm
      prospectively controlled trial. Participants will be randomly assigned to either the study
      or control catheter using a 1:1 schema.

      Enrollment:

      Four hundred sixteen (416) patients will be enrolled at four (4) to eight (8) study sites in
      order to obtain 354 evaluable patients.

      Study Objectives:

      The primary objective of this study is to investigate the incidence of catheter-related
      venous thrombosis in patients receiving either the 5 Fr BioFlo™ PICC catheter or the control
      catheter, i.e., the 5 Fr Dual-Lumen PowerPICC SOLO2® catheter.

      Secondary objectives of this study are to investigate:

        -  Incidence of other catheter-related complications, inclusive of catheter occlusion,
           catheter-related infection, technical failures, and premature catheter removals

        -  Incidence of catheter occlusion (independently from other catheter-related
           complications)

      Additionally, economic outcomes with respect to medical resource utilization requirements
      will be compared between the two catheter groups (at US sites only).

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Is indicated for a PICC based on institutional practices

          2. Is ≥ 18 years of age

          3. Is expected to require use of a PICC for a minimum of 10 days

          4. Has normal findings on initial ultrasonography (complete Ultrasound Checklist)

          5. Vein used for PICC placement must be a minimum of 5mm in diameter

          6. Is able to comprehend and have signed the Informed Consent Form (ICF) to participate
             in the study (or has the ICF signed by the patient's legal representative)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Anticipates or has presence of dialysis grafts or other ipsilateral intraluminal
             devices, including pacemakers (with the exception of peripheral IV catheters)

          2. Has current or anticipated hematologic derangements, including:

               -  thrombocytopenia

               -  history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia

               -  coagulopathy (International Normalized Ratio 2.5 or greater)

               -  Anatomical distortions from surgery, injury or trauma (e.g., orthopedic
                  conditions such as compound fractures requiring reconstructive procedures)

               -  Anatomical irregularities (structural, vascular, neurological) which may
                  compromise catheter insertion or catheter care procedures in the involved
                  extremity (e.g., reflex sympathetic dystrophy)

          6. Is pregnant or lactating

          7. Has been previously enrolled in this clinical study, or is participating in another
