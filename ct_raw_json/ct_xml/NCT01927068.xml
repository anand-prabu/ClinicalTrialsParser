      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Has clinically significant symptomatic leg ischemia, requiring treatment of the SFA
             and/or popliteal artery.

          2. Has a Rutherford Clinical Category of 2 - 4. Note: Rutherford Clinical Category 2-3
             subjects should be entered into the study if conservative treatment  has been
             unsuccessful.

          3. Is at least 18 years old.

          4. Has life expectancy &gt; 1 year.

          5. Is able and willing to provide written informed consent prior to study-specific
             procedures.

          6. Is willing and capable of complying with the required follow-up visits, testing
             schedule and medication regimen.

        Angiographic Inclusion Criteria

          1. Has evidence at the target lesion(s) of clinically and hemodynamically significant de
             novo stenosis or restenosis, or occlusion, in the SFA (1 cm distal to the ostium of
             the profunda) and/or popliteal artery, confirmed by angiography.

          2. Has target limb with at least one patent (&lt;50% stenosis) tibio-peroneal run-off
             vessel to the foot confirmed by baseline angiography or magnetic resonance
             angiography (MRA) or computed tomography angiography (CTA). Note: Treatment of
             outflow disease is NOT permitted.

          3. Has 1 or 2 target lesion(s) with a cumulative length of no more than 20 cm.

          4. Has target lesion(s) located &gt;2 cm from any stent if the target vessel was previously
             stented.

          5. Has a reference vessel diameter of 4 - 6 mm.

          6. Has a successful exchangeable guidewire crossing of the lesion(s).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Is pregnant, of childbearing potential not taking adequate contraceptive measures, or
             nursing.

          2. Has significant gastrointestinal bleeding or any coagulopathy that would
             contraindicate the use of anti-platelet therapy.

          3. Has known intolerance to study medications, paclitaxel or contrast agents that in the
             opinion of the investigator cannot be adequately pre-treated.

          4. Is currently participating in another investigational device or drug study that would
             interfere with study endpoints.

          5. Has history of hemorrhagic stroke within 3 months.

          6. Has surgical or endovascular procedure of the target limb within 14 days prior to the
             index procedure.

          7. Has any planned surgical intervention (requiring hospitalization) or endovascular
             procedure within 30 days after the index procedure.

          8. Has had a previous peripheral bypass affecting the target limb.

          9. Has unstable angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, liver failure, renal failure or
             chronic kidney disease within 30 days of the index procedure.

        Angiographic Exclusion Criteria

          1. Has significant stenosis (≥ 50%) or occlusion of inflow tract that is not
             successfully revascularized (&lt; 30% residual stenosis without death or major vascular
             complication) prior to treatment of the target lesion(s).  Treatment of target
             lesion(s) is acceptable after successful treatment of inflow artery lesion(s).

          2. Has an acute or sub-acute intraluminal thrombus within the target vessel.

          3. Has in-stent restenosis or restenosis of the target lesion following previous
             treatment with a drug-coated balloon.

          4. Has an aneurysmal target vessel.

          5. Has perforation, dissection or other injury of the access or target vessel requiring
             stenting or surgical intervention prior to enrollment.

          6. Has no normal arterial segment proximal to the target lesion in which duplex
             ultrasound velocity ratios can be measured.

          7. Requires use of adjunctive therapies (i.e., laser, atherectomy, cryoplasty,
             scoring/cutting balloons, brachytherapy).

          8. Has severe calcification that precludes adequate PTA treatment.
