  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well ibrutinib works in treating patients with relapsed or
      refractory follicular lymphoma. Ibrutinib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking
      some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the overall response rate of ibrutinib in patients with relapsed or refractory
      follicular lymphoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the safety and tolerability of ibrutinib in patients with follicular lymphoma.

      II. Evaluate overall survival, time to response, duration of response, progression-free
      survival, time to treatment failure, and time to subsequent treatment.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Describe the relationship between interim positron emission tomography (PET)/computed
      tomography (CT) scan results, CT response, and response duration.

      II. Biomarker studies including exploring associations between ibrutinib response and
      somatic mutations identified in follicular lymphoma, whole transcriptome shotgun sequencing
      (ribonucleic acid-sequencing [RNA-seq]), exploration of inhibition of Bruton's tyrosine
      kinase (BTK) and other kinases, expression of cytokines, chemokines, and other proteins with
      an aim to develop predictors of response and resistance.

      III. Assess changes in various cancer-derived molecules in the blood over the course of
      treatment with ibrutinib.

      IV. As part of ongoing research for Phase II Consortium (P2C) studies, we are banking
      paraffin-embedded tissue blocks/slides and blood products for future studies.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive ibrutinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with
      progressive disease at the end of course 2 may continue on therapy until the end of course 5
      at the discretion of the treating physician.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months until
      progressive disease, and then every 6 months for 5 years.

             biopsy performed to obtain material; if biopsy is performed and does not yield
             adequate material, the patient is still eligible for the study; if a biopsy cannot be
             done safely, the patient may still be eligible for the study if permission is granted
             in writing (email) by the Study Chair (Dr. Nancy Bartlett) or her designees; Dr.
             Bartlett may be consulted to discuss situations involving invasive biopsy procedures

                       is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician
                       immediately; men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to
                       use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study
                       participation, and 4 months after completion of ibrutinib administration

                    -  NOTE: breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with
                       ibrutinib

          -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients on combination antiretroviral

          -  History of stroke or intracranial hemorrhage =&lt; 6 months prior to the first dose of
             study drug

          -  Requires anticoagulation with warfarin or similar vitamin K antagonist; NOTE:

             than 30% risk of relapse

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to ibrutinib
