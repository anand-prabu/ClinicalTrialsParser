It will be implemented among\n      smokers from Romania aged 20-60 years. The participants will beneficiate of tailored\n      information received in letters generated by using sophisticated computer algorithms,\n      allowing the creation of highly individualized messages that address each individual's\n      unique needs, motivations and beliefs related to smoking .\n\n      Program implementation will comprise of :\n\n        1. ''diagnosis'' by means of questionnaires at the individual level of characteristics\n           that are relevant for a person's smoking behavior\n\n        2. development of the ''message library'' that contains all education messages that may be\n           needed\n\n        3. development of an ''algorithm'', a set of decision rules that evaluates the diagnosis,\n           selects and generates messages tailored to the specific needs of the individual user\n\n        4. generating of personalized letters for each participant\n\n        5. sending of theses personalized letters to the participants. The participants will\n           receive three personalized letters during a period of six months after registration\n           into the program.\n\n      The effects of the program will be evaluated with a randomized controlled trial which will\n      assess the changes in smoking behaviour as well as smoking related attitudes, self-efficacy\n      and quiting attempts at 6 months after the enrolment into the program.\n\n      A process evaluation will assess participants' opinion about the program."
