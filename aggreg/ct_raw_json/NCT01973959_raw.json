This includes the\n      perioperative phase in the post-anaesthesia care unit (PACU) where problems with incomplete\n      information transfer may have a negative impact on patient safety and can lead to patient\n      harm. The objective of this study is to analyse information transfer during postoperative\n      handovers in the PACU.\n\n      With a self-developed checklist information transfer during postoperative handovers will be\n      documented and subsequently compared with patient information in anaesthesia records."
