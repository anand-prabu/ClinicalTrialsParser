  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ulcerative colitis represents a chronic condition occurring in relapsing and remitting
      fashion with uncertain outcome and requires lifelong treatment with considerable side
      effects. Diagnostic methods currently in use, clinical (endoscopy), imaging (CT, MR) or
      laboratory (C - reactive protein, calprotectin) give an insight into disease activity, but
      are possibly associated with significant discomfort for the patient and / or  increased risk
      of irradiation  and potential allergic reactions on contrast agents. For that reason there
      is a need for a noninvasive, biologically inert method for evaluation of disease activity in
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Thermography possesses most of these characteristics. The
      aim of this study is to find potential link between pathological thermographic signs and
      endoscopic findings, serum C reactive protein (CRP) and calprotectin in the stool of
      patients with active and extensive ulcerative colitis.

      Hypothesis: Documenting pathological thermographic signs in patients with extensive
      ulcerative colitis investigators will demonstrate pathological thermography criteria that
      correlate with standard inflammatory markers such as Mayo endoscopic subscore (ESS), CRP and
      calprotectin in patients with ulcerative colitis.

      Aims: The aim of this study is to record abdominal thermographic images of patients with
      active ulcerative colitis (UC), to create interpretational thermographic criteria for these
      images and to compare them to abdominal infrared (IR) images of healthy volunteers.
      Furthermore investigators intend to correlate these criteria with standard markers of
      inflammation such as CRP and calprotectin in patients with UC at the beginning of treatment
      and at the end.

      Materials and methods: For the purpose of this work, 30 patients with extensive UC and 30
      healthy individuals will be put throe thermographic imagining, have their stool tested for
      calprotectin and their blood for CRP. In addition, patients with UC will receive colonoscopy
      evaluations.

      Expected scientific contribution: The results of this paper would give additional
      contribution to existing tools for pursuing ulcerative colitis activity thus demonstrating
      the potential of thermography as a complementary method to standard methods in assessing
      disease activity. Establishing diagnostic criteria for this method would be a good addition
      to present clinical practice.
