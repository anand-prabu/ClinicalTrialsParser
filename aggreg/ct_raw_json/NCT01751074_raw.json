The primary aims of this study are to estimate the potential effects of repeat\n      doses of Darapladib on the PK of Rosuvastatin as well as evaluating safety and tolerability.\n      Two part approaches are planned for this study. Part A of the study will examine the effects\n      of repeat doses Darapladib on the PK of Rosuvastatin in healthy volunteers of Caucasian\n      descent. Based on whether a significant increase in Rosuvastatin exposure is observed in\n      Caucasians in Part A, a decision will be made regarding whether to proceed with a\n      conditional Part B to examine this effect in healthy volunteers of Far-East Asian descent.\n\n      In both parts, subjects will receive Rosuvastatin 10 milligrams (mg) once daily (QD) for 1\n      day during the first treatment period (Treatment Period 1), followed by a 4 day PK sampling\n      period/wash-out. Subjects will then receive darapladib 160 mg QD for the next 10 days with\n      24-hour PK sampling on the last day (Day 14 of the study). Immediately following this, all\n      subjects will then receive the combination of Darapladib 160 mg and Rosuvastatin 10 mg for 1\n      day and continued Darapladib dosing of 160 mg QD for additional 3 days (Treatment Period 2)\n      while blood samples are collected to assess Rosuvastatin PK. Plasma samples collected on Day\n      15 will be analyzed for both Rosuvastatin and Darapladib concentrations.\n\n      Subjects will be required to return to the unit approximately 10 to 14 days following the\n      last dose of study medication for a clinic visit for assessments and then will return again\n      at 35 \u00b17 days following the last dose for the final follow-up visit of the study. The\n      duration of each subject's participation in the study from screening to follow-up will be\n      approximately three months.\n\n      Approximately 18 evaluable subjects will be enrolled in Part A and another 18 subjects will\n      be enrolled in Part B (if conducted) to complete dosing and all assessments."
