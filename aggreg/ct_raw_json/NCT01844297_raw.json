If the patient fails to tolerate TDF, AZT will be an alternative, except when Hb <\n      90/L or neutrophil count < 0.75\u00d7109/L. The participants will be followed up by months 0.5,\n      1, 2 ,3 and every 3 months subsequently for 2 years.\n\n      The efficacy of the regimen will be evaluated by comparison between different points along\n      the time line and previous regimens. The safety of the regimen will be assessed by\n      monitoring kidney function, bone density, cardiovascular profile, lipid profile, liver\n      function etc as well as other adverse events."
