  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Through the investigators involvement in an international consortium, the investigators had
      the opportunity to acquire a new type of synthetizer for the radiolabelling of such tracers.
      The investigators propose in this project to develop on their site, the radiosynthesis of
      68Ga-DOTATOC and to evaluate prospectively the diagnosis of neuroendocrine tumors, compared
      with the current imaging OctreoScan®. The objectives of this project are: - to validate the
      radiosynthesis of 68Ga-DOTATOC on their site with a new synthetizer - and clinically
      evaluate, through a prospective preliminary study, the diagnostic accuracy of PET-CT with
      68Ga-DOTATOC in comparison with other standard imaging examinations.
