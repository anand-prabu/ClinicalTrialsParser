In patients randomized to\n      the active arm of the study, LW-US will be performed before and after dialysis session and\n      their results used to titrate dialysis and drug treatment. Patients in this arm with\n      moderate to severe lung congestion (>15 lung comets pre-dialysis) LW measurements will be\n      repeated once a month until the treatment goal is achieved. The same (monthly) monitoring\n      frequency will be adopted also in patients without pulmonary congestion at pre-dialysis\n      baseline (<15 comets). Furthermore the use of the technique will be allowed whenever its\n      application is deemed useful to assume clinical decisions by attending physicians. Patients\n      in the active arm of the study without evidence of lung congestion at baseline who will\n      develop pulmonary congestion (i.e. clinical signs and/or >15 lung comets) during the trial\n      will receive the same treatment contemplated for those with lung congestion at baseline. At\n      the same time with the evaluation of lung water (monthly), the investigators will evaluate\n      the hid ration status using the BCM Monitor\u00ae. Of the two methods of evaluating hydration\n      status (lung ultrasound and body impedance), only LW will be used to guide the clinical\n      intervention (UF intensification or drug treatment).\n\n      The treatment goal will be pursued by ultrafiltration intensification according to\n      individual tolerance and feasibility. If the treatment goal will not be achieved within the\n      first 3-4 months or intolerance to UF supervenes, adjustment of drug treatment will be\n      considered including the introduction and/or dose adjustments of drugs of proven efficacy\n      like carvedilol and ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II blockers, as recommended by a recent\n      consensus document by KDIGO (KI 77, 273-284, 2010). Other cardiovascular and\n      non-cardiovascular medications will be maintained unchanged or appropriately adapted in\n      relationship to the individual needs."
