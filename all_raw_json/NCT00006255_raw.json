Thermal ablation continues until the entire tumor is treated. Treatment ceases\n      when the entire lesion has undergone necrosis or the zone of necrosis or significant heat\n      deposition approaches vital neurovascular structures.\n\n      Patients are followed at 2 weeks and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 28-39 patients will be accrued for this study within 22-36\n      months."
