      The purpose of the study is to perform endocardial catheter CRyo-Ablation to relieve the
      LVOT obstruction in patients with Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy.

      The investigators hypothesize that the investigators will be able to reduce &gt; 50% of the
      initial LVOT gradient. This will be considered as a successful procedure.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The patient must be ≥18 years of age

          2. The patient has left ventricular outflow tract obstruction with hypertrophic
             obstructive cardiomyopathy

          3. The patient is on optimal medication

          4. The patient is not eligible for/failed/refused alcohol ablation

          5. The patient is not eligible for/failed/refused myectomy

          6. The patient is willing to participate in the study and has signed informed consent

          7. The patient or legally authorized representative has been informed of the nature of
             the study, agrees to its provisions and has provided written informed consent,
             approved be the appropriate medical ethics committee.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Pregnant or nursing patients Female patients of child-bearing potential must have a
             negative pregnancy test done within 7 days prior to the index procedure per site
             standard test

          2. Patient has history of or known impaired renal function (Serum creatinine &gt;2.0 mg/dL
             or 177 µmol/l) or on dialysis

          3. Patient has a history of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy or patients in whom
             anti-platelet and/or anticoagulant therapy is contraindicated

          4. Patient has a known hypersensivity or contraindication to aspirin, both heparin and
             bivalirudin, clopidogrel and/or contrast sensitivity/allergy that cannot be
             adequately pre-medicated

          5. Patient has other medical illness not related to the hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
             (e.g., cancer, known malignancy, or cognitive heart failure) or known history of
             substance abuse (alcohol, cocaine, heroin etc.) that may cause non-compliance with
             the protocol, confound the data interpretation or is associated with limited life
             expectancy (i.e., less than 1 year)

          6. Subject is enrolled or intended to participate in any concurrent drug and/or device
             study, which would confound the results of this trial as determined by the
             investigator, during the course of this clinical study

          7. Subjects meets the exclusion criteria required by local low (e.g. age, pregnancy,
             breast-feeding, etc)

          8. Subject is anticipated not being able to complete the study
