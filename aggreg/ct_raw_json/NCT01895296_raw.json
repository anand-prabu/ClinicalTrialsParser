Because it is not well known\n      which somatostatin receptor(s) (sst1-5) influence(s) Dumping Syndrome most, the goal of this\n      trial is to evaluate :\n\n        -  the effect of pasireotide (sst1, 2, 3, 5 agonist) on the control of gastric emptying.\n\n        -  the effect of pasireotide (sst1, 2, 3, 5 agonist) on the release of GI hormones (during\n           OGTT).\n\n        -  the effect of pasireotide (sst1, 2, 3, 5 agonist) on the hyperinsulimic response\n           (during OGTT).\n\n        -  the efficacy of pasireotide (sst1, 2, 3, 5 agonist) for control of objective parameters\n           of Dumping Syndrome (hematocrit (Hct), pulse rate and occurrence of hypoglycemia after\n           an Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) with 75g of glucose)\n\n        -  the efficacy of pasireotide (sst1, 2, 3, 5 agonist) for control of overall symptoms as\n           measured by the combined Dumping Syndrome score\n\n        -  the efficacy of pasireotide (sst1, 2, 3, 5 agonist) for control of symptoms as measured\n           by (a) early and (b) late phase dumping symptom score separately\n\n        -  the efficacy of pasireotide (sst1, 2, 3, 5 agonist) for control of quality of life (QoL\n           SF-36)"
