            "textblock": "Respiratory muscle weakness results in substantial morbidity and mortality in individuals\n      with almost all forms of neuromuscular disease (NMD), including both the infantile and adult\n      phenotypes of Pompe disease. Although individual patterns of involvement vary, respiratory\n      weakness in Pompe disease typically affects both the inspiratory and expiratory muscle\n      systems. Our pilot data in two individuals with late-onset Pompe disease suggest that RMST\n      may be a treatment for the progressive respiratory weakness encountered in this condition.\n\n      Purpose of the Study\n\n        -  Determine the effect of respiratory muscle strength training on maximum inspiratory\n           pressure, maximum expiratory pressure,  upright % predicted forced vital capacity, and\n           aspects of cough function.\n\n        -  Determine the effect of RMST on functional outcome measures of gross motor function\n           appropriate for individual participants in terms of age and motor skills."

For example, high effort respiratory tasks are occasionally\n             associated with mild, transient dizziness which quickly dissipates following a brief\n             rest. If severe and/or prolonged dizziness were to occur in a particular case, then\n             exclusion from the study would be necessary."
