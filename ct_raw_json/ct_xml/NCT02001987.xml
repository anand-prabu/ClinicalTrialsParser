    <textblock>
      This two part, multi-center, open-label, single-arm study will evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of RoActemra/Actemra as a monotherapy or in combination with non-biologic disease
      modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) in patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid
      arthritis who have an inadequate response or are intolerant to non-biologic DMARDs or
      biologic therapy. 162 mg RoActemra/Actemra will be administered once a week by subcutaneous
      injection for up to 76 weeks.
