Subjects who are currently participating in the phase 3 study\n      20050147 will be offered this study if a positive benefit:risk compared with placebo is\n      determined in the 20050147 study. The primary endpoint of the 20050147 study is bone\n      metastases-free survival determined by the time to first occurrence of bone metastases\n      (either symptomatic or asymptomatic) or death from any cause. Subjects will receive\n      open-label denosumab administered once every 4 weeks (Q4W) subcutaneously (SC) until\n      subjects have developed a bone metastasis or for up to 3 years, whichever comes first."
