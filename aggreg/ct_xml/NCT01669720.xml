  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate if aflibercept can reduce the chance that
      metastatic (spread of) colorectal cancer can grow back after finishing standard treatment.
      The study will also look at the side effects of aflibercept and the effect on quality of
      life.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are over 1.2 million new cases of colorectal cancer and 600,000 deaths worldwide. The
      liver is the dominant site of metastases. Approximately 20-25% of patients with advanced
      colorectal cancer will be candidates for resection/ablation of all sites of metastatic
      disease.1 Unfortunately, despite resection/ablation of all metastatic sites only about 20%
      of these patients are ultimately cured.1 An effective adjuvant agent would prevent tumor
      recurrence.

      Aflibercept and bevacizumab are effective when combined with FOLFIRI for metastatic colon
      cancer. Neither has been tested in a randomized study in the adjuvant setting for patients
      with resected metastatic disease. Since aflibercept more effectively inhibits all forms of
      VEGF including VEGF-A, VEGF-B and PIGF, in striking contrast to bevacizumab which inhibits
      only VEGF-A, aflibercept likely will be more effective than bevacizumab as a single agent in
      the adjuvant metastatic setting. Therefore, we propose a randomized study of adjuvant
      aflibercept for patients  metastatic colorectal cancer who have received 10-12 cycles of
      perioperative FOLFOX and have had had a complete response to all sites of metastases after
      chemotherapy and local modalities such as surgical resection or ablation. SBRT may also be
      used to produce a complete response in a metastatic site not easily amenable to surgery or
      ablation. Only patients with very high risk of recurrence, defined as 3 or more metastatic
      sites, will be included in this study.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  First-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer with 3 or more metastases

          -  At least 10 cycles of FOLFOX. (Patients unable to complete 10 cycles of oxaliplatin,
             such as due to neuropathy or hypersensitivity reaction, may  complete 10 cycles of
             treatment with 5-FU/leucovorin or FOLFIRI)

          -  No prior bevacizumab.

          -  Resection or ablation of all metastatic sites that have not achieved complete
             response with chemotherapy. The sequence of surgery, ablation and chemotherapy may be
             according to standard institutional procedure.

          -  Patients achieving a complete response in a metastatic site by stereotactic body
             radiation are eligible if the site was not easily accessible by surgery or ablation
             and a complete response was achieved.

             therapy.
