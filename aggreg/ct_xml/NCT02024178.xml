  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies ultrasound imaging in finding prostate cancer in patients
      undergoing surgery. Diagnostic procedures, such as ultrasound imaging, may h elp find and
      diagnose prostate cancer. This study will serve as an analysis of the HistoScanning
      technology for the puprose of determing its ability to idntify sites of prostate cancer at
      the time of prostate ultrasound.
