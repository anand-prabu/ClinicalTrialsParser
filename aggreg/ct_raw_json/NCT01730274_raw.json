The effect of surgery on the cognition networks and the\n      neuropsychological performance  is dependent on the tumor location within the cerebellum.\n      Such a correlation seems feasible as functional connectivity analysis could be correlated\n      with the neuropsychological impairment in various neuropsychiatric disorders. Furthermore,\n      investigators were able to depict the maturation of the functional connectivity networks in\n      parallel to the neurocognitive development in childhood"
