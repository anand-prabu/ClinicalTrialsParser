        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologically confirmed diagnosis of pancreatic carcinoma (dose-escalation and MTD
             expansion components).

          2. Subjects in the dose-escalation component can have had up to 1 prior line of systemic
             therapy.  Subjects with pancreatic carcinoma to be enrolled in the MTD expansion
             cohort must have untreated, measurable metastatic disease.

          3. Unresectable disease or subject refused surgery.

          4. Progressive disease if treated with chemotherapy, radiotherapy, surgery or
             immuno-therapy.  If prior radiation was given, the measurable disease should be
             outside the radiation port.

          5. Measurable disease as assessed by RECIST 1.1 criteria (Appendix A).

          6. Age ≥ 18 years.

          7. ECOG performance status of 0 - 1.

          8. No prior systemic therapy, immunotherapy, investigational agent, or radiation therapy
             within the last 4 weeks.  Radiation therapy for symptomatic relief is allowed within
             the last 2 weeks.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Serious infection requiring treatment with systemically administered antibiotics at
             the time of study entrance, or an infection requiring systemic antibiotic therapy
             within 7 days prior to the first dose of study treatment.

          2. Prior treatment with nab-paclitaxel.

          3. Pregnancy or lactation.

          4. Expected non-compliance.

          5. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association Class III
             or IV), cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness, social situations that would
             limit compliance with study requirements.

          6. Subjects who have had any anticancer treatment prior to entering the study and have
             not recovered to baseline (except alopecia) or ≤ Grade 1 AEs, or deemed irreversible
             from the effects of prior cancer therapy. AEs &gt; Grade 1 that are not considered a
             safety risk by the Sponsor and investigator may be allowed upon agreement with both,
             including residual neuropathy.

          7. Subjects who had been treated with ADI-PEG 20 previously.

          8. History of seizure disorder not related to underlying cancer.
