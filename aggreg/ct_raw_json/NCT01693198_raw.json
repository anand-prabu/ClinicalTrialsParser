The symptoms are compatible with immediate allergic reaction. Previous\n      reports suggested a connection between similar symptoms and contact with different\n      cyanobacteria (living in fresh water lakes). In this study we intend to prove the mechanism\n      of these reactions.  To prove the exact allergen that causes allergic rhinitis allergists\n      perform skin tests with different suspected allergens. Likewise, we would like to perform\n      skin tests to different proteins extracted from cyanobacteria collected in lake Kineret."
