  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      MTN-017 is a Phase 2, multi-site, randomized, six-sequence, two three-period, open label
      crossover study, examining the effects of oral Truvada and reduced glycerin 1% tenofovir
      gel.  The study population will be sexually active, HIV-uninfected males who are 18 years of
      age or older, who report a history of receptive anal intercourse in the past 3 months.  Each
      of the study product regimens offers different advantages to participants seeking an
      effective HIV prevention agent.  How these relative advantages will compare in terms of
      safety, acceptability, systemic and local absorption, and adherence will be examined within
      this study.

                  corticosteroids

          7. By participant report, use of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for HIV exposure within
             the 12 weeks prior to screening or anticipated use during study participation.

          9. Has any other condition that, in the opinion of the IoR/designee, would preclude
             informed consent, make study participation unsafe, complicate interpretation of study
             outcome data, or otherwise interfere with achieving the study objectives would make
             the patient unsuitable for the study or unable/unwilling to comply with the study
             requirements. Such conditions may include, but are not limited to, colorectal
             abnormalities, substance abuse, or renal, hepatic, hematological, gastrointestinal,
