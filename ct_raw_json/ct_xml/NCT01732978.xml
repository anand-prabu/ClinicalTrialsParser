  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The crying baby is a sound signal including information relating to this individual identity
      or related to its physiological or motivational state.

      The objective of the study is to determine the implementation of the recognition of
      individual tone of the baby by his parents and acoustic modulation of the baby based on
      parental response.

      The detailed study of the acoustic structure of crying and analysis of parental perception
      will determine the dynamics during the first weeks of life of this recognition, and the
      influence of factors such as parental presence, or breastfeeding .

      For this study is organized in three stages: first, the recording of the baby's crying
      Secondly, a listening test parental soundtracks and third analysis of the acoustic structure
      of crying and parental response.
