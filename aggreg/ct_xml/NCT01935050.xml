  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to develop and pilot-test a guided cognitive-behavioral
      self-help program for mild-to-moderate depression in Parkinson's disease (dPD). We will
      pilot-test the guided self-help treatment on 20 people with PD and their caregivers.  The
      manual will be revised based on participant feedback.  Several feasibility measures
      regarding the guided self-help program (i.e., recruitment, retention, enjoyment,
      helpfulness, adherence) will also be assessed.  Moreover, preliminary estimates of effect
      size for this guided self-help program will be calculated and used in future research. We
      hypothesize that  people with PD will report decreases in depression, anxiety, and negative
      thoughts and improvements in quality life and sleep and that caregivers will report
      decreases in burden after participating in the guided self-help program

      To our knowledge, Cognitive-Behavioral self-help interventions remain unexplored for
      depression in PD to date.  The results of this study will be used to support future
      treatment development efforts for depression and other psychiatric complications in PD that
      may improve the access to and quality of mental health care in this medical population.

    <description>All participants will receive the experimental intervention: Guided Cognitive-Behavioral Self-Help. The 10 patient treatment modules will incorporate exercise, behavioral activation, thought monitoring and restructuring, relaxation training, worry control, and sleep hygiene.  The four caregiver educational modules will provide caregivers with the skills needed to facilitate patients' practice of treatment techniques learned in session.  For example, caregivers will be taught to help patients identify negative thoughts and replace them with more balanced alternatives and will be given tools to assist patients complete therapy goals (i.e., exercise, socializing).</description>
