However the intravascular therapy is going\n      on because of low complication rate in considerable Chinese studies coming from several high\n      volume stroke centers. Given to 12.2% patients failing to aggressive medical therap in the\n      SAMMPRIS study, it is imperative to performing an multiple prospective registry study of\n      stenting for patients with ICAS in China."
