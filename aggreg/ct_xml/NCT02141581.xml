  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of different licensed influenza
      vaccines including 2011-2012 formulation of trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV)
      delivered by different routes intramuscular(IM) and intradermal(ID) and 2011-2012
      formulation of live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) administered intranasally
      administered in generally healthy male and female volunteers. The goal is to develop and
      apply assays to characterize the human immune response to influenza vaccination, and to
      compare responses to mucosal vs. systemic vaccination.

      The aim of this study is to compare the cellular immune response to different licensed
      influenza vaccines  by analyses of vaccine-induced plasmablasts, including their expression
      of trafficking program and functions of polyclonal antibodies immunoglobulin gene repertoire
      derived from these cells. This work may help in the improved design of new vaccines, both
      for influenza and for other respiratory pathogens as well. Young adults, 18-30 years of age
      who did not receive 2010-2011 seasonal influenza vaccine will be enrolled. They will be
      randomly assigned to one of the three 2011-2012 licensed influenza vaccine [Fluzone®
      2011-2012 Formula (IM), Fluzone® 2011-2012 Formula (ID) or Flumist® 2011-2012 Formula given
      intranasally].  Blood samples to conduct the assays will be taken at pre-immunization, Day
      7-8 and Day 28 post immunization. A small sub-set of 7 young adults, 18-49 years of age who
      were not previously immunized with 2010-2011 seasonal influenza vaccine will be assigned to
      receive Flumist® 2011-2012 Formula vaccine. This sub-set was not part of the initial study
      design.
