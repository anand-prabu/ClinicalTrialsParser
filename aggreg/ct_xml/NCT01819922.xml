    <time_frame>180 min</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Strain and strain rate imaging (systolic function) will be performed by speckled tracking analysis.
Peak global strain will be calculated as the average strain in the basal, mid, and apical LV as measured in the apical 4-chamber view.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy male and/or female subjects of non child bearing potential only, between the
             ages of 18 and 40 years, inclusive (Healthy is defined as no clinically relevant
             abnormalities identified by a detailed medical history, full physical examination,
             including blood pressure and pulse rate measurement, 12 lead ECG and clinical
             laboratory tests).

          -  Body Mass Index (BMI) of 18 to 28 kg/m2; and a total body weight &gt;50 kg (110 lbs).

          -  Subjects with maximum effort studies (peak RER &gt;1.05) and normal exercise capacity as
             defined by peak VO2 ≥80% and ≤120% of predicted and no evidence of inducible ischemia
             or significant arrhythmia at the time of peak aerobic capacity testing 3 (±1) days
             prior to initiation of the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence or history of clinically significant hematological, renal, endocrine,
             pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric, neurologic, or
             allergic disease (including drug allergies, but excluding untreated, asymptomatic,
             seasonal allergies at time of dosing).

          -  History of smoking in the past 5 years or history or evidence of habitual use of
             other (non smoked) tobacco or nicotine-containing products within 3 months of
             Screening or positive cotinine test at Screening or Day -3 (±1).

          -  Dry eye symptoms
