The subjects will be selected based on the\n      severity of symptoms and level of dysfunction identified using the instruments of this\n      research; i.e. those obtaining an score equal or higher than 49.\n\n      The fieldwork and the interventions will be conducted by people belonging to the community;\n      they are called Mental Health Community Workers (MHCW). After six weeks of formal training,\n      they will be able to perform the interventions: 1) Component-based Intervention (CBI) and 2)\n      Community Therapy Group Intervention (CTI) for those people affected by violence and\n      displacement that were pre-selected according to the baseline instrument.\n\n      The MHCW will be under the constant supervision by psychologists of the project, and under\n      weekly supervision by a group of experts of Johns Hopkins University, the Heartland Alliance\n      and the CISALVA Institute by means of phone calls or Skype. Selected subjects will be\n      randomly allocated to any study branch: CBI, CTI or the waiting control group.\n\n      The study subjects will follow their allocated treatment, or waiting control, during 8 to 12\n      weeks; then they will be re-assessed using the project instrument.\n\n      The study outcome is the differences in instrument scores between the follow-up and the\n      baseline.\n\n      Control subjects will be assessed by the project psychologist after the follow-up, and they\n      will receive treatment when necessary."

Finally, anyone who is related with the\n      MHCW will be considered as exclusion.\n\n      For the CBI arm, new clients will be enrolled as long as treatment place becomes available\n      (i.e., as long as previous clients completed the treatment), thus to keep the providers\n      (MHCW) running at full capacity. These new clients will be chosen from those randomly\n      allocated to receive CBI. On completion of treatment, they will be reassessed within fifteen\n      (15) days after completing the treatment.\n\n      Similarly, for the CTI arm new groups will be formed as long as place becomes available\n      (i.e, as long as previous groups finished), thus to keep providers running at full capacity.\n      Group members will be chosen from those randomly allocated to receive CTI, selecting enough\n      persons at each time to fill up a group before a group begins. All group members will be\n      reassessed within fifteen (15) days after finishing the CTI.\n\n      Those allocated to the control group will undergo a waiting period similar to the period\n      between the initial and final assessments of those receiving CBI or CTI. This period could\n      be 3 months, but it could be longer if there are treatment delays. At the end of this time,\n      the participants will be reassessed.\n\n      For controls, after they are reassessed, they will be evaluated and receive professional\n      attention by psychologists to decide what is the best intervention that we can offer to the\n      clients in both cities.\n\n      The anticipated results will be the reduction in symptoms of anxiety, depression and\n      post-traumatic stress disorders in 20 points among subjects in intervention groups (CBI or\n      CTI) compared with those in the control group.\n\n      Also, an adherence of 70% is expected, and to generate strategies for the promotion and\n      prevention in mental health for Afro-Colombian victims of violence and displacement."
