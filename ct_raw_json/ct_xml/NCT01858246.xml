  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Bonebridge is a new bone conducting implantable hearing aid. The investigators plan to
      randomize patients to receive either the Bonebridge or a conventional bone conducting
      hearing device. The investigators will then compare the surgical and audiological outcomes
      of the two groups.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The new Bonebridge fully implanted, except for an external sound processor. It does not have
      any percutaneous parts like the Bone Anchored Hearing Aid. The investigators believe that
      this may improve wound healing and reduce problems with wound infection and skin overgrowth
      seen in Bone Anchored Hearing Aids.

      There may also be audiological improvements by the use of the Bonebridge as the physical
      separation of the vibrating part from the sound processor should reduce feedback. The
      company also claims other audiological improvements in the Bonebridge.

      The investigators wish to demonstrate whether this is actually the case by performing a
      study directly comparing the outcomes of the two groups.
