  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a retrospective chart review of 880-1000 patients who had a colonoscopy and
      were found to have a tubular adenoma between the years of 2004-2008. We will compare the
      rate and timing of completion of repeat colonoscopies pre and post establishment of a polyp
      registry (tracking system) in 2006.  Each group will be composed of up to 500 subjects
      consecutively identified from all the patients who underwent colonoscopy and were found to
      have a tubular adenoma (Group 1-2004 to 2006, Group 2 2007-2008).
