  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether two intradermal (ID) vaccine delivery
      devices can safely and precisely inject liquid into the intradermal layer of the skin in
      three different injection locations

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a preliminary device safety and performance evaluation in healthy adult
      volunteers (ages 18-55 years).

      Each participant will receive six injections of 0.1 ml of sterile saline solution into the
      skin:

        -  Upper deltoid with the side-load ID adapter

        -  Upper deltoid with the autodisable (AD) ID adapter

        -  Suprascapular (behind the shoulder) with the side-load ID adapter

        -  Suprascapular with the AD ID adapter

        -  Forearm with the side-load ID adapter

        -  Forearm with the AD ID adapter

      Intradermal administration of each injection will be assessed:

        -  The liquid remaining on the surface of the skin will be blotted with absorbent paper
           and the amount of liquid present will be recorded.

        -  The formation of an intradermal wheal will be observed, and the diameter of the wheal
           measured using a ruler or similar measurement tool.

        -  A photo of the injection site will be taken.

      Injections will be assessed for safety by observation of injection sites for any local
      adverse events.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Female and male participants ages 18 to 55 years.

          -  Healthy enough to participate in the clinical trial per site investigator assessment.

          -  Healthy skin on the upper deltoid, suprascapular, and forearm regions (both sides of
             the body).

          -  Able to provide signed informed consent and understand study procedures per ICH/GCP
             guidelines.

          -  Literate in English.

          -  Available by telephone 48 hours after the study visit.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        - Skin abnormalities on upper deltoid, suprascapular, and forearm regions of either side
        of the body (scars, rash, infection), tattoo at the injection site, or other skin
        conditions that would interfere with the ability to visualize an intradermal injection in
        the opinion of the investigator.
