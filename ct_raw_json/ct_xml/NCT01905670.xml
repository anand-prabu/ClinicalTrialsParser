  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is intended to demonstrate the safe implant of small receiver-electrodes into the
      endocardial surface of the left ventricle and to demonstrate its utility in providing
      cardiac resynchronization therapy in heart failure patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible patients will undergo an acoustic window assessment using transthoracic
      echocardiography. Patients with adequate acoustic windows will undergo implantation of the
      WiCS-LV system.

      Patients will undergo evaluations pre-hospital discharge, and at one month, 3 months, and 6
      months post implantation. Extended follow-up will be obtained via a registry at 1, 2, 3, 4,
      and 5 years post implantation.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients with standard indications for CRT based upon the most recent ESC/EHRA guidelines
        AND meeting criteria for one of these two categories:

          1. Patients with previously implanted pacemakers or ICD's and meeting standard
             indications for CRT but in whom  standard CRT is not advisable due to known high risk
             -  referred to as &quot;upgrades&quot;.  Justifications for not using standard CRT must be
             documented in a CRF.

          2. Patients in whom coronary sinus lead implantation or attempted implantation for CRT
             has failed to provide demonstrable therapy benefit - referred to as &quot;untreated&quot;

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Inability to comply with the study follow-up or other study requirements

          2. History of chronic alcohol/drug abuse and currently using alcohol/drugs

          3. Non-ambulatory (or unstable) NYHA class 4

         12. Life expectancy of less than 12 months

         13. Chronic hemodialysis

         14. Stage 4 or 5 renal dysfunction defined as GFR &lt;30

         15. Grade 4 mitral valve regurgitation

         16. Myocardial infarction within one month

         17. Major cardiac surgery within one month

         18. History of a pericardial effusion in prior procedures

         19. Female of childbearing potential, pregnant, or breastfeeding (a pregnancy test will
             be obtained where applicable)
