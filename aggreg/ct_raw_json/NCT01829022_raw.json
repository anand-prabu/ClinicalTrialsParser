            "textblock": "-  Leiomyoma is a common benign tumor of the smooth muscle cells of the myometrium.1 It\n           can cause several symptoms such as abnormal vaginal bleeding, pain, or urinary symptoms\n           according to size and location. Steadily, lesser invasive surgeries have been preferred\n           for such benign disease (laparotomy, laparoscopy, and then single-port surgery).2,3\n\n        -  However, these minimal approaches, laparoscopic morcellation of preoperatively\n           suspicious leimyoma, have the potential risk of peritoneal seeding of postoperative\n           diagnosed leiomyosarcoma in the pathological examination.4 Currently, safe morcellation\n           is also required during myomectomy while using a lesser invasive surgical approach such\n           as single-port surgery or natural orifice transumbilical endoscopic surgery (NOTES).\n\n        -  During single-port surgery or embryonic NOTES (E-NOTES) via an umbilicus, handling of\n           myoma into different directions could be quite a big challenge. Fortunately, myoma is\n           enough hard to pull with string and has a tendency not to rupture during manipulation\n           of these strings.\n\n        -  These concepts lead to traction of anchoring sutures during E-NOTES for myomectomy\n           applied in the current case. Safe morcellation could be guaranteed, because direction\n           morcellation via an umbilicus is possible in an endobag.\n\n        -  This useful and safe surgical approach needs to be confirmed in multi-centers in terms\n           of feasibility and morbidity."
