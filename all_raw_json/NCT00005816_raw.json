Determine the maximum tolerated dose of autologous dendritic cells\n      transfected with autologous total tumor RNA in patients with stage III or IV renal cell\n      carcinoma. II. Assess the toxicity and feasibility of this treatment regimen in these\n      patients. III. Evaluate this regimen in terms of cellular immune response, clinical\n      response, and overall survival in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients undergo nephrectomy for tumor RNA\n      extraction followed by leukapheresis to collect peripheral blood mononuclear cells for\n      dendritic cell (DC) production. Patients receive autologous DC transfected with autologous\n      renal cell carcinoma RNA both IV and intradermally on weeks 0, 2, and 4. Cohorts of 3-6\n      patients receive escalating doses of DC IV until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is\n      determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients\n      experience dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then\n      every 6 months for 1 year.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18 patients will be accrued for this study over 24 months."
