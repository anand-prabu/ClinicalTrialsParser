Here, the effect of\n      a progesterone receptor modulator, mifepristone, on cell proliferation in human breast\n      tissue in vivo will be studied in women with BRCA-1 or -2 mutations. Our preliminary results\n      implicate a possible protective effect of mifepristone in breast epithelium. The ability of\n      mifepristone to block breast epithelial cell proliferation may prevent tumorigenesis and may\n      also prove beneficial when used for contraceptive purposes and on other indications. The\n      proposed project concerns a Randomized Controlled Trial on mifepristone versus placebo\n      treatment of women with BRCA-1or -2 mutations with a high risk/incidence of breast cancer\n      and ovarian cancer."
