  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the safety and tolerability of intratracheal
      administration of two different single doses of CHF 5633 in preterm neonates with RDS in
      terms of adverse events, adverse drug reactions, hematology and biochemistry values, the
      incidence of major neonatal morbidities including bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and
      mortality.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Written informed consent obtained by parents/legal representative (according to local
             regulation) prior to any study-related procedures

          -  Inborn and outborn, preterm neonates of either sex with a gestational age of 27 weeks
             up to 33 weeks+6

          -  Clinical and radiological findings typical of RDS

          -  Age on admission to the study &lt; 24 hours from birth

          -  Requirement of endotracheal intubation for surfactant administration

          -  Fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) &gt; 0.35 to maintain SpO2 between 90-95 %

          -  Documentation of normal cranial ultrasound scan

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Use of surfactant prior to study entry and need for intratracheal administration of
             any other treatment (e.g. nitric oxide)

          -  Known genetic or chromosomal disorders, major congenital anomalies (cardiac
             malformations, myelomeningocele etc)

          -  Maternal drug abuse (heroin, methadone, methamphetamine, or cocaine) or significant
             alcohol consumption during pregnancy

          -  Clinical chorioamnionitis (Appendix III)

          -  Strong suspicion of congenital pneumonia/infection, sepsis

          -  Evidence of severe birth asphyxia or a 5 minutes Apgar score less / equal 3

          -  Presence of air leaks prior to study entry

          -  Neonatal seizures prior to study entry

          -  Mothers with prolonged rupture of the membranes (&gt; 3 weeks duration)

          -  Any condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would place the neonate at
             undue risk

          -  Participation in another clinical trial of any placebo, drug or biological substance
             conducted under the provisions of a protocol
