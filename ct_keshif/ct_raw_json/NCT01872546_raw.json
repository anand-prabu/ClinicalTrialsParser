Skin transcriptomics profiles of normal skin, psoriatic\n      non lesional skin, and psoriatic lesional skin before and after biotherapy will be compared.\n      The investigators will focus on the modification of the cytokine \"signature\" in these skin\n      lesions and of some markers of keratinocyte inflammation. The modification of the\n      transcriptomics profile induced by the biotherapy will be correlated to the clinical\n      response Psoriasis Area and Severity Index."
