Also, by also testing the full range of effects produced\n      by dronabinol (effects on brain reward circuitry assessed with task-based function MRI and\n      resting state connectivity), as well as on reward responsiveness, mood, craving, cognition,\n      psychiatric and extrapyramidal symptoms), we will provide clues as to whether dronabinol\n      should be tried in low doses as an adjunctive agent (with an antipsychotic medication) to\n      limit cannabis use in patients with schizophrenia.\n\n      Substance use disorders are strikingly common in patients with schizophrenia and contribute\n      to its morbidity and cost to society.

The assessments at T1 will be\n      virtually the same for all groups.  At T2 Groups 1-3, and Groups 5-7 will be randomly\n      assigned to one of the following conditions prior to the assessments: receiving 15mg of\n      dronabinol and smoking a placebo marijuana cigarette, receiving a placebo pill and smoking a\n      real marijuana cigarette, or receiving a placebo pill and smoking a placebo marijuana\n      cigarette.  Group 4 and Group 8 will receive no drug or placebo at T2.  Participants\n      receiving drug will have safety assessments before the drug is administered, after the drug\n      is administered but before leaving the research clinic for the day, and again a week later."
