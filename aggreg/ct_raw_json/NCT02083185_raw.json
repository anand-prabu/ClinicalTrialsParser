Appropriate serum testosterone and serum PSA concentration at screening as specified\n             in the protocol\n\n          5.

Voluntary written consent must be given before performance of any study-related\n             procedure not part of standard medical care, with the understanding that consent may\n             be withdrawn by the patient at any time without prejudice to future medical care\n\n          9. Suitable venous access for the study-required blood sampling, including PK and PD\n             Sampling\n\n        Exclusion Criteria\n\n        Patients meeting any of the following exclusion criteria are not to be enrolled in the\n        study:\n\n          1.

Previously received ADT for more than 8 months total duration (if ADT was received\n             for 8 months or less, then that ADT must have been completed at least 2 years prior\n             to screening)\n\n          3.

Specific screening for\n             chronic viral illness is at the discretion of the site and/or local institutional\n             review board (IRB)\n\n         15.

A primary family member (spouse, parent, child, or sibling of the patient) is\n             involved in the conduct of the study or is a study site employee\n\n         17. Known gastrointestinal (GI) disease or GI procedure that could interfere with the\n             oral absorption or tolerance of TAK-385, including difficulty swallowing tablets\n\n         18. Use of any medication, or food products listed in the excluded medications and\n             dietary products table within 2 weeks before the first dose of study drug.
