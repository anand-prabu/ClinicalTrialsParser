  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this study is to address the question of whether progressively lowering
      nicotine content in cigarettes can reduce or eliminate nicotine dependence in smokers of low
      socioeconomic status

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To address the question of whether progressively lowering nicotine content in cigarettes can
      reduce or eliminate nicotine dependence in low socioeconomic smokers, we will randomize
      smokers to either an Reduced Nicotine Content group with a gradual step-wise reduction in
      nicotine from 11 mg to 0.3 mg per cigarette in five 4-wk stages, or a control group with
      nicotine content that approximately matches the nicotine content of their usual brand of
      cigarettes.

      Overall, we hypothesize that low socioeconomic smokers who switch to progressively lower
      nicotine cigarettes will initially alter their smoking behavior to compensate for lower
      nicotine until cigarette nicotine yields become so low that complete compensation becomes
      too difficult. At that point, smokers will either drop-out or continue to smoke the reduced
      nicotine content cigarettes but with incomplete compensatory behaviors.

    <description>Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS): 20-item Likert scale that measures positive states (attentive, interested, alert, excited, enthusiastic, inspired, proud, determined, strong and active) and negative states (distressed, upset, hostile, irritable, scared, afraid, ashamed, guilty, nervous, and jittery)
Salivary Cortisol and amylase:
Cortisol is produced by the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) axis in response to stress. Salivary alpha amylase (sAA) is a marker of activity for the sympathetic nervous system and has been proposed as a sensitive biomarker for stress-related changes in the body</description>
