      The purpose of this study is to determine whether BMN 190 is safe and effective in the
      treatment of patients with Late-Infantile Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis Type 2 (CLN2)
      disease. This is an open label Phase 1/2 study conducted in patients with CLN2 disease.
      Efficacy measures (disease rating scale and MRI) will be compared to a natural history
      control.

      The study will be conducted under cGCP and patients will be closely monitored.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Has a diagnosis of CLN2 determined by TPP1 enzyme activity (dried blood spot)
             available at study entry. If no genotype information is available, blood will be
             collected for CLN2 gene analysis at baseline. In addition, blood for TPP1 enzyme
             activity (dried blood spot) will be collected at baseline to be analyzed centrally

          -  Has mild to moderate disease documented by a two-domain score of 3- 6 on motor and
             language domains of the Hamburg Scale, with a score of at least 1 in each of these
             two domains

          -  Written informed consent from parent or legal guardian and assent from subject, if
             appropriate

          -  Has the ability to comply with protocol requirements, in the opinion of the
             investigator

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Is less than 3 years old at enrollment

          -  Has another inherited neurologic disease, e.g. other forms of CLN or seizures
             unrelated to CLN2 (patients with febrile seizures may be eligible)

          -  Requires ventilation support, except for noninvasive support at night

          -  Has received stem cell, gene therapy, or ERT for CLN2

          -  Has contraindications for neurosurgery (e.g., congenital heart disease, severe
             respiratory impairment, or clotting abnormalities)

          -  Has contraindications for MRI scans (e.g., cardiac pacemaker, metal fragment or chip
             in the eye, aneurysm clip in the brain)  - Has generalized motor status epilepticus
             within 4 weeks before the First Dose visit, taking care that status epilepticus is on
             clinical examination and not only electroencephalogram (EEG) (enrollment may be
             postponed)

          -  Has severe infection (e.g., pneumonia, pyelonephritis, or meningitis) within 4 weeks
             before the First Dose visit (enrollment may be postponed)

          -  Has a medical condition or extenuating circumstance that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, might compromise the subject's ability to comply with the protocol
             requirements or compromise the subject's well being, safety, or clinical
             interpretability
