Determine the safety of transferring the Fanconi anemia complementation\n      group C (FACC) gene to hematopoietic progenitors by retroviral mediated gene transfer in\n      patients with Fanconi's anemia, complementation group C.\n\n      II.  Determine the extent of engraftment following this treatment regimen without prior\n      ablation of recipient marrow in these patients.\n\n      III.  Determine the ability of this treatment regimen to correct the cell phenotype and\n      improve hematopoietic function in these patients."

Patients receive transduced PBSCs\n      IV over no more than 2 hours on days 8-10. PBSC infusions may be repeated no more than every\n      2 months for up to 4 courses total.\n\n      Patients are followed monthly for 3 months, every 3 months for 9 months, every 6 months for\n      the next year, and then yearly thereafter."
