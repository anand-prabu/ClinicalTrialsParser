However, a large number of patients never receive an appropriate\n      therapy from their device. In contrast, electrical sorm and multiple ICD shocks occur in\n      other patients.\n\n      Thus, identification of predictors for survival or ICD shocks is necessary for improved\n      patient selection and optimized therapeutic strategies.\n\n      Risk stratification with electrocardiogram (ECG) and signal averaged ECG (SAECG), T-wave\n      alternans (TWA) and Holter ECG including premature ventricular contractions (PVC),\n      non-sustained VT (nsVT), heart rate variability (HRV), heart rate turbulence (HRT) and\n      deceleration capacity, as well as clinical variables is possible, but not implemented in\n      clinical routine in patients with ischemic or dilated cardiomyopathy and newly implanted ICD\n      for primary or secondary prevention of SCD following current guidelines.\n\n      Patients will be prospectively followed and the predictive value of the risk markers\n      mentioned above to predict all-cause mortality or appropriate ICD shocks will be\n      investigated."
