If a female who stops breastfeeding\n             enters the study, the female must stop breastfeeding from the day of the first study\n             drug administration until at least 3 months after the last administration\n\n          -  Have an estimated life expectancy of \u226512 weeks\n\n          -  Are able to swallow capsules\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  Have received treatment within 21 days of the initial dose of study drug with an\n             experimental agent for noncancer indications that has not received regulatory\n             approval for any indication\n\n          -  Have a medical history of any of the following conditions: presyncope or syncope of\n             either unexplained or cardiovascular etiology, ventricular arrhythmia (e.g.,\n             ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation) or sudden cardiac arrest\n\n          -  Have a baseline with any of the following findings on screening electrocardiogram\n             (ECG): ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, abnormal QTc using Bazett's\n             formula (QTcB) (defined as \u2265470 milliseconds), or evidence of acute myocardial\n             ischemia\n\n          -  Have serious preexisting medical conditions that, in the judgment of the\n             investigator, would preclude participation in this study (for example, history of\n             major surgical resection involving the stomach or small bowel)\n\n          -  Have symptomatic central nervous system (CNS) malignancy or metastasis. For\n             asymptomatic participants without history of CNS malignancy or metastases\n\n          -  Have evidence or history of a leukemia\n\n          -  Have received a stem-cell transplant. As an exception, a participant with lymphoma\n             who received an autologous stem-cell transplant is eligible for the study, if more\n             than 75 days have passed before the initial dose of study drug\n\n          -  Have active bacterial, fungal, and/or known viral infection (for example, human\n             immunodeficiency virus [HIV], hepatitis B, or hepatitis C)"
