            "textblock": "The overall aim of this trial is to study the safety and efficacy of ICD implantation as a\n      primary prevention strategy of SCD in patients 70 years and older. In particular, this study\n      is designed to determine the comparative effectiveness of ICD, in addition to the optimal\n      standard of care (OSC), in reducing all-cause mortality, versus OSC alone; OSC includes\n      standard intervention for chronic heart failure patients, i.e. lifestyle modification,\n      disease management, adoption of healthy diet and exercise practices, etcetera. One\n      particularly important secondary objective is to assess treatment efficacy under the\n      conditions of high versus low co-morbidity burden.\n\n      Participants will be randomized (1:1 ratio) to ICD + OSC or OSC alone, and stratified by\n      participating site and co-morbidity level (Charlson score <3 versus  3). Acute treatment\n      visits will occur as per site-specific conventions prior to the implantation, and within 1-4\n      months post-implantation; central follow-up will occur every 6 months thereafter, until\n      study close. Neither  the participant nor the treating clinician will be masked to\n      treatment.\n\n      Primary Objective:\n\n      The primary objective of this study is to determine if a primary prevention strategy with\n      ICD implantation in addition to optimal standard of care (OSC) is effective in reducing\n      all-cause mortality compared to OSC alone in patients 70 years of age and older who are\n      eligible for ICD therapy according to current Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)\n      criteria.\n\n      Primary Hypothesis:\n\n      The primary hypothesis of this study is that implantation of an ICD plus optimal standard of\n      care will reduce all-cause mortality in patients 70 years of age and older versus optimal\n      standard of care alone.\n\n      Secondary Objectives:\n\n        1. One secondary objective of this study is to ascertain whether age, co-morbidity burden,\n           or age and burden together, are determinants in mortality outcomes in the OSC versus\n           ICD + OSC group.\n\n        2. An additional secondary objective of the study is to determine the effect of ICD\n           implantation plus optimal standard of care on QoL among elderly patients compared with\n           optimal standard of care."
