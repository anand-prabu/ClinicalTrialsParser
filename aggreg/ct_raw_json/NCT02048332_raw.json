            "textblock": "In this research study, we want to learn more about the use of donor-derived cytotoxic\n      T-cells (CTLs) to treat viral infections that occur after allogeneic stem cell transplant.\n       A cytotoxic T cell is a T lymphocyte (a type of white blood cell) that kills cells that are\n      infected (particularly with viruses). Allogeneic means the stem cells come from another\n      person. These CTLs are cells specially designed to fight the virus infections that can\n      happen after a bone marrow transplant.\n\n      We are asking people who have undergone or will undergo an allogeneic stem cell transplant\n      to enroll in this research study, because viral infections are a common problem after\n      allogeneic stem cell transplant and can cause significant complications including death.\n\n      Stem cell transplant reduces a person's ability to fight infections. There is an increased\n      risk of getting new viral infections or reactivation of viral infections that the patient\n      has had in the past, such as cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and adenovirus\n      (ADV).  There are anti-viral medicines available to treat CMV, EBV and ADV infections,\n      though not all patients will respond to the standard treatments.  Moreover, treatment of\n      viral infections is expensive and time consuming, with families often administering\n      prolonged treatments with intravenous anti-viral medications, or patients requiring\n      prolonged admissions to the hospital.  The medicines can also have side effects like damage\n      to the kidneys or reduction in the blood counts, so in this study we are trying to find an\n      easier way to treat these infections."

In the laboratory, we will treat this blood sample to select out the cells that\n      will help fight viruses.  The cells will be grown with a special piece of DNA (a vector)\n      that makes the cells more effective at fighting viruses.  We will then grow the cells in the\n      laboratory so that we will have a stock of virus fighting cells for the patient to use in\n      the future.  We will freeze the cells and store them in a freezer in the laboratory.\n\n      If the patient has signs of virus in their blood after the transplant we will give the cells\n      to help fight the infection. If there are signs that the cells are helping fight the\n      infection, we may give more cells. The patient may get the cells up to 3 times, with one\n      month between each treatment. If the patient does not show signs of a virus, the cells will\n      stay in the freezer.\n\n      Following CTL infusion, (s)he will be monitored with physical exams daily while inpatient\n      and weekly after discharge and blood tests twice weekly for 30 days after the last infusion\n      of cells. The patient will have 2 teaspoons (10 mL) of blood drawn before each cell infusion\n      and then once a week after each infusion for 4 weeks and then once a month if possible for 1\n      year after the last infusion, all to monitor for the viral response."
