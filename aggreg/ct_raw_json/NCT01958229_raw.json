To observe the treatment outcomes.\n\n        2. To validate the result of super-responder trial.\n\n        3. To validate the Roadmap Concept.\n\n      Population:\n\n      The study population will consist of a representative group of 500 chronic hepatitis B\n      patients with detectable HBsAg for more than 6 months who need telbivudine therapy based on\n      investigators' judgment in 16 medical centers located in Taiwan."
