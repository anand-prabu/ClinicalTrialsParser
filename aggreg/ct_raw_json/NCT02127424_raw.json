            "textblock": "Background :\n\n      Despite easy and free access to HIV testing services and 5 million of tests per year\n      performed, late diagnosis remains common in France with one-third of HIV infections\n      diagnosed associated with AIDS or CD4 lymphocyte counts of less than 200/\u03bcL. To improve\n      early detection, the national health agency has promoted non-targeted HIV screening in\n      health care settings, including emergency departments (EDs), in addition to diagnostic\n      testing routinely performed by physicians. In our previous survey conducted in 2009-2010 in\n      29 EDs of the metropolitan Paris area, non-targeted nurse-driven HIV screening by rapid\n      tests was feasible, well-accepted but identified only a few new HIV diagnoses mostly among\n      patients at high-risk. Our findings, consistent with results from other international\n      groups, suggest that a targeted strategy could be feasible, efficient and cost-effective\n      with fewer tests required. However, the feasibility and the efficacy of this strategy remain\n      unknown in France.\n\n      Primary objective :\n\n      The aim of the present study is to compare the efficacy of two strategies: 1) the\n      combination of the nurse-driven HIV targeted screening and the current practice\n      (physician-directed HIV diagnostic testing) versus 2) the current practice alone\n      (physician-directed HIV diagnostic testing).\n\n      The main outcome measure is the number of patients with newly identified HIV infection among\n      the number of 18-64 years patients visited EDs (apart from being seen for prophylaxis after\n      exposure to HIV) during the inclusion periods.\n\n      Secondary objectives :\n\n      The linkage into care of patients with newly diagnosed infection, the number of new HIV\n      positive tests among the total number of tests, and the early detection will be compared.\n\n      The feasibility of the nurse-driven HIV screening (proportion of : filled-questionnaires,\n      proposition of the nurse-driven HIV screening, acceptation by patients and HIV rapid tests\n      done by nurses) and its acceptability caregivers in each ED will be evaluated as well as its\n      cost-effectiveness.\n\n      Methods :\n\n      Multicenter trial with cluster randomization and cross-over The 2 strategies will be\n      compared during 2 randomly assigned periods separated by a month (cluster randomization and\n      cross-over). 8 750 patients per ED and per period are expected with 8 EDs (cf. statistical\n      plan).\n\n      The study will be performed in 8 EDs of metropolitan Paris, an area in which half of\n      France's new HIV patients are diagnosed. The centers will be selected based on the high\n      proportion of patients at high risk visiting the EDs.\n\n      During targeted period, nurses will offer screening to all patients at EDs, aged 18-64 years\n      old, identified as high-risk by a self-administered questionnaire, not know to be HIV\n      positive, not being seen for post-exposure prophylaxis or unstable medical illness, and\n      accepting to participate by providing an informed consent. The questionnaire was previously\n      tested in one ED.\n\n      In case of reactive rapid test result, blood specimen will be collected for standard\n      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and western blot confirmation. A follow-up visit with an\n      on-site infectious disease specialist will be arranged within the following 48 hours.\n\n      Perspective :\n\n      This project will allow defining the benefit of nurse-driven HIV targeted screening in EDs\n      and its potential utility to improve HIV screening in France."
