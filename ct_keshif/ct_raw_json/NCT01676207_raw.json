            "textblock": "Background\n\n      Surgical bypass creates an artificial anastomosis between a diseased coronary artery and an\n      extracardiac vessel. Often one of the internal mammary arteries (IMA) is used for this\n      procedure. These connections have been very rarely described to occur naturally,\n      representing extracardiac coronary collaterals.\n\n      In contrast to the extensively studied coronary collateral circulation within the heart,\n      clinical attention has been paid only anecdotally to extracardiac-to-coronary anastomoses.\n      Usually this has been in the form of case reports giving account of angiographically visible\n      anastomoses between the coronary circulation and the internal mammary artery (IMA),\n      typically in the presence of a chronic occlusion of a coronary artery.

Similarly,\n      the macroscopic pathologic postmortem examination is likely to underestimate the true number\n      of extracardiac coronary collaterals.\n\n      When present, pre-existing connections between the IMA and the coronary circulation could be\n      promoted to serve as natural bypasses to diseased coronary arteries. Promotion of\n      extracardiac blood flow to the coronary circulation has very rarely already been attempted\n      in the past. In a minimally invasive intervention, bilateral surgical ligation of both IMA\n      was performed in a few patients, resulting in clinical improvement and disappearance of\n      angina. However, with the advent of coronary surgery, efforts aimed at promotion of\n      naturally existing bypasses have been abandoned for the placing of artificially created\n      extracardiac anastomoses to the coronary circulation.\n\n      Yet with the limitations of these established revascularization interventions becoming\n      clear, the need to search for alternative treatment options gets evident. Therapeutic\n      arteriogenesis with promotion of naturally existing bypasses between the coronary\n      circulation and the internal mammary arteries presents a future possibility.\n\n      Objective\n\n      The purpose of this study is to determine the in vivo prevalence and functional distribution\n      of IMA-to-coronary collateral supply via both the right and the left coronary artery.\n\n      Methods\n\n      Comparative observational study with CFI measurements in the IMAs (proximal IMA occlusion)\n      and in the coronary circulation (distal IMA occlusion), and IMA angiography during distal\n      IMA occlusion.\n\n      Study Protocol\n\n        -  Diagnostic coronary angiography and LV angiography\n\n        -  Administration of 5'000 units of heparin i.v. and 2 puffs of oral isosorbide-dinitrate\n\n        -  Right and left IMA CFI during a 1-minute ostial vessel occlusion\n\n        -  Selection of the coronary artery for CFI according to stenotic lesion chosen for PCI or\n           according to ease of access by the pressure sensor wire.
