Determine the response rate and survival of patients with recurrent or\n      metastatic colorectal carcinoma treated with fluorouracil (5-FU), leucovorin calcium, and\n      gemcitabine. II. Evaluate and establish the toxic effect profile of 5-FU, leucovorin\n      calcium, and gemcitabine in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive intravenous leucovorin calcium\n      for 60 minutes and bolus infusions of fluorouracil (5-FU), followed by gemcitabine\n      infusions, weekly for six weeks followed by 2 weeks of rest. The dosage of gemcitabine is\n      increased if fewer than 3 of the first 6 patients experience grade 3-4 toxicities. Phase II\n      proceeds at the maximum tolerated dose (1 dose level below that at which 3 patients\n      experience grade 3-4 toxicities). Patients receive a minimum of two courses of treatment to\n      be considered evaluable for response. Patients with stable disease, partial, or complete\n      remission may continue therapy for up to six treatment cycles. Patients exhibiting disease\n      progression or intolerable toxic effects are removed from the study.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 63 patients will be accrued."
