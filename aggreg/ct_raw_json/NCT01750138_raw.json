            "textblock": "The gastrointestinal tract has many functions\u037e it provides nutrition, produces hormones,\n      performs a barrier function, maintains a stable gastrointestinal micro flora and plays an\n      important role in the inflammatory process as it is the largest producer of cytokines\n      (proteins associated with inflammation). This gut function is impaired after colorectal\n      (bowel) surgery. There is evidence to suggest that impaired gut function is associated with\n      increased complications. Hence if gut function is preserved, it should equate with better\n      outcomes. As a result, there has been increasing interest in treatments called Gut Specific\n      Nutrients (GSN), which specifically target gut function. Most notable of them is Glutamine,\n      a conditionally essential amino acid and preferred fuel source for intestinal cells.\n      Research has shown that glutamine promotes cell growth, increases clearance of harmful\n      organisms from the blood, and reduces the surgical stress response. In other words,\n      glutamine has a favourable influence on gut function.\n\n      Recent studies from our unit using intravenous glutamine in critically ill patients have\n      shown an early return of gut function, which in turn is associated with attenuation of the\n      inflammatory response and improved outcomes. It is not known whether oral glutamine is\n      associated with a similar outcome. A recent pilot study at our unit suggests an association\n      between oral glutamine and early return of gut function. The aim of this research is to\n      determine if giving oral glutamine results in an early return of gut function and whether\n      this is associated with an attenuation of the systemic inflammatory response."
