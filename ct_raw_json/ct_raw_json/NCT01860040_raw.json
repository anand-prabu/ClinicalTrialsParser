No prior chemotherapy or radiotherapy for NSCLC\n\n          8. At least 5 years from diagnosis of another cancer except treated in-situ disease or\n             surgically resected non-melanoma skin cancer with clear margins.\n\n          9. Willingness to provide permission to biopsy NSCLC for collection of frozen\n             pretreatment sample.\n\n         10. Women of child-bearing potential (i.e., women who are pre-menopausal or not\n             surgically sterile) must be willing to use an acceptable contraceptive method\n             (abstinence, oral contraceptive or double barrier method) for the duration of the\n             study and for 30 days following the last dose of study drug, and must have a negative\n             urine or serum pregnancy test within 2 weeks prior to beginning treatment on this\n             trial\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          1.
