Due to an increasing in incidence of comorbidities related to\n      resistant hypertension such as diabetes, obesity and renal impairment, the prevalence of\n      resistant-to-treatment hypertension is much more likely to increase in older population.The\n      burden of resistant hypertension is going to be bigger and bigger.\n\n      At present, not many specifically designed prospective researches concerning resistant\n      hypertension are available.

The Expected rate\n      of resistant hypertension is 10% in hypertensive population.\n\n      Objectives:\n\n        1. True prevalence of resistant hypertension In order to obtain the true burden of\n           resistant hypertension, a uniform definition of resistant hypertension were applied,\n           AHA definition(4), \"high blood pressure (BP) remained in spite of appropriate lifestyle\n           interventions and treatment of three or more different types of antihypertensive drugs\n           at optimal dose, including at least one diuretics or achieving adequate BP control with\n           optimal doses of 4 or more antihypertensive drugs.\n\n             1. To exclude pseudoresistant hypertension\n\n             2. To avoid inaccurate measurement of blood pressure\n\n             3. To make sure that both the patients and the physicians are adherent to therapeutic\n                plans and to lifestyle interventions.The physicians comply with guidelines and\n                actively pursue adequate blood pressure for their patients. Ninety per cent of the\n                patients take recommended optimal daily doses of their antihypertensive\n                medications at follow-up for 6 months as well as more than 85% for 2 years(less\n                than 50% at present) Incidence of resistant hypertension TREATMENT RECOMMENDATIONS\n                This is a practical clinical trial,no specific antihypertensive drugs are going to\n                be tested in the trial.The antihypertensive drugs are selected according to\n                guidelines.\n\n                Treatment duration: six months of intensive treatment(optimal dose and type of\n                drugs),blood pressure does not reach goal.\n\n                The treatment of secondary causes of hypertension are referred to pertinent\n                specialists.\n\n                Appropriate lifestyle interventions are always encouraged:\n\n                Nonpharmacological therapy:\n\n                Reversal of lifestyle factors contributing to treatment resistance,\n\n                  -  DASH diet is encouraged to follow, lower salt diet (ideal goal< 100 mEq of\n                     sodium/24 h,evaluated with 24h urine collection), low fat and high fibre\n                     diet,\n\n                  -  weight loss if obese or overweight,\n\n                  -  moderation of alcohol intake to no more than two drinks per day for  men and\n                     one drink for women or lighter-weight persons,\n\n                  -  smoking cessation,\n\n                  -  regular physical activity.\n\n                Optimal pharmacological therapy\n\n                Drug treatment of resistant hypertension:\n\n                  -  Diuretics: Usually taking thiazide, among patients with an estimated\n                     glomerular filtration < 40 mL/min per m2(body surface area), thiazide\n                     diuretics become less effective and loop diuretics should be used instead,\n                     such as furosemide, which needs at least twice daily dosing due to its short\n                     half-life.\n\n                  -  Aldosterone antagonists, add-on therapy to use in resistant hypertension:\n                     spironolactone 25 mg once a day.\n\n                  -  In order to get better adherence to antihypertensive drug therapy, and better\n                     antihypertensive effects and less side effects, combination medicine is\n                     encouraged to use and the use of which class combinations follows guidelines\n                     and ASH recommendation(2011),but this is the choice of patients and\n                     physicians.\n\n                  -  Renal denervation with catheter-based radiofrequency ablation is not\n                     performed in this trial.\n\n             4. To rule out white-coat effect\uff1aIt has been reported that 20%-30% of patients with\n                apparent resistant hypertension referred for ambulatory BP monitoring in fact have\n                normal BP readings[5].When patients have higher BP levels than 140 over 90 mmHg\n                when measured by the physician than when assessed at home or with AMBP( ambulatory\n                monitoring blood pressure) which is called white-coat hypertension. The patients\n                with white-coat hypertension have less severe target organ damage and\n                cardiovascular risk than those with persistent elevated blood pressure in\n                ambulatory monitoring.\n\n             5. Reversing of contributing lifestyle factors for high blood pressure.\n\n                  -  Obesity\n\n                  -  High dietary salt intake (controlled at 6 grams daily as possible as we can).\n\n                  -  The recognition and avoid of other common contributing factors such as\n                     non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug use, oral contraceptive hormones\n\n                  -  The recognition and treatment of progressive renal impairment.\n\n             6. To rule out carefully the potential reversible causes of hypertension by medical\n                history, physical examination, biochemical evaluation, and/ or non-invasive\n                imaging. If diagnosed\uff0c pertinent therapy is given to the secondary hypertension:\n\n                  -  Sleep apnoea\n\n                  -  Primary aldosteronism , reported prevalence of approximately 20% in resistant\n                     hypertension[6]\n\n                  -  Renal parenchymal disease and renal artery stenosis\n\n                  -  Aortic coarctation\n\n                  -  Cushing syndrome\n\n                  -  pheochromocytoma\n\n             7. Biochemical evaluation, including serum sodium, potassium, glucose, and creatinine\n                (creatinine clearance); plasma aldosterone and renin activity.\n\n             8. 24-h urine collection to estimate dietary sodium, potassium, and aldosterone\n                excretion. Testing for urinary or plasma metanephrines/catecholamines is indicated\n                only when pheochromocytoma is suspected\n\n             9. Non-invasive imaging is mandatory when there is a suspicion of renal artery\n                stenosis, adrenal adenoma/tumour, parenchymal renal disease or aortic coarctation\n\n        2. Target damage:\n\n             1. left ventricular hypertrophy: ECG and echocardiography\n\n             2. periphery artery disease: ABI,carotid\n\n             3. kidney function: urinary microalbumin,cystatin C,creatinine eGFR\n\n             4. coronary heart disease\n\n             5.
