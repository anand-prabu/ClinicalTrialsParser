After an initial\n      wash-out non-drug treatment phase of 1 to 6 weeks, all patients will receive allocated Study\n      treatment up-titrated to the relevant dose level (i.e., 500 mg daily FP187, 720 mg daily\n      Fumaderm\u00ae, or placebo). The up-titration to full dose will last 4 weeks for FP187 and 9\n      weeks for Fumaderm\u00ae. After 20 weeks of treatment, all patients will be asked to enter a\n      separate open label treatment protocol expected to continue for up to 5 years."
