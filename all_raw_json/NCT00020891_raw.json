Multiple CT\n      scans may improve the accuracy of radiation therapy for prostate cancer.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of multiple CT scans in guiding the\n      treatment of patients who have prostate cancer and are undergoing radiation therapy."

Patients undergo a CT scan immediately\n      prior to receiving radiotherapy on treatment days 3-8 and then weekly thereafter. On 3\n      different days, patients also undergo CT scan immediately after radiotherapy. If the CT\n      scans indicate a correction that exceeds the action level currently in effect, then\n      beginning with the next treatment, the patient's position with respect to the radiation\n      field is adjusted.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 25 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years."
