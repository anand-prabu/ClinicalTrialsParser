Determine whether the use of a chemosensitivity assay to assign treatment\n      improves the time to progression and response rates of patients with stage III/IV ovarian\n      cancer.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified according to size of tumor\n      after debulking surgery, stage, and Swiss Group for Clinical Cancer Research center where\n      treatment is received. Within 14 days after patients undergo debulking surgery, they are\n      randomized to one of two treatment arms. Arm I: Patients randomized to this arm receive one\n      of six treatment regimens: Regimen A - cisplatin/cyclophosphamide Regimen B -\n      cisplatin/cyclophosphamide/doxorubicin Regimen C - carboplatin Regimen D -\n      carboplatin/cyclophosphamide Regimen E - cisplatin/paclitaxel Regimen F -\n      carboplatin/paclitaxel Arm II: Patients who are randomized to this arm are assigned a\n      treatment regimen based on a chemosensitivity assay of tumor specimens collected after\n      debulking surgery. If no valid assay result is obtained, patients receive\n      carboplatin/cyclophosphamide. Treatment is repeated every 3-4 weeks for a total of 6\n      courses. Up to 4 more courses may be administered if a partial response is demonstrated.\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for the first 2 years and every 6 months thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 300 patients will be accrued for this study over 6 years."
