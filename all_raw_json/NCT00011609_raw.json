What\n      are the perceived advantages of the WMRA to the veteran with SCI? Additionally, the study\n      will evaluate the following: 1) ease of installation and usefulness of instructional\n      manuals; 2) training requirements (time, tasks); 3) safety features; 4) reliability of the\n      device; 5) home, community, and vocational applications; 6) user acceptability; 7)\n      maintenance/ service; 8) portability; and possible modifications."
