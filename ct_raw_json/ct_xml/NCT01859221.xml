  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this phase II study is to evaluate the outcomes of patients treated with an
      investigational radiation regimen using stereotactic radiotherapy for oligometastatic
      prostate cancer and to establish efficacy       (producing a desired result or effect) and
      safety in this setting.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will serve as a component of a larger program investigating the benefits of
      stereotactic radiotherapy in patients with metastatic disease.

      This particular study will serve as a benchmark analysis.

      All patients will receive stereotactic radiotherapy directed at metastatic tumors.

      If primary prostate cancer is active and has not previously been treated with radiation
      therapy, conventional radiation therapy (6-8 weeks of daily treatment) may be recommended.
      The metastatic tumor will be treated at the same time.

      Hormone therapy will be recommended for all patients.

      Patients will be asked to complete questionnaires at regular intervals.

    <description>There are two different prognostic categories, hormones receptive and castration resistant, that have differing historical disease progression rates.  We have therefore stratified the trial so that we can independently monitor the hypothesized improvement provided by radiation therapy in these two groups. Both groups will receive the same radiation modality which is stereotactic radiation with two possible schedules of SBRT and SHRT.</description>
