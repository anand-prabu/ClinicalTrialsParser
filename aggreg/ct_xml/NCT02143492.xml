  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Standard treatment for kidney cancer is to remove the tumors from the body with surgery. The
      purpose of this clinical trial is to collect, preserve, and store excess kidney cancer tumor
      specimens that would normally be discarded after surgery.

      The purpose of this non-treatment, non-interventional protocol is to collect, preserve, and
      store excess tumor specimens, which would otherwise be discarded, following routine
      nephrectomy for subjects with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC). The collected tumor
      specimen will be preserved under current Good Manufacturing Practice conditions and will not
      be used for any other research or therapeutic purpose without a separate consent from the
      subject, specific to the intended use on a separate Institutional Review Board or
      Institutional Ethics Committee approved Argos sponsored study.

      Following routine nephrectomy (partial or cytoreductive) as indicated for subjects with
      advanced RCC, small samples of the excised tumor will be sectioned and placed into an RNA
      preservative solution as supplied by the sponsor. After collection, this preserved tumor
      specimen will be shipped to a repository operating under current Good Manufacturing Practice
      conditions. The tumor specimen will be stored for no longer than five years unless
      subsequent consent is obtained for extended storage or other use.
