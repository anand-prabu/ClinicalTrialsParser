This information will be compared to that of HIV patients in\n      another study.\n\n      Aging affects immune system activity. This study will look at some of the factors involved.\n      HIV also affects immune system activity. The results from this study, using healthy\n      volunteers, will be compared to those in another study of HIV-infected patients. This may\n      provide information on immune system activity in aging and HIV."

            "textblock": "Aging is associated with declines in both cellular and humoral immunity. A consistent\n      observation of the aging immune system is a change in T cells. Another possible mechanism of\n      diminished cellular immunity associated with age includes accelerated lymphocyte apoptosis.\n      Enhanced lymphocyte apoptosis may play an important role in the pathogenesis of HIV disease.\n      This study will use healthy volunteers to confirm and expand upon such observations. Samples\n      from these volunteers will serve as controls to those from the HIV-infected participants of\n      A5015 (a comparison study of 2 age-differentiated cohorts to determine potential mechanisms\n      that might contribute to accelerated HIV-disease progression that is associated with aging).\n\n      This is a non-treatment study; however, volunteers receive hepatitis A and tetanus\n      vaccinations. Numbers of phenotypically naive CD4+ cells (CD45RA+/CD62L+) are compared\n      between healthy, HIV-seronegative volunteers and HIV-seropositive patients of A5015. An\n      array of assays to assess baseline differences in immune function between these study\n      populations are performed. Expression of markers of activation are compared by measuring the\n      coexpression of HLA-DR+/CD38+ and CD28+ on CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes between these\n      populations. To investigate possible age-associated differences in apoptosis, Fas (CD95+)\n      expression is measured on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells by flow cytometry, and spontaneous apoptosis\n      is assessed using the propidium iodide method. DTH hypersensitivity to skin test antigens,\n      lymphocyte proliferation to mitogens, soluble antigens, recall antigens, and neoantigens are\n      compared between the 2 populations. Antibody responses to vaccination with tetanus and\n      hepatitis A are assessed. Finally, thymic size as measured by CT scan and the frequency of T\n      cells that contain TRECs is compared between these 2 populations."
