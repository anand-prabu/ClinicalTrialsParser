If parents agree to be part of this study, a 5-minute PES scan will be\n      performed first so as to not bias the sonographer. Then, a full echocardiogram study will be\n      performed on a traditional FFES. The scans will be performed at the bedside. The images will\n      be reviewed and compared by fellow and/or attending and by experienced sonographer. The\n      scans will include short axis view, ductal view and arch view.\n\n      The objective of the study is to assess if the current FDA approved PES can detect PDA in\n      neonates as comparable to traditional full featured echo systems and/or physical exam alone.\n      Using PES for PDA diagnosis will be an accessible, economic and effective way of\n      complementing the findings in our physical exam by increasing diagnostic accuracy, and\n      detecting PDA's at the bedside comparable to a full size traditional echocardiographic\n      system."
