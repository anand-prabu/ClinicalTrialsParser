The purpose of this study is to\n      demonstrate that FS Grifols is not inferior to commercially-available oxidized cellulose\n      pads (Surgicel\u00ae) in providing benefit in the time to hemostasis (i.e, the stoppage of\n      bleeding). This study has a Preliminary Part (I) for study teams to become familiar with the\n      application of FS Grifols and a Primary Part (II) to assess the safety and efficacy of FS\n      Grifols. In both parts of the study, patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either FS\n      Grifols or Surgicel."
