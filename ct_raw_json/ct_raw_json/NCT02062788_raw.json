Though\n      it may ensure a cleaner and safer surgery, this longer period of starvation increases\n      insulin resistance and may increase post-op complications. However, there is evidence that\n      administration of oral rehydration solution(ORS) prior to surgery reduces insulin\n      resistance. Our purpose is to evaluate the difference of insulin resistance in those who\n      received ORS 1 day prior to surgery and those who did not."

Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) Enhanced Recovery After Surgery(ERAS) was\n           introduced in the early 2000s by Kehlet et.al., and was applied primarily to patients\n           receiving colectomy. As the knowledge and understanding of this concept continues to\n           grow, we are now able to change the way we treat pre- and post- operative patients. In\n           Europe, it has been proven that applying this concept to patients resulted in decreased\n           length of post-operative hospital stay, post-op complications and overall hospital\n           costs.\n\n        2.
