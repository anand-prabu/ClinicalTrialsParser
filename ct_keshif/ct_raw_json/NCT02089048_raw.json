It affects about ten percent of the world's population, being\n      especially common in areas with poor health infrastructure. This is a Phase I open label,\n      multiple dose study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of Auranofin following oral dose\n      administration for 7 days to healthy subjects. 15 healthy male and female volunteers age\n      18-45 years, inclusive enrolled in one site. The study duration is 48 weeks and up to 23\n      weeks of subject participation. The primary objective characterizes the pharmacokinetics of\n      gold, given as auranofin, during and after 7 days of once daily oral dose administration.\n      The secondary objective monitor the safety of Auranofin during and after 7 days of oral\n      administration."
