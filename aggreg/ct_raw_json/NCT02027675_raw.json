Specific populations can have\n      different responses towards acute and chronic exercise. Moreover specific conditions, like\n      the type of meal ingested, can interfere with these responses. The true effect of\n      pre-competitive meal exercise in the immunity and inflammatory response is unknown. Acute\n      physical inactivity periods, commonly happens during daily life, related to work or acute\n      illness.  New evidence points out that it induces immediate metabolic and endocrinological\n      changes, these can might also be associated with changes in immune response.\n\n      Aims of this project are:\n\n        1. to assess the effect of the precompetitive meal  on the inflammatory, neuro-immune and\n           metabolic response to exercise;\n\n        2. to assess the effects of sedentary behaviour on inflammatory, neuro-immune and\n           metabolic response;\n\n        3. to assess differences in changes between healthy, asthmatic and obese subjects"

The main outcome for\n      this intervention will be airway inflammation and lung function. All outcomes will be\n      assessed before and 3h after each meal.\n\n      A group of  individuals will, in the three hours after the meal, perform an exercise\n      challenge, which is aimed to induce acute immune changes.\n\n      B) Randomized controlled trial where participants, after a run-in period and eligibility\n      evaluation, will be allocated to an intervention consisting in a reduction of physical\n      activity by 50% or maintaining habitual physical activity for two weeks; inflammatory\n      neuro-immune and metabolic response will be assessed before and after intervention."
