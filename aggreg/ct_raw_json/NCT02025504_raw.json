            "textblock": "Colonoscopy is the gold-standard for colorectal cancer screening in the US. However,\n      complete colonoscopy can be a challenging technical procedure, even for expert\n      gastroenterologists due to variations in patient anatomy, tortuous colons, and looping of\n      the endoscope. Such obstacles can prolong colonoscopy, lead to complications, decrease polyp\n      detection, and impact patient experience and tolerance. The investigators propose to\n      evaluate the efficacy of a new non-invasive abdominal binder (ColoWrap\u00ae) in improving the\n      performance and tolerance of colonoscopy by way of a randomized, blinded clinical trial.\n      Eligible participants undergoing colonoscopy at University of North Carolina Hospitals\n      (UNCH) will be recruited for the study and randomized to either the ColoWrap intervention or\n      sham arm. Colonoscopy will be performed per usual operating procedures. The primary outcome\n      will be time to distal extent (cecal intubation time). Secondary outcomes include\n      colonoscopy completion rate, use of ancillary maneuvers, medication usage, procedural\n      difficulty, patient comfort, and operator and assistant fatigue and pain. Efficacy will be\n      assessed on the basis of pairwise comparisons between groups with respect to primary and\n      secondary outcomes."
