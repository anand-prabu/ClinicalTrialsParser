Patients are stratified according to prior\n      therapy (adjuvant interferon vs chemotherapy for advanced disease vs both vs none), ECOG\n      performance status (0 vs 1), and number of organ sites involved (1 vs more than 1). Patients\n      are randomized into 1 of 3 treatment arms. (Arm III closed to accrual as of 11/30/1998.)\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive vaccination comprising gp100:209-217 (210M) peptide mixed with\n           Montanide ISA-51 subcutaneously on days 1, 22, 43, and 64. Patients also receive\n           high-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2) IV over 15 minutes every 8 hours on days 2-6 and 16-20.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive vaccination as in arm I on days 1, 22, 43, and 64. Patients\n           also receive high-dose IL-2 as in arm I on days 44-48 and 60-64. Patients who\n           demonstrate rapid visible disease progression during the initial 4 weeks of therapy\n           while maintaining good performance status may begin high-dose IL-2 on day 23.\n\n        -  Arm III (closed to accrual as of 11/30/1998): Patients receive vaccination as in arm I\n           on day 1 and then high-dose IL-2 as in arm I on day 2. Patients with nonhematologic\n           toxicity may only receive vaccination on weeks 4, 7, and 10. Other patients may also\n           receive IL-2 beginning on day 2 of each treatment week (4, 7, and 10) for up to 14\n           doses.\n\n      Patients in each arm may receive up to a total of 3 courses of treatment.\n\n      Patients are followed until death.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 90 patients (25 patients for arms I and II and 40 patients\n      for arm III [arm III closed to accrual as of 11/30/1998]) will be accrued for this study\n      within 12-18 months."
