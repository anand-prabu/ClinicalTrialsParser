    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to clarify the issue of adequate duration of consolidation period of
      Chronic hepatitis B infection with antiviral treatment with Tenofovir which could strike a
      balance between durable HBeAg seroconversion and avoiding long-term inevitable serological
      or virological recurrence.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      According to practice guidelines of American Association of the Study of Liver Diseases, in
      patients of HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B, treatment should be continued until the
      patient has achieved HBeAg seroconversion and undetectable serum HBV DNA and completed at
      least 6 months of additional treatment after appearance of anti-HBe. Also several other
      current guidelines of anti-viral treatment of chronic hepatitis B infection suggest that
      nucleos (t) ide analogues treatment can be stopped following 6 to 12 months of consolidation
      therapy after HBeAg seroconversion. However, there is a paucity of data available about the
      long-term durability of Tenofovir induced HBeAg seroconversion as well as antiviral
      treatment associated resistance risk.

      2. Primary end points: HBeAg seroconversion was defined as loss of HBeAg with concurrent
      appearance of HBeAb. Serological recurrence was defined as reappearance of HBeAg.
      Virological recurrence was defined as an increase of HBV DNA level to greater than 10,000
      copies/mL after HBeAg seroconversion with previously HBV DNA levels less than 10,000
      copies/mL.

      3. Aims: To clarify the issue of adequate duration of consolidation period which could
      strike a balance between durable HBeAg seroconversion and avoiding long-term inevitable
      serological or virological recurrence.

      4. Study design: A single-center cohort study which randomly allocating two different
      extended TDF treatment periods after HBeAg seroconversion - 12 months, and 18 months across
      patient groups. Then data will be collected about outcomes at a specific follow-up time.
