  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective cross sectional study to assess the feasibility of a school based
      health centre (SBHC) at Sprucecourt Public School, an inner-city elementary school in
      Toronto. The SBHC allows inner-city children who face barriers to accessing health care the
      opportunity to receive health care in their school. The primary aim of this study is to
      determine utilization of the SBHC. The secondary aims are a) to assess whether attending the
      SBHC resulted in important changes in health outcomes, and b) to compare rates of
      absenteeism from the first year of the SBHC to the year prior to implementation.
      Establishing feasibility of the SBHC would support further development and expansion of this
      program into other inner city schools.
