Informed consent must be obtained prior\n             to undertaking any study procedures.\n\n          2. Assent should be obtained from all children in the study where appropriate.\n\n          3. Male or female subject aged between 1 - 17 years inclusive at screening.\n\n          4. The parent / guardian, or where appropriate the child must be able to read,\n             comprehend, and write at a sufficient level to complete study related materials.\n\n          5. Subjects will be allowed to enrol in other studies while taking part on this study.\n             However, Permission from the Scientific Board must be obtained to enrol or allow the\n             continued participation of a subject enrolled in another study.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          1. As a result of medical interview, physical examination or screening investigation the\n             physician responsible considers the child unfit for the study.\n\n          2. The subject has a history of drug or other allergy, which, in the opinion of the\n             responsable physician, contra-indicates their participation.\n\n          3. Subject is female who is pregnant or lactating or up to 6 weeks post partum or 6\n             weeks cessation of breast feeding. If a woman is subsequently found to have been\n             pregnant at the time of an assessment data from that assessment will not be included\n             in the analyses\n\n          4. The child has participated within 3 months of the first dose in a study using a new\n             molecular entity, or the first dose in any other study investigating drugs or having\n             participated within three months in a study with invasive procedures. Any U-BIOPRED\n             assessments should be deferred until 3 months after the first dose or invasive\n             procedure. Permission from the Scientific Board must be obtained to enroll or allow\n             the continued participation of a child enrolled in another study.\n\n          5. Those who, in the opinion of the investigator, have a risk of non-compliance with\n             study procedures.\n\n          6. Prematurity \u226435 weeks gestation\n\n          7. The child had changed asthma medication within 4 weeks of the screening\n             assessment(except those using the Symbicort maintenance and reliever therapy (SMART)\n             regime)(assessment should be deferred)\n\n          8. History or current evidence of an upper or lower respiratory infection or symptoms\n             (including common cold) within 2 weeks of baseline assessment (assessment should be\n             deferred).\n\n          9. The child has had a severe exacerbation (requiring ER attendance or hospital\n             admission and/or a course of high dose OCS for at least 3 days duration) within 4\n             weeks of the baseline assessment (assessment should be deferred)."
