  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gut microbiota is being increasingly recognized as an important factor in fat distribution,
      insulin sensitivity and glucose and lipid metabolism. Accordingly, the intestinal microbiota
      could play an important role in the development of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The
      role of gut-derived short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), the formation of which is enhanced by
      microbial fermentation of fibre, is still controversial. At the present time, our
      understanding of the effects of SCFA on human metabolism (in gut or systemically) is still
      limited. The investigators hypothesize that the differential availability of SCFA impacts
      human metabolism differently.

      In this placebo controlled, double-blind, randomized crossover pilot study the investigators
      will validate in overweight/obese healthy male volunteers whether rectal administration of
      SCFA is a good model for studying the acute metabolic effects of SCFA. For this, it will be
      investigated if site of administration (in distal or proximal colon) of SCFA differentially
      affects parameters of substrate and energy metabolism and to test the duration of short-term
      effects of SCFA administration.
