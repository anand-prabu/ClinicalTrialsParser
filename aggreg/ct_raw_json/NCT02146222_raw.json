VEGFR/PDGFR dual kinase inhibitor X-82 may stop the growth of tumor cells by\n      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as\n      docetaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the\n      cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving\n      VEGFR/PDGFR dual kinase inhibitor X-82 and docetaxel one at a time instead of concurrently\n      may work in treating patients with solid tumors."
