            "textblock": "Regional anesthesia techniques, with administration of local anesthetics for neuraxial or\n      peripheral route are now playing a central role in modern anesthesia and in particular in\n      the control of postoperative pain. There are many review and meta-analyzes suggesting that a\n      good pain control, and specifically loco regional analgesia, may improve the outcome of\n      patients undergoing surgery.\n\n      The control of acute post-operative pain is not the only challenge to be paid by\n      anesthesiologists, because there is still much to be understood in relation to persistent\n      post-surgical pain (PPP), and about the degree of influence that regional anesthesia plays\n      in complete long-term functional recovery of patients.\n\n      From the pathophysiological perspective there is not a precise definition of the mechanisms\n      and risk factors that determine the onset of the persistent pain after surgery, but, more in\n      general, it seems to be related to a malfunction of the mechanism of secondary hyperalgesia.\n\n      Regional anesthesia could play a key role, as the main determinant of chronic pain is  acute\n      post-operative pain. The techniques of regional anesthesia exert a powerful block at the\n      peripheral level, potentially preventing the progression of central pain and the persistence\n      of stimuli that can reach the central nervous system. In addition, during surgery, these\n      techniques can reduce the metabolic alterations and the triggering mechanisms of local and\n      systemic pro-inflammatory mediators' release.\n\n      Few perspective studies exist about the influence of regional anesthesia on long-term\n      outcome and persistent pain after surgery.\n\n      The objective of the investigators study is to assess in a prospective fashion the role of\n      regional anesthesia/analgesia technique in preventing (or not) persistence pain occurrence\n      after surgical interventions which are mostly associated to pain persistence, and understand\n      if regional anesthesia provides advantages in other post-surgical outcomes."
