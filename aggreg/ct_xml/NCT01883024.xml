  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to assess the relevance of the advices provided by the IPRA©
      smartphone application for guiding the responses of insulin pump treated type 1 diabetes
      patients using real-time continuous glucose monitoring.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be asked to evaluate the IPRA advices by connecting to IPRA© application by
      using their smartphone, 30 times a week for two weeks. At the end of this two week period, a
      satisfaction questionnaire will be completed.
