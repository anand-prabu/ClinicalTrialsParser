The investigators\n      hypothesize that a self-directed and ultrasound-assisted LUS and FCU curriculum that\n      includes video lectures, online teaching modules, an ultrasound simulator, and self-directed\n      hands-on sessions on critically ill mechanically ventilated patients is effective in\n      training novice ultrasonographers to obtain good quality images, to correctly interpret\n      them, and to support clinical decision-making in critically ill patients.\n\n      Trainees will be randomized to fully supervised FCU hands-on sessions on healthy models and\n      critically ill mechanically ventilated patients (control group - traditional apprenticeship\n      model) or to a completely self-directed and simulation-based approach (intervention group).\n\n      To assess if this new self-directed and simulation-based ultrasound curriculum leads to\n      adequate acquisition of competences (adequate image acquisition and interpretation) in\n      novice ultrasonographers,  trainees will have to perform a focused lung and cardiac\n      assessment on a critically ill mechanically ventilated patient."
