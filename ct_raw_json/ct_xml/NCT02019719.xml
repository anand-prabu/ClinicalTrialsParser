  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to characterize the relationship between dose of GSK1278863 and hemoglobin
      (Hgb) response in hemodialysis-dependent (HDD) subjects with anemia associated with chronic
      kidney disease (CKD). It is anticipated that the data generated will enable selection of the
      starting dose(s) and optimize dose adjustment regimen(s) for Phase 3 clinical trials. This
      study will consist of a screening phase of 3-9 weeks, a 4-week treatment phase and a
      follow-up visit approximately 4 weeks after completing treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age (Informed concent): Japanese &gt;=20 years of age

          -  Gender (Screening 2 verification only): Female and male

          -  Females: must be of childbearing potential, and must agree to use one of the approved
             contraception methods from Screening 2 until completion of the Follow-up Visit. OR Of
             non-childbearing potential defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented tubal
             ligation or hysterectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous
             amenorrea [in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle
             stimulating hormone 23.0 - 116.3 million international units (MIU)/millilitre (mL)
             and estradiol &lt;= 10 picograms (pg)/mL is confirmatory]. Females on hormone
             replacement therapy (HRT) whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use
             one of the approved contraception methods if they wish to continue their HRT during
             the study. Otherwise they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of
             post-menopausal status prior to study enrolment. For most forms of HRT, at least 2
             weeks will elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval
             depends on the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their
             post-menopausal status, they can resume use of HRT during the study without use of a
             contraceptive method. Males: must agree to use one of the approved contraceptive
             methods from the time of Screening 2 until completion of the Follow-up Visit.

          -  Corrected QT interval (QTc) (Screening 2 verification only): Bazett's Correction of
             QT Interval (QTcB) &lt;470 milliseconds (msec) or QTcB &lt;480 msec in subjects with bundle

             paced rhythm.

          -  Dialysis frequency: On hemodialysis (HD) three times weekly for at least 8 weeks
             prior to Screening 2 through Day 1.

          -  Dialysis adequacy (Screening 2 only): A single-pool Kt/Vurea of 1.2 based on a
             historical value obtained within the prior month in order to ensure the adequacy of
             dialysis. If Kt/Vurea is not available, then an average of the last 2 values of urea
             reduction ratio (URR) of at least 65%.

          -  Hemoglobin: Target stable Hgb between 9.5-12.0 g/dL at screening.

          -  Stable erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) dose (Screening 2 only): Using the same
             ESA (epoetins or their biosimilar, or darbepoietin) with total weekly doses that
             varied by no more than 50% during the 4 weeks prior to Screening 2.

          -  Iron replacement therapy: Subjects may be on stable maintenance oral or intravenous
             (IV) (&lt;100 milligrams [mg]/week) iron supplementation. If subjects are on oral or IV
             iron, then doses must be stable for the 4 weeks prior to Screening 2, and Screening 2

             within the prior 8 weeks through Screening 2.

          -  methoxy polyethylene glycol epoetin beta (Screening 2 verification only): Use of
