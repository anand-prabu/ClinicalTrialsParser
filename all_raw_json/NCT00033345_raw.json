Study compound is\n      dispensed on weeks 1, 5, and 9. At times, study compound is oral placebo, and at other\n      times, oral indole-3-carbinol.\n\n      Quality of life is assessed at baseline and then every 4 weeks during study therapy.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18 participants will be accrued for this study within 9\n      months."
