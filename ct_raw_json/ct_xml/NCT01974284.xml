      We will compare the effectiveness of surgery and percutaneous ethanol ablation for the
      treatment of thyroid cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesize that percutaneous ethanol ablation for primary papillary thyroid
      microcarcinoma has equivalent oncologic outcomes to current treatment options including
      observation, thyroid lobectomy and total thyroidectomy.  In addition, we hypothesize that it
      will yield superior long-term quality of life, including measures of pain, voice, and
      cosmesis than standard surgical therapy (total thyroidectomy).  If our hypotheses are
      correct, the findings of this study have the potential to fundamentally change clinical
      management of this group of patients.

    <description>Primary endpoint of the study consists of the oncological outcome, which includes the disease-free status of the patients. We will compare the disease-free and overall survival of the patients between the two treatment arms and hope to find a clinically-significant difference.</description>

    <description>The Short-Form-36 (SF-36) health survey is a patient-reported survery that evaluates the patient's health status.  It consists of 8 scaled scores which are the weighted sums of the questions in each section.  The 8 sections that are tested are vitality, physical functioning, bodily pain, general role functioning, emotional role functioning, social role functioning, and mental health.  Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale; the higher the score, the less disability (i.e. the score of 0 is equivalent to maximal disability, and the score of 100 is equivalent of no disability).  The SF-36 is a set of easily-administered quality-of-life measures and is a validated tool to evaluate patient quality of life.</description>

    <measure>Patient Satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Patient satisfaction will be assessed by evaluating the following:  pain with the &quot;Brief Pain Inventory&quot; (BPI), voice with the &quot;Voice Handicap Index&quot; (VHI) and cosmesis with the &quot;Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale&quot; (POSAS).  The BPI is a simple, well-accepted instrument for the objective assessment of pain.  The VHI is an established tool used to assess voice after an intervention.  POSAS is a validated tool for the evaluation of surgical scars.</description>
