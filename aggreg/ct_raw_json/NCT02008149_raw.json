            "textblock": "Following a complete spinal cord injury (SCI), individuals experience progressive bone loss,\n      especially in the legs, with up to 70% of persons with SCI sustaining a fracture at some\n      point during their lifetime. Fractures following SCI are costly to treat and more than half\n      of patients experience a medical complication, requiring extended hospitalization, resulting\n      in a substantial impact on their quality of life. To reduce the incidence of fractures, more\n      effective rehabilitation strategies to prevent bone loss are needed. The goal of this\n      research is to determine if bone health can be preserved using an indoor rowing exercise\n      program in which the leg muscles are electrically stimulated using several, small surface\n      electrode pads that are placed on the skin on the front and back thigh muscles. An\n      encouraging case study has recently shown remarkable bone preservation in one individual\n      with SCI who participated in an electrical stimulation rowing program, however, whether\n      other individuals with SCI can achieve the same benefit is currently unknown."

            "textblock": "In this study we expect to enroll a total of 10 participants with SCI. Five participants\n      will be assigned to a Standard-of-Care (control) group and five participants will be\n      assigned to an FES-rowing intervention group. Group assignment will be partly based on the\n      preference of each potential participant and their willingness to make the necessary time\n      commitment required for participation in a given group, with the added goal, to the extent\n      possible, of matching the two groups for age, gender and time since injury. Only those\n      individuals who have a strong desire to participate in a regular exercise program and who\n      express a willingness to travel to VA Palo Alto the necessary number of times per week to\n      perform FES-rowing will be potential candidates for inclusion in the rowing group.\n\n      Bone density measurements for both the Standard-of-Care group and the FES-rowing group will\n      be performed using Dual energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) and peripheral Quantitative\n      Computed Tomography (pQCT). The Standard-of-Care group will undergo no other research\n      procedures.\n\n      The muscle conditioning program is accomplished through electrical stimulation of the\n      quadriceps and hamstring muscles using a 4-channel electrical stimulator that applies\n      stimulation using surface electrodes adhered using gel to the skin overlying the quadriceps\n      and hamstrings muscles. The muscle strengthening initially takes place three times per week,\n      sixty minutes per session, progressing up to five sessions per week, for approximately 8\n      weeks. The muscle strengthening program ensures that subjects have sufficient muscle\n      strength and endurance before they embark on the rowing program. Following the 8-week muscle\n      strengthening program, subjects will begin FES-rowing, with three sessions per week, thirty\n      minutes per session for the following 28 weeks. In the FES-rowing group, we will measure\n      isometric knee extension strength at the start of week 0, and at the end of weeks 8, 22 and\n      36.\n\n      For the rowing group, we will capture 3D kinetics and kinematics in our motion capture\n      laboratory during FES-rowing at the end of weeks 8, 22 and 36. Kinematics during rowing will\n      be collected from fifty passive retro-reflective markers that will be placed on each\n      participant to capture the position and orientation of the 12 interconnected body segments\n      used to represent each subject."
