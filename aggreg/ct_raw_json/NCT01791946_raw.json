Patients will\n      be randomized to receive the study treatment either before or after strabismus surgery\n      (i.e., corrective eye alignment surgery) or sham treatment before surgery.  The study\n      hypothesis is that there will be no significant change in vision in neither the pre nor\n      post-surgery groups and no significant change in vision in neither the sham nor actual\n      treatment groups."
