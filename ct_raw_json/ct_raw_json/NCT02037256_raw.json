Giving chemotherapy before a peripheral stem cell transplant stops the\n      growth of cancer cells by stopping them from dividing or killing them. After treatment, stem\n      cells are collected from the patient's blood and stored. The stem cells are then returned to\n      the patient to replace the blood-forming cells that were destroyed by the chemotherapy."

To test for co-mobilization of lymphoma or myeloma cells by bortezomib and G-CSF using\n      real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) patients and by\n      flow cytometry (cluster of differentiation [CD]38+/CD138+ cell) for multiple myeloma (MM)\n      patients.\n\n      II. To determine the effect of Bortezomib on the extent of mobilization of dendritic cells\n      subsets, plasmacytoid dendritic cell (pDC)1 and pDC2 and DC1/DC2 ratio by flow cytometry.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups.\n\n      GROUP A: Patients receive filgrastim subcutaneously (SC) on days 1-9 and begin apheresis on\n      day 5.
