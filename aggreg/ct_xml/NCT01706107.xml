      Multicenter, observational, longitudinal. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate
      the impact of early RRMS treatment with Tysabri in anti-JCV antibody negative patients on
      their quality of life (QoL) measured by MSIS-29 over 2 years.

      The secondary objectives of the study are:

        -  To evaluate the impact of early RRMS treatment with Tysabri in anti-JCV antibody
           negative patients over 2 years on the following:

             -  annualized relapse rate (ARR)

             -  EDSS

             -  work productivity

             -  QoL by EQ-5D

             -  QoL by Subject Global Assessment of Wellbeing VAS

        -  To evaluate clinical disease-free status (relapses, EDSS) over 2 years The tertiary
           objective of the study is to evaluate correlations between the endpoints.

      Number of Subjects: 150 Study Population: Anti-JCV antibody negative RRMS patients who
      either are treatment-naïve with a highly active disease (≥ 2 relapses in the year prior to
      study entry and ≥ 1 Gd+ lesion on T1-weighted MRI at study entry) or have failed an adequate
      course of their first-line disease modifying therapy (DMT), and who have been prescribed
      Tysabri as per the labeling.

      Treatment Groups: Single arm. Interim Analysis: An interim analysis will be performed at
      month 12 of observation.

      Visit Schedule: As per routine clinical practice. Efficacy Parameters: Passive collection of
      ARR and EDSS at the scheduled visits.

      Safety Parameters: As per routine pharmacovigilance.

        Patients who choose to participate in the study will receive a thorough description of the
        study protocol and an informed consent document describing the study and the risks and
        benefits of participating. Recruitment will continue until approximately 150 patients have
        been enrolled in the study at approximately 15 sites across Canada. Patients who withdraw
        and complete the exit interview will not be eligible to re-enroll in the study. The
        subject will be considered to be enrolled in the study once this identification number has
        been generated. Patients who convert to anti-JCV antibody positive status during the
        course of the study will be allowed to continue on Tysabri and in the study at the
        discretion of the participating neurologi
