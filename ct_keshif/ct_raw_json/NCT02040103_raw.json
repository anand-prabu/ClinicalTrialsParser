The objective of this study is to examine whether the use\n      of a device that provides intermittent compression to the legs in addition to the use of\n      low-dose blood thinners, provides an additional protection when compared to the use of blood\n      thinners alone.  Patients who are admitted to the intensive care unit are receiving low-dose\n      blood thinners to prevent clots are candidate for this study.  Patients who are enrolled\n      will continue to receive blood thinners but some will additionally receive the leg\n      compression.  The additional use of leg compression may provide protection from clots.  The\n      main side effect is possible skin abrasions but this is usually mild.  The study is\n      sponsored by King Abdullah International Medical Research Center(KAIMRC) and King Abdulaziz\n      City for Science and Technology(KACST) and will be conducted in several hospitals in Saudi\n      Arabia, Canada, USA, India, and possibly other countries. The study is planned to start on 1\n      February 2014 and to continue for 4 years."
