  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate whether Budesonide/Formoterol (Symbicort ®) therapy can improve heart
      function  at rest by decreasing lung hyperinflation in patients with COPD (Chronic
      Obstructive Pulmonary Disease).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with moderate to advanced COPD are known to have static hyperinflation (at rest) as
      a consequence of expiratory flow limitation. Hyperinflation is easily detected by measuring
      lung volumes during standard pulmonary function testing.

      Decreased Inspiratory Capacity (IC) secondary to hyperinflation has been described as a
      predictor of mortality in COPD, and as a limiting factor for the maximal tidal volume
      attained during exercise. Hyperinflation has been linked to a low cardiac output in part by
      limiting left ventricular ejection fraction during exercise.

      Treatment with inhaled anticholinergic agents or long-acting beta agonists (LABA) and
      combination of the LABA formoterol and budesonide has been shown to improve IC and decrease
      lung hyperinflation. Bronchodilators have been shown to improve exercise endurance in COPD
      when combined with pulmonary rehabilitation, however the exact mechanism: improvement of
      lung mechanics and /or improvement in cardiac function is not well known.

      Impedance cardiography (ICG) has emerged as a method to measure cardiac output without the
      need for invasive devices. Cardiac output measurement by impedance cardiography (CO-ICG) is
      a valid and reproducible method. It has been shown to have good correlation with
      thermodilution and the direct Fick method for the measurement of stroke volume and cardiac
      output.

      In addition, the oxygen pulse, easily obtained by dividing the measured oxygen uptake by the
      heart rate (VO2/HR) provides an adequate reflection of cardiac stroke volume when the
      systemic extraction of oxygen is stable.

      This method has been used to evaluate the effect of static and dynamic hyperinflation on
      cardiac function.

      This pilot study is designed to be a single center (Brigham and Women's Hospital),
      randomized, placebo-controlled, double blind, crossover study of 14 patients (male and
      female 40 to 80 years old) with COPD and static hyperinflation.

      The primary endpoint is the measurement of stroke volume, cardiac output and oxygen pulse at
      rest before and after the administration of budesonide/formoterol compared to placebo.

    <description>Impedance cardiography (ICG) (BioZ Dx ICG machine, by CardioDynamics) will be used to measure cardiac output without the need for invasive devices. Cardiac output measurement by impedance cardiography (CO-ICG) is a plethysmography technique of using sensors to detect the properties of the blood flow in the thorax. The placement of four dual disposable sensors on the neck and chest are used to transmit and detect electrical and impedance changes in the thorax, which are used to measure and calculate hemodynamic parameters. CO-ICG is a valid and reproducible method. It has been shown to have good correlation with thermodilution and the direct Fick method for the measurement of stroke volume and cardiac output</description>
