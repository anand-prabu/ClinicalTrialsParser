            "textblock": "Stroke is the most serious disabling condition in the United States and the developed world.\n      Novel stroke rehabilitation approaches, such as task-specific training, have shown promise\n      in improving an individual's recovery in the rehabilitation setting; however, evidence\n      suggests that these improvements are not generalized or transferred to the home, community,\n      or work settings. Thus, these interventions usually do not impact overall health and\n      participation outcomes.  This research study seeks to improve task-specific training as a\n      stroke rehabilitation approach by integrating it with evidence-based cognitive-oriented\n      strategies which have shown great promise as a way to address the limitations of\n      task-specific training.  The new treatment protocol is called Cognitive-Oriented Strategy\n      Training Augmented Rehabilitation, or COSTAR.  The hypothesis of this study is that COSTAR\n      will result in more efficient functional skill acquisition, better long-term retention of\n      skills learned, and generalization and transfer of skills learned to home, community, and\n      work settings."

These three components from CO-OP are overlaid on the TST intervention protocol described above to address the overall hypothesis of this study: that an evidence-based stroke rehabilitation treatment protocol (task-specific training) can be enhanced when augmented with the catalyst of cognitive-oriented strategy use.",

Winstein and Wolf use current theory to identify three key ingredients for a task-specific training (pg 269): (1) Challenging enough to require new learning, and engagement with attention to solve the motor problem; (2) Progressive and optimally adapted such that over practice, the task-demand is optimally adapted to the patient's capability and the environmental context. The task should not be too simple or too repetitive nor too difficult; and (3) Interesting enough to invoke active participation through engagement in meaningful activity.",
