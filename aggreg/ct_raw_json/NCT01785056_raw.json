Approximately 24 subjects will\n      take part in this investigator-initiated study at Georgetown University Hospital and Johns\n      Hopkins Hospital. This study will last for one year (12 months). This research is being done\n      because systemic sclerosis can cause severe, progressive organ involvement. The\n      investigators hope this study treatment will improve the outcomes in this disease, including\n      skin, muscle, joint, gastrointestinal, and lung involvement."

Subjects\n      with scleroderma will be given 2 g/kg/mo of Privigen\u00ae or placebo (Albuminar\u00ae-5) for 6\n      months. Scleroderma is generally a progressive disease, and while the skin does improve with\n      time in some patients, others have progressive disease in spite of aggressive treatment.\n      Also, spontaneous improvement in other organ systems is even less likely. Patients entered\n      into the trial will have failed to respond to standard of care treatment over the past 4\n      months. Thus, the investigators feel that any actual improvement observed can be attributed\n      to the IVIG treatment. Since this is a pilot study, future larger controlled trials will be\n      necessary to clearly demonstrate the effectiveness, but the investigators are hoping that\n      this study will give us signals that will guide the future clinical trial."
