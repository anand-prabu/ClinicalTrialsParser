  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study the investigators want to look at whether using aspirin instead of rivaroxaban
      (after initial treatment with rivaroxaban) works as well at preventing blood clots while
      also reducing risk of bleeding and is more cost effective in patients who have either a
      total hip replacement or total knee replacement.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        1.  All patients undergoing elective total hip or knee arthroplasty at the participating
        institutions will be potentially eligible for this study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Hip or lower limb fracture in the previous three months

          2. Metastatic cancer

          3. Life expectancy less than 6 months

          4. History of major bleeding that in the judgment of the investigator precludes use of
             anticoagulant prophylaxis

          5. History of aspirin allergy, active peptic ulcer disease or gastritis that in judgment
             of investigator precludes use of aspirin

          6. History of significant hepatic disease or any other condition that in the judgement
             of the investigator precludes the use of rivaroxaban

          7. Creatinine clearance less than 30 ml per minute

          8. Platelet count less than 100 x 109 /L

          9. Need for long-term anticoagulation due to a preexisting co-morbid condition or due to
             the development of venous thromboembolism following surgery but prior to
             randomization

         10. Did not or will not receive rivaroxaban post-operatively for VTE prophylaxis

         11. Bilateral total hip arthroplasty or simultaneous hip and knee arthroplasty

         12. Major surgical procedure within the previous three months

         13. Requirement for major surgery post arthroplasty within 90 day period

         14. Chronic daily aspirin use with dose greater than 100 mg a day

         15. Women of child bearing potential who are not abstinent or do not use appropriate
             contraception throughout the study drug period

         16. Geographical inaccessibility for follow-up

         17. Unwilling or unable to give consent

         18. Previous participation in the study
