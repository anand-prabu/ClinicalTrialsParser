In comparison\n      to other technologies that use water and high heat, which results in a loss of core\n      nutrients and decreased product efficacy, the calcium produced by this unique pulverizing\n      technology is micron-sized (0.03um - 10um) and therefore believed to be more effective.\n      While its tiny size was thought to increase its absorption, the belief was that the intense\n      activation of zinc via the patented ebonite charging process that could maximize the\n      bioavailability of this calcium."
