    <textblock>
      The study involves application of Axiron to each underarm. The study will evaluate the
      transfer of testosterone from underarms to the clothing items that the participant is
      wearing and other fabric items washed with participant's' clothes. The study is
      approximately 6 days, not including screening. Screening is required within 28 days prior to
      the start of the study.
