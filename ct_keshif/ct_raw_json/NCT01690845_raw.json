            "textblock": "Hypoxic hepatitis (HH) is reported to be the most frequent cause of elevated\n      aminotransferase levels in hospital. Up to 10 % of critically ill patients develop HH during\n      the course of their intensive care unit (ICU) stay. Occurrence of HH is a life threatening\n      event and ICU-mortality is reported to be up to 60%. Early therapeutic intervention is of\n      central prognostic importance in patients with HH to improve the hemodynamic impairment as\n      early as possible, to reduce hyperammonemia and hepatic encephalopathy, to avoid progression\n      of organ failure and to improve outcome. Studies reported that Molecular Adsorbent\n      Recirculating System (MARS\u00ae) therapy improved the hemodynamic situation in patients with\n      acute and acute on chronic liver failure. The study hypothesis is that MARS\u00ae therapy in\n      critically ill patients with severe HH improves hepatic hemodynamics and function and\n      consecutively the course of the disease. 40 patients with suffering of severe HH with\n      aminotransferase levels > 40 times the upper limit of normal of more than 12 hours will be\n      randomized 1:1 to MARS\u00ae therapy (n=20) or conventional therapy (n=20). 4 MARS\u00ae-sessions will\n      be performed on three consecutive days, each for at least 12 hours. Treatment will be\n      continued under special circumstances. The maximum duration of the treatment phase is 7\n      days. The primary endpoint is the difference of the indocyanine plasma disappearance rate at\n      day 7. The expected duration of the study is 2 years."

Assuming normal distribution of ICG-PDR, we will formally test the null-hypothesis of no difference between intervention group and control using an independent sample t-test. The assumption of a normal distribution will be founded on visually inspecting a histogram and using the Shapiro Wilks test for normal distribution. If the assumption of normality does not hold data will be compared using the Mann-Whitney U-test. A p-level of < 0.05 will be considered statistically significant. Furthermore a linear random coefficient model will be used to incorporate daily measurements of ICG-PDR during the course of the study in terms of a repeated measures design.",
