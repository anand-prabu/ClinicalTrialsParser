Studies have previously shown that IVCM provides an\n      in vivo metric to measure inflammatory changes in the central cornea. The objective of the\n      current study is to assess inflammatory response changes in the peripheral cornea and the\n      conjunctiva by analyzing epithelial immune cell density and morphology in these areas and\n      then correlating the IVCM findings to clinical signs and symptoms to establish novel\n      objective imaging biomarkers."
