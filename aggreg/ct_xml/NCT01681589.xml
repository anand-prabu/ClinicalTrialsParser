  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to understand the relationship between attention and emotional
      function after brain injury in an effort to develop better treatments for emotional problems
      as a result of brain injury.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies have shown that emotional problems such as difficulty with emotional
      adjustment and relationships, lack of attention to people, unawareness of one's own or other
      peoples' feelings, lead to depression and anxiety and have a large impact on quality of life
      after brain injury. This study is to better understand how the brain works to control ones
      emotions after a brain injury. The investigators will also study a treatment method to
      improve control of ones emotions called Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS). This
      method involves electrical stimulation of the scalp with sponge-soaked metal plates and a
      battery. This non-invasive treatment has already been cleared by the FDA for the treatment
      of anxiety, depression and insomnia which are problems patients are experiencing since their
      brain injury. Several studies have found this treatment useful for improving mental and
      physical functions after brain injury. The purpose of using this treatment is to understand
      how it affects changes in emotional functions.

    <description>Patients meeting criteria to particpate in the study will be tested at baseline. During Visit 1, patients will be tested to measure how alert they are, their ability to perform actions one after the other and other mental functions.  On Visit 2, patients will be tested on your ability to control your emotions. On Visit 3, patients will have a brain scan (MRI) to help the investigators understand how various parts of your brain are connected.</description>

    <description>Testing will be done again at the end of 6 weeks. This will allow the investigators to determine if there have been improvements in the patients attention and emotional function. The same assessments will be repeated again as with Visits 1-3. Investigators will ask questions regarding patients emotional well-being. An MRI will once again be performed.</description>
