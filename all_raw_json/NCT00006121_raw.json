Treatment continues every 3 weeks in\n      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed every 6 weeks until disease progression and then every 3 months for\n      survival.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 27-40 patients will be accrued for this study."
