            "textblock": "One of the main factors in the success of in-vitro fertilization is the quality of the\n      environment of the embryo.  In contrast to maternal age, the environment in which the embryo\n      develops is a modifiable factor.  Many techniques, such as assisted hatching and perfecting\n      culture media have been attempted in order to reproduce as much as possible the natural,\n      physiological environment of the mother for the embryo in in-vitro fertilization.  However,\n      the different new culture media used are devoid of growth factors normally secreted by\n      uterine cells that enhance the interaction between the embryo and its environment.\n\n      Because the endometrial lining of the uterus secretes many different cytokines necessary for\n      growth of the embryo, a new procedure has been developed to mimic the natural environment of\n      the growing embryo using autologous (patient's own) endometrial cells in co-culture with the\n      embryo.  Endocell, a product developed by Gen\u00e9vrier Laboratories, received commercial\n      authorization in France in 2011.  It is the only system of autologous embryo-endometrium\n      co-culture available on the actual market.  The process consists of developing the embryo on\n      a monolayer of the patient's own endometrial cells in order to favor its growth until the\n      blastocyst stage (day 5) and to improve its implantation."
