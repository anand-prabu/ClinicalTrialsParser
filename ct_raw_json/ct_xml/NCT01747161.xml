  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study we will investigate the efficacy and safety of infiltration of the vestibulum
      vaginae with botulin toxin in women who were diagnosed with localized provoked vulvodynia.
      In literature covering this subject we find that the prevalence of this condition is between
      10 and 15%. Especially young, sexually active women suffer from this problem and some of
      them are not capable of having sexual relations with their partner because of this burning
      pain.

      The most probable explanation for the physiopathological mechanism is an increase of nerve
      endings in the epithelium of the vestibulum, with an increase and activation of pain
      receptors in the vestibular mucosa. It also seems that patients with vestibulodynia have a
      higher tonus of the pelvic floor muscles, a greater muscle contraction in response to pain
      and a lower capacity of relaxation.

      Botulin toxin (Botox) is a neurotoxin that causes a temporary paralysis of the muscle cells.
      That way it can decrease the increased tension of the pelvic floor muscles  Botox also
      inhibits the pain receptors in the vestibulum.

      Patients will be recruited through the gynecology consultations. Every patient with
      localized provoked vulvodynia that has tried previous treatments (pelvic floor  muscle
      therapy, antidepressants, anti-epileptics, local anesthetics) will undergo Q-tip testing.
      If positive and there are no underlying diseases, the patient will be invited to participate
      in the study and  after oral and written informed consent, will be included in the study
      population. Every 6 weeks there will be given injections with 50 units of botulin toxin, on
      6 different spots in the vestibulum. 50 % of the subjects will receive physiological water
      instead of Botox (control   population). After 3 sessions, we will assess if there is any
      difference in provoked pain in treated patients vs. placebos through Q-tip testing.

    <description>Before each session (every 6 weeks) and after the last session the patients will have to fill in a FSFI questionnaire. This way we can evaluate the influence of the therapy on the patients' sexual wellbeing. (efficacy)
Before each sessions and 6 weeks after the last injection, patients will undergo Q-tip testing. This way we can objectively evaluate the pain score over the vestibulum. (efficacy)
