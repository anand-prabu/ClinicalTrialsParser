      This study aims to evaluate the effect of chlorhexidine digluconate (CRX) application in
      etched dentin on the retention of noncarious cervical lesions restorations.

      A randomized controlled split-mouth and blind trial will be carried out. Patients with at
      least two non-carious cervical lesions (NCL) will be selected. NCL will be randomly assigned
      according the type of teeth (incisors, canine or pre-molars) into two groups: control or
      experimental group (application of 2% CRX for 60 seconds after the acid etching procedure).
      Class V restorations will be performed out with an etch-and-rinse adhesive system (Adper
      Single Bond 2-3M ESPE) and a composite resin (Filtek Z350-3M ESPE) according the manufacture
      instructions, by previously trained operators. The restorations will be evaluated by a
      calibrate examiner at 1 week (baseline), and 6-month, 12-month and 24-month, using the World
      Dental Federation (FDI) criteria. The outcome is retention of the restoration.
