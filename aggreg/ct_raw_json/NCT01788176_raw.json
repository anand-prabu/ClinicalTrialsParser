The adverse effects were not serious and lasted just a few days. The\n      beneficial effects of other bisphosphonates have been already documented in several\n      placebo-controlled trials; however, there are no reports on the use of zoledronic acid to\n      reduce pain in CRPS patients."

Pre-existing hypocalcaemia and disturbance of mineral metabolism (e.g.\n             hyperparathyroidism, thyroid surgery, parathyroid surgery, malabsorption syndromes,\n             and excision of small intestine).\n\n          4.
