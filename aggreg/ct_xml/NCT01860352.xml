      The purpose of this study is to see what effects the dietary supplement called Omega-3 or
      &quot;Fish Oil&quot; and it has on your colon, if any.  Omega-3 (Fish Oil) is available in many forms
      (pills, capsules, liquid) in grocery stores, health food/vitamin stores and drug stores and
      from eating fish.  We would like to learn if different amounts of Fish Oil specifically
      chosen for you individually change your colon tissue (large intestine).  We hope that Fish
      Oil may be useful in the future as something that may help to prevent colon cancer, but we
      don't have any research in humans that shows that yet.  We have to do this study first to
      see if Fish Oil effects the colon. One type of Fish Oil is has been approved by the U.S.
      Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to reduce the risk of heart disease.  We are going to
      test a different Fish Oil supplement made by a company called Nordic Naturals.

      The colon lining or &quot;mucosa&quot; comes in contact with all the undigested things we eat or drink
      as it passes out to waste (stool).  Animal studies suggest that fish oil may help the colon
      lining by reducing colon polyps and therefore colon cancer.  We think this happens through
      chemical changes in the colon lining and also in the blood.  The chemicals that we are
      looking at are called &quot;fatty acids&quot;.  We want to see if taking different amounts fish oil
      chosen for you changes these chemicals (fatty acids) in your colon or your blood.  We will
      assign you a personal &quot;low dose&quot; of fish oil to take for 2 weeks, followed by a &quot;high dose,
      or maximum&quot; dose for 2 weeks.  We will calculate your basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) from your
      height, weight, age and assess your activity factor.  We have a table that then tells us
      your target low and high dose.  Then, based on your blood samples, we figure out which
      target dose is the one for you that will change these chemicals (fatty acids) by about ½
      (50%).  We will check how well this process worked by collecting small pieces of colon
      tissue (biopsies) of the colon before any fish oil and after all the fish oil is consumed.
      We will also use blood samples to test for these fatty acids and a few others. We are going
      to collect diet information at several times throughout the study so we can see if the food
      you eat makes a difference too.

      We hope to learn a lot about how fatty acids are metabolized (broken down or used) in the
      colon directly in combination with Omega-3 supplements.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Men and women who are between the ages of 25 and 75.

             document(s).

          -  Pre-menopausal women with intact female reproductive organs must have a negative
             pregnancy test within 2 weeks of the baseline flexible sigmoidoscopy. Post-menopausal
             is defined as no menses for the previous 12 months. If cessation of menses is within
             12 months then the subject should be treated as pre-menopausal and a pregnancy test
             performed.

          -  Have a normal WBC, hemoglobin and platelet count, and renal and hepatic function
             obtained within the last 28 days

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  • Pregnant or lactating women or women contemplating pregnancy for the duration of
             the protocol.
