Calcium and Iron supplementations are commonly used and\n      both of these have the potential to interact with Dolutegravir (DTG), this study will\n      evaluate the potential of calcium and iron supplements to decrease DTG exposure. It will\n      also evaluate two possible strategies for combined use; if an interaction is observed. The\n      first strategy is a two hour separation. The second strategy involves the administration of\n      DTG and the supplement with a meal since the presence of food modestly increases DTG\n      exposure, and because mineral supplements can be administered with food.\n\n      This is an open label, randomized, two cohort, four-period cross-over study in healthy\n      volunteers. One cohort will examine the effects of calcium carbonate and the other cohort\n      will examine the effects of ferrous fumarate on the pharmacokinetic (PK) of DTG.\n      Approximately 12 subjects will be enrolled into each of the two cohorts and receive each of\n      four treatments in a randomized fashion: 1) A single dose of DTG 50 milligram (mg)\n      administered under fasted conditions ; 2) A single dose of DTG 50 mg co-administered with a\n      single dose of calcium carbonate or ferrous fumarate under fasted conditions ; 3) A single\n      dose of DTG 50 mg co-administered with a single dose of calcium carbonate or ferrous\n      fumarate with a moderate-fat meal; 4) A single dose of DTG 50 mg administered under fasted\n      conditions 2 hours prior to administration of a single dose of calcium carbonate or ferrous\n      fumarate. There will be a washout period of at least 7 days between treatments.  Safety\n      evaluations and serial PK samples will be collected during each treatment period. A\n      follow-up visit will occur 7-14 days after the last dose of study drug. This study will be\n      conducted at one center in the United States, with healthy adult male and female subjects."
