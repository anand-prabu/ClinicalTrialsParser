However, if the patient were high risk of\n      thromboembolism, the patient should take heparin bridging therapy during temporal quit of\n      warfarin consumption for colon polypectomy. There have been very limited evidences about the\n      bleeding complication during colon polypectomy for the patients with warfarin taking.\n\n      Moreover, there have been lack of evidence that how to prevent the bleeding complication in\n      the patients with high risk of thromboembolism who should take heparin bridging therapy\n      during temporal stopping of warfarin for colon polypectomy.\n\n      This study is aimed to analyse the effect of prophylactic hemo-clipping during colon\n      polypectomy for the patients with warfarin consumption.\n\n      The investigators will enroll the subjects who should take heparin bridging therapy (quit\n      warfarin 3~5 days before colon polypectomy and check the INR, if the INR <2, heparin or low\n      molecular heparin should be start. If the INR <1.5 on the day before colon polypectomy, the\n      patient will undergo bowel preparation and colon polypectomy.

And the patients\n      enrolled into group 2 will be performed hemoclipping only for the lesion of immediate\n      bleeding during colon polypectomy. Including polyps for colon polypectomy are 6~ 20 mm size\n      and polypectomy procedure is defined as EMR after injection with blended electrical current.\n\n      The lesion which immediate bleeding is occurred during the polypectomy will be performed\n      hemoclipping irrespective of group and will not be counted as delayed bleeding even though\n      delayed bleeding is occurred on this lesion.\n\n      The primary endpoint is to compare the rate of delayed bleeding between two groups.
