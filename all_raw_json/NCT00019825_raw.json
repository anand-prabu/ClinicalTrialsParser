Patients are\n      stratified according to number of prior therapies (2 or fewer vs 3 or more).\n\n      Patients receive decitabine IV continuously on days 1-3. Treatment repeats every 5 weeks for\n      2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with\n      stable or responding disease after completion of the second course receive 2 additional\n      courses.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of decitabine until the maximum tolerated\n      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6\n      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined for a particular\n      stratum, additional patients from that stratum are treated at the MTD.\n\n      Patients are followed for 1 month.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 72 patients (36 per stratum) will be accrued for this study."
