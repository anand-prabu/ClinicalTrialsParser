Alisertib may stop the growth of\n      tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in\n      chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine hydrochloride, work in different ways to stop the growth\n      of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving\n      alisertib with gemcitabine hydrochloride may be an effective treatment for solid tumors or\n      pancreatic cancer."
