      Introduction:

      Knowledge concerning the impact of pleural and pericardial effusions on physical
      performance, recovery-time, cardiac and respiratory complications, and quality of life after
      open heart surgery is scarce. A more aggressive approach towards effusions has been
      suggested, but further studies are needed.

      Objectives:

        1. to determine the size of pleural and pericardial effusion that results in at least 30%
           reduction of physical performance in the 6-minute walk test.

        2. to compare the improvement in physical performance between the intervention group and
           the control group, measured from baseline to day 30 after surgery.

      Materials and methods:

      A randomised controlled intervention trial. Patients admitted for open heart-surgery (aortic
      valve surgery, coronary artery bypass graft surgery and combinations) will be randomised
      into either an intervention group or a control group. The intervention group will be
      followed with physical tests and ultrasonic examination the month following surgery. Pleural
      or pericardial effusion of a predefined size will be drained. The control group will follow
      the current postoperative regimen.

    <description>The primary outcome measure is the change in walking distance before and after pleuracentesis, subsequently the size of pleural effusion (both cm measured on ultrasound and drained volume) that results in a reduction of distance in the 6 minute walk test of at least 30%.</description>

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The difference in walking distance from before surgery (day 0) to after surgery (day 30) will be compared between the intervention arm (+ pleuracentesis) and the control arm (standard postoperative regimen)</description>

    <description>To asses how much of the pleural effusion is drained when performing needle puncture instead of inserting a pigtail catheter. Secondary to compare the complication rate of the two procedures.</description>

    <description>The group will follow the current postoperative regimen. In addition they will be followed with ultrasound examination, clinical examination, spirometry examination and 6 minute walk test. In case of either a) pleural effusion &gt; 400ml OR b) pleural effusion&lt; 400ml with symptoms in rest or during the walk test, the effusion will be drained and examinations will be repeated. In case of pericardial effusion of predefined size and location, either the surgeon on call or a cardiologist will be consulted.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age &gt;18 years.

          -  Admitted for elective aortic valve surgery, coronary artery bypass graft surgery or
             combinations.

          -  Be able to understand the written and oral patient information and to give informed
             consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Surgical combinations involving the mitral valve since they are already examined with
             full          echocardiography prior to discharge, which may influence protocol
             driven decisions.

          -  Simultaneous participation in any other clinical intervention trial
