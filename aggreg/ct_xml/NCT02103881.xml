  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is being done to find out if one of two drugs, ketamine or haloperidol,
      is better for treating agitation. Agitation is a state of extreme emotional disturbance
      where patients can become physically aggressive or violent, endangering themselves and those
      who are caring for them.  Often chemical substances or severe mental illness is involved in
      this level of agitation. Specifically, the investigators are interested in studying
      agitation that is treated in the prehospital setting by paramedics. This study's hypothesis
      is that ketamine is superior to haloperidol for treatment of agitation in the prehospital
      environment.

    <description>The Altered Mental Status Scale (AMSS) is an integral ordinal scale evaluating both agitation and sedation with scores from -4 to +4. It was developed at our institution and has been internally and externally validated. This scale is a modified version of the Behavioral Activity Rating Scale with additional data points from the Observer's Assessment of Alertness Scale. Effectiveness of sedation will be defined as an AMS score less than or equal to 0.
AMSS will be determined by the treating paramedic, who will undergo training as a research associate prior to commencement of the study. Participants will be followed for the duration of agitation, an expected average of 2 hours.</description>
