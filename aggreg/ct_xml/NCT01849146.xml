      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of WEE1 inhibitor MK-1775 when
      given together with radiation therapy and temozolomide in treating patients with newly
      diagnosed or recurrent glioblastoma multiforme. WEE1 inhibitor MK-1775 may stop the growth
      of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Radiation therapy
      uses high energy x rays to kill tumor cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as
      temozolomide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing
      the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving WEE1 inhibitor MK-1775 together with
      radiation therapy and temozolomide may work better in treating glioblastoma multiforme.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated doses (MTD) of MK-1775 (WEE1 inhibitor MK-1775) in
      combination with the current standard of care (radiotherapy/temozolomide for concomitant
      therapy and temozolomide for adjuvant therapy) for treating patients with newly diagnosed
      glioblastoma.

      II. To define the MTD of MK-1775 in combination with 6 weeks of daily (Monday-Friday [M-F])
      radiotherapy (RT) and concomitant temozolomide (TMZ) administered at 75 mg/m^2/day in
      patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma. (Arm 1) III. To define the MTD of MK-1775 in
      combination with adjuvant TMZ administered at 150 mg/m^2/day-200 mg/m^2/day for 5 days every
      28 days in patients with glioblastoma after concurrent RT/TMZ. (Arm 2)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To characterize the safety profile of MK-1775 in combination with RT and concomitant TMZ
      (Arm 1) and MK-1775 with adjuvant TMZ (Arm 2) in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma.

      II. To assess the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of MK-1775 in combination with upfront
      radiation/TMZ and adjuvant TMZ in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the intratumoral concentration of MK-1775 achieved in patients treated with
      the putative MTD.

      II. To characterize the time course of MK-1775 in extracellular fluid within brain tumors
      following a single oral dose of drug by microdialysis.

      III. To characterize O6-methylguanine deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)-methyltransferase (MGMT)
      methylation and tumor protein p53 (P53) pathway status, also P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and wee1
      expression levels in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma treated with standard
      therapy in combination with MK-1775.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of WEE1 inhibitor MK-1775. Patients are assigned to
      1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I:

      INITIATION COURSE: Patients receive WEE1 inhibitor MK-1775 orally (PO) on days 1, 3, and 5
      or 1-5 weekly and temozolomide PO once daily (QD) for 6 weeks. Patients also undergo
      concurrent radiation therapy 5 days per week for 6 weeks.

      MAINTENANCE COURSES: Beginning in week 10, patients receive temozolomide PO QD on days 1-5.
      Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive WEE1 inhibitor MK-1775 PO QD on days 1, 3, and 5 or 1-5, and
      temozolomide PO QD on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 2 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months thereafter.
