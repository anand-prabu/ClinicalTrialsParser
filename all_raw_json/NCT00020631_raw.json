Treatment continues for up to 2\n      years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Principal functional abilities are assessed at baseline, every 3 months, and at termination\n      of therapy.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10-25 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year."
