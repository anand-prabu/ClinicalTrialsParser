      A prospective, multicenter, uncontrolled study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the
      Cardiapex percutaneous trans-apical access and closure system. The Cardiapex device intended
      for percutaneous access and closure of the left ventricular apex in conjunction with
      transapical Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI).
