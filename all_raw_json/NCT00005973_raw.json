Evaluate intermediate biological endpoints as surrogates for the effectiveness of this\n      drug in these patients.\n\n      III. Determine the nature of dose limiting toxicity of this drug in this patient population.\n\n      IV. Determine the recommended phase II regimen of this drug in these patients. V. Establish\n      a pharmacologic and pharmacokinetic profile of this drug in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study.\n\n      Patients receive BMS-214662 IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Treatment repeats every\n      6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of BMS-214662 until the maximum tolerated\n      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which 2 of 6 patients experience\n      dose limiting toxicities.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for at least 24 months."
