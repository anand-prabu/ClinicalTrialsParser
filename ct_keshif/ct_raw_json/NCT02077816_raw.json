The variables values will be displayed in form of descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, standard error, proportions of the observations, confidence intervals) according to: sex, central venous catheter type (guide wire or port-a-cath), location of insertion, reason of the central venous catheter indication (like parenteral nutrition or antibiotics), number of catheter lumens and age. Also, the mean differences between the three locations measured will be presented.",
