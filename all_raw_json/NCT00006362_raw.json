Treatment repeats every\n           6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of PS-341 until the maximum tolerated dose\n      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 1 of 3-4 or 2 of\n      6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n        -  Regimen B: Once the MTD has been determined in regimen A, patients receive PS-341 IV\n           twice weekly for 2 weeks. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks in the absence of disease\n           progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed for 3 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 78 patients will be accrued for this study within 14 months."
