            "textblock": "For many years, patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) have been advised not to participate\n      in physical exercise. This advice was given in part because some patients were reported to\n      experience symptom instability during exercise as a consequence of increased body\n      temperature. A further argument was that avoiding exercise would preserve energy and thereby\n      result in less fatigue, leaving more energy for activities of daily living. During the last\n      decade, it has been more common to recommend exercise for MS patients, because of its\n      recently proven beneficial effects in these patients.\n\n      Resistance- and endurance training constitutes the two extremes of basic physical exercise.\n      To gain insight into the effects of exercise it therefore makes sense to understand the\n      extremes. In mild to moderately impaired MS patients endurance training is well tolerated\n      and providing beneficial effects. However, this exercise modality has not yet been tested in\n      severely disabled patients, and it is therefore unclear if endurance training is feasible\n      and beneficial in these patients. The investigators have, therefore, designed a feasibility\n      study evaluating the effects of 4 weeks of endurance training in severely disabled MS\n      patients (Expanded Disability Status Scale score > 6).\n\n      Patients are inpatients at one of the national MS hospitals and endurance training is added\n      to the usual care, and compared to usual care only (control group). Exercise frequency is 3\n      times per week, and intensity is controlled by HR measurements during exercise."
