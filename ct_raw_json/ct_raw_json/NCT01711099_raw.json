Diagnosis is\n             based on medical history, complete physical examination, and core labs.\n\n          -  Patients who no longer receive benefit from additional revascularization procedures\n             (i.e. CABG or Angioplasty).  Certification will be made by Heart Team.\n\n          -  Patient demonstrates Exercise Tolerance Time (ETT) duration < 10 minutes on Modified\n             Bruce protocol.\n\n          -  Patient had at least one documented myocardial segment with reversible ischemia.\n\n          -  Patient is under optimum medical therapy for angina for at least 6 weeks. The optimal\n             treatment plan is tailored to a person's age, the presence of other medical\n             conditions, lifestyle, medication side effects, etc.  Medical therapies for stable\n             angina include ACE-inhibitors, Nitrates, Beta Blockers and Calcium Channel Blockers,\n             trimetazidine, ivabradin. Combination of any of 3 above mentioned drugs will be\n             considered as optimum medical therapy.\n\n          -  Patient has an echocardiographic acoustic window to the target area in the myocardium\n             utilizing one of the following views: apical 2 chamber view (2CH), apical 4 chamber\n             view (4CH), modified parasternal long axis view (LAX) and parasternal short axis view\n             (SAX).\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  Patient who will substantially benefit from additional revascularization procedures\n             such as additional CABG or angioplasty therapies. This determination will be made and\n             certified by the Heart Team.\n\n          -  Patient has active endocarditis, myocarditis or pericarditis.\n\n          -  Patient with moderately severe or severe valvular disease.\n\n          -  Patient with known intraventricular thrombus.\n\n          -  Patients who have active or non-active implantables, such as pacemakers,\n             defibrillators, abandoned leads, or electrodes.\n\n          -  Patient for who shock waves applied over any implanted device that releases\n             substances or medications to the periphery (such as insulin pumps).\n\n          -  Patient is pregnant.\n\n          -  Patient with severe chronic lung disease (emphysema, pulmonary fibrosis) with\n             difficult access to ultrasonic acoustic window.\n\n          -  Patients for who shock waves applied over the area of healing fracture.\n\n          -  Patients for who shock waves applied over the area of bone growth.\n\n          -  Patients for who shock waves applied to the area of malignancy.\n\n          -  Prior invasive malignancy, except non-melanomatous skin cancer or other malignancies\n             with a documented disease-free survival for a minimum of 5 years.\n\n          -  By the physician decision there is underlying concomitant disease or circumstance\n             what may negatively influence the management of the patient."
