    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well giving cabozantinib-s-malate works in treating patients
      with refractory thyroid cancer. Cabozantinib-s-malate may stop the growth of thyroid cancer
      by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Cabozantinib-s-malate may also stop
      the growth of thyroid cancer by blocking blood flow to the tumor.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. The objective response rate, defined as the proportion of patients who have had a partial
      response (PR) or complete response (CR) within the first 6 months after initiation of
      therapy with cabozantinib (cabozantinib-s-malate).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess duration of objective response, progression-free survival and overall survival.

      II. To assess tolerability and adverse events of cabozantinib as a 2nd line therapy in
      patients with differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC).

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess effect of cabozantinib on serum tumor marker thyroglobulin and its correlation
      with overall response rate.

      II. To assess response of cabozantinib in bone metastasis (bone metastasis-specific
      progression free survival) as evaluated by pre- and on-study functional imaging such as bone
      scan, fludeoxyglucose F 18 (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) scan and/or 18F
      sodium fluoride (NaF) PET scan.

      III. To assess effect of cabozantinib on serum and urinary markers of bone turnover and its
      correlation with response to bone metastasis.

      IV. To assess predictors of response by performing tumor genotype studies (e.g. v-raf murine
      sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B [BRAF], rat sarcoma [RAS],
      phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase, catalytic subunit alpha [PIK3CA],
      mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 [MAP2K1], v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1
      [AKT1], mesenchymal-epithelial transition [MET], rearranged in transformation
      [RET]/papillary thyroid carcinoma [PTC] rearrangement) in archived tumor tissue.

      V. To assess predictors of response by assessing baseline expression levels of vascular
      endothelial growth factor (VEGF), phosphorylated vascular endothelial growth factor receptor
      (pVEGFR), phosphorylated mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (pERK), phosphorylated AKT1
      (pAKT) and/or total met proto-oncogene (MET) by immunohistochemistry in archived tumor
      tissue.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive cabozantinib-s-malate orally (PO) daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every
      28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks and then every 3
      months for 1 year.

             treatment

             asymptomatic and do not require steroid treatment for at least 2 weeks before
             starting study treatment are eligible; baseline brain imaging with contrast-enhanced
             CT or MRI scans for subjects with known brain metastases is required to confirm
             eligibility; eligible patients with brain metastases can be taking anti-convulsant

             such as warfarin or warfarin-related agents, heparin, thrombin or factor xabans (Xa)
             inhibitors, or antiplatelet agents (e.g., clopidogrel); low dose aspirin (=&lt; 81
             mg/day), low-dose warfarin (=&lt; 1 mg/day), and prophylactic low molecular weight
             heparin (LMWH) are permitted

             nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, voriconazole, and posaconazole); note: because the
             lists of these agents are constantly changing, it is important to regularly consult a
             frequently-updated lists; medical reference texts such as the Physicians' Desk
             Reference may also provide this information; as part of the enrollment/informed
             consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of interactions with
             other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be prescribed or if the

                         -  Gastrointestinal perforation

                         -  Bowel obstruction or gastric outlet obstruction

                         -  Intra-abdominal abscess; Note: Complete resolution of an
                            intra-abdominal abscess must be confirmed prior to initiating
                            treatment with cabozantinib even if the abscess occurred more than 6
                            months before the first dose of study treatment

               -  Other disorders associated with a high risk of fistula formation including
                  percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement =&lt; 3 months before the
                  first dose of study therapy

               -  Other clinically significant disorders such as:

                    -  Active infection requiring systemic treatment =&lt; 28 days before the first
                       dose of study treatment

                    -  Serious non-healing wound/ulcer/bone fracture =&lt; 28 days before the first
                       dose of study treatment

                    -  History of organ transplant

                    -  History of major surgery as follows:

                         -  Major surgery =&lt; 3 months of the first dose of cabozantinib if there
                            were no wound healing complications or =&lt; 6 months of the first dose
                            of cabozantinib if there were wound complications

                         -  Minor surgery =&lt; 1 months of the first dose of cabozantinib if there
                            were no wound healing complications or =&lt; 3 months of the first dose
                            of cabozantinib if there were wound complications

                         -  In addition, complete wound healing from prior surgery must be
                            confirmed at least 28 days before the first dose of cabozantinib
                            irrespective of the time from surgery

          -  The subject is unable to swallow tablets

          -  The subject has a corrected QT interval calculated by the Fridericia or Bazett's
             formula (QTcF) &gt; 480 ms within 28 days before registration; note: if initial QTcF or
             QTcB is found to be &gt; 480 ms, two additional electrocardiograms (EKGs) separated by
             at least 3 minutes should be performed; if the average of these three consecutive
             results for QTcF or QTcB is =&lt; 480 ms, the subject meets eligibility in this regard

          -  The subject is unable or unwilling to abide by the study protocol or cooperate fully
             with the investigator or designee

          -  The subject has had evidence within 2 years of the start of study treatment of
             another malignancy which required systemic treatment

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to cabozantinib

          -  Any of the following:

               -  Pregnant women

               -  Nursing women

             (HIV) positive and currently receiving antiretroviral therapy; NOTE: patients known
             to be HIV positive, but without clinical evidence of an immunocompromised state, are
             eligible for this trial

          -  The subject has received prior treatment with a small molecule kinase inhibitor or a
             hormonal therapy (including investigation kinase inhibitors or hormones) within 14
             days or five half-lives of the compound or active metabolites, whichever is longer,
             before the first dose of the treatment
