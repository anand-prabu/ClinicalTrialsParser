According to preclinical data and few early phase studies, a combined\n      use of gemcitabine and cisplatin (CDDP) showed synergistic efficacy against pancreatic\n      cancer.  NC-6004, a novel micellar cisplatin formulation, retains the activity but avoids\n      the renal toxicity and neurotoxicity caused by the high peak Cmax concentrations of\n      cisplatin.  This trial is designed to evaluate the impact of the addition of NC-6004 to\n      gemcitabine in the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic\n      cancer.\n\n      The main hypothesis of this study is that NC-6004 plus gemcitabine combination is superior\n      to gemcitabine alone in terms of overall survival in locally advanced or metastatic\n      pancreatic cancer patients"
