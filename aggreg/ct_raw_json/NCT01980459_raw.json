These magnesium levels will be\n      correlated with blood levels of indicators of inflammation (eg C reactive protein) to see\n      whether the cellular levels are more reliable than blood levels of magnesium for appropriate\n      treatment of magnesium deficiency in diabetic patients."

However, serum magnesium levels only represent less than one\n      percent of total body magnesium; whereas cellular deficiency of Mg is a more reliable\n      parameter to assess repletion of this essential mineral for correlation with indices of\n      inflammation.\n\n      The proposed research will compare the efficacy of a 3 month period of treatment with oral\n      Mg of diabetic patients selected for elevations of CRP, TNF\u03b1 and other markers of\n      inflammation on cellular and serum levels of Mg.\n\n      We anticipate that one hundred hypomagnesemic diabetic patients will be selected for a\n      double-blinded study of 3 months of supplementation with 336 mg of Mg lactate (50 patients)\n      or placebo tablets (50 patients). The repletion of serum and oral epithelial cell Mg levels\n      will be correlated with responses of CRP, TNF\u03b1, substance P, HgbAIc and\n      oxidative/nitrosative (ROS/RNS) stress parameters before and after treatment. Individuals\n      will be selected from the Dasman Diabetes Institute in Kuwait. With completion of these\n      analyses, several collaborative manuscripts with joint authorship will be prepared and\n      submitted for publication."
