  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1/1b open-label study evaluating the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and
      preliminary efficacy of ABBV-399 in subjects with advanced solid tumors. The early clinical
      development plan for ABBV-399 is based on the activity demonstrated in preclinical models.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject must have advanced solid tumor that is not amenable to surgical resection or
             other approved therapeutic options that have demonstrated clinical benefit.

          2. Subject has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0 to
             2.

          3. Subject must have measurable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors
             (RECIST) version 1.1 or disease evaluable by assessment of tumor antigens:

             - Subject with non-evaluable or non-measurable cancer are eligible if they have a
             confirmed increase in tumor antigens ≥ 2 × upper limit of normal (ULN).

          4. Subject has one of the following tumor tissues confirmed available for analyses:

               -  Archived diagnostic formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) or

               -  Biopsy collected prior to study drug administration (FFPE).

          5. Subject has adequate bone marrow, renal, and hepatic function.

          6. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 14
             days prior to initiation of treatment.

          7. Subjects in the combination therapy arms must be eligible to receive erlotinib,
             cetuximab, bevacizumab or carboplatin per most current prescribing information, or at
             the discretion of the Investigator.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject has received anticancer therapy including chemotherapy, radiation therapy,
             immunotherapy, biologic, or any investigational therapy within a period of 21 days or
             herbal therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of ABBV-399.

          2. Subject has known uncontrolled metastases to the central nervous system (CNS).
             Subjects with brain metastases are eligible provided they have shown clinical and
             radiographic stable disease for at least 4 weeks after definitive therapy and have
             not used steroids for at least 4 weeks prior to first dose of ABBV-399.

          3. Subject has unresolved adverse events &gt;= Grade 2 from prior anticancer therapy,
             except for alopecia or anemia.

          4. Subject has had major surgery within 21 days prior to the first dose of ABBV-399.

          5. Subject has a clinically significant uncontrolled condition(s).

          6. Subject has history of major immunologic reaction to any Immunoglobulin G (IgG)
             containing agent.

          7. Subjects enrolled on the combination therapy phase must satisfy the above exclusion
             criteria and also the following:

               -  Subjects may not receive ABBV-399 in combination with erlotinib, cetuximab,
                  bevacizumab or carboplatin if they have any medical condition which in the
                  opinion of the Investigator places the subject at an unacceptably high risk for
                  toxicities from the combination.

                  i. Subjects may not receive cetuximab if they have K-ras mutation. ii. Subjects
                  may not receive bevacizumab if they have squamous Non-small-cell lung carcinoma
                  (NSCLC).
