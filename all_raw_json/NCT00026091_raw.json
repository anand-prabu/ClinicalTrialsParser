To assess the toxicity of this agent in this patient population. III. To evaluate\n      molecular changes in normal and tumor cells induced by 4-HPR by studying: (a) the analysis\n      of ceramide and glucosyleceramide levels before and after therapy, (b) intracellular levels\n      of 4-HPR and 4-MPR, and (c) determinants of apoptosis (p53, p21, bcl-2, bax and terminal\n      deoxynucleotidyl transferase [TdT] assay) in baseline tumor specimens, serial serum and\n      tumor biopsy specimens where available, and surrogate in-vitro studies.\n\n      IV. To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of fenretinide. V. To further investigate the\n      antiangiogenesis effects of fenretinide in in-vitro assays using ovarian cancer cell lines\n      and in vascular growth factor (VEGF, TGFb) plasma levels in patients.\n\n      OUTLINE:\n\n      Patients receive oral fenretinide twice daily on days 1-7. Treatment repeats every 21 days\n      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity."
