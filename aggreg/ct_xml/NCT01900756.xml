  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a culturally-sensitive multipronged
      post-discharge intervention can significantly reduce blood pressure, enhance achievement of
      guideline recommended targets for risk factor control, and lower recurrent vascular events
      in a low-income and middle-income (LMIC). The study will have 2 Phases - a qualitative phase
      (Phase 1) lasting less than one year involving development of the intervention through focus
      group methodologies and structured interviews, and a clinical trial phase (Phase 2)lasting 3
      years involving a randomized trial testing the efficacy of the intervention.

      This research seeks to develop an effective and sustainable way of reducing the devastating
      and deadly impact of stroke in a low-income region of the world with poor medical
      infrastructure. It will do so by focusing on improving the treatment of the condition most
      closely tied to stroke, hypertension, using novel methods that incorporate the input of the
      local community. If successful, the strategy could serve as a ready model to be adapted by
      decision-makers in other under-resourced areas for lessening the burden of stroke(and other
      major public health challenges).
