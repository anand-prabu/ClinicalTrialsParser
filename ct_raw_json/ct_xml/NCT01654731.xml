  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is a chronic cholestatic liver disease that eventually leads
      to end-stage liver failure and death unless liver transplantation (LT) is performed.
      Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) administered orally at the daily dose of 13-15 mg/kg is
      currently the only drug approved for the treatment of PBC. UDCA consistently improves
      biochemical liver tests, prolongs survival without LT, and delays histological progression
      as well as the occurrence of portal hypertension. However, a significant proportion (40%) of
      patients treated with UDCA shows an incomplete biochemical response and remains at high risk
      of death or LT. The development of new treatments in combination with UDCA is therefore
      needed. Several candidates exist among which is Bezafibrate. Bezafibrate belongs to the
      fibrates' pharmacological class, which has been developed 4 decades ago for the treatment of
      mixed hyperlipidaemia. Bezafibrate is cheap, widely available and well tolerated. There is
      now a substantial body of circumstantial evidence supporting that fibrates, and Bezafibrate
      in particular, are well tolerated and can improve biochemical liver tests in patients with
      PBC with incomplete response to UDCA. However, despite several positive successful pilot
      studies, there are still no phase 3 randomized placebo-controlled trials of fibrates for the
      treatment of PBC. The purpose of this protocol is therefore to conduct such a trial in a
      selected population of patients with PBC based on an incomplete biochemical response after 6
      months of UDCA therapy.

  <detailed_description>

      This is a multi-center, randomized (treatment will be assigned by chance),
      placebo-controlled (an inactive substance will be compared with the test drug to see whether
      the drug has a real effect), parallel-group (two or more groups of patients will receive
      different treatments) study that will assess the efficacy and safety of bezafibrate in
      patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) who had an inadequate biochemical response to
      ursodeoxycholic acid, as defined by the Paris II criteria. Bezafibrate 400 mg or placebo
      will be daily administered in combination with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) 13-15 mg/kg/d for
      24 months. Patient safety will be monitored. Primary end-point will be the percentage of
      patients with a complete normalization of the following biochemical tests: alkaline
      phosphatase, aminotransferases, total bilirubin, serum albumin, and prothrombin index.
      Secondary endpoints will include the percentage of drug-related adverse events, survival
      rates without liver transplantation or liver decompensation, time course of non-invasive
      liver fibrosis measurements (Fibroscan, serum hyaluronic acid), time course of liver
      histological parameters (fibrosis stage, necro-inflammatory grade, ductopenia) assessed on
      percutaneous biopsy specimens, time course of endoscopic, ultrasound, and biochemical
      features of portal hypertension, time course of pruritus and of quality of life using
      validated scales.
