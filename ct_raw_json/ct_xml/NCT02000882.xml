      This is a study to determine the safety and effectiveness of BKM120 plus capecitabine in
      triple-negative (ER-, PgR-, HER2-) breast cancer (TNBC) patients with measurable brain
      metastases.

      Both capecitabine and BMK120 have previously shown activity in patients with triple-negative
      breast cancer.  Like capecitabine, BMK120 is also effective in crossing the blood brain
      barrier making it a preferred candidate for its evaluation in patients with TNBC.

      This is a Phase 2, multicenter, single-arm study to determine the safety and efficacy of
      BKM120 plus capecitabine in triple-negative (ER-, PgR-, HER2-) breast cancer patients with
      measurable brain metastases. Approximately 40 patients will be included, who have previously
      received ≤ 3 prior systemic therapies for their disease.

      The Graded Prognostic Assessment (GPA) is a recently developed, validated prognostic score
      for patients with brain metastases.  A recent study utilizing GPA in patients with TNBC and
      brain metastases showed that these patients had a median survival time of 6.4 months. The
      Graded Prognostic Assessment will be utilized to evaluate efficacy in this proposed clinical
      study.

      Capecitabine is a prodrug which is enzymatically converted to 5-fluorouracil in its tumor
      target where it inhibits DNA synthesis and slows tumor growth.  It is currently FDA approved
      for both colorectal and breast cancer.  BMK120 is a pan phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase
      inhibitor being developed under IND# 102,823 by Novartis Corporation.  As of September 2012
      over 600 patients had been enrolled in fourteen separate Novartis sponsored monotherapy or
      combination therapy clinical studies of BMK120.

      Patients with triple negative breast cancer have an increased susceptibility to the
      development of brain metastases.  In one clinical study 46% of TNBC patients were found to
      have CNS metastases at some point before death.  Because currently available targeted
      therapies such as endocrine or HER-2 targeted agents are ineffective against TNBC, current
      treatment options are generally limited to chemotherapy.

      Phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) signaling regulates diverse cellular functions
      including cell proliferation, survival, translational regulation of protein synthesis,
      glucose metabolism, cell migration, and angiogenesis.  PI3K signaling also serves a central
      role in the pathogenesis of numerous cancers.

      Constitutive activation of PI3K signaling is known to be a critical step in mediating the
      transforming potential of oncogenes and tumor suppressors in many tumor types.  Resistance
      to a variety of therapeutic interventions, including hormonal therapy, anti-HER2 therapies
      and chemotherapy (as is the case for TNBC patients) can also be linked to constitutive
      activation of the PI3K pathway.

      Preliminary data suggest that activation of the PI3K pathway is a predictor of a poor
      prognostic outcome in many cancer types.  Thus, as a pan-PI3K inhibitor, BMK120 may provide
      a therapeutic benefit to patients with TNBC.  Both capecitabine and BMK120 have previously
      shown activity in patients with TNBC.  Like capecitabine, BMK120 is also effective in
      crossing the blood brain barrier making it a preferred candidate for its evaluation in
      patients with TNBC.

      Current clinical experience with BMK120 has shown that its most frequent adverse events
      (AEs) include fatigue, decreased appetite, diarrhea, hyperglycemia, nausea, rash and mood
      alteration disorders.  Therefore patients will be closely monitored for fasting plasma
      glucose (FPG) HbA1c, and insulin C-peptide.  Patients will also be frequently and routinely
      evaluated for mood disorders and disturbances.  The remaining most frequent AEs will be
      detected by regular, frequent monitoring with symptomatic treatment to be provided as
      required.

                  sexes. Oral, implantable, or injectable contraceptives may be affected by
                  cytochrome P450 interactions, and are therefore not considered effective for
                  this study. Women of child-bearing potential, defined as sexually mature women
                  who have not undergone a hysterectomy or who have not been naturally
                  postmenopausal for at least 12 consecutive months (i.e., who has had menses any
                  time in the preceding 12 consecutive months), must have a negative serum
                  pregnancy test ≤ 72 hours prior to initiating treatment.

               -  Note: Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if
                  they have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate
                  clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or six
                  months of spontaneous amenorrhea with serum FSH levels &gt; 40 mIU/mL [for US only:
                  and estradiol &lt; 20 pg/mL] or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or
                  without hysterectomy) at least six weeks ago. In the case of oophorectomy alone,
                  only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up
                  hormone level assessment is she considered not of child bearing potential.

               -  Note: Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically
                  capable of becoming pregnant, must use highly effective contraception during
                  treatment for 4 weeks (5 T1/2) after stopping treatment. The highly effective
                  contraception is defined as either:

                  i. True abstinence: When this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle
                  of the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,
                  post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of
                  contraception.

             ii. Sterilization:  have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without
             hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks ago.  In case of oophorectomy
             alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up
             hormone level assessment.

             iii. Male partner sterilization (with the appropriate post-vasectomy documentation of
             the absence of sperm in the ejaculate). For female subjects on the study, the
             vasectomised male partner should be the sole partner for that patient.

             iv. Use of a combination of any two of the following (a+b):

               1. Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS)

               2. Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap (diaphragm or
                  cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal suppository

                    -  Oral contraception, injected or implanted hormonal methods are not allowed
                       as BKM120 potentially decreases the effectiveness of hormonal
                       contraceptives.

         27. Patient has known diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection

         28. Patient has history of another malignancy within 3 years, except cured basal cell
             carcinoma of the skin or excised carcinoma in situ of the cervix

         29. Patient is unable or unwilling to abide by the study protocol or cooperate fully with
             the investigator

         30. Patient is concurrently using other approved or investigational antineoplastic agent.

         31. Patient taking or needing enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic medication.
