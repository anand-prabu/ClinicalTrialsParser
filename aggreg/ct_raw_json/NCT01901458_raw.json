            "textblock": "Peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC) collected by apheresis are the most common stem\n      cell source for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.\n\n      Recently, Terumo BCT introduced a novel automated apheresis system for PBPC collection. The\n      Spectra Optia\u00ae apheresis system uses the Spectra Optia\u00ae Collection set and the MNC software\n      for PBPC collection. This system combines continuous centrifugation (high g) and subsequent\n      cellular collection into an elutriation chamber, where the platelets are elutriated from\n      mononuclear cells. An optical sensor detects when red blood cells begin to be elutriated and\n      subsequently triggers the collection of the buffy coat into the product bag by flushing the\n      chamber with donor plasma. Thus PBPCs are harvested intermittently. In contrast, the same\n      apheresis systems in combination with the Spectra Optia\u00ae IDL set and the WBC-D software,\n      which has been designed to perform leukodepletion procedures, permits continuous PBPC\n      centrifugation (low g) and harvesting.\n\n      The investigators hypothesis is that the use of the IDL set with manual adaption of the\n      WBC-D-software allows a more efficient PBPC collection compared to the collection set which\n      is recommended for PBPC collection. The apheresis time to collect the same amount of target\n      cells dependent on the donors peripheral blood count will be shortened. In addition, the\n      investigators want to compare both systems with respect to the cellular composition of the\n      apheresis product and the donors platelet loss and coagulation parameters during apheresis."
