We hypothesize that oral N-acetylcysteine\n      augmentation will help reduce symptoms in patients with posttraumatic stress disorder as\n      well as improve cognitive functions. We also expect that the N-acetylcysteine augmentation\n      will induce change in structural, functional, and neurochemical aspects of the brain.\n\n      In this study, we plan to conduct an randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled\n      augmentation study with N-acetylcysteine in addition to escitalopram. We will assess the\n      efficacy and safety of the N-acetylcysteine augmentation."
