      Objectives:

      Primary Objectives

        -  To investigate the safety and tolerability of single ascending doses of AZP-        531
           in healthy volunteers.

        -  To investigate the safety and tolerability of single and multiple ascending doses of
           AZP-531 in overweight/obese volunteers.

        -  To investigate the safety and tolerability of single and multiple ascending doses of
           AZP-531 in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

      Secondary Objectives • To determine the plasma pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of AZP-531 after
      single and multiple doses.

      Exploratory Objectives

      • To obtain exploratory data on the effects of AZP-531 on the pharmacodynamic (PD) markers
      of blood glucose, interstitial glucose, insulin, and plasma acylated ghrelin (AG) and
      unacylated ghrelin (UAG) in Parts A, B and C; glucagon, lipid profiles including free fatty
      acids (FFA), glycerol and pancreatic polypeptide in Parts B and C; and fructosamine in Part
      C only.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Part A:  Healthy male volunteers, aged 18 to 50 years (inclusive) with a body mass
             index (BMI) of 20 to 28 kg/m2 (inclusive).

          -  Part B:  Female (of non-childbearing potential) and male overweight/obese volunteers,
             aged 18 to 65 years (inclusive) with a BMI of 28 to 38 kg/m2 (inclusive).

          -  Part C:  Female (of non-childbearing potential) and male patients with a confirmed
             diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus for at least 3 months

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Part A:  Females and male volunteers who smoke and/or use other nicotine products
             within 6 months of screening are excluded.

          -  Part B:  Current or ex-smokers with a smoking history of greater than 10 pack years
             (1 pack year = 20 cigarettes smoked per day for 1 year) and any clinically
             significant abnormalities in physical examination, electrocardiogram (ECG), clinical
             chemistry, haematology, coagulation or urinalysis results at screening or on
             admission, as judged by the Investigator.

          -  Part C:  Current or ex-smokers with a smoking history of greater than 10 pack years
             (1 pack year = 20 cigarettes smoked per day for 1 year), any clinically significant
             abnormalities other than those attributed to type 2 diabetes mellitus in physical
             examination, ECG, clinical chemistry, haematology, coagulation or urinalysis results
             at screening or on admission, as judged by the Investigator, and estimated glomerular
             filtration rate &lt;40 mL*min-1*1.73m-2 calculated by the Modification of Diet in Renal
             Disease formula.
