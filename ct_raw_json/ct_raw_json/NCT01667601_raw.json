They will be randomly assigned to either the mindfulness-based\n      illness management program, conventional psychoeducation group, or usual psychiatric care.\n      The patients' mental and psychosocial functioning, insights into illness, and their\n      re-hospitalization rates will be measured at recruitment and at one week and 9 months and 18\n      months after the interventions.\n\n      Hypothesis: The patients in the psychoeducation program will report significantly greater\n      improvements in their illness insights, symptom severity and length of re-hospitalizations\n      over the 18-month follow-up, compared with those in psychoeducation group or usual care.\n\n      Conclusions: The findings will provide evidence whether the mindfulness-based illness\n      management program can improve Chinese schizophrenia sufferers' psychosocial functioning and\n      reduce their illness relapse."
