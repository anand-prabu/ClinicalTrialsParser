This is due to the chronic course of disease accompanied with\n      diarrhea, stomach pains but also with psychological stress.\n\n      It is known that physical education may improve course of disease and quality of life in a\n      multitude of diseases. These include coronary heart disease, malignancies and also\n      depression. The investigators believe that sport is as effective supportive tool in\n      improving quality of life in IBD patients. But data is lacking with regard to controlled\n      randomized clinical trials. Because of the small amount of data available the investigators\n      considered a feasibility study. Our hypothesis is that IBD patients will cope with moderate\n      exercise. The investigators further suspect that these patients improve their quality of\n      life compared with patients in the control group."
