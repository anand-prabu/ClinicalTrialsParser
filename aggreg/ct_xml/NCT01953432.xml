  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cocaine use disorders affect approximately 1.5 million Americans annually. Currently, there
      are no US Food and Drug Administration approved medications for treatment of cocaine
      dependence; however, both animal and human studies suggest that medications affecting the
      noradrenergic system can reduce cocaine craving and use. We will study the effect of
      doxazosin, an alpha-1 adrenergic antagonist, in reducing cocaine use and anxiety symptoms
      among cocaine-dependent individuals. In addition, we will identify genetic subpopulations of
      participants who preferentially respond to the medication.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The noradrenergic system, especially the alpha 1-adrenergic receptor, may play an important
      role in cocaine addiction in humans.  Doxazosin is a long-acting and selective alpha
      1-adrenergic receptor blocker, which inhibits the binding of norepinephrine to alpha
      receptors in the autonomic nervous system. This study will evaluate the efficacy of
      doxazosin in reducing cocaine-using behavior in treatment seeking cocaine-dependent
      individuals, and will guide future pharmacotherapy trials using Doxazosin or related alpha 1
      receptor antagonists for treatment of cocaine addiction. Additionally, this study will
      identify genetic subpopulations of participants for whom doxazosin is preferentially
      effective, specifically examining the R492C functional polymorphism of the ADRA1A gene.

      This 15-week double-blind, placebo controlled clinical trial will provide treatment for 100
      cocaine-dependent patients and includes a 13 week medication trial (weeks 1-13) and up to 2
      week washout period (weeks 14-15). Qualifying subjects will be randomized to receive
      Doxazosin 8 mg/day, or placebo during the study participation.

      Subjects will be receiving 2 mg study medication/placebo capsules at week 1, with 2mg/week
      induction rate for 3 weeks, according to their randomized assignments, and are maintained on
      these agents through week 13. During the course of the trial, all participants will receive
      manual-guided cognitive behavioral therapy. At the end of the study (weeks 14-15),
      participants will undergo discontinuation from active/placebo medication over a 2-week
      period. Subjects who wish to be transferred to an appropriate treatment program or
      treatment-research program will be helped with referral during the 2 week period (weeks
      14-15).

             negative pregnancy test at screening, agree to adequate contraception to prevent
             pregnancy, to have monthly pregnancy tests, and they understand the risk of fetal
             toxicity due to medication.

          -  Must be in good general health as determined by self-report and/or CPRS-based medical

          -  Motivated to discontinue or reduce cocaine use during the period of the study, as
             evidenced both by the judgment of the Investigator or designee and by the subject's
             compliance level with the requirement for attendance at clinic visits, such that
             weekly urine sample requirements for inclusion criteria are fully met.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Current diagnosis of other drug dependence, especially alcohol or benzodiazepine
             dependence, or abuse (other than cocaine, tobacco, or cannabis).

          -  Significant medical conditions (e.g., major cardiovascular, renal, endocrine, hepatic
             disorders) such as abnormal liver function (with laboratory findings of SGOT or SGPT
             greater than three times normal), hypotension or hypertension, a current cardiac
             condition, and those having a high risk of cardiovascular disease, seizure disorders,
             or another significant underlying medical condition which would contraindicate
             Doxazosin treatment.

          -  Lifetime schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or other psychotic disorders.

          -  Actively considering plans of suicidality or homicidality

          -  Subjects who are prescribed certain anti-hypertension drugs including ace inhibitors
             and alpha adrenergic blockers will be excluded because these medications may interact
             with Doxazosin's brain effects in reducing cocaine abuse.
