  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to conduct a proof of concept study in patients with probable
      Alzheimer's Disease who have mild to moderate hypertension, in order to determine if there
      is less global brain atrophy over one year, as measured by ventricular enlargement as a
      primary outcome measure, when patients are randomized to treatment with an angiotensin
      receptor blocker compared to an Angiotensin Converting Enzyme inhibitor (ACEI). This study
      uses a simple validated measure of brain atrophy as a surrogate marker in a repurposing
      effort that could recast an antihypertensive medication as a cognitive enhancer
      /neuroprotective agent and possibly as a drug of choice for Alzheimer patients and patients
      at risk for AD. If the proof of concept result is positive, a larger study would be
      warranted with potential practice-changing impact.
