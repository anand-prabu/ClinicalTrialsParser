To assess the effectiveness of a novel stepped care intervention for alcohol dependent\n           patients with co-morbid anxiety and/or depression compared to usual treatment for\n           alcohol dependence in promoting abstinence from alcohol and increased quality of life\n           and in reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression.\n\n        2. To describe important factors relating to the maintenance of alcohol-related\n           psychiatric comorbidity.\n\n      Step 1: All subjects will complete 12 weeks of pharmacotherapy (n = 120) on naltexone (50\n      mg, 1 tablet daily), acamprosate (333 mg, 2 tablets 3 times daily, reduced to 4/day for\n      women <65kg), or a combination of the two. After a 3 week stabilization period, subjects\n      will undergo complete formal assessment for anxiety and depression. Those subjects with a\n      diagnosis of anxiety or depressive disorder regardless of drinking outcome will be offered\n      the next step of care and followed up at 12-16 weeks.\n\n      Step 2: Subjects to undergo the next step of care (n = 30 per group, 60 in total) will be\n      randomized by referring to the consecutively assigned subject identification number to a\n      matched numbered envelope containing a random assignment card. Randomization will be\n      stratified according to concomitant SSRI use. The treatment groups will be:\n\n        1. Intervention for comorbid anxiety or depression, and\n\n        2. Usual counseling care."
