  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CD39 and CD73 was known protein expressed on surface of Th1 and Th17 cell and modulate
      immune related reaction. Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) can induce inflammatory reaction
      during cardiac surgery, and induce immunosuppression. In recent previous studies, CD39 and
      CD73 was known to have important role in cancer patients for inducing immunosuppressive
      reaction and consequently induce cancer cell proliferation. However, the immunosuppressive
      effect of CD39 and CD73 during CPB time was not evaluated in previous studies.

      The authors hypothesized that CD39 and CD73 would have important role in CPB induced
      immunosuppression. Therefore, the present study determined the effect of CD39 and CD73
      during CPB.

      After obtaining permission of the Institutional Review Board of Konkuk University Medical
      Center, Seoul, South Korea , patients scheduled to undergo elective cardiac surgery under
      cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) after signed written informed consent agreements and
      prospectively participate in the present study.

      All patients got a cardiac surgery under moderate hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB)
      by one cardiac surgeon. Also, 6ml of blood and 6ml of urine sample was obtained for total 8
      times in consecutive order.

        1. Before operation (pre-CPB1)

        2. Immediate after anesthesia induction (pre-CPB2)

        3. After surgeon achieved arterial and venous cannulation for CPB start (pre-CPB3)

        4. 15 minute after successful CPB weaning (post-CPB1)

        5. 3 hrs after CPB weaning (post-CPB2)

        6. 24 hrs after CPB weaning (post-CPB3)

        7. 48 hrs after CPB weaning (post-CPB4)

        8. 72 hrs after CPB weaning (post-CPB5)

      The following intraoperative exclusion criteria are applied:

        1. Emergency operation that could not obtain pre-CPB1 sample

        2. Patients who have infectious factor before operation

        3. Patients who have immunosuppressive agent for underlying disease before operation

        4. Patients who have history of cancer previously

        5. Patients who are younger than 19 years old

      Using blood and urine sample, authors examined as follows

        1. Flow cytometry for Th 17 and Th 1 cell.

        2. Immunocytochemistry for CD39, CD73.

        3. Assay for IL 1,4,6,8,10, TNF-α

        4. Other Routine Lab: Cardiac enzyme (CK-MB, TnI), ABGA, OT/PT, BUN/Cr, CBC with diff.
           count, ESR, CRP

        5. patient vital sign during operation

      Statistical analyses are conducted using SPSS 18.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). CD39 and
      CD73 are analysed used a Repeated Measures Analysis of Variance and their pairwise multiple
      comparisons are performed via the tukey method. The comparisons of the other continuous
      variables are performed by paired t or Wilcoxon Signed Rank tests. The linear regression
      analysis is used to determine possible correlation between CD39,CD73 and laboratory routine
      lab. Data are expressed as mean ± SD (95% confidence interval. CI) or median (25%-75%), and
      number of the patients. A p value less than 0.05 is considered statistically significant.
