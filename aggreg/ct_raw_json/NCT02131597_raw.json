            "textblock": "Study Drug Administration:\n\n      If participant is found to be eligible to take part in this study, they will receive\n      injections of SGI-110 under the skin 5 days every study cycle.  Each study cycle is 4-8\n      weeks depending on how participant tolerates the drug and how the disease responds to it.\n      The study staff will tell participant how often they should receive the drug.\n\n      Participant will need to stay in Houston to receive the study drug, but they may return home\n      after they have finished their dose for each cycle.  When participant has study visits where\n      they are not receiving study drug (described below), the tests performed at these visits can\n      be performed by their local doctor.  If participant's MD Anderson leukemia doctor approves,\n      their study drug can be administered outside MD Anderson by their local doctor.\n\n      Study Visits:\n\n      On Day 1 of every cycle, participant will have a physical exam.\n\n      Every week during the first cycle, and then every 2-8 weeks after that, blood (about 1/2\n      teaspoon) will be drawn for routine tests.  The study doctor will tell participant how often\n      they need to have these tests performed.\n\n      At the end of Cycle 1 and/or 2, participant will have a bone marrow aspirate to check the\n      status of the disease.  If the disease does not appear to have gotten better by the end of\n      Cycle 2, participant's next bone marrow aspirate will depend on the results of their blood\n      tests.  These samples will also be used for cytogenetic testing.  Cytogenetic testing looks\n      at how changes to cell DNA (genetic material) may affect how the disease may react to the\n      study drug.\n\n      Length of Study:\n\n      Participant will be on study for up to 24 cycles (about 2-4 years).  Participant will no\n      longer be able to receive the study drug if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side\n      effects occur, or if they are unable to follow study directions.\n\n      Patient's participation on the study will be over after the follow-up visits.\n\n      Follow-up Visits:\n\n      After participant's last dose of study drug, they will have follow-up visits. Participant\n      will only have these visits if the disease appears to have responded to the study drug.\n\n        -  Every month, blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn routine tests.  This can be done\n           in or near participant's hometown through their local cancer doctor.\n\n        -  Every 6 months, participant will return to Houston for a physical exam and blood (about\n           1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests.\n\n      This is an investigational study.  SGI-100 is not FDA approved or commercially available.\n      It is currently being used for research purposes only.\n\n      The study doctor can explain how the study drug are designed to work.\n\n      Up to 100 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson."
