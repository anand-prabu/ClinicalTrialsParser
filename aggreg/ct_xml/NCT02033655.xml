      The purpose of the trial is to assess the effects of combining regular, generous intakes of
      high quality protein (primarily from lean pork and other animal source proteins) with
      calorie restriction on functional status and lean muscle mass in frail, obese, women who
      participate in a 6 month intervention.

    <textblock>
      Assess the effects of combining regular, generous intakes of high quality protein (primarily
      from lean pork and other animal source proteins) with calorie restriction on functional
      status and lean muscle mass in frail, obese, women who participate in a 6 month
      intervention. Participants will be randomized into one of two study arms: Weight Loss
      Control (n = 20) subjects follow a calorie-reduced diet for a weight loss or ≥10%; or Weight
      Loss-High Protein: (n = 40) subjects follow a calorie-reduction diet for a weight loss of
      ≥10%, with a high proportion of high quality protein at each meal. Intakes of &gt; 30g of high
      quality protein will be achieved three times a day by subjects in this group, predominantly
      all from animal sources and 60-70% of animal protein from pork. Subject criteria will
      include obese (&gt;30 kg/m2) women (≥ 45 yrs.) with mild to moderate functional impairment (by
      Short Physical Performance Battery; SPPB score &gt;/= 4. This is a randomized clinical trial
      with repeated measurements, with the purpose of assessing change over time for the overall
      sample and the difference in the High Protein group relative to the Control group with
      regards to primary outcomes (function and lean body mass). The statistical analyses will
      proceed chronologically in 3 phases: 1) descriptive analyses that will summarize the
      distribution of the covariates and dependent variables, 2) bivariate analyses of the
      association between group membership and the outcome measures, and 3) controlled
      multivariable analyses, which assess the association between experimental group and the
      outcomes, controlling for the important covariates.
