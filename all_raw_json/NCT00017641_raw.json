Leukapheresis continues\n      daily until target number of cells is harvested.  CD 34+ cells are isolated from peripheral\n      blood stem cells (PBSC) in vitro.\n\n      Patients then receive cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on days -5 to -2, anti-thymocyte\n      globulin IV over 10 hours on days -4 to -2, and G-CSF SC beginning on day 0 and continuing\n      until blood counts recover.  Patients undergo reinfusion of CD34+ PBSC on day 0.\n\n      Patients are followed weekly for 90 days, monthly for 1 year, and at 2 years."
