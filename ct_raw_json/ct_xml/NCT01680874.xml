  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a probiotic, when used together with
      standard treatment, is effective in reducing duration of symptoms and preventing recurrence
      of infection in older adults with a first episode of C. difficile infection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Probiotics are live microorganisms that are available over the counter, widely used as
      dietary supplements or nutritional foods, and represent a low-cost, well tolerated, safe,
      non-antibiotic based strategy that may have efficacy as adjunctive treatment of infections
      without the attendant risks of promoting antimicrobial resistance. Certain probiotics have
      demonstrated inhibition of adherence of pathogenic bacteria and stimulation of systemic
      immune functions, possibly enhancing the body's ability to eradicate C. difficile in the
      gastrointestinal tract. However, limited data is available on the efficacy of probiotics for
      ameliorating C. difficile symptoms and reducing recurrence of C. difficile infection (CDI).
      The investigators propose a pilot randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical
      trial in older adult inpatients with a first episode of CDI to evaluate the efficacy of a
      probiotic combination, in conjunction with standard treatment, for reducing duration of
      diarrhea and recurrence of CDI.

    <description>This arm will receive a probiotic combination which will consist of equal amounts of Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM® (ATCC 700396), Lactobacillus paracasei Lpc-37 (ATCC SD5275), Bifidobacterium lactis Bi-07 (ATCC SC5220), and Bifidobacterium lactis Bl-04 (ATCC SD5219).
The probiotic will be taken orally, once a week, for 4 weeks.</description>

    <description>The intervention will consist of the subject taking the study medication once a day for 4 weeks. During hospitalization, patients will be followed daily for diarrhea history, record of concomitant medications, adverse effects (AEs), and their response to treatment using a stool diary. Upon discharge from the hospital, patients will be contacted through weekly phone calls to assess diarrhea history, record of concomitant medications, adverse effects (AEs), and their response to treatment using a stool diary. At weeks 4 and 8, a stool sample will be collected, and the stool diary will be reviewed.</description>
