  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of a specifically designed ankle foot
      orthosis (AFO, hinged, with Tamarack joint and adjustable check strap) on the spatial and
      temporal gait parameters, electromyography (EMG) and walking endurance, in select
      individuals living with Parkinson's disease.
