This intervention, which is supposed to\n      simulate walking on natural, uneven surfaces, is compared to a conventional treadmill\n      training.\n\n      Hypothesis: Sensorimotor treadmill training leads to larger improvements in walking and\n      balance abilities as compared to conventional treadmill exercise."
