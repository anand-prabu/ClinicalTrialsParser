No warm up was undertaken for this method as it was a walking exercise test and the risk of injury was minimised with use of the harnessed treadmill."

            "textblock": "Exercise is a cornerstone of pulmonary rehabilitation in the treatment of Chronic\n      Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). Although researchers have shown numerous benefits with\n      exercise in COPD patients, most studies have only looked at exercise tolerance and\n      psychological outcomes following training. COPD is characterised by persistent inflammation\n      that can cause progressive decline in lung function and multisystemic complications. This\n      inflammation can be amplified in patients when they suffer acute exacerbations. There is a\n      wellknown relationship between exercise, immune function and risk of infection. Exercise has\n      also been shown to have an antiinflammatory effect when performed regularly. There is a lack\n      of research looking into the inflammatory or immune response to exercise in patients with\n      COPD. The exercise within this study will be individually tailored to patients with COPD\n      based on their validated 6 minute walk test (6MWT) but the protocol will involve interval\n      exercise that has been used previously. This type of exercise is considered most appropriate\n      for research into mechanisms of benefit because it maintains the exercise training effects\n      of other modalities (e.g. continuous low intensity aerobic exercise) while avoiding the\n      occurrence of limitations to exercise in people with lung problems (e.g. dynamic\n      hyperinflation). It also closely mirrors daily activity of someone with COPD.\n\n      The investigators want to explore the effects of exercise specifically on immune function in\n      15 people COPD and compare any changes to 15 Controls. By better understanding the\n      mechanisms of how exercise affects inflammation, the investigators could eventually design\n      better Pulmonary Rehabilitation interventions, especially for those most at risk."
