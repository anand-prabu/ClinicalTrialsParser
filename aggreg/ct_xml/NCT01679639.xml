    <textblock>
      This open-label, fixed-sequence, three-period, single group study will evaluate the effects
      of rifampicin on the pharmacokinetics of aleglitazar in healthy volunteers. Volunteers will
      receive single doses of aleglitazar in all three periods and single doses of rifampicin in
      periods 1 and 2, and multiple doses in period 3. The anticipated time on study treatment is
      up to 14 weeks.
