            "textblock": "It is estimated that around 50 000 women die every year due to consequences of unsafe\n      abortion (Singh et al, 2009). A majority of these deaths occur in low-income countries where\n      access to safe abortion care is limited. Unplanned pregnancy and unsafe abortion thus place\n      a huge burden on scarce medical resources. Any improvement in Comprehensive Abortion Care\n      (CAC) would mean important improvements for the concerned women and their families (Singh,\n      2006) as well as for the societies at large. Recommended improvements concern increased\n      access to the safest and most cost-effective methods such as medical abortion provided at\n      primary level facilities (Singh et al, 2009). A Cochrane Review concludes that most\n      randomised controlled trials within the field of medical abortion are conducted in\n      high-income settings with good access to emergency health care services (Kulier et al,\n      2004). A simplified regime for medical abortion, which could be used at primary level\n      facilities, would contribute to the reduction of maternal mortality and morbidity related to\n      unsafe abortions globally. However, there is a knowledge gap in order to determine if a\n      simplified follow up of medical abortion is equally effective as the standard procedure in a\n      low-income setting. The results will provide evidence-based information to be used in\n      revising training and service delivery guidelines' in order to reduce maternal mortality and\n      morbidity in both low and high-income setting."
