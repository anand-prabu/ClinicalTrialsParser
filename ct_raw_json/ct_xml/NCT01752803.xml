      Background: The connection between gut health and diabetes status is increasingly
      recognized. Gut microbiota composition in diabetic differs from non-diabetic individuals.
      Interestingly, the level of glucose tolerance was associated with specific microbiota that
      was rarely found in healthy individuals. Probiotics is one of the functional foods believed
      to mediate their health promoting activities through modulating the composition of the gut
      health. Ingestion of probiotics has been shown not only to influence gut microbiota
      composition but also the secretion of the gut hormones and insulin resistance in animal
      models with limited trials in human. Supplementation with probiotic has also been shown not
      only affect glucose homeostasis, but improved other diabetes related comorbidities such as
      obesity, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia.

      Objectives and hypotheses: To address this research gap, this Randomized Controlled Trial
      (RCT) is proposed to determine the efficacy of probiotic supplementations as adjuvant
      therapy to improve glucose homeostasis through modulating gut microbiota composition and gut
      hormones secretion in individuals with type 2 diabetes. We hypothesized that the probiotic
      supplementations will improve blood glucose control as well as other diabetes related
      co-morbidities in individuals with type 2 diabetes.

      Methodology: This is a double blind randomized parallel group control trial with 3 months
      probiotic supplementation or placebo. After screening the eligible subjects will be
      selected. Then, after consent taking, subjects will be randomly assigned to either receive
      probiotic or supplement for 3 months. Measurements of blood parameters including glycemic
      control related parameters, lipid profile, renal profile, and liver function tests as well
      as three day diet recall, and anthropometry measurements will take place at baseline, after
      6 weeks and after 12 months.

      Expected Outcomes: Probiotic supplementation as an adjuvant therapy would improve glucose
      homeostasis and gut health as compared to the placebo and eventually will beneficially
      affect other diabetes related conditions. This study would provide avenue to identify the
      possibility of probiotic supplementations as an adjuvant therapy in the management of type 2
      diabetes.
