It appears\n      that AC and SCC of the cervix behave differently. They are different in epidemiology,\n      prognostic factors, and patterns of failure after similar treatments. Available data suggest\n      that they may also differ in their response to treatment. We postulate that new treatment\n      strategies specifically tailored to AC should be explored.\n\n      However, there is few data about outcome of cervical cancer in Taiwan. So we propose this\n      proposal for retrospective analysis of clinicopathological parameters and outcomes in\n      patients of cervical cancer, especially for cervical adenocarcinoma and adenosquamous\n      carcinoma."
