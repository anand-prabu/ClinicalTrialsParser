On average, someone suffers from stroke in United States every 40th second. Stroke\n      recurs in 1 out of 4 stroke patients. About 87% of the strokes are as a result of ischemic\n      insult. The total economic burden from stroke accounts to 38.6 billion dollars per year.\n      Stroke is also one of the leading causes of long term disability. Current stroke therapies\n      concentrate mainly on acute revascularization, sub-acute rehabilitation and secondary\n      prevention.\n\n      Neuroprotection is not the mainstay of treatment modality as there are no effective regimen\n      which has satisfied stroke clinicians and researchers. Many neuroprotection agents have\n      shown excellent pre-clinical results but have failed in clinical translation. Thus we need\n      to find new treatments in order to decrease the mortality and morbidity caused by stroke.\n\n      The investigators hypothesize that adopting a narrower therapeutic window, with treatment\n      initiation in the first six hours, may demonstrate a positive or significant short and long\n      term neuroprotective effect from NMDA/Glutaminergic or histaminergic antagonism when\n      compared with standard of care."
