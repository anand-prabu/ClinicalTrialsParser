  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute normovolemic hemodilution (ANH) is part of our current protocol to decrease
      post-operative bleeding and homologous blood transfusions post cardiopulmonary bypass. Blood
      is drawn from our patients pre-bypass after obtaining the arterial line and administered
      back to the patient after separation from cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and reversal of
      heparin with protamine. In our practice we noticed some variability in the impact of ANH on
      postoperative bleeding; with some patients appearing to show more hemostasis after
      separation from CPB than others. This is a prospective study to find out if there is an
      optimal time period that guarantees the largest amount of functioning platelets and what is
      the best practice for drawing and storing of ANH to guarantee the largest amount of
      functioning platelets.
