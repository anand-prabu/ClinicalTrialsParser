The in-office sessions are devoted to psychoeducation, cognitive therapy, and hierarchy development. These sessions will include all procedures of the standard therapist-delivered CBT but will be parent-led, therapist guided; thus, the parent is delivering evidence-based strategies with clinician guidance.\nChildren are then \"stepped up\" to Step Two of SC-CBT if it is determined that  more therapy is needed following the post assessment.  Step Two is a continuation of therapy and will include 9 additional in-office weekly session lasting 1 hour each over 9 weeks. These sessions will be therapist-led and are devoted to exposure and response prevention."

The investigators are testing a\n      Stepped-Care Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (SC-CBT) approach in which children receive a full\n      course of parent-led, therapist-guided treatment for OCD.  The goal is to see if therapy can\n      be done in fewer visits to the clinic. Children receiving SC-CBT will start with Step One,\n      which includes three therapy sessions over six weeks. Those who do not get better in Step\n      One will \"STEP UP\" to Step Two which involves coming in to meet with a therapist for the\n      remaining sessions. Youth receiving SC-CBT will be compared to youth receiving standard CBT\n      in the clinic through this study. It is expected that Stepped Care will be an acceptable,\n      cost-effect, and feasible treatment with outcomes similar to standard CBT."
