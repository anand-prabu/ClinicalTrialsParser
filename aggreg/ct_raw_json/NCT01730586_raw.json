If at any point the scans show the disease appearing to get better, you will\n      have another scan 2 cycles later.\n\n      Length of Treatment:\n\n      You may continue taking the study drug for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best\n      interest.  You will no longer be able to take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if\n      you have intolerable side effects, if the study is stopped, or if you are unable to follow\n      study instructions.\n\n      Your participation on the study will be over after the follow-up period.\n\n      End-of-Treatment Visit:\n\n      Within 10 days after you stop taking the study drug, you will have an end-of-treatment\n      visit.  At this visit, the following tests and procedures will be performed:\n\n        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and blood pressure.\n\n        -  You will be asked about any drugs you may be taking and about any symptoms or side\n           effects you may be having.\n\n        -  Your performance status will be recorded.\n\n        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.\n\n        -  If one has not been performed in the previous 4 weeks, you will have a CT or MRI scan\n           of your chest, abdomen, and pelvis to check the status of the disease.\n\n      Follow-Up:\n\n      The study staff will ask about any symptoms or side effects you may be having during the 30\n      days after your last dose of the study drugs.  The study staff may ask you by phone or at\n      the time of a routine clinic visit.  If the study staff contacts you by phone, the phone\n      call should last about 15-30 minutes.\n\n      If you leave the study for any reason other than the disease getting worse, you will have a\n      CT or MRI scan of your chest, abdomen, and pelvis to check the status of the disease every\n      12 weeks unless you start receiving other treatment.\n\n      The study staff will also review your medical records and/or contact you to check the status\n      of the disease every 3 months after you stop receiving the study drug.  If you are contacted\n      by phone, each phone call should take about 5 minutes.\n\n      This is an investigational study.  Abraxane is FDA approved and commercially available for\n      the treatment of breast cancer.  It is not FDA approved for the treatment of colorectal or\n      small bowel cancer.  The use of abraxane in patients with colorectal cancer or small bowel\n      cancer is investigational.\n\n      Up to 35 patients will take part in this study.  All will be enrolled at MD Anderson."
