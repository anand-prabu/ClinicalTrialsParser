Stress and an individual's biological response to it are significant\n      predictors of relapse. Thus, interventions that decrease stress and normalize an\n      individual's biological response to stress are desperately needed. Exercise decreases stress\n      and improves the body's regulation of stress. The proposed project will utilize exercise as\n      a novel relapse prevention intervention with individuals who have recently completed\n      inpatient SUD treatment. This project will evaluate the efficacy of a motivational\n      intervention for exercise in a randomized clinical trial of 150 SUD patients beginning\n      Aftercare treatment at the VA St. Louis Health Care System. Participants will be randomized\n      to one of two interventions: (1) standard care (SC), or (2) standard care plus a\n      motivational intervention targeting exercise that lasts for six months. Participants are\n      followed every three months for one year. Results from this study will advance exercise as a\n      new strategy for enhancing stress regulation and prevention of relapse in SUD populations."
