            "textblock": "Nasal Potential Difference (NPD) measurements will be conducted on participants. The NPD\n      measurement, is a bioelectric assay of CFTR-dependent ion transport that has been used in a\n      variety of protocols designed to detect CFTR function. A 4-Step protocol will be utilized.\n      The nasal cavities will be perfused in a step-wise fashion with the following solutions: 1)\n      Ringer's solution, 2) Ringer's solution + amiloride 100\u03bcM, 3) Low-Cl--containing solution,\n      and 4) Low-Cl- + isoproterenol (10 \u00b5M).  The potential difference will be monitored in nasal\n      epithelium in comparison to an agar filled reference butterfly electrode placed in the volar\n      aspect of the forearm, and connected via a calomel cell to a high impedance voltmeter.\n\n      Following placement of the subcutaneous reference bridge, the nasal probe will be secured\n      1-3 cm within the inferior meatus and secured in position at the most polarizing position.\n      Each nare will then be sequentially perfused with Ringer solution. All nasal potential\n      difference tracings will be scored independently by a single reviewer.\n\n      The investigator and an internal committee comprised of Gregory Fleming James Associate\n      Scientists will oversee the safety of the study. Our internal committee is a\n      multidisciplinary group consisting of physician and subspecialists who, collectively, have\n      experience in treatment patients with cystic fibrosis and other airway disease in the\n      conduct of randomized clinical trials. The primary responsibility of this committee is to\n      protect the safety and welfare of subjects consenting to the investigator's procurement of\n      remnant tissue during endoscopic sinus procedure. Members are responsible for reviewing\n      procedural conduct, including acquisition of consents and materials, to protect patient\n      well-being. An interim data safety review will be conducted on a yearly basis. The committee\n      will consist of at least 3 members with clinical trials experience in airway diseases.\n      During annual review, issues relating to the safety and process for acquiring human tissues\n      will be reviewed. Summary reports from each annual meeting will be prepared and will address\n      concerns about the procurement of tissue or any other information deemed pertinent to the\n      review."

Discolored nasal drainage arising from the nasal passages, nasal polyps, or polypoid\n             swelling as identified on physical examination with nasal endoscopy.\n\n          2. Edema or erythema of the middle meatus or ethmoid bulla\n\n          3. Generalized or localized erythema or edema. If it does not involve the middle meatus\n             or ethmoid bulla, CT scan is performed to confirm a diagnosis.\n\n          4. The CT scan must demonstrate isolated or diffuse mucosal thickening, bone changes,\n             air-fluid levels. b. Age \u2265 19 years and Weight \u2265 50 kg c. Ability to perform NPD\n             testing d. Negative pregnancy test (for females of childbearing potential) e. Written\n             informed consent\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          1. Acute illness within 2 weeks before start of study treatment.\n\n          2. History of major asthma attack within 2 months prior to start of study treatment.\n\n          3. Change in intranasal medications (including use of corticosteroids, cromolyn,\n             atrovent, phenylephrine, or oxymetazoline) within 14 days prior to start of study\n             treatment.\n\n          4. Positive hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C antibody test, or human\n             immunodeficiency virus (HIV) test.\n\n          5. Hemoglobin <10 gm/dL and Serum albumin <2.5 g/dL.\n\n          6. Abnormal liver function (serum ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, or total bilirubin >2\n             times upper limit of normal).\n\n          7. Abnormal renal function (serum creatinine >1.5 times upper limit of normal).\n\n          8. Pregnancy or breast feeding.\n\n          9.
