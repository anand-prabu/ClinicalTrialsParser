    <textblock>
      This pilot phase II trial studies how well EF5 works in measuring lack of tumor oxygen,
      hypoxia, in patients with stage I-III non-small cell lung cancer. EF5 may be effective in
      measuring the lack of oxygen in lung tumors and may allow doctors to plan better treatment.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the frequency and degree of hypoxia as measured by EF5 binding in patients with
      non-small cell lung cancer.

      II. Correlate hypoxia as measured by EF5 binding with potential serum/plasma markers of
      hypoxia in patients with non-small cell lung cancer.

      III. Correlate hypoxia as measured by EF5 binding with tissue markers of hypoxia in patients
      with non-small cell lung cancer.

      IV. Correlate hypoxia as measured by EF5 binding with tumor angiogenesis in patients with
      non-small cell lung cancer.

      V. Correlated hypoxia as measured by EF5 binding with apoptosis in patients with non-small
      cell lung cancer.

      VI. Measure and characterize tumor perfusion in relationship to hypoxia in patients with
      non-small cell lung cancer.

      VII. Correlate tumor perfusion to microvessel density in tumor samples in patients with
      non-small cell lung cancer.

      VIII. Determine the longevity of EF5 adducts in human lung tumors.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive EF5 intravenously (IV) over 1-2.5 hours. Beginning 24-55 hours later,
      patients undergo tumor hypoxia measurement using a polarographic needle electrode and
      intraoperative tumor measurement before undergoing surgical biopsy or resection.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4-6 weeks.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Known or suspected non-small cell lung cancer; patients without histologically or
             cytologically documented non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) must be estimated by
             their physician to have at least 75% probability of having NSCLC; the probability of
             malignancy will be predicted on the basis of known probabilities of individual
             clinical characteristics using a Bayesian model

          -  Clinical or pathologic stage I to III; patients in whom pre-surgical staging has not
             definitively establish stage IV disease are eligible

          -  Tumor mass at least 1.5 cm in maximum diameter must be present on computed tomography
             (CT) scan and must be included in the planned surgical biopsy or resection

          -  Patient must be planning to undergo a surgical staging or treatment procedure
             (including mediastinoscopy, wedge resection, lobectomy, or pneumonectomy) and have
             the clinical and physiological status appropriate for this procedure

          -  Performance status 0-2

          -  Bilirubin within normal limits

          -  Creatinine within normal limits or, if elevated, a creatinine clearance of at least
             60 mL/min/m^2 (EF5 is primarily excreted via the kidney)

          -  White blood cell (WBC) &gt; 2000/mm^3

          -  Platelets &gt; 100,000/mm^3

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnancy or breast feeding; a negative serum pregnancy test is required of any woman
             of childbearing potential prior to enrollment; pregnant women are excluded from this
             study; breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with EF5

          -  Allergy to IV contrast dye

          -  History of grade III or IV peripheral neuropathy as defined by the National Cancer
             Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria (CTC)
