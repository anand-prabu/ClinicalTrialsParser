In some cases,\n      the etiologic investigation of patients with non-systematized and chronic musculoskeletal\n      pain can not highlight any organic cause. Several studies have shown a link between these\n      symptoms and vitamin D deficiency, characterized by a blood level of 25 (OH) vitamin D <\n      20.8ng/ml. This deficit is easy to identify and to correct through proper vitamin D\n      supplementation with few side effects. Nevertheless, it remains unknown and vitamin D\n      deficiency is rarely considered as a possible etiology in patients with chronic pain. We\n      hypothesize that vitamin D supplementation in patients with non-systematized musculoskeletal\n      pain and deficient in vitamin D could improve painful symptoms. We aim to perform a\n      double-blind randomized controlled trial, vitamin D versus placebo, to assess the pain\n      improvement after vitamin D supplementation."
