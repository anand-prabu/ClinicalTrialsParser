Evaluate the response rate and duration of response to etoposide,\n      mitoxantrone, and prednimustine in patients with relapsed HIV-associated non-Hodgkin's\n      lymphoma (NHL). II. Evaluate the response rate and duration of response to cyclophosphamide,\n      doxorubicin, and etoposide in patients with refractory HIV-associated NHL. III. Assess the\n      toxic effects of these regimens in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients with relapsed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) receive oral etoposide and\n      prednimustine on days 1-5 and intravenous mitoxantrone on day 1 every 3 weeks. Patients with\n      refractory NHL receive cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and etoposide as a continuous infusion\n      over 4 days every 4 weeks. All patients receive concomitant antiretroviral therapy with\n      zidovudine or didanosine. G-CSF is given for hematologic support as indicated. All patients\n      are evaluated for response after 2 courses of chemotherapy. Patients with a complete\n      response (CR) receive 2 additional courses. Patients with a stable or partial response\n      receive 2 additional courses and are re-evaluated; those with a CR receive 2 more courses,\n      while those with a stable or partial response are treated off study at the physician's\n      discretion. Patients with progressive disease are removed from study.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 15-20 patients will be treated on each regimen."
