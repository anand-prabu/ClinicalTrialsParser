To determine whether there is an effect on plasma drug\n      levels of azithromycin and rifabutin as measured by changes in the plasma concentration-time\n      curve (AUC) when these drugs are taken concomitantly.\n\n      ORIGINAL PRIMARY: To gain preliminary information about the safety and tolerance of\n      clarithromycin and azithromycin in combination with rifabutin (three potential agents\n      against Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare) in HIV-infected patients with CD4 counts < 200\n      cells/mm3.\n\n      ORIGINAL SECONDARY: To determine whether there is an effect on the pharmacokinetics of the\n      macrolide antibiotics or rifabutin when these drugs are taken concomitantly. To monitor the\n      effect of rifabutin therapy on dapsone serum levels in patients taking dapsone for PCP\n      prophylaxis. To monitor the effect of macrolide/rifabutin combination therapies on AZT or\n      ddI serum levels.\n\n      Two new macrolide antibiotics, clarithromycin and azithromycin, and rifabutin (a rifamycin\n      derivative) have all demonstrated in vitro and in vivo activity against Mycobacterium\n      avium-intracellulare, a common systemic bacterial infection complicating AIDS.

Patients are followed weekly.\n      Pharmacokinetic sampling will be performed on days 14, 15, and 42-45.\n\n      ORIGINAL: Sixty-eight patients are randomly assigned to one of four groups (17 patients per\n      group). They receive either clarithromycin or azithromycin in combination with rifabutin on\n      one of two different dosing schedules. Patients receive medication for 6 weeks and undergo\n      follow-up weekly during drug administration and at week 8."
