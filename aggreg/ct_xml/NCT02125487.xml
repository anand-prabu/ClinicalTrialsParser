      The purpose of this study is to determine whether breast simulation jackets are more
      effective in teaching CBE technique and culturally sensitive doctor-patient communication
      skills to medical students than the traditional method.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is a Lebanese national problem.  Campaigns for mammography screening are
      effective but recommendations on breast examinations screening for breast tumors are
      lacking. On one hand, the Lebanese population is a culturally diverse one with women's
      beliefs ranging from liberal to extremely conservative. On the other hand,
      physicians-in-training learn Clinical Breast Examinations (CBEs) in a non-standardized
      method and randomly when real patients are available and are willing to be examined by
      students. There is no research on breast cancer screening through physical examination
      (self-examination or by a trained health care worker) in Lebanon. In addition, little is
      known about how religious beliefs and other cultural factors could affect rates and efficacy
      of breast examination in detection of cancerous lesions.

      In this project, we focus on the need for an effective and culturally sensitive method for
      teaching CBE to physicians-in-training. The proposed teaching methods is this study is
      standardized with double simulation meaning that it is a teaching method that is repeated in
      a similar manner with all students where they learn physical examination of the breast using
      both artificial breast models (simulators) and trained fake patients/actors (standardized
      patients). We hypothesize the efficacy of such standardized teaching method in making
      medical students more aware of, and apt to deal with, cultural differences related to breast
      examination. In order to do so, we will evaluate medical students' performance and examine
      their attitudes and cultural competencies when they perform CBEs on 3 culturally different
      standardized patients using breast simulators. Through an experimental design that minimizes
      biases related to selection of students (randomized controlled), we will compare double
      simulation (intervention) with single simulation (control) in teaching CBE i.e. a
      standardized patient wearing breast simulation jacket versus a single breast silicone model
      without any actors. Medicine-III students rotating in the Obstetrics and Gynecology
      department will be asked to participate; they are free to refuse without any effect on their
      grades in the rotation. The students will be assessed in an Objective Structured Clinical
      Examination (OSCE) setting similar to their usual oral clinical exams but not contributory
      to their academic evaluation in the Faculty of Medicine. The OSCE setting will include
      encounters with 3 culturally different Standardized Patients (1 &quot;outgoing&quot; patient, 1 with
      &quot;chador&quot;, and 1 moderately conservative). The assessment tools include both objective and
      self-reporting questionnaires about (1) met learning objectives, (2) student attitude, (3)
      and clinical cultural competency.
