      Objectives: Main objective: to assess the impact of an intervention for optimizing the
      dosing of colistin based on its plasma levels in patients with infections due to multi-drug
      resistant gram negative bacilli. The impact will be evaluated in terms of clinical and
      microbiological outcome, and toxicity.

      Secondary objectives:

        1. To determine the percentage of patients reaching plasma levels considered adequate
           (Cmax / MIC 8-10) for the treatment of infections due to gram-negative bacilli
           susceptible to colistin, in the cohort of patients treated with standard doses of this
           drug without adjusting the dose.

        2. To analyze the possible emergence of bacterial resistance to this drug and its
           relationship to the calculated colistin pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic indexes.

      Methods:

      Design: open controlled trial, blinded for the analyst, to be performed at thre tertiary
      care Hospitals in Barcelona.

      Subjects: Patients attended consecutively between 2012 and 2013 infected with multi-drug
      resistant gram negative bacilli and treated with colistin.

      Sample size: 142 cases. Intervention: Once detected the infection requiring treatment with
      colistin, patients will be randomized to receive the intervention or not, with a 1:1 ratio.
      The intervention will be performed by an Infectious Diseases physician and will consist in a
      recommendation on the dose of colistin based on its plasma levels 48 hours after treatment
      onset.

      Variables:  peak and through colistin levels 48 hours after treatment onset, clinical,
      analytical and microbiological data at baseline and during follow-up of the patients.

      Outcome measures: clinical, microbiological and toxicity data. Analysis: Comparison of
      patient characteristics and outcome variables between patients who had received the
      intervention and those who had not. The analysis will be done by intention to treat, by
      biological effectiveness and by compliance with the protocol.
