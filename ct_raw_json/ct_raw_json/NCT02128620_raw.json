This methodology consist on the redirection of the\n      users to two different versions of the website, and therefore allows to assess the\n      interactivity of the users according to the design of the webpage and determine which one\n      has a higher impact on the clinical settings, and consequently on prevention of STDs.\n\n      For the A/B test we will test the interactivity of two versions of a web page\n      www.sjekkdeg.no: the A version (control), consisting en the educative web app; and the B\n      version, consisting in the web app www.sjekkdeg.no including the Game-Based Appointment\n      System.\n\n      The Game-Based Appointment System will offer the users the option of booking appointments at\n      the venereology department at the University Hospital of North Norway. The system will\n      include an automatic priority appointments function, with three levels of prioritization\n      (triage): 1) Emergency-appointment: The user should go to the doctor on the same day or the\n      following day. 2) Haste-appointment: Within 3-4 days; or 3) Routine-appointment: within 2-3\n      weeks.\n\n      The hypotheses of this research project are:\n\n        1. The number of visits with the health professionals will be larger in the game-based\n           appointment group than in the control group.\n\n        2. The number of visits to the educative components of www.sjekkdeg.no will increase after\n           the launch of the Game-Based Appointment System functionality.\n\n        3. The number of visits to the educative components of www.sjekkdeg.no will be larger in\n           the appointment group than in the control group.\n\n        4. The time spent per visit to the website will be larger in the appointment group than in\n           the control group, meaning a higher exposure to health information.\n\n        5. The visitors returning rate is larger in the appointment group than in the control\n           group."

Early triage of health\n      service consumers is now more and more used as an effective way to reduce expenses and the\n      use of healthcare staff resources.\n\n      - Environmental perspectives: The project will provide a health related social network aimed\n      at empowering the citizens to better understand and prevent sexually transmitted diseases,\n      therefore minimizing the number of travels to visit the doctor at the healthcare service.\n\n      - Ethical aspects: The research activities will strictly follow the regulations provided by\n      the Health Register Act (Helseregisterloven) and the Health Personnel Act\n      (Helsepersonelloven). Both acts (with accompanying regulations) being supervised by the\n      Ministry of Health and the Norwegian Board of Health. To guarantee approval regarding any\n      possible use of data in a personal way, this project will pursue conformance to the\n      regulations of the Personal Data Act (based on the European Data Protection Directive). The\n      Personal Data act and other relevant acts and regulations are enforced and supervised by the\n      Norwegian Data Inspectorate (Datatilsynet).\n\n      - Gender equality and gender perspectives: The planning of the this research project has\n      stressed that the selection of participants and the conduct of the trial will all be\n      gender-neutral."
