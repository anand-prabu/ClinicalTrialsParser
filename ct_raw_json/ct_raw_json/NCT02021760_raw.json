At least one of these conditioning cycles is performed before PCI is initiated. If time allows, cycles of remote conditioning (5 min leg ischemia and 5 min reperfusion) are repeated until PCI is performed. Following reperfusion, defined as first balloon inflation, four additional cycles of remote conditioning will be performed."
