    <textblock>
      This is a study of ruxolitinib in combination with gemcitabine with or without
      nab-paclitaxel to patients with advanced solid tumors that has two parts.

      Part 1 of the study will evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) of
      ruxolitinib when given as described to patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors.  A
      goal of Part 1 will be to identify the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of ruxolitinib when
      given with gemcitabine with or without nab-paclitaxel that will be used in Part 2 of the
      study.

      Part 2 of the study will further explore the safety, tolerability, PK, and preliminary
      clinical activity of ruxolitinib at the dose identified in Part 1, in combination with
      gemcitabine with or without nab-paclitaxel in subjects with advanced or metastatic
      pancreatic cancer.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female, 18 years or older

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed solid tumor (Part 1) or  pancreatic cancer
             (Part 2)

          -  ECOG performance status ≤ 1

          -  Received no more than 1 prior chemotherapy regimen for advanced or metastatic disease
             (not including neo-adjuvant and/or adjuvant therapy. There is no restriction on the
             number of prior non-myelosuppressive targeted therapies or hormonal agents (eg, EGFR
             targeted therapy for lung cancer and hormonal therapy for breast cancer or ovarian
             cancer); targeted and/or hormonal therapy alone will not be considered chemotherapy
             for the purposes of this study.

          -  Adequate renal, hepatic, and bone marrow function without blood product or
             hematopoietic growth factor support:

          -  Able to swallow and retain oral medication

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any known contraindications to the use of gemcitabine (for enrollment in Regimen A or
             B) or nab-paclitaxel (for enrollment into Regimen B).

          -  Evidence of uncontrolled brain metastases or history of uncontrolled seizures.

          -  Ongoing radiation therapy and/or radiation therapy administered within 28 days of
             enrollment.  Subjects who have received radiation to the spine, pelvis, ribs, or
             femur should be discussed with the sponsor, as extensive radiation to marrow forming
             region may compromise a subject's ability to tolerate myelosuppressive chemotherapy.
             Subjects who have ongoing radiotherapy-related toxicities are not eligible.

          -  Subjects who participated in any other study in which receipt of an investigational
             study drug occurred within 28 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to
             first dose.

          -  Current or previous other malignancy within 2 years of study entry, except cured
             basal or squamous cell skin cancer, superficial bladder cancer, carcinoma in situ of
             the cervix, or other noninvasive malignancy without sponsor approval.

          -  Inability to swallow food or any condition of the upper GI tract that precludes
             administration of oral medications.

          -  Recent (≤ 3 months) history of partial or complete bowel obstruction.

          -  Unwilling to be transfused with blood components.

          -  Known history of Hepatitis B or C infection or HIV infection.

          -  Presence of ≥ Grade 2 neuropathy
