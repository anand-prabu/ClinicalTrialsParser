        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female subjects, ages 6 through 11 years, are experiencing the common cold,
             but are otherwise healthy.

          2. Subjects have an onset of cold symptoms within the past 2.5 days before screening and
             are experiencing self-reported nasal congestion of at least stuffy severity (score =
             3 or 4).

          3. Subjects have at least two of the following additional symptoms due to common cold:
             runny nose, sneezing, sore throat, headache, body achiness, and cough, as deemed by
             the parent.

          4. Subjects can swallow oral tablets without chewing them (based on a pretest of
             successfully swallowing a placebo tablet at screening)

          5. Findings from the medical history review and vital signs are within the range of
             clinical acceptability, as determined by the investigator.

          6. Subject and legally authorized representative are likely to be compliant and complete
             the study.

          7. Subject's legally authorized representative has signed and dated the informed consent
             form.  Subject has given verbal assent, and has signed and dated the informed assent
             form.

          8. Female subjects who have reached menarche must have a negative urine pregnancy test
             at screening.  These subjects must have practiced abstinence for at least three
             months prior to study entry and for the duration of the study. A second pregnancy
             test will be given when the subject returns to the clinic after the last dose.

          9. Subject and legally authorized representative can read and understand English.

         10. Subject's legally authorized representative who signs informed consent is available
             to administer all assessments and study medication on days 1 and 2.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Have any of the following medical conditions: heart disease, high blood pressure,
             thyroid disease, diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, increased intraocular
             pressure, prostatic hypertrophy

          2. Are under treatment for a hyperexcitability disorder with a medication regimen that
             has not been stable for at least 3 months

          3. Are currently experiencing an asthmatic episode

          4. Are experiencing symptoms of seasonal or perennial allergic rhinitis

          5. Are currently or within the last 24 hours having symptoms of vomiting or diarrhea

          6. Have been exposed to immediate family members with the flu within the past week

          7. Are exhibiting signs or symptoms of, or diagnosed with sinusitis, pneumonia, strep
             throat, acute otitis media, or influenza

          8. Are experiencing a fever 103˚F or higher at screening

          9. Are from homes where there is smoking in the home around the child.

         10. Are currently taking a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), or have taken a MAOI
             within two weeks of screening (e.g., isocarboxazid - Marplan, phenelzine - Nardil,
             selegiline - Eldepryl, Emsam, Zelapar, and tranylcypromine - Parnate). Note: subjects
             may not discontinue taking a MAOI solely of the purposes of qualifying for the study.

         11. Have a known sensitivity or allergy to pseudoephedrine, phenylephrine, or
             acetaminophen or any of the excipients of the drug product

         12. Have taken any oral cold or allergy medicine within 12 hours of enrollment, or

             OTC analgesics

         13. Have the need to take additional medications, including cough and cold (i.e., oral or
             intranasal antihistamines, intranasal steroids, intranasal decongestants), or
             herbal/dietary supplements during the study, with the exception of acetaminophen, a
             medication regimen for a hyperexcitability disorder that has been stable for at least
             three months or a daily vitamin or multivitamin/multimineral supplement

         14. Have participated in another clinical study within 30 days before entry

         15. Have another child from the household currently participating in this study

         16. Have a history of drug, alcohol, or tobacco use (older children)

         17. Are involved directly or indirectly with the conduct and administration of this study
