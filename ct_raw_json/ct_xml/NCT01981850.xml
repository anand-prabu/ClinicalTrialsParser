  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PRM-151 is an investigational drug that is being developed for possible use in the treatment
      of myelofibrosis (MF), a disease in which the bone marrow, which is the organ in the body
      that makes blood cells, is replaced by fibrosis, or excess scar tissue.

      The purpose of this study is to gather information on whether PRM-151 has an effect on the
      MF disease, whether it is safe in patients with MF, and how well it is tolerated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, Simon two stage, Phase 2 study to determine the efficacy and safety
      of two different dose schedules of PRM-151 in subjects with PMF and post ET/PV MF. There are
      two treatment cohorts, each assigned to one of two dose schedules of PRM-151. Subjects will
      be assigned to a weekly or every four week dosing schedule by the investigator based on
      their ability to visit the study site on a weekly basis.  This is an adaptive design as
      defined in FDA Draft Guidance for Industry: Adaptive Design Clinical Trials for Drugs and
      Biologics, February 2010.  Modifications to dose levels, schedule, or regimen may be made in
      Stage 2 based on data from Stage 1.

             treatments for myelofibrosis (including investigational therapies) and study
             enrollment, except for ruxolitinib for Cohort 2 (see Inclusion Criteria 11);

             8. Recovery to ≤ Grade 1 or baseline of any toxicities due to prior systemic

             (diaphragm with spermicidal gel and condoms with spermicide), partner vasectomy, and
             total abstinence.

             10. Ability to adhere to the study visit schedule and all protocol requirements;

             improvement in splenomegaly for at least four weeks;

             12. Must have adequate organ function as demonstrated by the following:

               -  ALT (SGPT) and/or AST (SGOT) ≤ 3x upper limit of normal (ULN), or ≤ 4 x ULN (if
                  upon judgment of the treating physician, it is believed to be due to
                  extramedullary hematopoiesis [EMH] related to MF);

               -  Direct bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN; or ≤ 2x ULN (if upon judgment of the treating
                  physician, it is believed to be due to EMH related to MF);

               -  Serum creatinine ≤ 2.5 mg/dL x ULN.

          -  1. Other invasive malignancies within the last 3 years, except non-melanoma skin
             cancer and localized cured prostate and cervical cancer;

             arrhythmia requiring medication or mechanical control within the last 6 months;

             3. Presence of active serious infection;

             4. Any serious, unstable medical or psychiatric condition that would prevent, (as
             judged by the Investigator) the subject from signing the informed consent form or any
             condition, including the presence of laboratory abnormalities, which places the
             subject at unacceptable risk if he/she were to participate in the study or confounds
             the ability to interpret data from the study;

             5. Known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), or known active hepatitis A,
             B, or C infection;

             6. Organ transplant recipients other than bone marrow transplant;

             7. Women who are pregnant or lactating.
