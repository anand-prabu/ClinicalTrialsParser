            "textblock": "Sudden out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OOH-CA) remains a significant cause of death.\n      However, in 2002 it was in two clinical trials demonstrated that mild therapeutic\n      hypothermia in comatose OOH-CA victims yields a better cerebral outcome measured by Cerebral\n      Performance Category Score (CPC) after 6 month. The optimal mild hypothermia treatment time\n      is however not known. The two trials from 2002 apply the treatment for 12 and 24 hours\n      respectively. In newborns with cerebral hypoxic damage the standard treatment time is 72\n      hours. It is therefore relevant to investigate the influence of the treatment time on the\n      cerebral outcome in OOH-CA victims. In the present study cerebral outcome after mild\n      therapeutic hypothermia (target temperature 33 degrees centigrade) in OOH_CA patients for 24\n      is compared to outcome after 48 hours of mild hypothermia. The main outcome parameter is\n      mortality and CPC score measured 6 month after the treatment."
