            "textblock": "TDF is a nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) which can be taken only once per\n      day and continues to have good efficacy even in patients who have resistance to other NNRTI\n      in the absence of K65R mutation. TDF is a choice for patients with NRTI resistance, or those\n      that require once-daily regimen to improve adherence. Currently, TDF has not been approved\n      by the US FDA for children less than 18 years, but pediatricians has been using TDF in\n      children who have treatment failure because of limitation of a more appropriate pediatric\n      ARV. The Thai national guideline for pediatric 2009 recommend the use of TDF in children who\n      have failed the first line therapy with multi-NRTI mutation and are more than 30 kilograms\n      or have tanner stage 4 or more. However, the problem is that there is no pediatric TDF\n      formulation. The available preparation of 300 mg tear drop tablet, if cut in half, may\n      increase dosing errors, more or less by 18-37%. This will affect the blood level and/or\n      toxicities. Therefore, the Thai Governmental Pharmaceutical Organization (GPO) has produced\n      a generic TDF formulation that can be used in HIV-infected children. This study will assess\n      the safety and efficacy information in children using this generic pediatric TDF\n      formulation."
