        -  Before eating, you will be given instructions on how to use the study medication. You
           will swish about 2 teaspoons of a solution in your mouth for 30 seconds and then spit
           it out (like mouthwash).

        -  Just before eating, you will be given another brief questionnaire judging your
           appetite.
