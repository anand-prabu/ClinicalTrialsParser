In the primary arm, the diagnosis and therapeutic decision will be\n      made by means of a domiciliary nasal pressure (DNP) channel and oximetry while the\n      specialist healthcare arm will use polysomnography (PSG) in a hospital. Patients with an\n      intermediate-high suspicion of OSAS will be included, taking as primary variables the\n      Epworth scale, for efficacy, and the Epworth scale and EuroQol 5D, for cost-effectiveness.\n\n      Secondary objectives: efficacy of the two SAHS management programs according to the\n      following secondary variables: a) quality-of-life tests: FOSQ questionnaire, SF36 and\n      analogical wellbeing scale, b) adherence to and compliance with the treatment."
