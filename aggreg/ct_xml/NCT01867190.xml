  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the safety and efficacy of intra-arterial infusion and intramuscular
      injection of an autologous, bone marrow-derived stem cell preparation (ASCT01) versus
      placebo in patients with critical limb ischemia who have exhausted all medical and surgical
      therapeutic options. The safety and tolerability will be evaluated by regular monitoring of
      the general physical condition, vital signs, and the occurrence of AE and SAE, respectively.
      Furthermore, the standard biochemical and blood variables (red and white blood cell counts,
      Hb, Ht, platelets, sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, phosphor, ASAT, ALAT, bilirubin,
      total protein, albumin, AP, cholesterol (LDL,HDL), triglycerides, urea and creatinine,
      immunoglobulins, HBA1c, C-peptide) will be checked before the treatment as well as 30 and 90
      days after the treatment.

      Efficacy will be determined by number of collateral arteries as assessed magnetic resonance
      angiography at baseline and again at 3 months, rate of major amputation (above the ankle) of
      the affected limb within 3 months or an unchanged critical limb ischemia of the affected
      limb after 3 months defined as less than 15% change in tcPO2 or ABI or absolute ankle
      pressure.Efficacy endpoint is at 3 months. Clinical endpoints and safety will be measured
      through 12 months.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients in the age group of 18-75 yrs.

          2. Established CLI (confirmed by Rutherford 4 to 5 or Fontaine III-IV to the
             recommendations of the TASC) with angiographic evidence of significant with
             infra-inguinal arterial occlusive disease

          3. Ankle Brachial Pressure Index (ABI) â‰¤ 0.6 or the absolute ankle systolic blood
             pressure &lt; 60 mm Hg or TcPO2 &lt;20 mmHg without tissue loss or TcPO2 &lt;40 mmHg if there
             is tissue loss or alternatively toe Brachial Pressure Index (TBI) less 0.5 or the
             absolute toe blood pressure less than 50 mm Hg.

          4. No surgical or interventional option for revascularization and no response to best
             standard care delivered as confirmed by a physician.

          5. No immediate life-threatening complication from CLI, which would demand immediate
             amputation.

          6. Patients who are able to understand the requirements of the study, and willing to
             provide voluntary written informed consent, abide by the study requirements, and
