At least 18 years of age\n\n          3. Histologically confirmed diagnosis of advanced solid or hematological malignancy not\n             amenable to standard treatment.\n\n          4.

Hematology values: blood leukocyte count \u2265 3.0 x 109/L, blood absolute neutrophil\n             count \u2265 1.5 x 109/L, blood platelet count \u2265 100 x109/L, hemoglobin \u2265 100 g/L\n             (transfusions are allowed)\n\n          7. Clinical chemistry values: plasma total bilirubin level \u2264 1.5 times the upper limit\n             of the \"normal\" range (ULN; i.e. reference), plasma AST or ALT \u2264 1.5 x ULN (\u22645 times\n             if liver metastases have been documented) and plasma creatinine \u2264 1.5 x ULN\n\n          8. 12-lead ECG with normal tracings; or changes that are not clinically significant and\n             do not require medical intervention\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          1. Ongoing infection or other major recent or ongoing disease that, according to the\n             Investigator, poses an unacceptable risk to the patient\n\n          2. Known primary or secondary central nervous system malignancy. (Patients with symptoms\n             suggestive of possible CNS metastasis such as headache, dizziness or focal\n             neurological deficits should undergo CT or MRI of the brain to rule out CNS\n             metastasis. Patients who do not have CNS symptoms do not need a CT or MRI of the\n             brain.)\n\n          3. Grade 3 or higher constipation within the past 28 days or grade 2 constipation within\n             the past 14 days before randomization. (Patients with grade 2 constipation within the\n             past 14 days could be re-screened if constipation decreases to \u2264 grade 1 with optimal\n             management of constipation.)\n\n          4. Impairment of gastrointestinal (GI) function, GI cancer or GI disease that may\n             significantly alter the absorption of AXL1717\n\n          5. Coexisting uncontrolled medical condition, including active cardiac disease (such as\n             unstable angina, myocardial infarction within 6 months, or New York Heart Association\n             Class III/IV congestive heart failure), or significant dementia\n\n          6. Hepatic impairment as indicated by abnormalities of transaminases and/or alkaline\n             phosphatase (AST and/or ALT > 1.5 \u00d7 upper limit of normal concomitant with alkaline\n             phosphatase > 2.5 \u00d7 upper limit of normal, \u22645 times if liver metastases have been\n             documented)\n\n          7. Major surgical procedure within 4 weeks prior to randomization\n\n          8. Use of potent inhibitors of CYP2C9 (e.g. Fluconazole) from 3 weeks prior to first\n             administration of investigational product\n\n          9. Women of child bearing potential (WOCBP) who do not consent to using acceptable\n             methods of contraception (i.e. two of the following - oral contraception, barrier\n             contraception, intrauterine device). For purposes of this study, WOCBP include any\n             female who has experienced menarche, who has not undergone tubal ligation, and who is\n             not postmenopausal. Post menopause is defined as: amenorrhea \u2265 12 consecutive months\n             without another cause.\n\n         10. Women who are breast-feeding or have a positive pregnancy test at screening\n\n         11. Current participation in any other investigational clinical trial or any\n             administration of an investigational agent within 4 weeks of study drug\n             administration or 10 half-lives of the investigational agent, whichever is longer.\n             Patients with unresolved investigational treatment-related AEs may not participate.\n\n         12. Known or suspected hypersensitivity to AXL1717\n\n         13. Lack of suitability for participation in the trial, for any reason, as judged by the\n             Investigator"
