This\n      rationale is based on several findings from previous work: 1) cigarette smoke contains\n      constituents that inhibit both forms of the enzyme monoamine oxidase (MAO-A and MAO-B); 2)\n      that severity of depression symptoms after smoking abstinence is correlated with the level\n      of MAO-A inhibition previously obtained from smoking; 3) moclobemide, an MAO-A inhibitor was\n      found efficacious in a smoking cessation treatment trial (Berlin et al., 1995); and 4) women\n      show a greater association between smoking and depression than men and women smokers in our\n      previous trials report smoking to alleviate symptoms of depression to a greater extent than\n      men."
