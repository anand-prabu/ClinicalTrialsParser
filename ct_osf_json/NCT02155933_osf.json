    "description": "\n      Hormones are substances that are made by the body and are sent directly out into the\n      bloodstream to increase or decrease the function of certain organs, glands, or other\n      hormones.  Testosterone is a hormone found in the blood of all girls, but some girls have\n      too much testosterone in their blood. Too much testosterone in the blood can possibly lead\n      to a problem called polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). People with PCOS have abnormal\n      menstrual periods, excess facial and body hair, and too much testosterone in their blood. On\n      the other hand, some girls with too much testosterone in their blood do not develop PCOS. We\n      do not know why some of these girls develop PCOS and why some do not.\n\n      The purpose of this research study is to find out whether too much testosterone can cause\n      problems with other hormones that can lead to the development of PCOS. This study may help\n      us understand more about the causes of PCOS.\n    ",

We will\\n      examine hormonal profiles (e.g., LH, FSH, progesterone, testosterone, estradiol) during\\n      pubertal maturation in adolescent girls with and without elevated plasma androgens. The\\n      working hypothesis is that, in pubertal girls without hyperandrogenemia, overnight rises of\\n      P are associated with a reduction of LH frequency during the waking morning hours. However,\\n      in pubertal girls with hyperandrogenemia, LH frequency will be higher than normal during\\n      both the day and night, despite similar or higher P levels. The studies will involve\\n      frequent blood sampling over 18 hours. We will assess differences in hormone parameters\\n      between time blocks (1900-2300 h, 2300-0300 h, 0300-0700 h, 0700-1100 h) in individuals to\\n      evaluate day-night changes.
