  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study the investigators are examining the effectiveness of intensive speech therapy
      in chronic moderate-to-severe stroke-induced aphasia under two conditions - responses
      &quot;constrained&quot; or unconstrained to speech. Both treatments involve massed practice
      communicating, using intensive language action therapy 3 hours/day, 5 days/week for two
      weeks, followed by six months of a home practice program. One treatment stresses spoken
      responses as the preferred expressive modality during intensive therapy. Before and after
      treatment, and following the home practice program and a period of no practice, the
      investigators will administer several tests and discourse samples to examine changes
      associated with the treatments. Participants will also undergo structural and functional MRI
      testing at these time points. The investigators will also attempt to quantify the degree to
      which improvements following intensive language therapy and home practice correlate with
      changes in Quality of Life measures as perceived by both participants with aphasia and their
      significant others. It is hypothesized that, whereas both treatments will lead to
      improvements in naming practiced words and communicating, outcomes will be enhanced for the
      group randomly assigned to the &quot;constraint&quot; condition. Moreover, performance will be
      enhanced on words practiced during the home practice program, including those that were not
      practiced during intensive therapy.  Improved naming will correlate with modulation of
      'signature' language and attentional networks, whose variability will depend on remaining
      viable brain structures. Initial severity and site/extent of lesion should predict patients'
      ability to transfer gains in naming to improvements in discourse.

    <description>Following a phase of baseline pre-treatment testing, speech therapy sessions take place 5 days/week for 3 hours per session during two consecutive weeks. Spoken responses are explicitly modeled and encouraged during therapy. Following the intensive 2-week treatment, participants are trained in using individualized home practice programs on iPads. They practice approximately daily for six months, checking in weekly with an SLP via videoconferencing software and return for probes monthly. Six months post-treatment testing will take place following completion of the home practice phase and again at 12 months post-treatment.</description>
