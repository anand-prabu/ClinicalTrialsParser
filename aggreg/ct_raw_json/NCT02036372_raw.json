The prevalence of diabetes\n      in hospitalised patients is up to 40%, meaning that the anaesthesiologist will encounter a\n      diabetes patient in the operating room on a daily basis. Multiple protocols for\n      perioperative glucose regulation have been developed, ranging from intravenous\n      glucose-insulin-potassium infusion to subcutaneous bolus regimens. Despite this abundance of\n      published glucose lowering protocols and the proven negative effects of intraoperative\n      hyperglycaemia in diabetes, there is no evidence regarding the optimal intraoperative\n      glucose lowering treatment. Recently, incretins have been introduced to lower blood glucose.\n      The main hormone of the incretin system is glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). GLP-1 increases\n      insulin and decreases glucagon secretion in a glucose-dependent manner, resulting in low\n      incidence of hypoglycaemia. This study investigates for the first time the optimal\n      intraoperative treatment algorithm to lower glucose in patients with diabetes mellitus\n      undergoing non-cardiac surgery.\n\n      Objective:\n\n      This study investigates the optimal intraoperative treatment algorithm to lower glucose in\n      patients with diabetes mellitus type 2 undergoing non-cardiac surgery, comparing\n      intraoperative glucose-insulin-potassium infusion (GIK), insulin bolus regimen (BR) and\n      GLP-1 (liraglutide, LG) treatment."
