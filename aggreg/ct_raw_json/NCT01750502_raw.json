MIF is expressed in\n      several cell types,including monocytes/macrophages, vascular smooth muscle and\n      cardiomyocytes, and is released on stimulation from pre-formed storage pools. A foreign\n      study reported that MIF had demonstrated to offer protection from I/R-injury by activating\n      adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and inhibiting c-Jun Nterminal\n      kinase (JNK)-induced apoptosis of cardiomyocytes. In addition, animal experiments showed\n      that MIF was reduced in aged heart compared with young heart. Coronary heart disease is a\n      chronic ischemic disease, in which MIF may play as a protective factor during the whole\n      procedure.\n\n      We observed individuals who will be taking coronary angiography during the hospitalization.\n      Individuals will be assigned to coronary-artery-disease group, which included acute coronary\n      syndromes and stable ischemic heart disease, or non-coronary-artery-disease group, according\n      to coronary angiography. All participants will be extracted 3ml blood sample 5 minutes\n      before coronary angiography. Coronary-artery-disease group will be taken another two blood\n      samples, 5 minutes after the opening of the balloon and 5 minutes after the stents have been\n      implanted, respectively."
