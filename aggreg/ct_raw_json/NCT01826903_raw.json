Economic and human resources aspects\n      of the intervention will also be evaluated to determine overall societal benefits from\n      investment in such a program, feasibility of scaling up the intervention and its\n      sustainability in the long-term. The primary hypothesis is that children of mothers who\n      participated in the THP will have better cognitive outcomes and socio-emotional functioning\n      when compared to children of mothers randomized to the control group."
