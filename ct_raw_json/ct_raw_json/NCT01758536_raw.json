It is used to\n      symptoms induced by blood stasis or stagnation of phlegm-wetness, such as stroke and\n      paralysis, stiffness and numbness, deviation of the eye and mouth and dysphasia.\n\n      Based on the history of Huatuo Zaizao Pills for the treatment of cerebral infarction and\n      hemorrhagic stroke, investigators will perform a phase IV, double blind, placebo-controlled,\n      randomized and multi-Center clinical trial in China to determine the efficacy of Huatuo\n      Zaizao Pills in improving neural function and life quality in patients with acute ischemic\n      stroke in China.\n\n      The study was designed with a target sample size of 1100 patients and the investigators will\n      perform 200 patients in the first period. Patients will be randomly assigned to receive\n      Huatuo Zaizao Pills or placebo at dose of 12g each time, twice daily.\n\n      The investigators hypothesis that this study might offer based medicine evidence to test and\n      verified the efficacy of Huatuo Zaizao Pills in improving the neural function and life\n      quality in patients with ischemic stroke."
