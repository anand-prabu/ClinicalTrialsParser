Mild:Pink to slightly brown\n\n        2. Moderate:Deep brown or black\n\n        3. Severe:Mixed in color Score in each tooth was taken including one full inter dental\n           papilla. Observations were made in natural light. The assessment of the scoring of the\n           pigmentation index were done by all the three examiners, and the agreed upon score was\n           assigned to prevent individual variations.\n\n      The investigators compared  the intensity of pigmentation in each patient in recall sessions\n       after 1month and 3mounth postoperative."
