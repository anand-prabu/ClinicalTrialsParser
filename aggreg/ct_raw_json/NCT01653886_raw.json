The menus\n      consist of three diets that vary in dietary fat and energy density: 1) high fat/high energy\n      density, 2) high fat/low energy density, and 3) high carbohydrate/low energy density.  In\n      addition to these three menus, the menu from the baseline period of the trial will also be\n      tested for palatability."
