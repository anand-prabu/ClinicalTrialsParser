      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate superior intraocular pressure (IOP) control with
      travoprost 0.004% / timolol 0.5% (DuoTrav®) compared to beta-blocker monotherapy in patients
      with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have a clinical diagnosis of either open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.

          -  Currently on beta-blocker monotherapy (for &gt;30 days) and would benefit, in the
             opinion of the investigator, from further lOP reduction.

          -  Have a mean baseline lOP of &gt;18 mmHg and &lt;32 mmHg in at least one eye.

          -  Must be able to understand and sign an Informed Consent form.

          -  Other protocol-specified inclusion criteria may apply.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Severe central visual field loss in either eye within the last year.

          -  Chronic, recurrent or severe inflammatory eye disease (e.g., sclerotic, uveitis, or
             herpes keratitis).

          -  Ocular trauma or surgery within the past 6 months.

          -  Ocular infection or ocular inflammation within the past 3 months.

          -  Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) score worse than 55 ETDRS letters (equivalent to
             20/80 Snellen, 0.60 logMAR or 0.25 decimal).

          -  Any abnormality preventing reliable measurement of IOP.

          -  Other ocular pathology (including severe dry eye) that may, in the opinion of the
             investigator, preclude the administration of study medication.

          -  Condition that requires the use of any additional topical or systemic ocular
             hypotensive medication during the study.

          -  Hypersensitivity to prostaglandin analogues or any component of the study medications
             in the opinion of the investigator.

          -  Asthma, history of asthma, or severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

          -  Condition that does not allow the patient to discontinue all glucocorticoids
             administered by any route safely.

          -  Therapy with another investigational agent within 30 days prior to Visit 1.

          -  Any other condition including severe illness which would make the patient, in the
             opinion of the investigator, unsuitable for the study.

          -  Women of childbearing potential if pregnant, test positive for pregnancy at Screening
             visit, breastfeeding, or not in agreement to use adequate birth control methods to
             prevent pregnancy throughout the study.

          -  Other protocol-specified exclusion criteria may apply.
