      Purpose of this study is to understand the clinical feasibility of duodenal juice diagnosis
      to screen UICC stage II pancreatic ductal  adenocarcinoma patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic cancer (PC) is the most lethal of all major cancers with a five year survival
      rate of 5 %.  While stage I and II tumors leads to an improvement in survival, almost all
      PCs are currently diagnosed at more advanced non-resectable stages since minimally invasive
      technique which is capable of screening early-stage PC does not exist.  Serum CA19-9 is not
      recommended as a screening technique because of its low sensitivity and specificity. Imaging
      modalities such as MRI, CT, EUS and ERCP are more accurate but are not appropriate screening
      tools due to their high cost, discomfort and complications. Therefore, there is a strong
      demand for a screening tool with high sensitivity and specificity which is highly acceptable
      for the patient.

      The investigators would like to standardize the detection method of pancreatic cancer that
      uses the duodenal juice as an optional endoscopic diagnosis. It's a very useful chance to
      collect pancreatic juice from duodenum, it is called &quot;duodenal juice&quot; ,if we collect them
      without additional invasion. The investigators would like to collect duodenal juice during
      undergoing upper gastrointestinal endoscopy  and analyze the pancreatic tumor markers in
      duodenal juice. A definite diagnosis of the patient is made with histology, cytology or
      imaging diagnosis and the result of each definite diagnosis is correlated to the each marker
      analyzing result of duodenal juice. Therefore this study can be positioned as a feasibility
      study to confirm clinical performance.
