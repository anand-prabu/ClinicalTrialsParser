  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the role of radiotherapy dose escalation and/or addition of a drug
      called Nelfinavir, to standard chemoradiotherapy in patients with inoperable, cancer of the
      pancreas that has not spread beyond the pancreas.

      Currently in the United Kingdom, either chemotherapy alone or chemotherapy followed by
      chemoradiotherapy can be used in the management of inoperable pancreatic cancer that has not
      spread beyond the pancreas. Standard chemoradiotherapy consists of 28 daily treatments of
      radiotherapy. Although this treatment is effective in controlling local symptoms and slowing
      down the pace of cancer, in most cases it is unable to eradicate the cancer or shrink it
      well enough to make it operable. Some of the reasons behind this could be the lack of oxygen
      and lack of blood flow within the tumour that makes it resistant to the effects of
      chemoradiotherapy. This study is trying to investigate whether increasing the dose of
      radiotherapy, or increasing the oxygen and blood supply to the tumour by giving an
      additional drug called Nelfinavir, or a combination of both strategies, can improve outcome.
      The investigators also want to know what are the additional toxicities from such intensive
      approaches.

      All patients will initially receive 12 weeks of chemotherapy, and those with stable or
      responding disease will receive further study treatment as outlined below.

      The study will consist of two stages. In the first stage the investigators aim to find out
      the right dose of Nelfinavir to combine with chemoradiotherapy, and this will require up to
      27 patients all of whom will receive Nelfinavir together with standard chemoradiotherapy. In
      the second stage, the investigators want to find out the benefits of this approach over and
      above standard treatments and therefore the investigators will recruit approximately 262
      patients and allocate them to one of the five following treatment arms:

      Arm A: Nelfinavir together with the standard chemoradiotherapy regimen Arm B: Standard
      chemoradiotherapy Arm C: Nelfinavir together with standard chemoradiotherapy but with a
      higher radiotherapy dose Arm D: Standard chemoradiotherapy regimen but with a higher
      radiotherapy dose Arm E: Standard chemotherapy
