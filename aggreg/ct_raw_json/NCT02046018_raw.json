            "textblock": "In Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), many children die from diarrhoea, acute respiratory illness\n      (ARI) and malaria, despite well- recognized, inexpensive and highly effective treatments,\n      since health access and human resources are limited. Healthy Child Uganda (HCU) is a\n      Ugandan-Canadian partnership that since 2003, has developed, implemented and evaluated a\n      Village Health Volunteer (VHV) program in 175 rural villages. Volunteers, selected by peers,\n      provide health education and refer sick children. Volunteer retention (94%) and significant\n      decreases in child deaths are remarkable. Now, HCU wonders whether VHV scope can extend to\n      provide treatment for sick children using Oral Rehydration Salts (ORS)/Zinc, antibiotics,\n      and antimalarials. Use of lay providers in this capacity, called integrated community case\n      management (iCCM), has been proposed as a potential inexpensive solution to SSA's human\n      health resource crisis.\n\n      PRIMARY QUESTION: In rural southwest Uganda, can iCCM provided by lay volunteers, improve\n      the proportion of children with diarrhoea receiving ORS/Zn, ARI receiving antibiotics, and\n      fever/malaria receiving antimalarials? Secondary study questions consider VHV capacity to\n      prescribe appropriate drug, dose, duration; iCCM acceptance by family, and VHV; VHV\n      retention/motivation; program cost. Selected VHV will be iCCM trained then receive\n      treatments for distribution. Qualitative and quantitative methods including household\n      surveys, and focus groups will consider pre/post intervention differences and differences in\n      control and intervention populations. A research short course and micro research grants (~\n      $3000 to multidisciplinary groups pursuing relevant questions) will promote health system\n      evaluation capacity. Lessons learned are critical as SSA countries move forward in planning\n      for increased iCCM programming."
