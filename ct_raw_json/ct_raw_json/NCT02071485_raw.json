            "textblock": "A brain-computer interface (BCI) is a system that provides a separate output pathway for\n      neurological signals whereby they can be interpreted to determine the user's intended\n      cognitive action. Utilizing EEG-based  sensorimotor rhythms (SMRs) generated in the motor\n      cortex has allowed subjects to control virtual computer cursors in up to three dimensions by\n      simply imagining the movement of a specified body part. Nevertheless, the scalp EEG signals\n      are smeared by the volume conduction effect and measurement noise.\n\n      The PI's hypotheses include: (1) The use of advanced signal processing techniques will\n      better reveal characteristics of EEG signals that represent the underlying motor cognitive\n      function of the subject; (2) BCI systems based on SMR generated using motor imaginations\n      will allow effective control of a virtual object in real time; (3) EEG imaging techniques\n      will provide insight into the areas of cortical activation during a motor imagery task that\n      can be utilized to increase the spatial resolution of non-invasive BCI's. Overall, these\n      hypotheses all fall under an overarching hypothesis that EEG-based virtual object control\n      will reveal optimal motor imagination tasks best used in a BCI."

Using non-invasive methods, we will investigate the neural processes that occur\n      during the motor imagination tasks associated with controlling a virtual object. Using a\n      variety of motor imaginations, we will determine which tasks are best used for BCI control\n      by quantitative means of BCI performance and neurological dynamic system analysis.\n\n      Subjects for this study will be healthy, English speaking adult volunteers (18-64 years old)\n      with no history of mental illness, neurological deficit, or traumatic brain injury."
