We plan to enroll a total of 63 HIV infected\n      subjects to ensure that 50 complete the protocol. All HIV infected subjects will undergo\n      biopsies of inguinal lymph node (LN) and gut associated lymphatic tissue (GALT) for primary\n      endpoint analysis at baseline, 12 and 30 months after study enrollment. Blood will be\n      collected at least quarterly throughout the study and an intensive blood pharmacokinetic\n      (PK) study will be conducted at month 1. All HIV infected subjects will be vaccinated with\n      the quadrivalent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine at months 23, 25 and 29.5 to measure\n      immune function. 5 HIV uninfected control subjects will also be enrolled.\n\n      The primary endpoint is to determine the impact of losartan on lymphoid tissue fibrosis in\n      HIV infected, ART treated adults. This will be determined by measuring the amount of\n      collagen deposition in lymphoid tissues and the integrity of the FRCn using\n      immunohistochemistry (IHC) and quantitative image analysis (QIA)."
