Plerixafor may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking\n      blood flow to the tumor. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as temozolomide, work in different\n      ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from\n      dividing. Radiation therapy uses high energy x rays to kill tumor cells. Giving plerixafor\n      after radiation therapy and temozolomide may be an effective treatment for high grade\n      glioma."
