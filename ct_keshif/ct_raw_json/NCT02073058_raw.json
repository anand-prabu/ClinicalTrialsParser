During the course of the wear\n      duration, the subject is required to test fingerstick glucose measurement at least eight (8)\n      times a day for capillary reference glucose measurements and three in-clinic visits of a\n      maximum 13 hours each for venous reference glucose measurements. With every reference\n      measurement, the subject or study staff will perform a measurement on the System."
