            "textblock": "HIV-infected children from sub-Saharan Africa often present with severe malnutrition as\n      their AIDS defining illness.  Severe malnutrition that is not responding to nutritional\n      rehabilitation is an indication to initiate highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). In\n      severe malnutrition metabolic and or gut structural derangement may lead to inadequate\n      antiretroviral (ARV) absorption and or erratic drug levels. The greater surface area to\n      weight ratio in severely malnourished children could also place them at higher risk of under\n      dosing compared to children with mild to moderate malnutrition.  The paucity of ARV\n      pharmacokinetic (PK) data in these vulnerable severely malnourished children speaks to the\n      need to determine the PKs of ARVs and the most appropriate time to initiate HAART in this\n      group of children.  This study will utilize the recommended weight band dosing which\n      simplifies dosing in resource limited settings and is the approach used in the WHO pediatric\n      ARV dosing guidelines. It will also use pediatric formulations which have not been studied\n      before in severely malnourished children. The findings of this study will determine the PK\n      of HAART in this population with the overall goal of determining whether the current\n      recommended doses are optimum doses for severely malnourished children and the most\n      appropriate time to initiate HAART in the severely malnourished child."
