            "textblock": "Cell-based cardiac regeneration has been the focus of acquired, adult heart disease for many\n      years. However, congenital heart disease with severe structural abnormalities may also be\n      reasonable targets for cell-based therapies. Interestingly, the pediatric heart is naturally\n      growing and may be the most amendable to regenerative strategies. Therefore, identifying\n      autologous cells (cells from the patient's own body) would be important to initiate these\n      studies.\n\n      This study aims to validate the use of umbilical cord blood as a source of autologous cells\n      for the purpose of cardiac repair of congenital heart disease. Cells will be isolated from\n      the cord blood to help us determine the feasibility of collection, processing, and storage\n      of these samples at the time of birth of infants with prenatal diagnosis of hypoplastic left\n      heart syndrome. This study may be useful for the development of pre-clinical and clinical\n      studies aimed at the long-term goal of repairing damaged heart muscle."
