Alisertib may stop the\n      growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Monoclonal\n      antibodies, such as rituximab, can block cancer growth in different ways. Some block the\n      ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and help kill them or\n      carry cancer-killing substances to them.
