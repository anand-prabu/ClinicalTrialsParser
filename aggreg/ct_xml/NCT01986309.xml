    <textblock>
      There some evidence regarding the effect of lidocaine for the prevention of nausea and
      vomiting in adults. The investigators want to know whether with intravenous lidocaine a
      adjunct for general anesthesia for children between 2 and 12 years who are undergoing
      tonsillectomy, with or without adenoids has the same effect.
