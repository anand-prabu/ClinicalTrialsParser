Although designed as a second-line diabetes drug, this medication has\n      very little risk of hypoglycemia in older adults.  In fact the risk of hypoglycemia is\n      extremely low even in patients concurrently taking concurrent hypoglycemia agents (including\n      insulin), and there is almost no risk of hypoglycemia in subjects not on other diabetes\n      medications.  Acarbose suppresses postprandial glycemia by slowing small intestinal\n      digestion and absorption of carbohydrate, and has been shown to slow gastric emptying\n      Acarbose has yet to be examined in a prospective fashion in older adults, despite the\n      prevalence of PPH in this patient population.  Preliminary, pilot work done in our\n      laboratory on older adults with PPH has demonstrated that the hypotensive response over 90\n      minutes to a standardized meal was significantly reduced by the administration of acarbose"
