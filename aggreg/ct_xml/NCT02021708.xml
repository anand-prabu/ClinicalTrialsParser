  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn about the effects of smoking shisha on the lungs, when
      compared to the effects of smoking cigarettes or of not smoking. The investigators hope to
      learn more about how shisha smokers should be monitored and treated once diseased.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Traditional shisha smoking is practiced by ~10% of the Qatari adult population. Although
      based on tobacco leaves, shisha smoking exposes the airway epithelium to a chemical insult
      of intensity and duration different from that of cigarette smoking. This study, a
      collaboration between WCMC-Qatar and WCMC-New York and the Hamad Medical Corporation (HMC),
      is focused on defining the biology of the airway epithelium of shisha smokers compared to
      non-smokers. Using approved protocols, bronchoscopy will be used to sample the airway
      epithelium, the site of the earliest changes associated with smoking. The transcriptome of
      the recovered epithelium will be assessed in the genomic core WCMC-Qatar for gene expression
      using microarrays and complete RNA sequencing using massive parallel sequencing.Based on
      this information, the epithelial DNA will be assessed for relevant SNPs, copy number
      variations and methylation status. Parallel studies will be carried out in cigarette
      smokers, providing a comprehensive catalog of shisha smoking-induced changes compared to
      cigarette smokers and non-smokers in this population.

    <description>We will measure the effect that shisha smoking has on the small airway epithelium (SAE) by measuring parameters such as the SAE gene expression in  shisha smokers (i.e., non-cigarette smokers). We will compare these parameters to the same parameters measured in non-smokers and cigarette smokers.</description>
