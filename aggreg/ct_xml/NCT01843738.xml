  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients are being asked to take part because they have melanoma that has spread to other
      organs in their body (metastatic). As part of this study, patients will receive radiation
      therapy and an approved drug (Vemurafenib).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be treated with vemurafenib plus radiation therapy (RT) based upon the
      administration schedule.  The starting dose of vemurafenib will be the patient's baseline
      tolerating dose, between 720 - and 960 mg by mouth.  Patients must be tolerating at a
      minimum 720mg for one cycle (28 days) prior to enrollment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age &gt; 18 years old

          -  Diagnosis of BRAFV600 mutated Stage IV or unresectable Stage III melanoma

          -  Actively receiving treatment with vemurafenib as single agent and tolerating at least
             720 mg bid for one cycle (28 days).

          -  In the opinion of the investigator, patients who are progressing in an area where
             radiation may provide benefit from either:

               -  Symptom control

               -  Oligo-progression, defined as progression in up to 3 areas where focal treatment
                  would provide benefit.

          -  Patients with brain metastases will be allowed provided they meet all of the
             following criteria:

               -  Small, &lt; 1cm metastases which are untreated are allowed so long as in the
                  opinion of the investigator they do not require immediate treatment by radiation
                  or surgery

               -  Asymptomatic, treated brain metastases which are stable for 4 weeks prior to
                  study entry are allowed

               -  If patients are requiring steroids for their brain metastases, they must be on a
                  stable dose for two weeks prior to study entry, and maintain that steroid dosing
                  during the radiation treatments

          -  Adequate bone marrow function as defined by: ANC &gt; 1.0 k/uL, Platelets &gt; 75 k/uL,
             Hemoglobin  &gt; 8 g/dL

          -  Adequate hepatic function: Total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 times the institutional upper limit
             of normal, ALT/AST &lt; 2.5 times the institutional upper limit of normal

          -  Adequate renal function as defined by serum creatinin &lt; 1.5 times the upper limit of
             normal.

          -  Negative serum pregnancy test at screening for women of child bearing potential
             within 10 days of starting vemurafenib treatment .  Women of non-childbearing
             potential may be included if they are either surgically sterile or have been
             postmenopausal for &gt; 1 year

          -  Fertile men and women must agree to use an acceptable method of birth control during
             treatment and for at least 2 months after discontinuation of vemurafenib.

          -  Able and willing to provide informed consent to an approved consent form that
             conforms to federal and institutional guidelines.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Screening QTc interval &gt; 450 msec on EKG

          -  Known HIV positivity or AIDS-related illness, or active HBV, or active HCV.

          -  Any of the following within the 6 months prior to study drug administration:
             myocardial infarction, severe/unstable angina, coronary/peripheral artery bypass
             graft, symptomatic congestive heart failure, serious cardiac arrhythmia requiring
             medication, uncontrolled hypertension, cerebrovascular accident or transient ischemic
             attack, or symptomatic pulmonary embolism.

          -  Malabsorption disorder that would preclude adequate vemurafenib absorption.

          -  Other medical condition present that in the opinion of the investigator will hinder
             the subjects ability to complete the study.
