Both small\n      and large nerve fibres can be affected in disease states, such as diabetes. Since defects of\n      small nerve fibre activity have important consequences (painful symptoms, erectile\n      dysfunction, cardiac rhythm disturbances, bladder and gastrointestinal dysfunction), it is\n      important to determine new ways to maintain their function to help individuals maintain a\n      high quality of life.\n\n      Until now, researchers have only tested the effect of omega-3 supplementation in animals\n      with diabetes and have found this nutrient to lessen nerve damage while maintaining the\n      function of nerves. However, there has not been any research on the use of omega-3s on nerve\n      structure and function in humans with type 1 diabetes.\n\n      Current standard of care for type 1 diabetes is to manage glycemic control and any painful\n      symptoms through medication. The use of omega-3 supplements for prevent or limit nerve\n      damage in diabetes is not within the current standard of care. In this study omega-3\n      supplementation is experimental and has been approved by Health Canada for use in this\n      study."
