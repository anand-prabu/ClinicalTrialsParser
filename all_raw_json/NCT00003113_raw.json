Etoposide\n      is given on days 1-3 and cyclophosphamide and procarbazine are given on days 22-31 of each\n      cycle. Lomustine is given on day 1 of cycles 1 and 3 only. Filgrastim (granulocyte\n      colony-stimulating factor; G-CSF) is given subcutaneously on days 5-21 and 33-42 of each\n      cycle.\n\n      Patients who have disease progression after one cycle of therapy or at any time thereafter\n      are taken off the study. Patients with a complete response after 1 cycle of therapy receive\n      2 additional cycles of chemotherapy and are observed off treatment. Patients with a partial\n      response (PR) also receive 2 additional cycles of chemotherapy. Following the third cycle of\n      chemotherapy, if residual disease is confined to 1 or 2 nodal sites, patients receive\n      radiation therapy. All other patients with a PR are treated at investigator's discretion.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months until death.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 32 patients will be accrued for this study."
