Determine the toxicity of SU5416 in this patient population. III. Determine the median\n      and overall survival and time to progression in these patients receiving this treatment.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.\n\n      Patients receive SU5416 IV over 60 minutes twice weekly for 4 weeks. Treatment continues for\n      a minimum of 2 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.\n\n      Patients are followed weekly for 4 weeks.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-35 patients will be accrued for this study within 18-24\n      months."
