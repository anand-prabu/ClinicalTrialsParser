  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A study to evaluate safety and efficacy of topical sirolimus to treat plantar keratoderma in
      adults with PC.  Subjects may receive either placebo or treatment with at least 1 foot
      receiving topical sirolimus at some time.  For certain phases of the study treatment
      assignment to the right and left foot will be randomized in a double blind fashion.  Blood
      levels will test systemic absorption of sirolimus.  Other safety and efficacy measures will
      be taken through the 39-week study duration.

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Investigator assessment of local tolerability at the application sites on the plantar surfaces will be evaluated by the Investigator according to a 4-point scale (none to severe) with regard to: erythema, pruritis, stinging/burning, and crusting/erosion</measure>
    <time_frame>Local tolerability will be assessed prior to application of study drug and within 15-45 minutes after application of study drug at each visit for 39 weeks; data will be reported as a change in severity compared to baseline for each visit</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Standardized photographs of the callus area will be taken at each study visit and used to determine size and local tolerability</measure>
    <time_frame>Data will be reported as a change in the appearance of the calluses on the plantar surface compared with baseline and reported for each study visit over 39 weeks</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>An expert in the disease who is blinded to the study treatment will read the photographs. The reader will assess changes to the calluses based on criteria such as blisters, cracks, small/large size, and red or bloody spots on the callus. Change in calluses will be reported for both the right and left foot.</description>

    <description>This is a split-body design. Subjects will self-administer 1% topical sirolimus cream or placebo cream (no drug, vehicle control) on the plantar surface of each foot. At least one foot will be treated with topical sirolimus at some time during the study. Application will be one time daily for a total of 26 weeks. There will be an additional follow-up visit 3 months after the last application of study drug. The total duration of the study is 39 weeks.</description>
