The more common typical HUS is mostly caused by Shigatoxin-producing\n      enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC). The rarer atypical HUS is mainly caused by\n      different genetic abnormalities in complement regulatory proteins.\n\n      About 50 till 60 percent of all patients with HUS develop a severe acute renal failure and\n      require dialysis. Resulting from new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches the survival rate\n      increased during the last years. Despite this, there are only few data concerning long-term\n      prognosis, cognitive and motoric development, as well as psychological coping and\n      health-related quality of life of affected children and their parents."
