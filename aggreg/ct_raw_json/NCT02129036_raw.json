            "textblock": "1. Several authors have reported frequent admixtures of clear cell ovarian carcinoma with\n           serous, mucinous, and endometrioid tumors. However, few papers addressed the difference\n           in response to chemotherapy and survival between patients with pure and mixed-type\n           advanced clear cell carcinoma.\n\n        2. Recent trends in the clinical management of advanced ovarian cancer include increased\n           attention to maximal cytoreduction and general acceptance of paclitaxel-platinum-based\n           adjuvant chemotherapy.\n\n        3. The introduction of paclitaxel markedly changed the postoperative management of ovarian\n           cancer patients, but the results and value of these newer efforts and therapies applied\n           to clear cell carcinoma are as yet undetermined.\n\n        4. Today, paclitaxel-platinum-based chemotherapy is becoming the standard regimen for\n           ovarian cancer worldwide. Previous research suggests a potential benefit of paclitaxel\n           plus carboplatin regimens for stage I clear cell carcinoma. However, few papers\n           specifically addressed the efficacy of paclitaxel-platinum-based chemotherapy for\n           advanced clear cell carcinoma because clear cell carcinoma occurs only rarely in\n           Western countries."
