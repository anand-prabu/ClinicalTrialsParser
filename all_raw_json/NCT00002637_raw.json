Interferon gamma may interfere with the growth of the\n      cancer cells. Combining interferon gamma with interleukin-2 may be a more effective\n      treatment for prostate cancer.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of biological therapy using\n      interleukin-2 and interferon gamma in treating patients with advanced prostate cancer."

Evaluate the safety of immunization with HLA class I-matched allogeneic human\n      prostate carcinoma cells genetically engineered to secrete interleukin-2 and interferon\n      gamma in patients with prostate carcinoma. II. Evaluate the antitumor effects of this\n      treatment as assessed by post-therapy declines in PSA. III. Evaluate the induction of\n      cellular and humoral immunity in vivo with this treatment.\n\n      OUTLINE: Tumor Cell Vaccine Therapy. Immunization with irradiated, MHC class I-matched\n      allogeneic human prostate carcinoma cells, LNCaP cells, engineered to secrete approximately\n      58 ng/24 hr/million cells of interleukin-2 (IL-2) and approximately 0.72 U/24 hr/million\n      cells of interferon gamma (IFN-G).\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Up to 12 patients will be entered on the Phase I study; accrual will\n      continue to a total of 25 patients treated at the MTD (Phase II). Accrual is expected to\n      require 2 years."
