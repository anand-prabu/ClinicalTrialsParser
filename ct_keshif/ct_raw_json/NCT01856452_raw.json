            "textblock": "Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) has become a mainstay surgery method in breast cancer. It\n      provides the surgeon the evidence of axillary lymph node metastasis, which determines the\n      extent of surgery. Because effective SLNB can decrease the extent of axillary lymph node\n      dissection, it is increasingly important. In general, radioactive colloid has been used for\n      SLNB.  In order to pursue more precise SLNB, the investigators developed a multimodal method\n      enabling visual guidance with the mixture of indocyanine green, blue dye and radioisotope.\n\n      In this study, our hypotheses are as following:\n\n        1. Multimodal method enables to increase identification rate of SLNB\n\n        2. blue dye and indocyanine green provide the surgeon visual guidance to ensure better\n           outcome\n\n        3. Multimodal method alleviates the shortcomings of indocyanine green and blue dye as an\n           identification strategy"
