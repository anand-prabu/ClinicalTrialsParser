Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for at least 4 courses in the absence\n      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve a complete or partial\n      response continue to receive additional courses. Patients who achieve stable disease may\n      receive more than 4 courses at the discretion of the investigator.\n\n      Patients are followed every 6 weeks until disease progression or initiation of a new\n      therapy.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-32 patients will be accrued for this study."
