It is an individualized rehabilitative protocol intended to\n      improve mobility, endurance, strength  and continence in frail, older, functionally impaired\n      and disabled veterans.\n\n      Objectives of the project are as follows:\n\n      1) Test the effects of FIT on transfer ability, continence, ambulation/mobility, balance and\n      fall risk, strength, and endurance; 2) Determine the characteristics of NHCU residents who\n      respond to FIT; 3)Identify the most sensitive outcome measures related to FIT; and 4)\n      Determine the labor costs of FIT relative to usual care."

The intervention is an individualized rehabilitative protocol intended to improve\n      mobility, endurance, strength  and continence in frail, older, functionally impaired and\n      disabled veterans in VA nursing home care units(NHCUs).The design is a multi-site cross-over\n      design, to be carried out in five NHCUs (Atlanta, Durham, Salisbury, Augusta, Tuscaloosa)\n      over about eight months in each site.  About 24 residents will be recruited in each NHCU: 12\n      each will be randomized to initial intervention and control for 8 wks and evaluated; the\n      controls will then receive the intervention and vice versa for another 8 wks with another\n      evaluation. Patients are seen 4x a day for FIT activities, including walking/using wheel\n      chair, prompted toileting, strengthening exercises.  Outcome measures will be made in a\n      blinded manner by Project Manager."
