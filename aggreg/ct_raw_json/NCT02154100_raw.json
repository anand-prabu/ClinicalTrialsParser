After an initial telephone screening, all participants will be requested to\n      report to the study site for their first visit. On the first visit (screening), participants\n      will be provided with verbal and written explanation of the project. They will then be asked\n      to sign an informed consent form, followed by measuring waist circumference, resting\n      brachial BP, fasting serum triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, and glucose levels to confirm\n      MetS. Baseline assessments will be performed for medical history, medication use, dietary\n      intake, and physical activity. Qualified participants will be scheduled for their second\n      visit two weeks later (actual baseline data collection) and randomly assigned to their\n      treatment group. On the second (baseline) visit between the hours of 7-10 A.M., BP and\n      vascular function will be measured followed by blood draw. Anthropometrics will be measured.\n      Participants will be provided with their assigned treatment and will receive standard\n      instructions on how to fill out daily diaries for their treatment, and for food and physical\n      activity records. Blood pressure, vascular function, blood draw, and anthropometric, body\n      composition, diet, and physical activity assessments will be repeated at 6- (third visit),\n      and 12-week (final visit) intervals. All cardiovascular measurements will be performed\n      between 7:00 to 10:00 A.M., in a quiet temperature-controlled room in the supine position\n      after an overnight fast and 12 hours after the abstinence of caffeine and/or 24 hours after\n      the last bout of moderate to heavy physical activity."
