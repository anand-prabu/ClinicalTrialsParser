Focus of the trial is the evaluation of \"Stop the pain\", which has shown high\n      effectiveness in one first trial. This time, five clinics, experienced in diagnosis and\n      treatment of childhood chronic abdominal pain, will take part. Children aged 7-12 years are\n      eligible. The programs imply six weekly group sessions for the children and 2 parent\n      evenings. The study group assumes that participation in \"Stop the pain\" will reduce pain\n      experience and will improve the children's quality of life and coping strategies - up to 12\n      months after training."
