One of the more\n      recent developments is the practice of reprocessing single use medical devices.  This\n      practice has been shown to provide considerable savings for health care payers.  Medical\n      devices have been reprocessed in a number of different medical fields including Orthopaedic\n      Surgery.  One of the devices that has been reprocessed are the Precision Saw Blades from\n      Stryker Inc.  These saw blades are used during Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) surgery.  The\n      reprocessed Precision saw blades are Health Canada approved and are available at Capital\n      Health.\n\n      Beyond the benefits to the environment and cost savings, the investigators do not know if\n      the reprocessed saw blades work better, work worse or the same as non reprocessed saw\n      blades.  This study is designed to determine if the reprocessed saw blades used during a TKA\n      work as well as a new saw blade."
