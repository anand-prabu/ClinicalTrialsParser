            "textblock": "The purpose of this study is to determine the value of Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL) MRI, a\n      measure of blood flow to the brain, in Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and compare it to\n      existing measures.  In particular, the investigators will compare ASL MRI to Positron\n      Emission Tomography (PET/CT), which measures brain metabolism reflecting how well cells in a\n      patient's brain are functioning. In addition, the investigators will assess the relationship\n      of these measures to specific protein levels associated with Alzheimer's Disease in the\n      patient's cerebrospinal fluid (the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord) obtained\n      by lumbar puncture.  By comparing the information that is available from these procedures to\n      the patient's performance on cognitive tests, the investigators hope to learn which\n      procedures most accurately reflect and assist in determination of the potential causes of\n      cognitive difficulties that arise with MCI, and thus, which are most useful in the clinical\n      setting. In particular, PET scans have been found to be very useful in diagnosis of MCI and\n      Alzheimer's Disease, but the investigators want to find out if they can get the same, or\n      better, information from an ASL MRI scan, which is less expensive and easier to acquire."
