      The purpose of this study is to see whether the ICDs(Impulse Control Disorder) are improved
      and neuropsychiatric traits related to ICD are changed or not when switching dopamine
      agonist to levodopa/carbidopa in patients with Parkinson's disease who have been treated
      with dopaminergic medications.

      -  PRIMARY OBJECTIVE To evaluate the improvement of mMIDI(modified version of Minnesota
           Impulsive Disorders Interview,Korean version) score from the baseline to 12 weeks or
           LOCF(Last Observation Carried Forward)

        -  SECONDARY OBJECTIVE i) To evaluate the improvement of neuropsychiatric profiles from
           the baseline to 12 weeks or LOCF ii) To evaluate the improvement of UPDRS(Unified
           Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale)Score from the baseline to 12 weeks or LOCF

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient with a diagnosis of idiopathic PD according to United Kingdom Parkinson's
             Disease Brain Bank Criteria

          -  mMIDI ≥ 3 score with ICD

          -  Patients must be on an anti-parkinson treatment at least 6 months before screening.

          -  for this protocol, dopamine agonists should be included in his/her anti-parkinson
             treatment.

          -  30years ≤ patients &lt; 80years of age, male or female

          -  patients must give written informed consent before any assessment is performed

        Exclusion Criteria:

             mental illness currently or in the future

          -  for the patients ≤ 65years: K-MMSE(korean version of Mini-Mental State Exam) ≤24, or
             for the patients ≥ 66years: K-MMSE ≤ 20, or the patients have dementia(incl. early
             dementia) even though K-MMSE score is more than 20

          -  Requirement of treatment more than 6times per day due to the severe motor
             fluctuation.

          -  pregnant, nursing or lactating women

          -  women of child-bearing potential

          -  history of hypersensitivity or allergy to levodopa/carbidopa

          -  any serious disease accordidng to the investigator's discretion
