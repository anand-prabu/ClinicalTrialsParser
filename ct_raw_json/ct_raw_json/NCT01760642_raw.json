Subjects suitable for this study will be\n      admitted to the Clinical Trials Center, Seoul National University Hospital on the day before\n      dosing, and they will be overnight-fasted from 9 p.m. of Day -1. Urine collection is\n      scheduled from 24 hours before midazolam administration to 24 hours after administration.\n      Subjects will be dosed midazolam by intravenous around at 9 a.m. of Day 1. Subjects will\n      perform scheduled procedures including clinical laboratory tests, electrocardiograms and\n      pharmacokinetic samplings. Subjects will be discharged on Day 2 and visit the Clinical\n      Trials Center for period 2, ketoconazole administration. After 3 days of ketoconazole\n      administration, midazolam will be dosed with ketoconazole on Day 4 of period 2. Subjects\n      will perform scheduled procedure and on period 3 rifampicin will be dosed for 9 days and on\n      Day 10 of period 3 midazolam will be dosed with rifampicin. After subjects perform scheduled\n      procedure, the study will be terminated 6-8 days after the end of period 3."
