In addition, therapies that\n      can complement the effect of exercise and diet for reducing body weight are considerate\n      important strategies. Thus, experimental evidence shows that the use of laser therapy\n      combined with exercise swimming was effective in controlling the lipid profile, reducing the\n      mass of adipose tissue, suggesting increased metabolic activity and changes in lipid\n      metabolism.\n\n      To investigate the effect of the use of therapeutic laser when associated to exercise like\n      response to new therapy for weight loss and decrease of dyslipidemias levels."
