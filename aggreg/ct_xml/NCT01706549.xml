      Patients undergone  either laparoscopic or vaginal hysterectomy will called for a clinical
      examination 1-3 years after surgery, if they suffer from pain 6 months after surgery. The
      aims of the study are:

        1. to reveal whether the pain is postsurgical in nature, or if there are any other reasons
           for the pain.

        2. to reveal the type of pain, neuropathic, nociceptive or idiopathic.

        3. to reveal the impact of pain on quality of life.

      Patients undergone  either laparoscopic or vaginal hysterectomy will called for a clinical
      examination 1-3 years after surgery, if they suffer from pain 6 months after surgery. All
      patients were treated in Pirkanmaa District Hospital and the anesthesia was either
      propofol-infusion or sevoflurane gas with remifentanil-infusion.

      6months after the surgery, questionnaires about pelvic pain were sent to the patients.
      Patients still having pain at that time, were invited for detailed sensory and gynecological
      examinations.
