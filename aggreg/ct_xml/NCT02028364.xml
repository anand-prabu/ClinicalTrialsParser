    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single arm  trial in which patients with locally advanced or
      metastatic endocrine receptor positive and HER2 negative breast cancer refractory to
      non-steroidal aromatase inhibitors (NSAI) will receive Everolimus 10mg orally daily given in
      conjunction with exemestane 25mg orally daily until disease progression or treatment
      discontinuation for any other reasons. Tumour, metastatic lesions and blood samples will be
      collected during the treatment period. Genomic analysis on metastatic tumour tissue
      specimens and &quot;liquid biopsies&quot; will help to identify patients who benefit of this treatment
      regimen. The main objective is to evaluate if early metabolic response (MR) using FDG-PET/CT
      is associated with progression free survival (PFS) this population.
