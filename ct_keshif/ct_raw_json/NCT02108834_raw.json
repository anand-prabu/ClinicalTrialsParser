Although it is clear that regional analgesia in association with\n      general anesthesia substantially reduces postoperative pain, the benefits in terms of\n      overall perioperative outcome are  controversial. The aim of this study is to evaluate the\n      effect on short and long-term postoperative outcomes of adding regional analgesia to general\n      anaesthesia in thoridetomic patients."
