  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an exploratory study in Egypt that will combine a treatment trial among early course
      schizophrenia (ECSZ) patients with key analyses suggested by rodent studies.  Specifically,
      the study will test the provocative results from animal studies indicating an impact of
      Toxoplasma Gondii (TOX) exposure on novelty seeking.  The study will also test whether
      exposure to TOX is associated with other cognitive and behavioral changes, as well as
      changes in overall social function.  We will also explore the relative efficacy of Sodium
      Valproate (Depakote, DEP) in improving clinical and overall social function among TOX
      exposed and unexposed patients.

      Hypotheses

        1. At baseline, TOX exposure is associated with increased novelty seeking, clinical
           severity, and impaired cognitive and overall social function in patients with SZ.

        2. Adjunctive DEP treatment improves clinical symptoms, cognitive and social function in
           SZ, particularly among TOX exposed SZ patients.

        3. Exploratory hypothesis: adjunctive DEP reduces serological indices of TOX infection
           (VIP and TH levels).

    <description>Sodium Valproate treatment:During the entry period, all patients will have a placebo run-in for two weeks after which they will be evaluated for the outcome variables and then randomized to either Sodium Valproate (Depakote, DEP) or placebo (PLA) group in a 1:1 proportion.  For the Sodium Valproate treatment grou, this will be followed by a two week period to adjust the dose of DEP and attain therapeutic levels (50-100 µg/mL).  Then DEP treatment will continue for 16 more weeks, after which DEP will be discontinued.  Subject will be followed up for four weeks post-DEP discontinuation to monitor delayed adverse side effects.</description>
