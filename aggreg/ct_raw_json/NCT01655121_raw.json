Fiber has been proven to increase the excretion of nitrogen products and\n      consequently reduce its blood levels and an adequate protein intake (1.2g/kg) has shown to\n      decrease endogenous catabolism in cirrhotics patients.\n\n      The implementation of a high protein high fiber nutrition plan and improves nutritional\n      status of patients with autoimmune cirrhosis."
