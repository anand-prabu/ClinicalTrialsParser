  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3 study placebo-controlled, randomized study to determine the effectiveness
      of the rotavirus vaccine. The hypothesis is that a three dose series of BRV-PV administered
      orally to healthy Indian infants, with the initial dose given at 6-8 weeks of age and
      followed by vaccinations at monthly intervals, will significantly reduce the incidence of
      severe rotavirus gastroenteritis (SRVGE). Duration of follow-up is until aged 2 years of
      each enrolled child. The study is powered to detect vaccine efficacy significantly greater
      than 10% (95% confidence interval lower bound &gt; 10%) if the true vaccine efficacy is 50% or
      higher.
