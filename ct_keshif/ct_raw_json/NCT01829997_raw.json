            "textblock": "Spine fusion is one of the most common procedures performed in spinal surgery. Several\n      surgical techniques can achieve a solid union, but the intertransverse posterolateral fusion\n      (PLF) is the most widely used. However, complications can develop when the bone graft\n      material used is insufficient to achieve the desired fusion. With its unique properties,\n      nanOss Bioactive 3D can be mixed with bone marrow aspirate (BMA) and autograft bone to\n      obtain new bone growth during the healing process.\n\n      nanOss Bioactive 3D is approved for use in the U.S., however, additional information is\n      useful to assess its efficacy in the posterolateral spine.  The purpose of this study is to\n      assess fusion results in the posterolateral spine using nanOss Bioactive 3D mixed with\n      autograft bone and BMA.  It is hypothesized that the use of nanOss Bioactive 3D will result\n      in fusion at 12 months, with CT evidence of bridging trabecular bone, less than 3mm of\n      translational motion, and less than 5 degrees of angular motion."
