The dose of imatinib (Glivec),\n      nilotinib (Tasigna) or dasatinib (Sprycel) treatment will initially be cut to half the\n      standard dose for 12 months, and then treatment will be stopped completely for a further two\n      years. The trial information will also help to develop a de-escalation and stopping strategy\n      for future newly diagnosed CML patients in the next British national CML study (to be known\n      as SPIRIT3)."

DESTINY also includes scientific bolt-on studies, quality of life assessments and\n      health economic evaluation."

If the results over the\n                  preceding 12 months are a mix of MMR and undetectable BCR-ABL1, then the patient\n                  is eligible for the MMR but not the MR4 group.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  Age under 18\n\n          -  Life expectancy predicted to be less than 37 months because of intercurrent illness\n             (e.g. heart, renal, respiratory or active malignant disease) that might preclude\n             completion of the study\n\n          -  CML in accelerated phase or blast crisis at any time\n\n          -  Any molecular result during the preceding 12 months that is not in either MMR or MR4.\n\n          -  Treatment with higher than standard TKI doses ('standard' is defined as imatinib\n             400mg daily, nilotinib 400mg twice daily or dasatinib 100mg daily)\n\n          -  Patients who switched previous licensed TKI treatment (imatinib, nilotinib or\n             dasatinib) twice or more because of intolerance.\n\n          -  Patients who switched previous licensed TKI treatment (imatinib, nilotinib or\n             dasatinib) because of resistance.\n\n          -  Patients treated with lower than standard TKI doses (imatinib 400mg daily, nilotinib\n             400mg twice daily or dasatinib 100mg daily) for tolerance reasons may be included,\n             but will de-escalate to the same doses as for standard dose patients and will be\n             analysed separately, as they could be seen as undertreated.\n\n          -  Previous treatment with ponatinib or bosutinib. Patients who received interferon\n             prior to commencing TKI (even if resistant to their interferon) are eligible,\n             provided their response to TKI fits the entry criteria.\n\n          -  Pregnant or lactating women\n\n          -  Women of childbearing potential (including women whose last menstrual period was less\n             than one year prior to screening) who are unable or unwilling to use adequate\n             contraception from study start to one year after the last dose of protocol therapy.\n             Adequate contraception is defined as hormonal birth control, intrauterine device,\n             double barrier method or total abstinence."
