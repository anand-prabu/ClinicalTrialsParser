The investigators hypothesize that there will be\n      (1) significant improvement in thinking and reasoning ability after starting buprenorphine\n      treatment compared to methadone treatment, among participants with and without HIV at 3 and\n      6 months compared to baseline; (2) HIV positive participants will demonstrate significant\n      improvement in thinking and reasoning ability at 3 and 6 months compared to baseline, but\n      that their thinking and reasoning ability will still be lower than HIV negative\n      participants; and (3) there will be biomarkers in participants' blood samples that will be\n      associated with measures of change in thinking and reasoning ability."
