Participants will be tested in the KBR Human\n      Performance Lab on the campus of Winston Salem State University (WSSU).  Participants will\n      complete a demographic form and a survey about their knee pain and function.  Participants\n      will be evaluated under two conditions:  1) with SAI placed inside the shoe and 2) shoes\n      alone.  There are  three walking tasks: 1) walking 25 feet at their usual pace; 2) walking\n      25 feet at a fast pace; 3) walking six minutes for distance; and a 4) biomechanical gait\n      analysis.  After each of the walks, participants will rate the amount of knee pain they\n      experienced.  During the biomechanical analysis, participants will walk down a 20 foot\n      walkway while wearing reflective markers.  Eight cameras and a force plate embedded in the\n      walkway will measure the amount of body movement and the forces applied to the leg joints\n      during walking."
