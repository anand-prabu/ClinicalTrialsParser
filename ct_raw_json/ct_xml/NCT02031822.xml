  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Headache is one of the most common reasons for patients to access healthcare. Greater
      occipital nerve (GON) block with local anesthetic and steroid has been described for the
      management of primary headache refractory to conventional treatment. Two ultrasound
      (US)-guided techniques for greater occipital nerve (GON) block have been described for the
      management of refractory headache syndromes: a proximal technique performed at the level of
      the second cervical vertebra and a distal technique performed at the level of the superior
      nuchal line. Our airm is to compare the accuracy, efficacy and safety of these two
      techniques in patients with refractory headaches.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We conducted a double-blinded, randomized control trial to compare accuracy, efficacy and
      safety of these two techniques in patients with refractory headache syndromes. Following REB
      approval, 40 patients with moderate or severe refractory headaches (intensity score&gt;4/10)
      will be randomized to the &quot;proximal&quot; or &quot;distal&quot; groups with a 1:1 allocation. Each patient
      receives an injection of 2ml of 0.5% bupivacaine with 40mg of methylprednisolone. The null
      hypothesis is that there is no difference in intensity scores for headache at one month
      after the interventions. Outcomes related to efficacy (numbness immediately after the
      injection, reduction in episodes of severe headache, sleep quality), performance (time taken
      for and discomfort during procedure), and safety (incidence of hematoma, intravascular
      injection) are measured after one month.

    <description>This would include NRS for headache at 24 hrs and 3 months after the intervention, patient satisfaction with the block, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale at 1 month compared to baseline, SF-36 Short Form Health Survey to measure improvement in functional status compared to baseline, quality of sleep and average hours of restful sleep at night.</description>

    <description>We will measure performance time from contact of US probe with skin to the end of the procedure, procedural discomfort as rated by NRS, number of needle re-adjustments and evidence of sensory block as confirmed by the loss of pin-prick sensation in the dermatomal distribution of GON, and visualization of GON.</description>

    <description>Any immediate post intervention complications will be recorded (e.g. hematoma, vascular puncture, dizziness). Occurrence of any long-term adverse effects (e.g. infection, numbness, alopecia) will be recorded at 1 month following the intervention.</description>
