    <textblock>
      This study is a biospecimen discovery project that will serve as a pilot for a comprehensive
      'omics approach using fresh core biopsy tissue and blood samples for DNA and protein
      analysis, as well as paired tumor-normal exome DNA and RNA sequencing.

      This study will be conducted at select NSABP sites where investigators are willing to give
      paclitaxel plus trastuzumab before the anthracycline-based component of neoadjuvant therapy
      as a pilot for a comprehensive 'omics approach using next generation sequencing and protein
      expression and post-translational modification analysis using mass spectrometry (MS) based
      and Reverse Phase Protein Array-based proteomics.  Tumor samples will be obtained at
      baseline and 48 to 72 hours after initial drug treatment to study variation in the
      biological responses to these agents.  The study of tumors both before and early after the
      first treatment probes the biological responses to treatment and is rich source of
      predictive biomarkers.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The diagnosis of invasive adenocarcinoma of the breast must have been made by core
             needle biopsy or limited incisional biopsy.

          -  The breast cancer must be HER2-positive based on current ASCO/CAP (American Society
             of Clinical Oncology/College of American Pathologists) Guideline Recommendations for
             Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 Testing in Breast Cancer.

          -  The patient must have a mass in the breast measuring greater than or equal to 2.0 cm
             by physical exam and/or ultrasound that is accessible and safe for repeat biopsy.
             Patients with a diagnosis of inflammatory breast cancer are eligible if there is a
             palpable or detectable breast mass that is accessible and safe for repeat biopsy.

          -  Planned initial treatment with a combination of paclitaxel and trastuzumab.  Schedule
             for paclitaxel/trastuzumab administration is per the investigator.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Excisional biopsy or lumpectomy performed prior to registration.

          -  Previous therapy with chemotherapy or targeted therapy for any malignancy.

          -  Treatment, including radiation therapy (RT), chemotherapy, and/or targeted therapy,
             administered for the currently diagnosed breast cancer prior to registration.

          -  Other nonmalignant systemic disease that would preclude the patient from receiving
             chemotherapy and targeted therapy.
