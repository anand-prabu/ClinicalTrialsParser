Adult onset vitelliform detachments\n      have an accumulation of material on the outer retina. Over time, the abnormal accumulation\n      of this material can damage cells that are critical for clear central vision. As a result,\n      people with this disorder often lose their central vision, and their eyesight may become\n      blurry or distorted."

            "textblock": "Subretinal fluid is thought to play a role in the formation of vitelliform detachments,\n      which are associated with progressive vision loss. Fluid in the subretinal space disrupts\n      the physical apposition between photoreceptor outer segments and retinal pigment epithelial\n      cells, which may in turn hinder the phagocytosis of shed photoreceptor outer segments.\n      Material derived from the unphagocytized outer segments may accumulate in the subretinal\n      space to form vitelliform lesions, resulting in a persistent detachment.  Anti-VEGF therapy\n      in the form of intravitreal aflibercept injections may be useful in controlling or\n      eliminating subretinal fluid, thus promoting contact between photoreceptor outer segments\n      and the retinal pigment epithelium. Vitelliform detachments may resolve subsequent to the\n      removal of subretinal fluid and restoration of contact-dependent mechanisms of photoreceptor\n      outer segment recycling."
