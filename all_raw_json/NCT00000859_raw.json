This study\n      will compare 2 protease inhibitors, NFV and RTV for efficacy and safety in a population with\n      advanced HIV disease, who are taking various background nucleoside therapies.\n\n      Eligible patients will be randomized either to NFV plus background AR nucleoside therapy or\n      to RTV plus background AR nucleoside therapy. Background AR therapy may also be no\n      background therapy, although use of protease inhibitors as monotherapy is not recommended\n      unless there is no alternative.

Switchover for intolerance is strongly discouraged during the first 4\n      weeks of follow-up. Patients initially assigned to NFV therapy who experience disease\n      progression may switch to RTV; if RTV is not tolerated, patients may switch to IDV.

Conversely, patients originally assigned to RTV should change to NFV\n      or enroll in the PIP protocol (such patients continue to be followed on this study).\n      Because of cross-resistance between RTV and IDV, change from RTV to IDV is discouraged.\n      Determination of poor virologic control or disease progression is at the discretion of the\n      patient's clinician.

These patients will have a plasma sample collected for HIV RNA and\n      genotypic resistance within 30 days prior to randomization, at the 1-month visit, and at the\n      q-4-month study visits thereafter until the end of the study. CD4+ cell counts will be done\n      at the 1-month visit and at the q-4-month study visits until the end of the study. A subset\n      of patients will also have immunophenotyping of CD4+ and CD8+ cell TCR V-beta clones carried\n      out before and during treatment. Another subset of patients at selected sites will have\n      viral cultures performed for phenotypic drug sensitivity testing.\n\n      Initially, specimens for 50 randomly chosen patients in the group originally assigned RTV\n      will be identified for resistance testing. Of this group, specimens for those who have\n      received RTV/IDV for more than 1 month will be analyzed for genotypic resistance to obtain\n      an estimate of the rate of resistance development and to estimate the risk of disease\n      progression associated with resistance to RTV/ZDV. Based on these estimates, determination\n      will be made of the total number of patients and specimens in both treatment groups in order\n      to address the primary objective of comparing genotypic resistance in the two groups.]"
