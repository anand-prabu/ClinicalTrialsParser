The incidence of VTE increases with age and it - as\n      the third most common cardiovascular disease after ischemic heart disease and stroke -\n      represents an important public health problem in industrialized countries with several\n      aspects in need to be addressed.\n\n      VTEval Project is a long-term prospective observational study to evaluate and improve VTE\n      diagnostics and management, treatment and outcome. The aims of the project include a\n      systematic assessment of VTE, i.e. disease status (symptoms, clinical and subclinical\n      aspects) and risk profiles (classic, psychosocial and environmental factors), using a\n      system-oriented approach. VTEval collects three large prospective cohorts of patients with\n      suspected and incident VTE consisting of individuals with a clinical suspicion of acute PE,\n      individuals with a clinical suspicion of acute DVT, and individuals with incidental\n      diagnosis of VTE).\n\n      The standardized and harmonized data acquisition of the study establishes a sustainable\n      resource for comprehensive research on VTE, thus providing the basis for both short- and\n      long-term analysis."
