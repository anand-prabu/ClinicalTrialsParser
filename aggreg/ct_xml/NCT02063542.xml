  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous study demonstrated that the condition of central cholinergic nerve is important for
      the postoperative cognitive dysfunction. In present study investigators hypothesized that
      the acetylcholine concentration in the cerebral spinal fluid is associated to the
      postoperative cognitive changes in aged patients undergoing osteopathic surgery.
