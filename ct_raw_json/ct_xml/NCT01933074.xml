  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to gain a better understanding of what causes urinary urgency
      in women by asking about different symptoms and measuring biomarker levels in their urine.
      Understanding the underlying causes of urinary urgency will allow us to develop treatment
      options to better take care of women with urinary urgency.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We propose to test the hypothesis that urinary urgency in women is caused by neurogenic
      inflammation that is manifested clinically as neuropathic pain and associated with the
      expression of neuroinflammatory biomarkers in the urine.

    <description>We propose a prospective cross-sectional study.  We will recruit 137 women with urinary urgency and without incontinence or infection.  All women will complete validated symptom questionnaires to measure neuropathic pain, urinary, bowel, sexual symptoms and quality of life.  All patients will bring a first morning clean catch urine void to the office on ice within one week of completing the questionnaires.  The specimen will be transported to the lab within 24 hours and stored at -80 degrees. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) will be used to determine expression of urinary creatinine and neuropeptides.  The primary outcome will be the severity of urinary symptoms as measured by the Interstitial Cystitis Symptom Index.</description>

    <description>To determine the association between the severity of neuropathic pain and expression of urinary neurotrophic peptides in women with urgency.  We hypothesize that in women with urinary urgency, increasing severity of neuropathic pain will be associated with increasing levels of urinary neurotrophic peptides NGF and BDNF. Nerve growth factor (NGF) and Brain-Derived Neurotrophic factor (BDNF) - NGF and BDNF are neurotrophic growth factors that are released in urine from different cell types in the bladder wall making urine a convenient sample for measurement of their levels.  Activation of the myelinated A fiber and unmyelinated C fibers in the bladder wall can lead to an elevation in NGF and BDNF levels, sensitization of bladder afferent pathways and development of neurogenic inflammation in the urinary bladder [2,3].</description>
