  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is part of a larger consortium project investigating the validity and best use of
      next-generation sequencing (in particular, whole exome sequencing, or WES) in clinical care.
      This sub-project is investigating benefits and harms of providing WES diagnostic and
      different types of incidental findings to adult patients and parents of pediatric patients
      who undergo WES because they have symptoms suggesting genetic disease.

      This study is part of a larger consortium project investigating the validity and best use of
      next-generation sequencing (in particular, whole exome sequencing, or WES) in clinical care.
      Participants are patients who were either seen in the UNC Cancer and Adult Genetics Clinic
      or referred to the study by their physician. They will be approached by their physician or a
      genetic counselor for recruitment. Once enrolled, a clinical geneticist or genetic counselor
      will obtain consent and collect blood samples to be analyzed using WES. Results may include
      information related to a diagnosis and incidental information. Medically actionable
      incidental findings will be CLIA-certified and returned to participants in a routine genetic
      counseling session, along with diagnostic findings. Eligible adult participants will be
      randomized to have the opportunity to choose to get certain types of non-medically
      actionable incidental findings, as well. Their decisions will be investigated, as will
      psychosocial and behavioral responses to sequencing and receiving sequencing information.
      This is a longitudinal, mixed methods study (i.e., multiple assessments pre- and post-return
      of results, with both quantitative and qualitative methods used to gather data). Because
      only the quantitative component of the study uses randomization, only measures and
      procedures associated with that component are described here.

      <textblock>
        - To receive whole exome sequencing in the study, adult or child patients must have a
        significant chance of having a genetic disorder, as determined by experts on the study
        team using criteria that depend on the genetic disorder in question. Representative
        criteria are listed below and will be considered together to determine whether patterns
        indicate a likely genetic etiology.

          -  Age of diagnosis

          -  Presence of bilateral (or multiple) cancers

          -  Diagnosis of a rare type of cancer

          -  Details of the family history

        Cardiovascular Conditions

          -  Certain clinical findings, such as prolonged QT interval on electrocardiogram.

          -  Presence of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or aortic aneurysm

          -  Age of diagnosis

          -  Presence of family history
