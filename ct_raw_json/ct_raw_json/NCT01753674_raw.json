Randomization will be done in a\n      sequential manner; the first subject will be allocated to supplement A and the next one to\n      supplement B and so on. After a 3-week washout, they will be allocated to the alternate\n      treatment for additional 12 weeks. Supplements (TA-65 or placebo) will be taken twice daily\n      with a meal.\n\n      Participants will be advised not to change their diet or exercise protocols during the 27\n      week intervention. Volunteers will be required to provide a 5-day dietary record before\n      starting the study, at the end of each supplement period (TA-65 or placebo) and at the end\n      of the washout period. Subjects will have to fill an exercise questionnaire during the same\n      times to ensure that there are no changes in physical activity.  Participants will be asked\n      to report to the department every 4 weeks for checking compliance on supplement intake and\n      to assess weight and blood pressure."
