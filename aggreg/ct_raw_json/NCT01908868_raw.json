Real-time convex probe endobronchial\n      ultrasound-guided TBNA (EBUS-TBNA) has shown immense potential, however it is costly, labor\n      intensive and still has limited availability, especially in low and middle income countries.\n      In the past, TBLB has been the bronchoscopic procedure of choice for diagnosis of\n      sarcoidosis however currently its role is being debated with the advent of EBUS. We have\n      observed that EBUS even though has high yield yet the optimal diagnosis is obtained only\n      when combined with EBB and TBLB. The investigators hypothesize that conventional or\n      EBUS-TBNA will have equal efficiency in diagnosing sarcoidosis when performed in conjunction\n      with endobronchial and transbronchial lung biopsy.\n\n      The study compares the diagnostic yield of EBUS-TBNA (plus EBB and TBLB) vs. conventional\n      TBNA (plus EBB and TBLB) for diagnosis of sarcoidosis."
