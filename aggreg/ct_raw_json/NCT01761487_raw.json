In Israel, the death rate among CRKP carriers is 3.5 times\n      higher than in Carbapenem-sensitive Klebsiella pneumonia carriers (44% vs. 12.5%,\n      respectively).\n\n      In the investigators' previous study: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial\n      of Selective Digestive Decontamination (SDD) Using Oral Gentamicin and Oral Polymyxin E for\n      Eradication of CRKP Carriage (Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol. 2012;33:14-19) the\n      investigators have shown that the investigators' SDD regimen is effective for decolonization\n      patients colonized with CRKP.\n\n      The investigators' assumption is that a higher dose of polymyxin E together with gentamicin\n      (SDD drugs) for a prolonged period is needed to overcome the likelihood of a high rate of\n      drug inactivation in the gut, thereby reaching CRKP carriage eradication."
