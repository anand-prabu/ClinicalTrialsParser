This could be a\n      significant advance in a field where treatment outcomes have stabilized in the last 15\n      years. This study will be the basis for further prospective, randomized, multicenter trial\n      comparing idarubicin maximum tolerated dose, compared to standard treatment with idarubicin\n      and cytarabine, including raising both arms in G-CSF. The dose of 12 mg/m2 will be\n      administered as control arm in this future randomized study, which will investigate the\n      benefit of enhanced dose identified as optimal in this phase II pilot study."
