      This is a special drug use surveillance on long-term use of alogliptin, designed to
      investigate the safety and efficacy of treatment with alogliptin  in patients with mild type
      2 diabetes mellitus in the routine clinical setting.

      Participants will be patients with mild type 2 diabetes mellitus. The planned sample size is
      20,000.

      The usual adult dosage for oral use is 1 alogliptin tablet (25 mg of alogliptin) once daily.
