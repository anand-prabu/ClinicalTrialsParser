    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of an innovative program, entitled CRISP
      (Community Integration for Socially Isolated Patients), on improving self-efficacy and
      assessing whether improved self-efficacy helps to reduce depression and loneliness of people
      with MS.

    <measure>Multiple Sclerosis Self-Efficacy Scale (MSSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to week 12</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The Multiple Sclerosis Self-Efficacy Scale (MSSS) is designed to measure self-efficacy in people diagnosed with MS. The MSSS incorporates aspects of social interaction and themes related to beliefs of control over future events, which is based on Bandura's definition of self-efficacy (Rigby et al., 2003). The MSSS is a 14 item, six-point Likert scale and participants are asked to rate their level of agreement or disagreement for each item on the scale ranging from 'strongly disagree' (1) to 'strongly agree' (6). Examples of questions include &quot;sometimes I feel embarrassed in public places&quot; or &quot;I have as much independence as I need.&quot; Scores can range from 14 (low self-efficacy) to 84 (high self-efficacy).</description>

    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to week 12</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The General Self-Efficacy Scale is a ten question scale designed to measure self-efficacy.  Participants are requested to rate questions about self-efficacy on a scale of 1-4, 1 indicating &quot;not true at all,&quot; and 4 indicating &quot;exactly true.&quot; Examples of questions include &quot;I can always manage to solve difficult problems if I try hard enough,&quot; or &quot;I am confident I could deal efficiently with unexpected events.&quot; Scores from the 10 questions are summed based on the answers and could range from 10 (low self-efficacy) to 40 (high self-efficacy).</description>

    <measure>UCLA Revised Loneliness Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to week 12</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The UCLA Revised Loneliness Scale was developed to assess subjective feelings of loneliness and is widely used in loneliness research. The scale consists of 20 questions about loneliness asking participants to rate each question from 1 (never) to 4 (always), higher scores indicating greater degrees of loneliness.</description>

    <measure>Chicago Multiscale Depression Inventory (CMDI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to week 12</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The Chicago Multiscale Depression Inventory will be used to assess symptoms of depression. The CMDI is a 50-item self-report measure that includes three subscales representing different types of depression symptoms: vegetative, mood, and evaluative. Each item on the scale consists of a single word or brief phrase describing feelings or experiences and participants rate each item on a Likert scale from 1 (not at all) to 5 (extremely).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Performance Scales (PS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to week 12</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The Performance Scales (PS) is a self-reported measure of MS disease status assessing mobility, hand function, vision, fatigue, cognitive symptoms, bladder/bowel, sensory symptoms, spasticity, pain, depression, and tremor/coordination. Each scale of the PS (with the exception of the mobility scale) is a 6 item ordinal scale and participants are asked to describe their functioning in each area as compared to before they developed MS. Scores range from normal (0) to total disability in specified area (5) with higher scores indicating greater perceived disability. The mobility scale has a range from normal (0) to total gait disability or bedridden (6) and asks participants to choose the category that describes their walking ability in the past four weeks.</description>

    <measure>Community Integration Questionnaire (CIQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to week 12</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The Community Integration Questionnaire (CIQ) was developed to assess community integration after an injury with questions about home integration, social integration and productive activities. The CIQ is a 15 item self-report measure. The basis for scoring is by the frequency of performing specific activities and providing subtotals for each category of community integration as well as an overall score.</description>
