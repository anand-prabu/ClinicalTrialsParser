Patients are randomized into 5 arms, each consisting of 10\n      healthy volunteers and 5 patients with cystic fibrosis, based on the amount of ibuprofen\n      received during the treatment period.\n\n      The study period lasts for at least 15 days and consists of 3 periods: baseline (days 1-3),\n      treatment (days 3-12), and recovery (days 13-15 or longer).  During the treatment period\n      patients receive ibuprofen orally every 12 hours (except for a control arm that receives no\n      ibuprofen)."
