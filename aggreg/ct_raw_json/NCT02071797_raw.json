Any patient\n      with return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) following a cardiac arrest within the Essex\n      Cardiothoracic Centre (CTC), or who is brought to the Essex CTC and is a candidate for TH\n      will be considered for this study."

Patients will have a baseline tympanic temperature measurement taken and then\n      will be randomized to receive induction of TH by either RhinoChill Transnasal cooling\n      system, or standard care using the Blanketrol III cooling blanket.\n\n      All patients will have tympanic and oesophageal temperature measurement every 10 minutes\n      until they reach TH (<34 degrees centigrade). Once TH is achieved, the RhinoChill will be\n      discontinued, and all patients will then receive the Blanketrol III cooling blanket for\n      maintenance of TH for the standard 24 hour period. If a patient achieves a core body temp of\n      34 degrees centigrade while undergoing RhinoChill cooling and is still on the cath lab\n      table, the device will be turned to low flow to ensure that the temperature is maintained\n      until a transfer to the Blanketrol system is possible. For patients that arrive in the ICU\n      on RhinoChill with a temperature >34 (i.e. have not reached TH), these patients will have\n      RhinoChill and blanket therapy until they reach <34 degrees centigrade when the RhinoChill\n      will be discontinued."
