            "textblock": "Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is defined as a disease state characterized by\n      the presence of airflow obstruction due to chronic bronchitis or emphysema. The airflow\n      obstruction is generally progressive, may be accompanied by airway hyper-reactivity, and may\n      be partially reversible. Inflammation in the lungs is triggered by exposure to inhaled toxic\n      substances that can lead to tissue damage, mucous secretion, airways narrowing and tissue\n      destruction.\n\n      Interleukin-8 (IL-8) plays a major role in elevating sputum in patients with COPD and may\n      contribute to tissue destruction.  Therefore, the highly specific antibody to IL-8 (such as\n      ABX-IL8) may help to reduce mucous production and tissue destruction."
