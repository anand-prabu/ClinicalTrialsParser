The investigator needs to\n      know how much DNA in order to better interpret our radiation detection test. Therefore, the\n      investigator is collecting blood from several patients with different diseases or medical\n      conditions and also healthy volunteers to measure their DNA content.\n\n      Patients that will be included in this study are pregnant women, patients who have suffered\n      a pulmonary embolism within the past 48 hours, patients who have suffered from myocardial\n      infarction in the past 48 hours, patients with autoimmune diseases and health patients."
