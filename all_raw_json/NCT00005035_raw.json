Characterize the toxicities and\n      pharmacokinetics of this drug in this patient population. III. Determine the duration of\n      response, time to progression, and survival of these patients receiving this drug.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to prior treatment with neoadjuvant chemotherapy\n      (yes vs no). Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours weekly for 4 weeks followed by 2\n      weeks of rest. Treatment continues every 6 weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or\n      disease progression. Patients are followed until toxicity resolves or for no less than 30\n      days.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 34-74 patients will be accrued for this study within 17\n      months."
