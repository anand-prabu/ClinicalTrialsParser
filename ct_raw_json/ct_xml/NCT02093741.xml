    <textblock>
      This is a Post-Authorization Safety Surveillance (PASS) study designed to collect data on
      the safety and effectiveness of ADVATE reconstituted in 2 mL Sterile water for injection
      (SWFI) during routine clinical practice in children until 12 years of age. This surveillance
      study is a post-licensure commitment for ADVATE reconstituted in 2 mL SWFI.

          -  Participant has a requirement for a major surgical procedure at the time of
             enrollment

          -  Participant has no prior exposure to a FVIII concentrate

          -  Participant currently being treated with an immune tolerance induction (ITI) regimen

          -  Participant has been diagnosed with an inherited or acquired hemostatic defect other
             than hemophilia A (eg, qualitative platelet defect or von Willebrand disease)

          -  Participant has participated in another clinical study involving an investigational
             product (IP) or investigational device within 30 days prior to enrollment or is
             scheduled to participate in another clinical study involving an IP or investigational
             device or PASS registry during the course of this study
