      The investigators study the VEGF signaling in HCC cell lines and its mechanism in HCC
      growth, proliferation and apoptosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Several studies have documented the elevated expression of VEGF, VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 in HCC
      cell lines and tumor tissues. Another study observed a sequential elevation of VEGF in
      low-grade dysplasia, high-grade dysplasia and early stage HCC. Clinical analyses have
      discovered the high expression of VEGF is correlated with tumor progression, vascular
      invasion, distal metastasis and poor prognosis. However, few studies have been conducted to
      investigate the VEGF signaling in HCC cells and its possible mechanism in regulating HCC
      growth.Therefore,we try to clarify the mechanism of VEGF signal in HCC growth,proliferation
      and apoptosis.

      Cut tissue into small pieces (~2 mm2)and wash in drops of saline (1x PBS). Place pieces
      individually into LN2 in Styrofoam cup. Transfer pieces into LN2-cooled 1.5 mL cryovial.
      Pour out excess LN2 from vial, then seal and keep in LN2 until freezer storage.
