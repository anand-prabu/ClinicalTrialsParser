Brachytherapy may\n      kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of brachytherapy in treating patients\n      who have recurrent prostate cancer that has not responded to standard therapy."

            "textblock": "OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the dosimetry and toxicity of interstitial colloidal phosphorus P32\n      (cP32) in patients with locally recurrent prostate cancer that has failed conventional\n      therapy. II. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of interstitial cP32 when combined with\n      interstitial macroaggregated albumin (infusional brachytherapy) in these patients. III.\n      Determine the therapeutic response rate to acceptable single doses of cP32 in these\n      patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of colloidal phosphorus P32 (cP32). Patients\n      receive cP32 and macroaggregated albumin via interstitial infusion using ultrasound\n      localization. Cohorts of 3 patients receive escalating doses of cP32 until the maximum\n      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which 2 of 4 patients\n      experience dose limiting toxicities. Additional patients are treated at the MTD. Patients\n      are followed at 1, 2, 4, and 6 weeks; then at 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 months; and then\n      every 6 months thereafter until death.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-25 patients will be accrued for phase I of the study and a\n      total of 40 patients will be accrued for phase II of the study."
