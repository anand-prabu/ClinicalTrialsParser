    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and the best dose of MK-1775 (WEE1 inhibitor
      MK-1775) when given together with local radiation therapy in treating patients with newly
      diagnosed diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas. WEE1 inhibitor MK-1775 may stop the growth of
      tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Radiation therapy uses
      high energy x rays to kill tumor cells. Giving WEE1 inhibitor MK-1775 with local radiation
      therapy may work better than local radiation therapy alone in treating diffuse intrinsic
      pontine gliomas.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended phase 2 dose and schedule of
      the Wee1 inhibitor MK-1775 administered concurrently with radiation therapy in children with
      newly diagnosed diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG).

      II. To define and describe the toxicities of MK-1775 given concurrently with radiation
      therapy in children with newly diagnosed DIPG.

      III. To characterize the pharmacokinetics of MK-1775 in children with newly diagnosed DIPG.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To preliminarily define the antitumor activity of MK-1775 within the confines of a phase
      1 study, including response rate, progression free survival, and overall survival of treated
      patients.

      II. To assess the biologic activity of MK-1775 by measuring expression of
      phosphorylated-cell division cycle 2 G1 to S and G2 to M (p-CDC2) (cyclin-dependent kinase 1
      [CDK1]) and phosphorylated-Histone H3 (p-HH3) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)
      before and after administration of MK-1775 in children with newly diagnosed DIPG.

      III. To assess the biologic activity of MK-1775 by measuring expression of gamma-H2A histone
      family, member X (H2AX) in PBMCs, a marker of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) double-strand
      breaks (dsDNA), before and after administration of MK-1775 in children with newly diagnosed
      DIPG.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of WEE1 inhibitor MK-1775.

      Patients undergo radiation therapy 5 days a week for 6 weeks (up to 30 fractions). Patients
      also receive WEE1 inhibitor MK-1775 orally (PO) on days 1-5 of weeks 1, 3, and 5; days 1-5
      of weeks 1, 3, and 5 AND days 1, 3, and 5 of weeks 2, 4, and 6; OR days 1-5 of weeks 1-6
      depending on dose level assignment. Treatment continues in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 2 months for
      6 months, and then every 3 months thereafter.
