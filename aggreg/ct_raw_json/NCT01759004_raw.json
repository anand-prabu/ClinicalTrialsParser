Lipedema is an under-recognized condition, often misdiagnosed as lymfedema or\n      dismissed as simple obesity. The diagnosis of lipedema is a clinical diagnosis and may be\n      challenging to determine among patients who are obese. Measurements of muscle strength and\n      physical fitness may give more clarity to differentiate between lipedema and obesity. This\n      may lead to improvements in the criteria of diagnosing lipedema. The research question of\n      the study is: Is there a difference in muscle strength between adult women with lipedema and\n      adult women with obesity?\n\n      In this study 40 patients will be studied; 20 patients in every group. Besides the general\n      data as length, weight, age, abdominal circumference, volume of the legs additional muscle\n      strength and physical fitness of women with lipedema and women with obesity will be measured\n      and analysis.\n\n      This study doesn't involve a negligible risk for participants. The study will not have\n      direct benefit for the participants, but may be useful in giving more clarity in defining\n      the phenotype for patients with lipedema."

The patient will be instructed to cross a maximum distance in six minutes with a possibility to stop or rest if necessary.16 The result is the walking distance in meters (m) after six minutes (with five meter exactness). The 6MWT is a good test for functional activity. De walking distance performed with the 6MWT gives a good sight in the amount of activities in daily living (ADL) of the performer.17 Rjeski et al.17 found a good validity and correlation with the VO2max (r=0.64) for participants with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
