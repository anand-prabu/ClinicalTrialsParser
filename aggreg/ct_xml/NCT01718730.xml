  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn if measures of brain activity are different in
      children and adolescents with depression who are in different stages of treatment. This is
      important because it may identify a biological marker for depression that could one day be
      used to identify depressed children who would benefit from certain treatments (medications
      for example), or to monitor how well treatments are working. Brain activity measures(known
      as cortical excitability and inhibition) will be collected by Transcranial Magnetic
      Stimulation (TMS). TMS is a noninvasive (no surgery or implants) brain stimulation
      technology which can make parts of the brain work without putting any wires or chemicals
      into the body. Measurements will take place over one 3-hour visit. This study does not
      provide any form of treatment.

      *There is an optional portion of the study that uses a brain scan to gather measures of
      brain structure and brain chemicals. The brain scan is called magnetic resonance and
      spectroscopy (MRI/MRS).  MRI/MRS uses magnetic fields to study the structure of the brain
      and brain chemicals. The PI will determine eligibility for the MRI/MRS portion of the study.

      This study is focused on understanding the neurophysiology of major depressive disorder
      (MDD), and the impact of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in children and
      adolescents. This is a cross-sectional study which will utilize single and paired-pulse
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to collect measures of glutamatergic cortical
      excitability (the motor threshold and intracortical facilitation), and GABAergic cortical
      inhibition (the cortical silent period and intracortical inhibition) of the motor cortex in
      chilren and adolescents in various disease states of MDD. The optional proton magnetic
      resonance spectroscopy and imaging scans (MRS/MRI) at 3 Tesla (3T) will examine glutamate
      concentrations in the motor cortex and anterior cingulate cortex.

      This is a biomarker study (MRI/MRS and TMS neurophysiology measures); treatment is not
      provided in any form. This study will not utilize Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic
      Stimulation (rTMS).

    <description>Motor Threshold (MT) is a single-pulse TMS measure of cortical excitability. A higher MT indicates decreased cortical excitability. Intracortical Facilitation (ICF) is a paired-pulse TMS measure of cortical excitability. A higher ICF indicates increased cortical excitability. Cortical Silent Period (CSP) is a single-pulse TMS measure of cortical inhibition. Longer CSP durations indicate greater cortical inhibition. Intracortical Inhibition (ICI) is a paired pulse TMS measure of cortical inhibition. A lower ICI indicates increased cortical inhibition, and a higher ICI indicates decreased cortical inhibition.</description>

        This protocol will plan to screen depressed children and adolescents who are seeking
        treatment at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN, using strict inclusion and exclusion criteria.
        These adolescents will represent gender and minority distribution consistent with the
        Rochester metro/rural area demographic distribution. This study will be inclusive of all
        races, genders, and socioeconomic classes.
