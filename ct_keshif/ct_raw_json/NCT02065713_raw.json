The efficacy\n      of synthetic or biologic disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) on dactylitis has\n      not been previously studied in randomized controlled trials as a primary endpoint.\n\n      In this investigator initiated clinical trial the investigators aim to test the hypothesis\n      that the combination therapy of golimumab and methotrexate (MTX) will result in a\n      significant improvement of dactylitis in comparison with MTX monotherapy, in MTX na\u00efve\n      psoriatic arthritis patients, at week 24. Similarly the efficacy on enthesitis, peripheral\n      and axial involvement, skin and nail psoriasis, inflammation and damage of the feet and\n      hands assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), composite indexes of disease activity,\n      remission, function and quality of life will be determined.\n\n      This is a national multicentre, interventional, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, parallel\n      design trial. 136 patients with active dactylitis, refractory to at least two systemic\n      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), at optimal dosage, for 3 months will be\n      included and centrally randomized to golimumab in combination with MTX versus MTX\n      monotherapy, in a 1:1 ratio. The study duration will be 24 weeks.\n\n      The investigators expect the results from this trial will contribute to a better definition\n      of the treatment algorithm of PsA patients with dactylitis."
