The\n      strategies to overcome the issue consist of switch to a more potent antiplatelet medications\n      including prasugrel or ticagrelor. Economic constrains of many countries still do not allow\n      wide reimbursement of newer antiplatelet agents. Therefore a strategy to personalise\n      treatment according to genotype and phenotype characteristics of the patient may provide an\n      attractive solution combining high clinical efficacy with low budget impact."
