  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to evaluate accuracy and precision of noninvasive intracranial
      pressure measurement device for selected patients compared with cerebrospinal fluid pressure
      measured during lumbar puncture
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Noninvasive intracranial pressure (ICP) measurements will be compared to simultaneous
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure measurements during lumbar puncture. Measures of pressure
      in mmHg will be compared.  These measurements will be compared in chronic daily headache,
      normal pressure hydrocephalus and multiple sclerosis patients groups. For stroke patients
      noninvasive measurements will be compared with cerebral lesion in brain MRI/CT.

    <description>CSF pressure in mmHg will be compared with noninvasive ICP measurements simultaneously during measurement procedures lasting around 15 minutes.

    <description>Patients with chronic daily headache with suspicion of intracranial hypertension selected. Selection based on clinical symptoms (headache description, leading symptoms)and para-clinical pathological findings (optical nerve papilla edema). Not enough evidence to diagnose any other headache type. Simultaneous CSF pressure measurements and noninvasive ICP measurement performed.
Interventions: noninvasive intracranial pressure measurement; lumbar puncture and cerebrospinal fluid pressure measurement; brain MRI/CT.</description>

    <description>Multiple sclerosis (MS) group patients selected based on clinical symptoms and brain MRI changes typical for the disease. Diagnosis based on McDonalds criteria. CSF test for oligoclonal bands required as supporting diagnostic criteria. Patients selected with disease relapse symptoms. Simultaneous noninvasive ICP and CSF pressure measured.

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Patients selected for this group have stroke/intracranial hemorrhage that might be complicated with intracranial hypertension. Stroke/intracranial hemorrhage diagnosed based on clinical findings and changes on brain CT/MRI. Patients with stroke less than 33% of middle cerebral artery territory included. Patients with intracranial hemorrhage 20-40 ml volume included. Patients unable to cooperate or sign informed consent excluded.
Bilateral noninvasive ICP measurements performed. Results compared with brain MRI/CT lesion volume, mid-line shift.

    <description>The noninvasive ICP measurement device used in this study has been developed in Lithuania. The method is based on two-depth transcranial Doppler (TCD) technique for simultaneously measuring flow velocities in the intracranial and extracranial segments of the ophthalmic artery (OA). These measurements are made while applying a series of small pressure steps to the tissues surrounding the eye-ball. The intracranial segment of the OA is compressed by ICP and the extracranial segment of the OA is compressed by the externally applied pressure Pe. Blood flow parameters in both of these OA segments can be monitored which will be approximately equal when Pe = ICP. Two-depth TCD device is used as an  indicator of the balance point (Pe = ICP) when the measured parameters of OA segments are identical</description>

    <description>Lumbar puncture performed in lateral decubitus position while knees and head flexed. After local antiseptics and anesthesia puncture in lumbar 3/4 or 4/5 intervertebral space performed. As CSF appears legs and head are relaxed and slightly straightened. Spinal manometer graded 0-40 cm Hâ‚‚O with stopcock connected to the needle. CSF pressure monitored for 15 minutes and recorded. CSF  collected for diagnostic test. Spinal needle Number 22 and Rocket Spinal Manometer Set (No. R55990) used for this study.</description>
