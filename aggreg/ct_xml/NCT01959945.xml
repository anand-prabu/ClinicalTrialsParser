  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Flublok was studied previously in children 6 -59 months of age and demonstrated less than
      satisfactory immunogenicity results, especially in the 6-36 month age group. Thus, the
      initial introduction of Flublok Quadrivalent Formulation (RIV4) into the pediatric
      population will evaluate immunogenicity and safety older children and adolescents, aged
      6-17. This clinical trial is designed to demonstrate safety and non-inferior immunogenicity
      of Flublok-Q in pediatric subjects 6-17 years of age as compared to IIV4. Positive results
      in this study may support further studies in younger children.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The U.S. Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends that all people ≥6
      months of age receive influenza vaccine annually.  Recommendations for influenza
      immunization of children vary somewhat among countries in the European Union, but
      immunization of children at high risk for complications of influenza infection is
      recommended by WHO and according to criteria in most countries. Currently, the immunization
      practices are progressing to quadrivalent formulations of inactivated influenza vaccines
      (IIV4) which are approved in the US for most of the indicated population.  Additionally,
      live attenuated vaccine (LAIV4) is approved in the U.S. for individuals aged 2-49 years and
      Flublok®(RIV3), a purified trivalent recombinant hemagglutinin protein vaccine is approved
      in the U.S. for adults 18-49 years of age. Children are at particular risk of complications
      of influenza, including the B lineages, so expansion of the Flublok indication into the
      pediatric age group with a quadrivalent formulation is warranted.

        The parent(s) or legal representative(s) of each potential subject must:

          1. Comprehend the study requirements and agree to comply with planned study procedures
             and visits

          2. Provide written consent prior to enrollment and initiation of any study procedures
             Pediatric assent will be obtained in accordance with the Institutional Review
             Board/Independent Ethics Committee determination.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             on nasal or topical steroids will be allowed

          3. Active neoplastic disease or a history of any malignancy.

          4. History of receiving influenza vaccine within the past 6 months or plans during the
             study to receive influenza vaccine outside of this study.

          5. History of receiving immunoglobulin or other blood product within the 3 months prior
             to enrollment in this study.

          6. Receipt of any non-study licensed vaccines within 2 weeks (for inactivated vaccines)
             or 4 weeks (for live vaccines) prior to enrollment in this study, or plans during the
             study to receive a licensed vaccine within 4 weeks of a study dose [See above for
             influenza vaccines].

          7. Acute or chronic medical condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would
             render immunization unsafe or would interfere with the evaluation of immune responses

          8. History of severe reactions following immunization.

          9. An acute illness, including a body temperature greater than 100*F, within 3 days
             prior to immunization.

             in this study, or expectation of receiving an experimental vaccine, medication, or
             blood product during the study Stage in which the subject will participate.

         11. Developmental delay, neurologic disorder, or seizure disorder requiring ongoing
             medical management (note: history of seizure is not an exclusion criterion).

         12. Any other condition or situation that would, in the opinion of the investigator,
             place the potential subject an unacceptable risk of injury or render the subject
             unable to meet the requirements of the protocol.

         13. History of Guillain-Barré syndrome.

         14. Known pregnancy, positive urine or serum pregnancy test within 24 hours prior to
