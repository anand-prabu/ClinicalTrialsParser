For that purpose the nerval stimulation of the bladder\n      muscle is interfered by several drugs, e.g. solifenacin.\n\n      We observed that the surgical repair of critical pelvic structures, i.e. the uteri-sacral\n      ligaments (USL) can restore continence in a considerable number of patients.\n\n      In this study the surgical treatment is compared with the solifenacin treatment. According\n      to outcome after three months patients who are still incontinent are referred to the\n      opposite treatment group.\n\n      Outcome will be differentiated in cure (primary aim) and improvement of symptoms (secondary\n      aim)."
