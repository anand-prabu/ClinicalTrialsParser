The most important feature of IgG4-RD is chronic\n      inflammation with multiple organ involvement. However, some organ involvements are difficult\n      to find by ultrasound, CT or MRI.\n\n      18F-FDG PET/CT is a sensitive imaging tool for inflammation. In this study, PET/CT were\n      performed in patients with IgG4-RD both before and after glucocorticoid treatment by a\n      single dose of 18F-FDG. Visual and semiquantitative method will be employed to assess the\n      PET/CT images. The PET/CT image data will be used to establish a diagnostic model as well as\n      assessment criteria for response evaluation of IgG4-RD treatments."
