Imatinib mesylate may stop the growth of cancer cells by\n      blocking the enzymes necessary for cancer cell growth.\n\n      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying giving imatinib mesylate together with cytarabine\n      to see how well it works in treating patients with chronic phase chronic myelogenous\n      leukemia."
