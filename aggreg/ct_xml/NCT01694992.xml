      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a rehabilitation
      (physiotherapy) program in patients with acute ischemic stroke in Acute Vascular Unit and in
      general ward of Hospital de Clínicas de Porto Alegre, and to verify the degree of disability
      at fourteenth and third month, functional improvement at third month, the frequency of
      deaths and incidence of complications due to immobility and quantify the time spent in
      hospital.
