        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Must be ≥18 years of age at consent.

          2. Subjects with advanced heart failure symptoms (Class IIIB or IV) who meet one of the
             following):

               1. on optimal medical management including dietary salt restriction and diuretics,
                  for at least 45 out of the last 60 days and are failing to respond; or

               2. in Class III or Class IV heart failure for at least 14 days and dependent on
                  intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) and/or inotropes.

          3. Left ventricular ejection fraction ≤25%.

          4. Female subjects of childbearing potential must agree to use adequate contraceptive
             precautions (defined as oral contraceptives, intrauterine devices, surgical
             contraceptives or a combination of condom and spermicide) for the duration of the
             study.

          5. The subject has signed the informed consent form.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Body Mass Index (BMI) &gt; 45.

          2. Body Surface Area (BSA) &lt; 1.0 m2.

          3. Existence of any ongoing mechanical circulatory support (MCS) other than an
             intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP).

          4. Prior cardiac transplant or cardiomyoplasty.

          5. History of confirmed, untreated abdominal or thoracic aortic aneurysm (diameter &gt; 5
             cm).

          6. Acute myocardial infarction within 14 days of implant as diagnosed by ST or T wave
             changes on the electrocardiogram (ECG), diagnostic biomarkers, ongoing pain and
             hemodynamic abnormalities.

          7. On ventilator support for &gt; 72 hours within the four days immediately prior to
             implant.

          8. Pulmonary embolus within three weeks of implant as documented by computed tomography
             (CT) scan or nuclear scan.

          9. Symptomatic cerebrovascular disease, stroke within 180 days of implant or &gt; 80%
             stenosis of carotid or cranial vessels in the absence of confirmed collateral
             circulation.

         10. Uncorrected moderate to severe aortic insufficiency.  Correction may include repair
             or bioprosthesis at the time of implant.

         11. Severe right ventricular failure as defined by the anticipated need for
             extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) at the time of screening.

         12. Active, uncontrolled infection diagnosed by a combination of clinical symptoms and
             laboratory testing, including but not limited to, continued positive cultures,
             elevated temperature and white blood cell (WBC) count, hypotension, tachycardia,
             generalized malaise despite appropriate antibiotic, antiviral or antifungal
             treatment.

             75,000, International Normalized Ratio (INR) &gt; 2.0 or Partial Thromboplastin Time
             (PTT) &gt; 2.5 times control in the absence of anticoagulation therapy).

         14. Intolerance to anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapies or any other peri- or
             postoperative therapy that the investigator may administer based upon the subject's
             health status.

         15. Serum creatinine &gt; 3.0 mg/dL within 72 hours of implant or requiring dialysis.

         16. Specific liver enzymes [Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) (SGOT), and Alanine
             Aminotransferase (ALT) (SGPT)] &gt; 3 times upper limit of normal within 72 hours of
             implant.

         17. A total bilirubin &gt; 3 mg/dL within 72 hours of implant, or biopsy proven liver
             cirrhosis or portal hypertension.

         18. Pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) is demonstrated to be unresponsive to
             pharmacological manipulation.

         19. Subjects with a mechanical heart valve.

         20. Etiology of heart failure is due to, or associated with, uncorrected thyroid disease,
             obstructive cardiomyopathy, pericardial disease, amyloidosis, active myocarditis or
             restrictive cardiomyopathy

         21. History of severe COPD or severe restrictive lung disease (e.g. FEV1 &lt; 50%).

         22. Participation in any other trial involving investigational drugs or devices within 4
             weeks prior to  screening and last visit of the trial

         23. Severe illness, other than heart disease, which would limit survival to &lt; 3 years

         24. Peripheral vascular disease with rest pain or ischemic ulcers of the extremities

         25. Pregnancy and breast feeding

         26. Psychiatric disease, irreversible cognitive dysfunction or psychosocial issues that
             are likely to impair compliance with the CIP and LVAD

         27. Subject unwilling or unable to comply with trial requirements

         28. Technical obstacles, which pose an inordinately high surgical risk, in the judgment
             of the investigator

         29. Employees of the investigator or trial site, with direct involvement in this trial or
             other trials under the direction of the investigator or trial site, as well as family
