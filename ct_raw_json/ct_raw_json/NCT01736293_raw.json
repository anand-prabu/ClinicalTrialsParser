            "textblock": "Background:\n\n      - The ABCA4 gene contains a blueprint for the ABCA4 protein. When this protein is absent or\n      faulty (such as in Stargardt   s disease), waste material from dead cells collects in the\n      eye. The waste material may cause other cells in the eye to die. This can lead to the loss\n      of vision. Researchers want to look at blood and skin samples from people with ABCA4 gene\n      mutations to study related eye diseases.\n\n      Objectives:\n\n      - To study eye diseases that are related to mutations in the ABCA4 gene.\n\n      Eligibility:\n\n      - Individuals at least 12 years of age who have ABCA4 gene mutations.\n\n      Design:\n\n        -  The study requires seven visits to the National Eye Institute clinic over 5 years. In\n           the first year, there will be three visits. After the first year, participants will\n           have one visit a year for 4 more years.\n\n        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam, full eye exam, and medical history.\n           The eye exam will check eye pressure, light and color sensitivity, and retina function.\n\n        -  Participants will provide a blood sample and a skin tissue sample for study.\n\n        -  No treatment will be provided as part of this study."

            "textblock": "Objectives: The objectives of this study are to 1) establish a cohort of participants with\n      ABCA4-related retinopathies in anticipation of future clinical trials, 2) create a\n      repository of plasma, DNA, and skin fibroblast samples from the accrued cohort of\n      ABCA4-related retinopathy participants, 3) formulate clinical outcome measures for future\n      studies, and 4) acquire and perform preliminary analyses of data that may advance our\n      understanding of genotype-phenotype correlations in ABCA4-related retinopathies.\n\n      In addition, the skin fibroblast samples collected from participants may be used to generate\n      iPS cells, which may be differentiated into RPE and/or neural retinal cells. These cells, if\n      produced, will be used to analyze molecular mechanisms involved in disease pathogenesis and\n      to perform high throughput (HTP) drug screens to identify novel potential therapeutic\n      compounds.\n\n      Study Population: Forty (40) participants, age 12 or above, with ABCA4-related retinopathies\n      will be accrued for this study.\n\n      Design: In this natural history study, participants will be followed for five years. Because\n      three years may be required to enroll 40 participants, this study will last up to eight\n      years. Participants will be recruited through other pre-existing NIH protocols, such as the\n      NEI Evaluation and Treatment Trial (08-EI-0169), the NEI Screening Protocol (08-EI-0102),\n      and the National Ophthalmic Disease Genotyping and Phenotyping Network, Phase II protocol\n      (eyeGENE II, 10-EI-N164), or through referral from an outside clinician after a review of\n      pertinent medical records and genetic testing. All participants will undergo a standardized\n      medical/ophthalmic history and a complete baseline eye examination, including non-invasive\n      electrophysiology (e.g., electroretinography), psychophysiology (e.g., microperimetry,\n      static perimetry), and diagnostic imaging examinations (e.g., optical coherence tomography).\n\n      The participants will be examined three times over the course of the first year (i.e.,\n      baseline examination, Month 6, and Month 12). After the first year, they will return to the\n      NEI clinic on an annual basis for the next four years. This study will require a minimum of\n      seven study visits. Participants may be seen at more frequent intervals at the investigators\n         discretion, depending on the clinical and research situation. Participants will be\n      required to submit a blood sample as part of the study for DNA and serum banking, and they\n      will have the option to provide a 3 mm punch skin biopsy to facilitate research at a\n      cellular level.\n\n      Outcome Measures: The primary outcome for this study is the establishment of a cohort of\n      participants with ABCA4-related retinopathies, and the secondary outcome is the creation of\n      a repository of plasma, DNA, and skin fibroblast samples from the accrued cohort of\n      ABCA4-related retinopathy participants. Exploratory outcomes for this study include: 1) the\n      formulation of clinical outcome measures for future studies and 2) the acquisition and\n      preliminary analysis of data that may advance our understanding of genotype-phenotype\n      correlations in ABCA4-related retinopathies. Potential exploratory outcomes include: 1) the\n      generation of iPS cells from the skin fibroblast samples, 2) the differentiation of the\n      generated iPS cells into RPE and/or neural retinal cells, and 3) the use of the\n      participant-specific RPE and/or neural retinal cells to perform HTP drug screens to identify\n      novel potential therapeutic compounds. The cells obtained in this protocol may be\n      genetically modified and may be used for in vivo research."
