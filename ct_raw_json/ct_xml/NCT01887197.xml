    <textblock>
      The investigators are developing a new nuclear medicine imaging technique for measuring
      liquid absorption in the airways that can be applied to screen new medications being
      developed to treat cystic fibrosis (CF). The investigators believe that the absorption of
      the small molecule radiopharmaceutical Indium 111 diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid
      (In-DTPA) will indicate changes in liquid absorption in the airways and demonstrate whether
      new CF medications will be effective. In this study the investigators will determine whether
      the imaging technique will demonstrate similar results when it is repeated on different
      days.  They will also determine how their results change when subjects utilize several
      common CF medications.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive genetic disease, caused by mutations of the
      Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) that impairs ion transport at
      epithelial surfaces. This results in the accumulation of dehydrated secretions in the
      airways and chronic infection and inflammation in the lungs, leading to significant
      morbidity and mortality. The investigators understanding of CF pathogenesis has increased
      substantially and many new targeted therapies are being developed to treat this disease,
      however, the measurements of clinical efficacy used to evaluate these therapies require long
      trials to demonstrate an effect. New translational techniques are needed to assess changes
      in the most basic aspects of the disease and allow for the rapid screening of
      disease-altering therapies. The investigators have recently developed a novel aerosol-based
      imaging technique to measure liquid absorption in the airways - a central pathophysiological
      process related to CFTR dysfunction. The investigators propose that airway liquid
      hyper-absorption is a key link between cellular defects in ion and fluid transport and
      progressive airway dysfunction in CF. Thus The investigators technique may provide a measure
      of disease severity and rapid indication of therapeutic correction in advance of currently
      available outcome measures.
