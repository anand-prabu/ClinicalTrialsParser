Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor\n      cells. Combining more than one drug and combining chemotherapy with radiation therapy may\n      kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying combination chemotherapy and radiation therapy to\n      see how well they work in treating children with localized ependymoma."

Patients with residual\n      disease proceed to chemotherapy, while those with no residual disease proceed directly to\n      radiotherapy.\n\n      Chemotherapy begins within 3 weeks of surgery and consists of vincristine IV on days 1, 8,\n      and 15, cyclophosphamide IV over 3 hours on day 1, and etoposide IV over 4 hours on days\n      1-3. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for up to 4 courses. Patients who progress after 2\n      courses proceed to radiotherapy. If residual disease is still present at completion of\n      chemotherapy, second look surgery is recommended.\n\n      Patients undergo radiotherapy daily for 6 weeks beginning after complete resection within 4\n      weeks of surgery, within 3 weeks of completion of chemotherapy, or within 4 weeks of second\n      look surgery.\n\n      Patients are followed at 6 weeks after radiotherapy, every 2 months for 1 year, every 4\n      months for 2 years, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually for 5 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 65 patients will be accrued for this study within 2-3 years."
