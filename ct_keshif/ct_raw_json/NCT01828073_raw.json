Mother/infant pairs will be enrolled prior\n      to delivery, and women will be followed until discharge from the labor/delivery unit. At\n      delivery, cord blood will be drawn and a single blood sample will be collected from the\n      woman.\n\n      All infants will undergo a medical history, physical examination, and blood draw at the Week\n      1-2 visit and Week 20 visit. Infants who meet certain criteria defined in the protocol will\n      be eligible for PK sampling at the birth visit. These infants will have one blood sample\n      collected at 1 to 5, 8 to 14, 18 to 24, and 30 to 36 hours after birth. Infants not eligible\n      for PK sampling will undergo a blood draw at 8 to 14 hours and 30 to 36 hours after birth.\n\n      Optional genotyping for UGT1A1 polymorphisms will be done using dried blood spot on filter\n      paper. (UGT1A1 is the enzyme primarily responsible for RAL metabolism.) Only infants who\n      have PK sampling will have genotyping done.\n\n      No study-specific drugs will be given to women or infants during this study. Women will be\n      receiving RAL for clinical indications outside of the study. Infants will receive standard\n      of care ARV therapy for prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) as prescribed by\n      their primary care physicians. Infants will be followed for 20 weeks after birth.\n\n      Cohort 2 will enroll mother-infant pairs in which the HIV-infected pregnant woman will have\n      received at least one dose of 400 mg of RAL within 2 to 24 hours prior to delivery, and\n      their infants will weigh less than or equal to 2,500 grams at birth. Participants will take\n      part in most of the same study procedures as participants in Cohort 1, except infants will\n      only be followed for 6 weeks after birth."
