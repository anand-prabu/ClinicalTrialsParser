      This study is aimed at evaluating whether the computer-based cognitive exercises in the
      Thinking Skills for Work (TSW) program are critical to improving work and cognitive outcomes
      in consumers with serious mental illness and cognitive impairment enrolled in supported
      employment (SE), or whether a streamlined version of TSW without this component (the
      Cognitive Skills for Work (CSW) program) is equally effective for some or all consumers. An
      RCT will be conducted at two sites (Mental Health Center of Greater Manchester in New
      Hampshire and Thresholds Inc. in Illinois) with 244 consumers randomly assigned to one of
      two groups (122 each, with approximately 122 participants having schizophrenia or
      schizoaffective disorder and 122 of the participants having other diagnoses): 1) TSW, or 2)
      CSW. The TSW and CSW programs will be delivered by the same Cognitive Specialists, who will
      work as members of the SE team to integrate cognitive and vocational services. All
      participants will continue to receive SE services. Participants will be assessed at
      baseline, post-treatment  at 8 months (after completion of the active teaching components of
      TSW or CSW), and at 16 and 24 months post-baseline to evaluate cognitive functioning,
      symptoms, and quality of life. All work outcomes will be tracked weekly.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Unemployment is a major burden for people with severe mental illness (SMI) such as
      schizophrenia, with competitive work rates typically between 10-20%. Over the past two
      decades, supported employment (SE) has been shown to improve competitive work in persons
      with SMI, and it is now considered an evidence-based practice (EBP). However, there is a
      need to improve the effectiveness of SE, as 30-60% of consumers work little or not at all,
      and jobs are often brief and end unsuccessfully. Cognitive remediation, when combined with
      vocational rehabilitation, has shown promise for improving work outcomes, including in
      consumers in SE. The most extensively studied approach is the Thinking Skills for Work (TSW)
      program, developed by this research group, which incorporates computer-based cognitive
      exercises to restore cognitive skills and teaching compensatory strategies by a Cognitive
      Specialist who is integrated into the vocational rehabilitation team. Five randomized
      controlled trials (RCTs), two conducted in SE programs (including one previously conducted
      by this research group), have shown that adding the TSW program to vocational (SE) services
      improves work and cognitive outcomes compared to vocational (SE) services alone.

      The proposed study takes the next bold step of &quot;dismantling&quot; the TSW program to evaluate
      whether the cognitive practice exercises component is critical to improving outcomes in SE,
      or whether a more streamlined and efficient version of the program that focuses only on
      teaching compensatory skills is sufficient. The study will also yield important information
      about whether some consumers benefit from computer cognitive exercises, but not others,
      permitting the TSW program to be individually tailored to consumers' personal needs.

      In preparation for the proposed study we developed, standardized, and pilot tested a variant
      of the TSW program, the Cognitive Skills for Work (CSW) program, that teaches compensatory
      skills for managing cognitive difficulties but omits computer cognitive exercises, resulting
      in a program that is approximately one-half the intensity of the original TSW program. A
      small ongoing pilot study indicated that consumers in SE could be readily engaged and
      retained in the CSW program and obtain work, supporting the feasibility of this streamlined
      version of TSW. The proposed research will be an RCT conducted at two high fidelity SE
      programs, comparing the effects of the TSW and CSW programs in consumers enrolled in SE.

      The following hypotheses will be tested:

        1. Primary Hypothesis: Participants in TSW will have better competitive work outcomes than
           those in the CSW program. This hypothesis is based on the fact that virtually all
           cognitive remediation research on SMI has included cognitive exercises designed to
           restore cognitive skills, such as the computer-based cognitive exercises in TSW, with
           some programs also teaching compensatory strategies. If the null hypothesis is not
           rejected, and TSW is found to be not significantly more effective than CSW, then
           dissemination efforts can focus on the more efficient CSW.

        2. Secondary Hypothesis: Participants in TSW will improve more in cognitive functioning
           than those in CSW. This hypothesis is based on the same rationale as Hypothesis #1.

      Exploratory Analyses  In addition to evaluating whether the TSW and CSW programs differ
      overall in their impact on vocational and cognitive outcomes, we will explore whether
      consumer characteristics can be identified that predict a differential response to either
      program. For example, it is possible that consumers with more severe cognitive impairment
      will respond better to the full TSW program, whereas those with less severe impairment may
      benefit equally well from the more efficient CSW program.

      The proposed research has high potential impact for improving the outcomes of SE, an
      established EBP for increasing competitive work in SMI, but whose effectiveness is limited
      by the extent of consumers' cognitive impairment. Maximizing the efficiency of the TSW
      program, a cognitive remediation program shown to improve work outcomes in two RCTs of SE
      programs, by determining whether a more streamlined version of the program that requires
      about one-half the time to implement (the CSW program) is equally effective, could reduce
      the costs of disseminating and implementing the program, making it accessible to more
      consumers. This study could also help identify which consumers benefit most from the
      cognitive exercises component of TSW, thereby facilitating tailoring of the program to the
      individual's personal needs. Ultimately, this research could play a critical role in making
      the dream of competitive work a reality for many consumers with SMI.
