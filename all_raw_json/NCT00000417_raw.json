The counseling intervention includes an initial\n      in-person session followed by five monthly telephone calls to monitor and reinforce\n      problem-solving. We will follow patients for 12 months for self-reported physical and mental\n      health, disease activity, self-efficacy, coping, social support, and couples communication."
