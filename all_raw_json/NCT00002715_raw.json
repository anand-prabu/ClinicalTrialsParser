Treatment continues for\n           8-12 weeks, depending on response, in the absence of disease progression or\n           unacceptable toxicity.\n\n        -  Regimen B: Patients begin radiotherapy 2-4 weeks after completion of Regimen A.\n           Patients receive radiotherapy to lungs, pleura, and other extralymphatic sites for\n           approximately 5 weeks.\n\n      Patients are followed for survival.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be entered if at least 16 of the first 22\n      patients respond. As of 03/96, it is expected that a total of 45 patients each with stage\n      III/IV disease and 40 with unfavorable stage II disease will be accrued."
