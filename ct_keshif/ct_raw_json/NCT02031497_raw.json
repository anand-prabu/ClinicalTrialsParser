Sweeteners are widely used in\n      commercialized beverages. Despite some debate, no significant toxicity was demonstrated at a\n      reasonable level of consumption (less than 20 cans per day). However little data is\n      available on the metabolic effects of a regular consumption of beverages containing\n      sweeteners. The objective of the study is to evaluate the effect of a regular consumption\n      (twice a day for 12 weeks) of a carbonated drink with sweeteners, in a normal diet, compared\n      with unsweetened sparkling water on insulin sensitivity in healthy normoweight and\n      overweight subjects."
