It is also not known whether arthrographic distention using steroid and saline is\n      better than intra-articular steroid injection alone.\n\n      The purpose of this study is to determine whether there is an additional benefit in the\n      combination of arthrographic distention plus intra-articular corticosteroid injection\n      compared to arthrographic distention or intra-articular corticosteroid injection alone."
