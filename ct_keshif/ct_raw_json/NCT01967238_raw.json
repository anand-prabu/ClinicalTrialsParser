            "textblock": "Antibodies are principle mediators of immunity against infections and they can also give\n      rise to autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.  Two functional domains make up an IgG\n      antibody - the Fab domain binds to a specific target, while the Fc domain can interact with\n      receptor molecules to activate a pro- or anti- inflammatory state.  The Fc domain of IgGs\n      contains a glycan that is variable in composition and its specific sugar components are an\n      important determinant of the biologic activity of IgGs in both protective and pathologic\n      immune responses.  New disease treatments could be developed through purposeful manipulation\n      of IgG Fc glycans, but there is currently little known about how Fc glycan composition is\n      regulated.  We plan to study this by evaluating whether vaccination can cause changes in Fc\n      glycan composition and, if so, whether signaling from helper T cells, age of the patient,\n      and/or route of vaccine administration are determinants of specific modifications that are\n      triggered by vaccination.  Next, we will study effects that specific components within the\n      Fc glycan have on immunity against the common human pathogens Streptococcus pneumoniae and\n      influenza viruses using in vitro and in vivo models of infection."
