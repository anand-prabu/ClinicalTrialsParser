Also, increasing the 6-MP dose can lead to unwanted side effects, such as\n      inflammation of the liver as shown by increases in laboratory values (ALT, aspartate\n      aminotransferase (AST), bilirubin), nausea, and abdominal discomfort. Previous studies in\n      children with inflammatory bowel disease has shown that combining allopurinol with 6-MP can\n      decrease side effects associated with high doses of 6-MP and also increase the efficacy of\n      6-MP. Allopurinol is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of tumor\n      lysis syndrome in ALL. Through this research study, we hope to show that the combination of\n      allopurinol and 6-MP will be safe, tolerable, and effective in children with ALL."
