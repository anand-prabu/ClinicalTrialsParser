The total population at this age interval that is\n      insured by CMS in this district is 347,374.\n\n      A. Screening of the computerized database of CMS to detect all patients at the age interval\n      of 20-70 years with a computerized title-diagnosis of bronchial asthma during the period of\n      January 1st -December 31,  2011.  (preliminary data shows that the total asthmatic\n      population at this age interval is 20,651 patients (5.94% of the entire population).\n\n      B. To detect from this database the asthmatic patients that are considered to have \"severe\n      asthma\" according to the level of medication that is prescribed to them (adjusted on the\n      basis of severe/refractory asthma definition by the ATS workshop consensus 2000) [2].\n\n      C. To detect the fraction of patients having co-morbidities and/or potential triggers\n      (computerized title-diagnosis) that may interfere with asthma management (WHO group two:\n      potentially \"difficult to treat severe asthma\"). Severe asthmatics without these\n      co-morbidities /triggers will be considered as having WHO group three \"treatment resistant\n      severe asthma\".\n\n      D. To detect the fraction of the patients with \"severe asthma\" that underwent evaluation for\n      anti IgE-therapy.\n\n      E. To evaluate a sample of the above \"severe asthma\" population (WHO groups two and three)\n      in the asthma outpatient clinic in Meir Hospital (estimated on the basis of preliminary\n      data, 200-250 patients). If the absolute number of patients in either WHO group two or group\n      three will not exceed 150, all patients will be invited. If the number will exceed 150, then\n      each second patient, consecutively according to the computerized list, will be invited.\n\n      F. Patients invited to the asthma outpatient clinic will be evaluated by a pulmonary\n      physician and complete a specific  questionnaire regarding asthma control level (including\n      non-scheduled use of medical resources), medication adherence, co-morbidities, smoking\n      history, potential asthma triggers, level of asthma education,  quality of follow-up care\n      and potential adverse events in patients receiving anti-IgE therapy that are possibly\n      related to this specific therapy.\n\n      G. All patients will undergo post bronchodilator spirometric evaluation, assessment of blood\n      cell counts for peripheral eosinophils, total IgE blood levels and skin testing for\n      aeroallergens.\n\n      H.  Stages F and G of this protocol will be accomplished in one visit and there will be no\n      more outpatint visits under this study.\n\n      Inclusion criteria:\n\n      A. Age 20-70 years old\n\n      B. A computerized diagnosis-title of \"bronchial asthma\", at any stage of severity. A\n      subgroup of the above asthmatic patients will be considered as having \"severe asthma\"\n      according to the ATS workshop consensus definition of severe/refractory asthma, based on the\n      level of prescribed medication criteria 2000:\n\n      C.  An obligatory criteria of at least 12 month inhaler-therapy prescription of a\n      combination of high dose corticosteroid +LABA (at least 12 inhalers of Symbicort 160/4.5 mcg\n      OR at least 10 inhalers of Seretide 500 mcg, a year) PLUS at least one of the following\n      criteria:\n\n      D. Prescription of SABA, either Ventolin OR Bricalin inhalers at least once a quarter of a\n      year or at least 4 inhalers in 12 months OR at least one prescription a month of\n      inhalation-solution of Ventolin or Bricalin a month.\n\n      E. Prescription of an oral or IM corticosteroid, at least twice in the last 12 months.\n\n      The fulfilment of the above mentioned criteria indicates that these asthmatic patients are\n      not conrolled, according to the GINA definition of controlled asthma.\n\n      Asthmatics that potentially have \"difficult to treat severe asthma\" due to co-morbidities or\n      potential triggering factors will be sub-grouped according to these criteria (criteria for\n      potential exclusion of having \"treatment resistant severe asthma\"):\n\n      A. Having computerized title-diagnosis of COPD, congestive heart failure, smoking,\n      bronchiectasis, interstitial lung disease.\n\n      B. Prescription of an oral or topical (ocular) beta-blockers."
