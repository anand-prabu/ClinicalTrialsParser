Determine whether autologous graft versus host disease significantly alters\n      the relapse rate for lymphoma or Hodgkin's disease after autologous bone marrow\n      transplantation.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Stem cells are harvested and cryopreserved. All\n      patients receive busulfan/cyclophosphamide or cyclosporine/total body irradiation as a\n      preparative regimen. Arm I: Patients randomized to the graft versus host disease (GVHD)\n      induction arm receive oral cyclosporine twice a day beginning on day 0 and continuing for at\n      least 28 days, followed by peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) infusion. At the time the white\n      blood cell count begins to recover, subcutaneous interferon gamma is administered for 10\n      doses, followed 2 days later by subcutaneous interleukin-2 (IL-2) for 18 doses. Arm II:\n      Patients do not receive autologous GVHD therapy after the PBSC transplant. Both arms should\n      receive radiation to the site of lymphoma after recovering from the stem cell\n      transplantation. Patients are followed at 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years posttransplant.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 50 patients (25 per arm) will be accrued for this study\n      within 3 years."
