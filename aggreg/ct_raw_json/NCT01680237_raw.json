Although the efficacy of psychological treatment for panic disorder with\n      agoraphobia has been the subject of a great deal of research, studies comparing\n      cognitive-behavioral therapy and exposure in vivo have regularly been underpowered to detect\n      small to moderate differences. Therefore, the primary purpose of the present study is to\n      investigate if the combination of cognitive techniques with exposure in vivo is superior to\n      the the effects of exposure alone for patients with moderate to severe agoraphobia."
