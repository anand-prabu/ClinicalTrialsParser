The aim of this study is to investigate the\n      differences between milk composition, infant and maternal gut microbiota from women with and\n      without gestational diabetes mellitus or type 2 diabetes vs. controls.\n\n      Fresh Milk Study. The aim of this study is to elucidate the relationship between the\n      expression of glycan metabolizing genes of mammary epithelial cells and levels of milk\n      glycans.\n\n      RNA Study. The aim of this study is to compare the RNA of milk fat globule membrane\n      crescents in human milk against epithelial expression profiles in non-human primate milk.\n\n      Skin Study. The aim of this study is to provide skin samples from healthy term infants to\n      act as the control group for a different study with preterm infants.\n\n      Breast Milk, Gut Microbiome, and Immunity (BMMI) Project. The aim of this study is to\n      provide healthy control samples for the BMMI project.
