      Atrial fibrillation (AF) and atrial flutter (AFL) are cardiac rhythm problems where there is
      an irregular, rapid heart rate. Investigators plan to study Emergency Department (ED)
      patients with recent-onset episodes of AF or AFL (RAFF) where rapid heart rate requires
      urgent treatment to restore normal heart rhythm. RAFF is the most common rhythm disorder
      managed in the ED. Investigators recently showed that doctors use a wide variety of
      treatment approaches in Canadian EDs for RAFF. Also, the Canadian Cardiovascular Society
      Guidelines indicate that there have not been enough studies to know if the best treatment is
      to use an electrical shock (Shock Only) or drugs followed by shock (Drug-Shock).
      Investigators believe that Drug-Shock approach will be more effective and will help avoid an
      electric shock for many patients. Investigators also do not know if electrical shocks should
      be given with the electrode pads on the front (antero-lateral) or front and back
      (antero-posterior).

      Investigators intend to conduct 2 randomized protocols within one study (partial factorial
      design) in order to answer these two questions. 1. Will initial drug treatment followed by
      electrical shock if necessary (Drug-Shock) lead to more patients being converted to normal
      heart rhythm than a strategy of only electrical shock (Shock Only)?  2. Will the
      antero-posterior pad position be more effective than the antero-lateral position?
      Investigators plan to enroll 468 RAFF patients at 8 large Canadian EDs. Patients will be
      randomized to 1 of 2 arms for each of the two protocols. Investigators primary outcome will
      be conversion to normal heart rhythm. Other outcomes will include heart rhythm at discharge,
      need for hospital admission, length of stay in ED, adverse events, patient satisfaction, and
      14-day follow-up status.

      Investigator results will add important information about the best and safest ways to treat
      RAFF patients in Canadian EDs. Ultimately Investigators expect to see fewer patients
      admitted to hospital and more patients rapidly and safely returned to their normal
      activities.

      Background: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is characterized by disorganized atrial electrical
      depolarization leading to an irregular and rapid heart rate and is the most common
      arrhythmia seen in the emergency department (ED). Atrial flutter (AFL) is a less common
      arrhythmia with similar pathophysiology. Investigators will focus on recent-onset episodes
      of AF and AFL (RAFF), which have usually been present less than 48 hours, are highly
      symptomatic, and may be a first or recurrent event. There is a surprising lack of evidence
      regarding many important ED RAFF management questions and the 2011 Canadian Cardiovascular
      Society AF Guidelines indicate clinical equipoise for most facets of early care. In Canadian
      EDs, most physicians use the rhythm control approach, where attempts are made to cardiovert
      patients to sinus rhythm in the ED, either pharmacologically or electrically (DC
      cardioversion). Canadian ED physicians seem equally divided between those who prefer to
      attempt rhythm control initially with drugs and then move to DC cardioversion if necessary
      (Drug-Shock strategy) and those who prefer to start immediately with DC cardioversion (Shock
      Only strategy). Investigators recently completed a prospective cohort RAFF study (N=1,065,
      funded by the Heart and Stroke Foundation of Ontario) at 6 Canadian EDs. 73.3% of all
      patients underwent ED rhythm control with 34.4% receiving rhythm control drugs first and
      38.9% receiving electrical shock first. There is also much variation in whether the DC
      cardioversion electrodes are placed in the front and back (antero-posterior) or front and
      side (antero-lateral) position (Figure 1).

      Investigators believe that the Drug-Shock strategy has many advantages over a Shock Only
      strategy. Most Canadian EDs have a single physician on duty, which is a barrier to safe
      procedural sedation and DC cardioversion. Even in larger EDs, DC cardioversion requires 4
      professional staff, has a risk associated with sedation, and can be frightening for
      patients. Investigators expect that the Drug-Shock strategy will be more effective because
      procainamide will facilitate DC cardioversion and prevent early return of AF. Even if the
      Drug-Shock strategy is not more effective overall, its use can prevent the need for DC
      cardioversion in 50-60% of patients. Regarding DC cardioversion pad placement, no randomized
      trials have ever been done with RAFF patients using modern biphasic devices at high energy
      levels.

      Study Objectives: Investigators primary aim is to compare conversion to sinus rhythm between
      the strategies of i) attempted pharmacological cardioversion with intravenous procainamide
      followed by DC cardioversion if necessary (Drug-Shock) and ii) DC cardioversion alone (Shock
      Only). Investigators secondary aim is to compare the effectiveness of the i)
      antero-posterior and ii) antero-lateral pad positions.

      Methods: Design and Interventions: Investigators propose a partial factorial study design
      with 2 protocols (Figure 2). All patients will participate in Protocol 1 (N=468) and most in
      Protocol 2 (N=356). 1. Drug versus Shock Protocol. This will be a randomized, blinded,
      placebo-controlled comparison of: i) attempted pharmacological cardioversion with
      intravenous procainamide (15mg/kg over 30 minutes) followed by DC cardioversion (200 joules
      x 3) if necessary (Drug-Shock), and ii) only DC cardioversion (Shock Only) (Hypothesis 1).
      2. Pad Position Protocol. For the subset of patients who undergo DC cardioversion, this will
      be a randomized, open-label comparison of i) the antero-posterior pad position, and ii) the
      antero-lateral pad position (Hypothesis 2). Management protocols will be standardized.
      Randomization will be stratified by site and by rhythm (AF or AFL). Setting: 8 EDs of large,
      tertiary care Canadian hospitals. Subjects: Stable patients with primary diagnosis of RAFF
      where acute rhythm control is a safe option. Investigators will obtain patient consent.
      Outcomes: The primary outcome measure will be conversion to sinus rhythm and maintenance of
      sinus rhythm for at least 60 minutes; other outcomes will include sinus rhythm at discharge,
      hospital admission, length of stay in ED, adverse events, patient satisfaction, and 14-day
      follow-up status. Data Analysis: Primary analysis will be intention-to-treat using
      chi-square testing. Sample Size: Investigators will require 213 evaluable patients per group
      to detect a minimal clinically important absolute difference of 10% between groups. Allowing
      for 10% non-compliance, investigators plan to enroll 468 patients.

      Importance: This study will answer two important questions about the early management of ED
      RAFF patients, leading to higher rhythm conversion rates and lower admission rates. The
      results will inform future efforts to create effective, safe, and efficient pathways for
      RAFF patient management in Canada.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  include stable (see below) patients presenting with an episode of RAFF of at least 3
             hours duration,

          -  where symptoms require urgent management and where pharmacological or DC
             cardioversion is a reasonable option because there is a clear history of:

          -  onset within 48 hours, or

          -  onset within 7 days and adequately anticoagulated for &gt; 4 weeks (warfarin and INR &gt;
             2.0 or newer oral anticoagulants [dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban]), or

          -  onset within 7 days and no left atrial thrombus on TEE. Of note, Investigators will
             not exclude patients with prior episodes of RAFF.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Investigators will exclude patients for the reasons listed below.

          -  who are unable to give consent;

          -  who have permanent (chronic) AF;

          -  whose episode did not clearly start within 48 hours [or 7 days if anticoagulated /
             normal TEE];

          -  who are deemed unstable and require immediate cardioversion: i) systolic blood
             pressure &lt;100 mmHg; ii) rapid ventricular preexcitation (Wolff-Parkinson-White
             syndrome); iii) acute coronary syndrome - chest pain and acute ischemic changes on
             ECG; or iv) pulmonary edema - severe dyspnea requiring immediate IV diuretic,
             nitrates, or BIPAP;

          -  whose primary presentation was for another condition; examples include pneumonia,
             pulmonary embolism, and sepsis;

          -  who convert spontaneously to sinus rhythm prior to randomization; or
