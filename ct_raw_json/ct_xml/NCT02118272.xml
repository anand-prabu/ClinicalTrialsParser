      The aim of this study is to assess the clinical, radiographic and patient-reported outcome
      measures (PROMs) after total knee replacement with Physica KR, define the survivorship of
      the implants and identify possible risk factors that may lead to failure.

         11. Patients with a flexion greater than or equal to 90째 on the affected side

         12. Patients with a fixed flexion contracture less than 10째

         13. Patients who understand the conditions of the study and are willing and able to
             comply with the prescribed rehabilitation and to perform all scheduled follow-up
             visits

         14. Patients who have signed the Ethics Committee approved study-specific Informed
             Consent Form prior to the surgery

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Obese patients with BMI above 35 kg/m2 (severe obesity)

          2. Previous partial knee replacement (unilateral, bicompartimental or patellofemoral
             joint replacement), patellectomy, high tibial osteotomy or  femoral osteotomy in the
             affected knee

          3. Primary Total Knee Replacement (TKR) in the affected knee

          4. Varus or Valgus deformity greater than 20째

          5. Patients with a fixed flexion contracture greater than 10째

          6. Previous knee replacement on the contralateral side within the last year and whose
             outcome is achieving an KSS&lt; 70 points

          7. Patients with symptomatic OA of the hips, spine, ankles, if it can interfere with the
             evaluation of the target knee

          8. Patients with active or any suspected infection (on the affected knee or systemic)

          9. Muscular insufficiency or absence of muscoligamentous supporting structures required
             for adequate soft tissue balance

         11. Recurrent medical history of severe allergic or immune-mediated reactions

         12. Vascular insufficiency of lower limbs severe enough to interfere with the study
             evaluation

         13. Current treatment or treatment within the previous 2 years before the screening visit
             for malignant and life-threatening non-malignant disorders

         14. Any clinically significant pathology based on clinical history that the Investigator
             feels may affect the study evaluation

         15. Any intercurrent chronic disease or condition that may interfere with the completion
             of the 5-year follow-up, such as liver disease, severe coronary disease, alcohol or
             drug abuse, disordered mental state, or other clinically significant condition

         16. Patients who have significant neurological or musculoskeletal disorders or disease
             that may adversely affect gait and compromise functional recovery and evaluation

         17. Patients who have neuromuscular or neurosensory deficit which would limit the ability
             to assess the performance of the device

         18. Patients with systemic or metabolic disorders leading to progressive bone
             deterioration

         19. Patients who have a medical condition with less 5 years of life expectancy

         20. Previous organ transplant surgery

         21. Any psychiatric illness that would prevent comprehension of the details and nature of
             the study

         22. Participation in any experimental drug/device study within the 6 months prior to the
