  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the skin quality of using adipose-drived stromal
      vascular fraction (SVF) cell taken by automatic centrifuge for adipose-drived cell isolation
      system  into irradiated breasts.

    <textblock>
      10 participants who taken conservative mastectomy will be enrolled

        1. Process

             -  adipose tissue is obtained from the subject's thigh or abdomen

             -  adipose-drived stromal  vascular fraction(SVF)cell isolation using automatic
                centrifuge system

             -  adipose-drived stromal  vascular fraction(SVF)cell graft into the irradiated
                breast.

        2. Duration of study

             -  entire duration: approximate 30weeks

             -  Follow-up period: 12 weeks

             -  Enrollment period: 12 weeks

        3. Study design - Randomized, prospective, pilot study
