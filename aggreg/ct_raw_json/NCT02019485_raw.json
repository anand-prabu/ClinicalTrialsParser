The study consists of 3 phases: the screening phase, treatment phase, and\n      end-of-study or withdrawal assessment phase. In the treatment phase, participants will\n      receive a single dose of new tapentadol ER 100-mg TRF tablet (Treatment A) and current\n      tapentadol ER 100-mg PR2 (Treatment B) under fasted conditions in 2 treatment sequences (AB\n      and BA). Administration of the study medication will be separated by a washout period (no\n      treatment) of 7 to14 days. Approximately 64 participants will be enrolled in this study.\n      Safety will be evaluated by the assessment of adverse events, clinical laboratory tests,\n      electrocardiogram, vital signs, and physical examination. The duration of participation in\n      the study for an individual participant will be approximately 5.5 weeks."
