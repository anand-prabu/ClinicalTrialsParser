            "textblock": "Mucositis is a debilitating side effect of radio and chemotherapy treatment in oncology\n      patients. It is not only painful, but also can limit adequate nutritional intake and\n      decrease the willingness of patients to continue the treatment. Furthermore, extensive\n      mucositis may require additional  nutritional supplementation, and narcotic analgesic\n      increasing the cost of the therapy. Quality of life is impaired in patients who develop\n      severe mucositis.\n\n      Clinically, it begins with asymptomatic redness and erythema and ultimately passing through\n      different stages to large acutely painful contiguous pseudomembranous lesions with\n      associated dysphagia and decreased oral intake. The common sites of oral mucositis are\n      labial, buccal, soft palate, floor of mouth, and the ventral surface of the tongue. The loss\n      of the epithelial cells exposes the underlying connective tissue with its associated\n      innervations causing pain. Oral infections, which may be due to bacterial, fungal, or\n      viruses may further exacerbate the mucositis as well as lead to systemic infections.\n\n      Treatment and prevention of therapy related mucositis is essential; unfortunately, the\n      efficacy and safety of most of the regimen used have not been clearly established.\n      Prophylactic measures employed are use of:  chlorhexidine, saline rinses, soda bicarbonate\n      rinses, acyclovir, and ice. For treatment of mucositis and its associated pain local\n      anesthetic, diphenhydramine, nystatin, or sucralfate are used alone or in combination as\n      mouthwash. Oral or parenteral narcotics are also used for pain relief.\n\n      There is a clear need for new therapeutic options for oral mucositis."
