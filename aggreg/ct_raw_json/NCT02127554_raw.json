            "textblock": "In the general population epistaxis occurs quite frequently. Approximately 60% of persons\n      will be affected once in their lifetime, and 6% thereof will seek medical advice. Thereby\n      anterior and posterior epistaxis are discerned. Anterior epistaxis is usually located at the\n      Locus Kisselbachii, while posterior bleeds are found further back in the nose. There, most\n      bleeds will originate from the A. sphenopalatina or the A. ethmoidalis.\n\n      Different treatment modalities exist. Anterior epistaxis are usually easier to treat than\n      posterior ones. The aim of this study is to find the most efficient treatment. This involves\n      the assessment of long term results and potential sequelae. Existing data will be\n      complemented with information about recurrences and complications. The question is: Which\n      treatment method leads to the least numbers of recurrences in the long term with the fewest\n      long term sequelae?\n\n      Secondly, the most agreeable, least painful treatment method is to be identified. Therefore\n      we will send out questionnaires to patients that were treated between March 29, 2007 and\n      April 1st, 2008 at the Zurich University Hospital."
