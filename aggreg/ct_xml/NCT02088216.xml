      Objective: To evaluate whether long-term oral N-acetylcysteine ​​as an expectorant drug can
      reduce the frequency of acute exacerbations of patients with non-cystic fibrosis
      bronchiectasis and improve their quality of life.

      Methods: Patients with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis will be randomly assigned to the
      observer group (participants receive 600 mg of oral N-acetylcysteine BID for 12 months) or
      the control group (participants receive oral tablet BID for 12 months). The primary endpoint
      was the frequency of acute exacerbations.

      Expected results: Compared with the control group, the frequency of acute exacerbations of
      the observer Group will decrease significantly.

      Hypothesis: Long-term oral N-acetylcysteine can reduce the frequency of acute exacerbations
      of patients with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis and improve their quality of life.

    <description>An exacerbation of bronchiectasis is defined as either a change in one or more of the common symptoms of bronchiectasis (sputum volume or purulence, dyspnea, cough, and fatigue/malaise) or the onset of new symptoms (fever, pleurisy, haemoptysis or need for antibiotic treatment).</description>
