Additionally, the ability of\n      myVisionTrack\u00ae to detect changes in vision function will be evaluated.\n\n      The results of this study will provide the basis for patient self-monitoring of visual\n      function with the myVisionTrack\u00ae, and for reporting, storage, and maintenance of collected\n      data. The myVisionTrack\u00ae is intended to be used remotely by patients to monitor their\n      disease. In the case of significant changes, patients will be prompted to visit their\n      ophthalmologist. It is hypothesized that this can lead to earlier detection of disease\n      progression, which, in turn, can lead to earlier treatment and better prevention against\n      vision loss due to diabetic retinopathy (DR)."
