      This study is aimed at examining the safety and efficacy of rotational atherectomy (RA) in
      nondilatable calcified lesion complicated by coronary dissection during percutaneous
      coronary intervention (PCI) procedure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Coronary artery dissection is a contraindication for the use of rotational atherectomy,
      since rotational atherectomy may propagate coronary dissection. In the presence of coronary
      dissection, conservative management is suggested for approximately 4 weeks to permit the
      dissection to heal prior to treatment with rotational atherectomy. However, a lot of
      patients have frequent angina attacks and some patients develop serious complications
      including abrupt vessel closure during this period. Thus, immediate strategies cope with
      coronary dissection induced by balloon dilation is needed for the early recovery of those
      patients. The present study was performed to compare the safety and efficacy of immediate RA
      and delayed RA in the treatment with nondilatable calcified lesion complicated by coronary
      dissection.
