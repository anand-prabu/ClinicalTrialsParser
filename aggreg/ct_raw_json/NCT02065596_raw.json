To evaluate the safety and feasibility of hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) after\n      treatment with fludarabine in adult patients with Sickle Cell Disease (SCD).\n\n      Secondary Objective(s), in HSCT for SCD\n\n        1. To evaluate the rates of disease-free and overall survival in both MSD and alternate\n           graft donor (MUD, haploidentical, or cord blood-derived) recipients\n\n        2. To evaluate fertility in matched sibling and alternate-donor graft recipients\n\n        3. To evaluate GVHD rates in MSD and Alternate Graft Donor recipients in SCD.\n\n        4. To evaluate cerebral, pulmonary, renal, and generalized vasculopathy before and after\n           HSCT in SCD.\n\n        5. To evaluate hematopoiesis and erythropoiesis before and before HSCT in SCD.\n\n        6. Modulation of SCD Phenotype by Allogeneic Transplantation We will perform rigorous\n           clinical follow-up, per routine care, to evaluate those consequences of SCD that will\n           be modified by allogeneic transplantation in the short-term (4-12 weeks), in the\n           medium-term (12-24 weeks) and in the long-term (>24 weeks). Short-term changes would\n           include disappearance of stress hematopoiesis and erythropoiesis; medium- and long-term\n           changes would include effects on pain, fertility (TSH, LH), cognition (routine\n           cognitive assessments), and end-organ damage (including urine albumin-to-creatinine\n           ratios and tricuspid regurgitant jet velocities, as indicated).\n\n      Procedures:\n\n      The study will start with at least 10 and up to 25 patients. They will be given the lowest\n      starting dose of fludarabine. This is done to make sure it is safe. Researchers will watch\n      the patients during what is called the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) period. Their safety\n      will be monitored by a Safety Monitoring Committee, which is made up of people who run\n      research studies. The study will not take new patients until the DLT period is done.\n\n      If at least 3 of the 10 patients enrolled do not benefit, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)\n      will be considered exceeded. After the DLT period is complete, patients will receive a stem\n      cell transplant from a genetically matched donor. Patients will be continued to be monitored\n      for a year after the transplant.\n\n      To prepare for the transplant patients will have to undergo the following treatments:\n\n        -  an exchange transfusion\n\n        -  a stem cell graft infusion from either a:\n\n             -  perfectly matched sibling donor (called MSD),\n\n             -  perfectly matched but unrelated donor (called MUD),\n\n             -  a half-matched related donor (called Haploidentical), or\n\n             -  a cord blood donor\n\n        -  rabbit antithymocyte globulin (ATG)\n\n        -  cytoxan  (a type of chemotherapy)\n\n        -  Fludarabine (you get this medicine a few weeks before transplant and again, as part of\n           the routine chemotherapy treatment). This is the main drug being studies in this\n           research\n\n        -  total body irradiation (also called TBI)\n\n        -  tacrolimus, mycophenolate (MMF) and/or methotrexate (MTX). These drugs will weaken your\n           immune system. They are given to lower your chances of getting GVHD and rejecting the\n           donor cells.\n\n      Patients will be in the study for approximately 14 months."
