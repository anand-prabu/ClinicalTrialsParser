Peripheral stem cell transplantation may allow the doctor to\n      give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill more tumor cells. Interferon alfa may\n      interfere with the growth of cancer cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to determine the effectiveness of giving interferon alfa after\n      chemotherapy and peripheral stem cell transplantation to patients who have stage III or\n      stage IV multiple myeloma and who have been treated with high-dose melphalan."

II. Determine the\n      response rate to high dose dexamethasone therapy using sequential noncrossresistant\n      chemotherapies for patients with advanced multiple myeloma.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients receive high dose dexamethasone on days 1-4, 9-12, and 17-20, followed by\n      4 weeks rest. Cyclophosphamide (CTX) is administered intravenously in combination with mesna\n      following dexamethasone therapy. Sargramostim (GM-CSF) is initiated subcutaneously 1 day\n      later and is continued for 10 days to support stem cell collections, which begin 10-14 days\n      after CTX induction. Following 4 weeks of rest, melphalan (L-PAM) is administered over 1\n      hour. Stem cell rescue is begun 48 hours after L-PAM therapy. Three to 4 months after the\n      first L-PAM course, a second L-PAM and stem cell rescue is undertaken. Interferon alfa-2b\n      (IFN-A) maintenance is administered 3 times per week following bone marrow recovery from the\n      first or second L-PAM courses. Patients achieving complete remission following the first\n      course of L-PAM may proceed directly to IFN-A maintenance. Patients achieving greater than\n      grade 3 nonhematologic toxicity or not achieving an absolute neutrophil count of greater\n      than 1,000/mm3 by day 21 posttransplant are not eligible for dose escalation.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A minimum of 30 patients will be enrolled."
