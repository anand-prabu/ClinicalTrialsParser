      This project will characterize children and adolescents with severe mood dysregulation (SMD)
      and conduct a pilot study of combination pharmacotherapy as a basis for future intervention
      trials.

      Eligible participants assessed for SMD will have 4 weeks open titration with
      lisdexamfetamine (LDX) to optimal dose, followed by double-blind randomization to fluoxetine
      (N=25) or placebo (N=25) in combination with optimized LDX for an additional 8 weeks.
      Participants will be monitored for clinical response and adverse events.

      Specific aims are:

      #1: To define youth meeting SMD criteria in terms of psychiatric comorbidity, neurocognitive
      functioning, and a potential &quot;bio-signature&quot; derived from electroencephalography (EEG).

      Specific hypotheses to be tested include: 1) that SMD participants will differ in comparison
      to non-SMD individuals in our pre-existing database on patterns of a) psychiatric
      comorbidity, b) symptoms, c) behavioral ratings, and d) neurocognitive functioning, and 2)
      that a distinct EEG bio-signature will be confirmed in individuals formally diagnosed with
      SMD.

      #2: To conduct a preliminary study of sequential pharmacotherapy for SMD with a stimulant
      followed by randomized, placebo-controlled selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor (SSRI)
      therapy to evaluate the feasibility of recruitment and enrollment and assess the suitability
      of the proposed combination treatment as a basis for future clinical investigations.

      Specific hypotheses to be tested include: 1) that significant improvement in Clinical Global
      Impression - Improvement -SMD (CGI-I-SMD) scores and other secondary measures are evident
      after open-label LDX titration; 2) that participants randomized to fluoxetine will
      demonstrate additional significant improvement in CGI-I-SMD scores and other secondary
      measures in comparison to participants randomized to placebo; 3) that combination LDX and
      SSRI therapy is safe and well tolerated, and 4) that EEG profiles will normalize with
      treatment.

      Background

      The increased frequency of diagnosed pediatric bipolar disorder has emerged as one of the
      greatest controversies in child and adolescent psychiatry.  Beginning with reports that 20%
      of prepubertal of children with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) met criteria
      for juvenile mania, a view arose that bipolar children were more irritable than euphoric and
      more chronic than episodic, compared with the typical adult.  Concurrently, there was a 4 to
      6-fold increase in inpatient discharges and 40-fold increase in office-based visits for
      pediatric bipolar disorder, although many of these failed to meet formal Diagnostic and
      Statistical Manual (DSM) criteria.  Concerns have been raised that any child with impulsive,
      volatile behavior is apt to be diagnosed as bipolar.

      Some attempted to inform valid symptomatic boundaries by proposing a differentiation of
      narrow versus broad pediatric bipolar phenotypes.  The narrow phenotype was defined by
      strict DSM criteria for mania or hypomania, including discrete episodes of grandiosity and
      euphoria.  In contrast, the broad phenotype, also referred to as severe mood dysregulation
      (SMD), was defined by chronic, non-episodic illness lacking hallmark symptoms of grandiosity
      and euphoria, but typified by severe irritability and hyperarousal.  Work at the National
      Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) demonstrated that patterns of adolescent irritability are
      stable and distinct, with episodic irritability leading to mania and simple phobia, and
      chronic irritability leading to diagnosed depression and ADHD.  On structured assessment,
      children with SMD were highly comorbid for major depression (20%), anxiety (64%),
      oppositional defiant disorder (83%), and ADHD (87%).  Others also found increased rates of
      ADHD and anxiety.  In addition, the broad and narrow phenotypes could be differentiated
      according to electroencephalography (EEG) measures.  SMD youth have impaired face emotion
      recognition deficits correlated with dysfunctional family relationships and were less
      influenced by emotional distracters during tasks of attention.  A recent study revealed
      patterns of amygdala hypoactivation similar to depression, further supporting links between
      chronic irritability and subsequent depressive episodes.

      In response to the perceived over-diagnosis of pediatric DSM bipolar disorder,
      acknowledgment that the &quot;classic&quot; adult bipolar phenotype does occur in prepubertal youth,
      and increased recognition that SMD is a distinct behavioral and/or biological syndrome, the
      DSM-5 Child Disorders Workgroup proposed a new diagnostic category named temper
      dysregulation disorder with dysphoria (TDD).  Criteria for TDD were largely based on SMD,
      however, the requirement for hyperarousal was removed and minor changes were made in age of
      onset and exclusion criteria.  Unlike SMD, TDD lacks any demonstrated scientific basis or
      history of prior research.  As such, it seems prudent at this time to continue research on
      the better-established SMD category with an expectation that any information derived will
      have ready applicability as work on TDD progresses.

      One preliminary report suggests that SMD has a lifetime prevalence of 3.3% among those ages
      9-19.  Recent longitudinal studies further indicate that children with SMD have increased
      rates of adult mood and anxiety disorders, substance abuse, suicidality, and poorer overall
      functioning.  Given this significant morbidity, it is essential that the investigators
      increase understanding of children with chronic irritability and affective instability.
      Impulsive aggression in childhood has been identified as a significant public health concern
      that cuts across currently defined diagnostic categories.  These youth demonstrate increased
      difficulties with school adjustment, peer interactions, cognitive deficits, problem-solving,
      and physical abuse - a developmental trajectory predictive of significant adult dysfunction.

      Current community practice emphasizes use of second-generation antipsychotic agents for
      children with impulsive aggression.  While risperidone has proven effective for irritability
      associated with pervasive developmental disorders [25,26] and second-generation
      antipsychotics have been effective in pediatric bipolar disorder, these agents are
      associated with significant weight gain and other metabolic effects.  Use of these
      medications is associated with decreased utilization of psychosocial interventions.  Given
      the relationship of SMD with ADHD, anxiety, and unipolar depression, investigations of drugs
      from other classes with targeted effects and better side effect profiles, such as mood
      stabilizers, antidepressants, and stimulants, are certainly warranted.  In fact, the DSM-5
      Workgroup has specifically called for clinical trials stating it is &quot;critically important&quot;
      to assess whether stimulants and SSRIs should be first line treatments in SMD-affected
      youth.  The only published medication trial in SMD youth is a double-blind placebo
      controlled study of lithium conducted by the intramural group at NIMH, which failed to
      demonstrate effects.  Other informative investigations include small positive studies of
      methylphenidate versus placebo for ADHD plus oppositional defiant disorder and aggression,
      open-label stimulant followed by adjuvant divalproex vs. placebo for ADHD and aggression,
      and stimulant augmentation with double-blind risperidone versus placebo in ADHD with
      treatment resistant aggression.  These studies are notably heterogeneous in design and
      choice of outcome measures.  No clear predictors of response have been reported.

      Most existing SMD research has been conducted by a single intramural group at NIMH.  It is
      imperative that investigations of SMD be expanded to other research groups to ensure that
      results generalize to broad clinical settings.  Additional research is required to delineate
      clinical phenomenology that will inform subsequent efforts at diagnostic classification.
      Further work is also necessary to establish the appropriate foundation for future clinical
      interventions research.  This should include pilot studies of various medication classes
      that might prove useful in management of SMD, as well as examination of various outcome
      measures that are likely to be useful in both medication and psychosocial intervention
      trials.

      Overview

      The study will include comprehensive phenotyping of 65 patients meeting criteria for SMD,
      including assessment of comorbid psychopathology, language disorder, neurocognition, and
      EEG.  Potential endophenotypes and diagnostic boundaries will be assessed in relation to our
      large existing database of children and adolescents with internalizing and externalizing
      disorders, as well as non-clinical controls.  Eligible participants with SMD will proceed to
      a pilot study of sequential pharmacotherapy with an initial 4-week titration of open label
      lisdexamfetamine (LDX) followed by 8 weeks adjunctive therapy with randomized fluoxetine or
      placebo.  Statistical analyses will address diagnostic boundaries of SMD compared with other
      disorders and emphasize initial determinations of the potential efficacy and tolerability of
      stimulant and SSRI treatments for SMD.  There will be an added emphasis on effect size
      estimates and determination of optimal outcome measures in anticipation of future
      large-scale studies.

      Project Visits and Procedures

      At baseline, visits 1, and 2 eligible participants will undergo open-label stepwise
      titration with one week each of low, medium, and high dose LDX.  The study physician may
      modify titration due to emergent side effects following routine practice standards.

      At visit 3, the clinician will determine &quot;optimal&quot; stimulant dose based on review of parent
      and teacher-completed Conners Global Index scales and all available adverse event and side
      effects data, using procedures similar to those used in other studies.  Participants will
      remain on this optimal stimulant dose for the remainder of the study, unless side effects
      necessitate some downward dose adjustment.

      At visit 4, participants who fail to achieve CGI-I-SMD score greater than or equal to 2 will
      be randomized to double blind adjunctive treatment with either fluoxetine or placebo.

      A forced dose, stepwise, upward titration of one week each of 5, 10, and 20 mg
      fluoxetine/placebo will occur at visits 4, 5, and 6.  The treating physician may modify this
      titration schedule in response to emergent side effect following routine practice standards.
       Participants will remain on their visit 6 doses of fluoxetine/placebo until the study's
      final visit, unless side effects necessitate some downward titration.

      Side effects, adverse events, and medication compliance will be assessed at each visit.
      Major outcome assessments will occur at baseline, visits 4, and 12.

      Arrangements will be made to transfer participants to standard clinical care following visit
      12.  One month after visit 12, families will be contacted by telephone for a final
      assessment of residual adverse events and ongoing medication use.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male and female participants, ages 7-17 years.

          2. Abnormal mood (specifically anger, sadness, and/or irritability), present at least
             half of the day most days and of sufficient severity to be noticeable in the child's
             environment (e.g. parents, teachers, peers).

          3. Hyperarousal, as defined by at least three of the following symptoms: insomnia,
             agitation, distractibility, racing thoughts or flight of ideas, pressured speech,
             intrusiveness.

          4. Compared to his/her peers, the child exhibits markedly increased reactivity to
             negative emotional stimuli that is manifest verbally and/or behaviorally.  For
             example, the child responds to frustration with extended temper tantrums
             (inappropriate for age and/or precipitating event), verbal rages, and/or aggression
             toward people or property.  Such events occur, on average, at least three times a
             week.

          5. Criteria 2, 3, and 4 are currently present and have been present for at least 12
             months without any symptom free periods exceeding two months.

          6. The onset of symptoms must be prior to age 12 years.

          7. The symptoms are severe in at least one setting (e.g. violent outbursts, extreme
             verbal abuse, assaultiveness at home, school, or with peers). In addition. There are
             at least mild symptoms (distractibility, intrusiveness) in a second setting.

          8. Score &gt; 9 on either the Inattentive or Hyperactive/Impulsive subscales of the
             baseline ADHD-RS.

          9. Score &lt; 12 on the irritability subscale of the Aberrant Behavior Checklist. -

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. As evidenced in the mania section of the Kiddie-Schedule for Affective Disorders and
             Schizophrenia, the individual exhibits any of these cardinal bipolar symptoms in
             distinct periods lasting more than 1 day, and therefore meets criteria for bipolar
             disorder not otherwise specified (NOS):

             i) Elevated or expansive mood. ii) Grandiosity or inflated self esteem. iii)
             Decreased need for sleep. iv) Increase in goal-directed activity (this can result in
             the excessive involvement in pleasurable activities that have a high potential for
             painful consequences).

          2. Meets criteria for schizophrenia, schizophreniform, schizoaffective illness, PTSD, or
             conduct disorder.

          3. T-score greater than/equal to 60 on baseline Social Responsiveness Scale

          4. Meets criteria for substance use disorder in the three months prior to baseline.

          5. Full scale intelligence  &lt; 70.

          6. The symptoms are due to the direct physiological effects of drug abuse, or to a
             general medical or neurological condition.

          7. Currently pregnant or lactating, or sexually active without using an acceptable
             method of contraception.

          8. Failed an adequate trials (defined as four weeks of consecutive treatment at the
             minimally effective dose) or severe ill effects while on therapeutic doses of SSRI
             therapy.

          9. Hypersensitivity or severe adverse reaction to methylphenidate.

         10. History of fainting after exercise, syncope, a young family with sudden cardiac
             death, or known structural heart defect.

         11. A serious history of adverse reactions (psychosis, severely increased activation
             compared to baseline) to methylphenidate or amphetamines.

         12. Any chronic medical condition that requires medication that is contraindicated with
             SSRI or stimulant therapy, or any serious chronic or unstable medical disorder.

         13. Medical contraindication to treatment with SSRI or stimulant therapy. -
