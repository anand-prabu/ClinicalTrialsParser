  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study is aimed at assessing the acute effect of several combinations of lipids
      differing in their fatty acid composition on glucagon-like-peptide (GLP)-2 and GLP-1
      secretion in healthy subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators aim to investigate the effect of various lipid types on
      GLP-2 and GLP-1 secretion. This will allow to determine the importance of lipids in
      nutritional solutions. Moreover, this will allow us to assess whether existing clinical
      formulas can be improved in order to stimulate GLP-2 and accelerate intestinal recovery.
