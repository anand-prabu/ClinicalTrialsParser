    <textblock>
      Ten (10) adult female subjects that had a caesarean surgery performed.Study will be
      conducted in 1 site.

      Each subject will receive three treatments on one area that was randomly chosen. The other
      area will be left untreated and will serve as a control.

      The objective is to Evaluate the clinical impact of UltraPulse fractional carbon dioxide
      laser treatment on the appearance of a Caesarean Scar (CS) as compared to a similar
      untreated scar side.
