Samples will be\n      collected from adult women or men who have previously tested positive as carriers for\n      various recessive conditions. These are healthy adults who carry a mutation that might place\n      them at increased risk of having a child with a specific genetic disorder. Study\n      participation will be open to adults that were previously tested as part of their routine\n      medical care and where test results demonstrated positive carrier status for a specific\n      genetic disease. Samples will be tested for the disease mutation for which the subjects\n      provides documentation of prior testing."
