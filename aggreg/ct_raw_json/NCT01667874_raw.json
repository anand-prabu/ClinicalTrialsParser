            "textblock": "While total hip and knee replacement surgery remains a highly successful treatment for\n      arthritis of the hip and knee, infection following a joint replacement still remains an\n      issue, occurring in approximately 1-2% of joint replacement patients.  Treatment of\n      infection remains very difficult with the successful elimination of the infection being\n      quite variable, ranging from as low as 10% to approximately 85-90%, following a two stage\n      revision. A two stage revision involves removing the joint replacement implant and replacing\n      it with a cement spacer until the surgeon is comfortable that the infection has been\n      eliminated.  In the second part of a two stage revision the cement spacer is removed and a\n      new joint replacement implant is inserted in the joint space.  In particular, the treatment\n      of an acute infection, that is, infection occurring in the early postoperative period or in\n      a patient with less than two weeks duration of symptoms, is particularly problematic.  As a\n      first line of treatment, surgeons often perform an irrigation (washing out a wound with a\n      stream of water) and debridement (the surgical removal of contaminated tissue) surrounding\n      the joint in the hopes of preserving the joint replacement, although the success rate is\n      highly variable. Most treatment routines involve irrigation of the joint with copious\n      (large) amounts of fluid, removal of infected soft tissue, replacement of any removable\n      parts (example plastic liners or femoral heads) and then intravenous antibiotics for a\n      prolonged period of time (6-8 weeks).  It is thought that part of the reason for failure\n      with this form of treatment is the inability to adequately provide local antibiotics to the\n      joint environment while the joint replacement components are in place. In particular, the\n      formation of a bacterial slime by the infecting organism, which can attach itself to the\n      metallic components, is thought to be a major hindrance to removing infection.  In theory,\n      the ability to infuse local antibiotics to the joint could prove advantageous to the\n      treatment of joint replacement infections.\n\n      Collatamp\u00ae is a like a small flat sponge soaked with antibiotics that delivers a consistent\n      dose of fast-release antibiotics called Gentamicin Sulphate (2.0 mg/cm2). The antibiotic is\n      concentrated locally in the tissue around the joint replacement. The sponge is reabsorbed by\n      the body and therefore does not need to be surgically removed.  Collatamp\u00ae sponges have been\n      utilized in the clinical setting for over 20 yrs. This material has been used in treatment\n      of other orthopaedic, general surgery, and cardiac infections, but has not been studied in\n      the setting of infected total joint replacements. The purpose of this study is to examine\n      the use of CollatampTM sponges as an addition to the treatment of acute joint infections\n      after a total joint replacement surgery."
