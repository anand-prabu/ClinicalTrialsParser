Patients may\n      be treated on more than one regimen, if they meet the eligibility requirements.\n\n      Patients on regimen A are adults and receive uridine triphosphate (UTP) by inhalation,\n      followed immediately by bronchoscopy.\n\n      Patients on regimen B are children, aged 4 to 10 years.  Patients receive up to 4 graded\n      doses of UTP by inhalation on day 1.  On day 2, patients receive a single dose of UTP.\n      Patients receive amiloride followed by UTP by inhalation on day 3.\n\n      Patients on regimen C are children, aged 4 to 18 years.  Patients inhale a radiolabelled\n      (technetium 99m) monodisperse iron oxide aerosol.  Radiation deposited in the patient's\n      lungs is monitored.  Patients are randomized to receive one of 4 different aerosols\n      (vehicle; UTP; amiloride; or UTP plus amiloride), which is inhaled for 20 minutes.  Patients\n      are followed 24 hours after aerosol exposure.\n\n      Regimen D is a dose escalation study in which patients are aged 9 to 40 years.  Patients\n      receive either the vehicle or UTP by inhalation 3 times daily for 3 days.  Cohorts of 4\n      patients each are entered at each dose level."
