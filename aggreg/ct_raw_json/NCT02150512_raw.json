            "textblock": "Rationale: Fluid loading is an important intervention in patients with severe sepsis and\n      septic shock in order to prevent development of multi organ failure and mortality. The\n      Surviving Sepsis Guidelines recommend during the first 6 hours of resuscitation a central\n      venous pressure (CVP) based fluid loading approach, targeting to 12-15 mmHg in mechanically\n      ventilated patients. CVP however has proven to be a poor indicator for preload and preload\n      dependency, while dynamic parameters as stroke volume variation (SVV) derived from the\n      transpulmonary thermodilution technique (TPTD) are superior. Together with the ability to\n      measure the extravascular lung water (EVLW), the TPTD technique may guide fluid management\n      more accurately and may prevent deleterious fluid overloading.\n\n      Objective:  The risk of fluid overloading in mechanically ventilated patients with septic\n      shock is less when fluid administration is based on a fluid loading protocol using SVV\n      together with EVLW measurements than applying the Surviving Sepsis Guidelines targeting CVP\n      to 12-15 mmHg, in at least the first 6 hours of resuscitation, translating in more\n      ventilator free days (VFDs) Study design: This is a prospective, randomized, non-blinded,\n      single-center, controlled clinical trial comparing two different fluid resuscitation\n      strategies in patients with septic shock. Patients will be randomized for fluid management\n      based on the Surviving Sepsis Guidelines (SSG) or based transpulmonary thermodilution (TPTD)\n      derived SVV and EVLW in at least the first 6 hours of resuscitation.\n\n      Study population: All patients of \u226518 years admitted to the ICU because of septic shock\n      together with the need for mechanical ventilation are eligible for randomization\n      Intervention: During at least the first 6 hours of resuscitation, the standard group (SSG\n      guided therapy) follows a fluid resuscitation protocol based on the Surviving Sepsis\n      Campaign recommendations. Initial trigger for fluid loading when circulatory insufficiency\n      is present will be the CVP (target \u226512 mmHg). The intervention group (TPTD guided therapy)\n      follows a fluid resuscitation protocol based on SVV and EVLW. Initial trigger for fluid\n      loading when circulatory insufficiency is present will be SVV. The study protocol will be\n      applied up to a maximum of 72 hours.\n\n      Main study parameters/endpoints: VFDs on day 28. Benefit and risks associated with\n      participation:  Since inclusion criteria include a TPTD (5F fiber optic, femoral artery)\n      catheter, the inconvenience as compared to standard treatment is minimal.  Current routine\n      hospital policy involves TPTD catheter insertion in most of the patients meeting the\n      inclusion criteria specified above."
