Kinerase has been found out to significantly improve the appearance of skin texture, mottled hyperpigmentation and fine wrinkles. It  does not cause the cutaneous side effects that result from other commonly used anti-aging products. The Kinerase cream contains: Water, glyceryl stearate, propylene glycol, butylenes glycol, glycerin, cetyl alcohol, stearic acid, isopropyl palmitate, squalene, stearyl alcohol, glycene soja sterols, dimethicone, laureth-23, aloe barbadensis leaf juice, phenoxyethanol, carbomer, ethylhexyglycerin, sodium hydroxide, soluble collagen, kinetin, panthenol, tocopherol, citric acid, sodium citrate, hydrolysed elastin."
