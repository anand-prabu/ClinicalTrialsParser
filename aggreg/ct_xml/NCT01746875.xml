      The purpose of this study is to determine treatment effects in patients with retinal pigment
      epithelium detachment (PED) in relation to Age Related Maculopathy (AMD). Patients with
      newly diagnosed PED without choroidal neovascularisations (CNV), will be randomized to
      either treatment or observation. The treatment group will first be given injections with
      anti Vascular Endothelium Growth Factor (anti-VEGF). If the injections do not have any
      effect, Verteporfin Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) will be given. All patients will be followed
      for a period of 2 years. It is hypothesized that treatment stops the progression of the
      disease and stabilizes the vision in this subgroup of patients with AMD.
