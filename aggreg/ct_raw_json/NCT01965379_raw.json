Data from studies performed in the USA\n      shows a reduction in phosphatemia with nutritional orientation to reduce foods containing\n      additives from restaurants in the region of the study . In another study, also conducted in\n      the USA, the researchers evaluated the phosphorus content and presence of additives in\n      appetizers and side orders served at fast food restaurants in Cleveland. The results showed\n      that of the appetizers, 52% were accepted by the traditional criteria for the renal diet\n      (low content of sodium, potassium and organic or natural phosphorus), but only 16% were also\n      free of phosphorus additives; of the side orders, 23% were accepted by the traditional\n      criteria and 17% were exempt of phosphorus additives. Thus, only a small proportion of\n      appetizers and side orders served at fast food restaurants were compatible with the renal\n      diet.                                                                      Considering that\n      alimentary phosphorus has an important role in the control of phosphatemia, there is a lack\n      of studies which evaluates the effect of foods containing phosphorus additives on\n      phosphatemia and which, at the same time, evaluated the alimentary ingestion and the\n      nutritional state of the chronic kidney disease patients treated with hemodialysis.\n\n      Can the elimination of foods containing phosphorus additives and their substitution for\n      foods without additives reduce phosphatemia without altering the nutritional state of\n      hyperphosphatemic patients on hemodialysis?"
