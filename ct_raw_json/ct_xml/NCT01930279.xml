    <textblock>
      Sleep deprivation was found to affect many organs including the immune system and
      predisposing for various health consequences including diabetes hypertension infections and
      increase in neoplastic diseases.

      Subjects will be evaluated for immune parameters in peripheral blood test following a
      regular nigh sleep and compared with a test performed following a night shift in which they
      slept less than 3 hours.

      Each participant will serve as its own control.

      Overall Study Design and Plan

        1. Subjects will be bled on the day of the experiment between 8and 9 AM.

        2. Blood tubes will be tested for T cell markers, serum cytokines levels, and other immune
           parameters by western blots.

        3. The first tube will be tested on the day of experiment.

        4. The second tube will kept in the lab and will be tested 24 hours later.

        5. The third tube will be kept in the pocket of the subject and be tested 24 hours later.

        6. The fourth tube will be kept in the pocket of another subject and will be tested 24
           hours later.

        7. The subject will be tested again following 24 hours.

        8. Each subject will be tested twice following a regular 6-8 hours of sleep, and following
           an on call duty in which he slept less than 3 hours.
