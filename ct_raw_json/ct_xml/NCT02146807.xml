    <textblock>
      The Investigational device is a dual wavelength laser system developed for treatment of
      pigmented lesions and for tattoo removal. The base unit is a GentleMax Pro laser system
      modified to emit light at wavelengths of 532 and 1064 nm and deliver pulse energy up to
      400mJ, and pulse duration of 700 ps.

      A multicenter study.
