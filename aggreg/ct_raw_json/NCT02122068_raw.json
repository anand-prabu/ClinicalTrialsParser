            "textblock": "Family dementia caregivers provide a needed service to relatives with dementia and to\n      society, but are often at risk for consequences to their own health such as depression,\n      reduced immune system function, and burnout. Central Meditation and Imagery Therapy (CMIT)\n      is a novel group mindfulness and guided imagery intervention designed to help caregivers\n      reduce depressive symptoms and cope with the stress of caregiving. A small study suggested\n      that CMIT techniques are feasible for dementia caregivers, and resulted in a reduction of\n      depressive and anxiety symptoms. The largest benefits were shown to occur within the first 4\n      weeks, and were maintained at 3 months post treatment. The early benefits of CMIT were\n      further described in a recent trial of CMIT for patients with recurrent depression, which\n      demonstrated promising improvement in depressive symptoms, with the largest benefits\n      occurring within the first 4 weeks. We have therefore shortened CMIT for caregivers from 8\n      weeks to 4 weeks, and aim to study the effects of the four-week version (Central Meditation\n      and Imagery Therapy, Short Term, CMIT-ST) on dementia caregivers with elevated depressive\n      symptoms. We will conduct a pilot feasibility of CMIT-ST versus home relaxation practice\n      with 24 dementia caregivers. Half of the caregivers will be randomly assigned to receive a\n      relaxation recording, while the other half will receive CMIT-ST. After 4 weeks, the group\n      assigned to the relaxation recording will then have the opportunity to participate in\n      CMIT-ST.\n\n      To measure the effects of CMIT-ST, we will obtain depression symptom ratings and\n      questionnaires about psychological symptoms before and after CMIT-ST. We will also study the\n      biological effects of CMIT-ST. We will do so by measuring brain activity, recording the\n      pulse in order to determine variation in beat to beat intervals of the heart, and studying\n      patterns of gene expression."
