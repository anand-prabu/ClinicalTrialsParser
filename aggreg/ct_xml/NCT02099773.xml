  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This exploratory and observational study focuses on adults with an intellectual disability
      (ID) caused by Down Syndrome and their support workers. Adults with ID due to a non-genetic
      cause constitute the control group. All clients have a mild to moderate ID and use a form of
      Alternative Augmentative Communication (AAC). Approximately half of adults with ID is
      estimated to experience communication difficulties. AAC supports them in their daily
      communication aiming at optimal participation in society. Current communication models, such
      as Participation Model (Beukelman &amp; Mirenda, 2005) and ICF (WHO, 2001), regard both client
      related and environmental factors as important elements of communication. A substantial part
      of the environmental factors is made up of the communication partners' characteristics. In
      daycare and residential services for adults with ID an important communication partner
      constitutes the support worker.

      This study aims to:

        1. with regard to teaching KeyWordSigning (KWS), a specific form of AAC, to support
           workers:

           Analyse the relation between training method, support workers' attitude, and short and
           long term sign knowledge.

        2. with regard to the use of AAC in everyday communication between support workers and
           adults with ID:

             -  Identity the support workers' characteristics that may influence the
                quality/quantity of the communication between adults with ID who use AAC and their
                support worker.

             -  Analyse the nature of this influence as well as any possible interaction effects
                with the clients' characteristics.
