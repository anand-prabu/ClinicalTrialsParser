Beta-endorphins can be made in response to stress, injury, and also\n      pleasurable activities. In previous studies, it has been shown that levels of\n      beta-endorphins in the blood go up during radiation therapy, and that this increase is\n      linked to fatigue. This suggests that naltrexone may help to reduce fatigue in people who\n      are getting radiation therapy In this research study, the investigators are looking to see\n      whether naltrexone works better than a placebo in reducing fatigue during radiation therapy."

Those whose fatigue\n      symptoms increase above the pre-specified threshold at any point during the monitoring\n      period will be approached about enrollment into the intervention phase of the study.\n\n      Intervention Phase: This is a randomized, double-blind, parallel-arm 5-week clinical trial\n      which will be used to determine the effect of naltrexone on fatigue emerging during\n      radiation therapy for non-metastatic breast cancer."
