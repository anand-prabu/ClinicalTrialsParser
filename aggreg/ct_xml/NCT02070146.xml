  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Survival after colorectal cancer (CRC) diagnosis strongly depends on local tumor extent,
      lymph node involvement and the presence of distant metastases. However, there remains great
      inter-patient variability regarding treatment outcome. A combination of biochemical factors,
      histopathological features, genomic profile, environmental factors and other clinical
      factors are likely to influence prognosis and treatment effect, independent from tumor
      stage, but it is still unclear which, how, and to what extent these factors can influence
      tumor recurrence and mortality in both early stage (I-III) and late stage (IV) CRC.

      Although the results from prospective clinical trials will remain the backbone of evidence
      based medicine, this concerns a highly selected patient population since the large majority
      (85%-95%) of cancer patients do not participate to clinical trials for various reasons. It
      is unlikely that trial participation will significantly improve in the near future. This
      fact has the following implications: 1) It is highly desirable to validate the results from
      trials in the general patient population. However, this is complicated by the fact that the
      documentation of patients treated in general practice (i.e. outside the scope of clinical
      trials) is largely insufficient to provide comparable patient cohorts in terms of prognostic
      characteristics and treatment parameters. 2) There is an increased availability of novel
      technologies that provide molecular markers with potential prognostic and/or predictive
      value. To test the clinical value of these markers large numbers of patients are required
      which greatly exceeds the number of patients who consent to participate to prospective
      clinical trials. 3) as a result of rapid technical developments, a range of new minimally
      invasive treatment options for CRC are entering the market. These interventions have the
      potential to be of great benefit to patients in terms of improved local control, higher
      probability of complete tumor removal, less damage to surrounding tissue, faster recovery
      and less short and long term side effects. Still, the interventions will have to prove their
      effectiveness, safety and superiority (or non-inferiority) to standard cancer treatments on
      a patient level. A prospective observational cohort study has the great opportunity to fill
      this gap.

      Objectives

        -  To start a prospective observational cohort study of CRC patients from their primary
           diagnosis until death.

        -  After obtaining Informed Consent, to prospectively collect data on medical history,
           serious comorbidities, baseline clinical parameters, imaging results, pathology
           results, tumor characteristics, treatment, treatment outcomes, hospital stays,
           interventions and grade 3/4 adverse events.

        -  After obtaining separate Informed Consent for biobanking, to store blood and tumor
           tissue material, obtained during routine practice, in the biobank.

        -  The cohort will serve as an infrastructure geared towards efficient, safe and
           comprehensive clinical evaluation of new (image guided) interventions for treatment of
           CRC.

      Expected outcome

        -  More accurate data on the treatment and clinical and patient reported outcomes of CRC
           in daily practice.

        -  A continuous infrastructure for a large variety of research purposes including:

      A. Prognostic research B. Biological research and (epi)genetic research C. Studies that
      compare new therapies in a target population according to the cohort multiple randomized
      controlled trial design. D. Health care policies and cost-effectiveness studies
