    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies the effects, good and bad, of using everolimus along
      with sorafenib tosylate versus sorafenib tosylate alone in treating patients with advanced
      radioactive iodine refractory thyroid cancer. Sorafenib tosylate and everolimus may stop the
      growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. The addition
      of everolimus to sorafenib tosylate may cause more shrinkage of thyroid cancer and may
      prevent it from growing but it could also cause more side effects than sorafenib tosylate
      alone. It is not yet known whether this treatment with sorafenib tosylate and everolimus is
      better, the same, or worse than sorafenib tosylate alone.

    <textblock>
      This randomized Phase II trial will compare the progression-free survival (PFS) of sorafenib
      and everolimus versus sorafenib alone in patients with radioactive iodine refractory hurthle
      cell thyroid cancer. Prior studies have shown that the median PFS is generally around 4.5
      months for sorafenib alone in this disease population. It is hoped that the combination of
      everolimus and sorafenib can increase the median PFS to at least 9 months. In addition to
      PFS, this trial will also compare the confirmed response rate, overall survival (OS) and
      adverse event rates between sorafenib and everolimus vs. sorafenib alone. The primary and
      secondary objectives for the study are listed below.

      Primary Objective:

      To compare the progression free survival between sorafenib and everolimus versus sorafenib
      alone in patients with radioactive iodine refractory Hurthle cell thyroid cancer

      Secondary Objective:

      To compare the confirmed response rate, overall survival and adverse event rates between
      sorafenib and everolimus versus sorafenib alone.

      Treatment will continue until disease progression or unacceptable adverse events. Patients
      will be followed for 5 years after randomization.
