The\n      purpose of this research study is to find out if an eighteen-session strengthening program\n      will decrease your anterior cruciate ligament injury rate.\n\n      There will be approximately ninety-four (94) people in this research study at Henry Ford\n      Health System (HFHS)."

This program has no more risk than if\n      each athlete were to work out at their own gym. Each athlete will be given two\n      questionnaires before and after completing the program in order to determine their level of\n      activity has changed as well as uncover any underlying knee issues. They will also go\n      through a series of functional and movement tests to reveal any imbalances, and determine\n      whether or not they have improved by going through the prevention program.\n\n      All functional and movement tests will be video recorded. These recordings will only be used\n      for the purpose of conducting this research study and will only be viewed by the HFHS people\n      participating in the study. We will follow-up with each athlete one year later to see if\n      there are any lasting effects from the program and re-test each athlete at that time to\n      validate any results"
