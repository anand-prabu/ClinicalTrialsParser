Define the immunological parameters of cytolytic T cell and T helper cell\n      activity associated with skin testing and vaccination with autologous lung tumor associated\n      antigen and detoxPC in patients with curatively resected stage I, II, or IIIA non-small cell\n      lung cancer (NSCLC) or stage I or II mesothelioma. II. Evaluate any responses associated\n      with an enhanced antitumor immune status in this patient population with this treatment\n      regimen.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients undergo delayed type hypersensitivity skin testing with autologous tumor\n      associated antigen (TAA) and memory antigens (i.e., Monilia, PPD, and Trichophyton)\n      intradermally at 1-4 weeks following surgical tumor resection. At week 4-9, patients receive\n      low dose cyclophosphamide IV once. At 3 days following chemotherapy, patients receive\n      autologous TAA with DetoxPC intradermally for up to 3 doses over 4 weeks. At 2-3 weeks\n      following vaccination, patients undergo repeat skin testing. At week 6-12, patients with a\n      positive skin test undergo biopsy of the skin test/vaccination site followed by\n      leukapheresis at week 12-20 if T cells exhibit active antitumor reactivity. Patients with\n      stable or regressive disease receive additional vaccination courses at week 20 and\n      thereafter. Patients are followed for 5 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years."
