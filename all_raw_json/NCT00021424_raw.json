Beginning on week 16, patients may receive additional rF-TRI once every 8 weeks\n      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of rF-TRI until the maximum tolerated dose\n      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 3\n      or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed at 1 year.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued for this study."
