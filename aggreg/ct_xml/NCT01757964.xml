  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators want to see if Bacteriotherapy (also referred to as stool
      transplantation) improves the symptoms and decreases inflammation in children with
      Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). Examples of IBD are Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative
      Colitis. Additionally, researchers want to learn whether this experimental therapy delays
      the need for starting additional medications to treat pediatric IBD.
