            "textblock": "The occurrence of an acute respiratory failure necessitates mostly admission to ICU and\n      mechanical ventilation (MV). Rapid and safe discontinuation of MV should be the objective\n      for the majority of patients. Many reasons may contribute to weaning , extubation failure\n      and prolongation of MV. Critical illness myopathy, induced by immobilisation and prolonged\n      MV, may represent a main factor and  early rehabilitation may reverse these conditions and\n      improve the success of weaning from MV.The objective of this study is to evaluate the effect\n      of  an early chair sitting (while the patient is awake but still mechanically ventilated) on\n      weaning from mechanical ventilation and ICU mortality.\n\n      Methods: Chronic respiratory failure patients with an acute decompensation and requiring MV\n      for more than 48 hours will be randomized to 2 groups at the initiation of weaning schedule:\n      the studied group (20 patients): chair-sitting group will be transferred from bed to arm\n      chair for at least 1 hour and once a day; the control group will stay in bed until\n      extubation. Ventilator free days, extubation failure, nosocomial infections, ICU mortality,\n      ICU length of stay are assessed and compared between groups. Expected results: Early chair\n      sitting would decrease MV duration, number of extubation failure, nosocomial infections and\n      ICU mortality. Feasibility and safety of this intervention will also be evaluated and also\n      the related work load."
