In the second part of the study, we will provide HPV vaccines and other\n      vaccines (Tdap, meningococcal, varicella, influenza) to 100 adolescents in a local community\n      pharmacy in Chapel Hill, North Carolina.  This portion of the study will identify the\n      systems and workflow needed to provide vaccines effectively and safely, characterize\n      parents' and their adolescents' attitudes toward receiving vaccine services in a pharmacy,\n      and characterize pharmacists' attitudes toward providing adolescent vaccine services in a\n      pharmacy."
