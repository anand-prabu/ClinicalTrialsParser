  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is increasing. GDM requires patients to
      test their blood glucose at least four times daily. The investigators propose to
      prospectively evaluate blood glucose testing done every day compared to every other day. The
      primary goal is to establish the most cost-effective modality while still being able to
      detect patients who require therapy in a timely fashion. The investigators plan to evaluate
      this new management scheme utilizing a non-inferiority trial design.

      The investigators primary research question is the following: When managing patients with
      GDM, is every other day blood glucose testing non-inferior compared to every day blood
      glucose testing, as measured by the difference of less than 5% in birth weight?

      This study is a prospective randomized, non-inferiority clinical trial of pregnant women
      diagnosed with gestational diabetes and cared for at the Diabetes in Pregnancy clinic in
      Women &amp; Infants Hospital in Providence, Rhode Island. Patients with GDM diagnosed between 20
      weeks 0 days and 32 weeks 0 days of gestation will be recruited. Diagnosis of GDM will be
      based on Carpenter and Coustan criteria for an abnormal 3-hr 100 gram oral glucose tolerance
      test, as currently supported by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists
      (ACOG). Patients whose 1-hr, 50 gram oral glucose challenge test exceeds 200 mg/dl will not
      require a 3-hr OGTT.  If the patient meets the inclusion and exclusion criteria listed
      below, she will be offered participation in the trial and randomized to every day blood
      glucose testing or every other day blood glucose testing for the remainder of her pregnancy.

      After the diagnosis of GDM, and before recruitment to the study, all patients will be
      provided counseling and education and will attempt adequate blood glucose control with
      medical nutritional therapy alone for one week. During this period, all patients will test
      their blood glucose values daily. Only after this week is completed will a subject be
      approached for participation.
