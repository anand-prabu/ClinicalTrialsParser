Patients seen in an\n      out-patient pre-surgical testing center will receive 1) a one-page written information sheet\n      that outlines the benefits of pneumococcal immunization and 2) verbal reinforcement of this\n      message, provided by the clinical staff, during the patient's interview.\n\n      At-risk adult patients (as defined by Centers for Disease Control) seen in an ambulatory\n      healthcare environment (a pre-surgical testing center) will receive a one page,\n      \"gain-framed\" message that emphasizes the benefits of pneumococcal vaccinations. This\n      educational material will be reviewed and reinforced by clinical staff during the assessment\n      phase of the clinical visit. Among this group, there will be increased vaccination rate\n      compared with at-risk adult patients who did not receive this communication (prospective vs\n      retrospective data)."
