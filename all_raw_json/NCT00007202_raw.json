Following\n      infection, the viral load (level of HIV in the blood) rises rapidly over the next few days\n      to weeks. It is not known which is the best treatment in patients with very early HIV\n      infection. Researchers believe these patients may respond well to strong early treatment. A\n      combination consisting of enteric-coated didanosine (ddI-EC), stavudine (d4T), and the HIV-1\n      protease inhibitor, BMS-232632, will be tested."

            "textblock": "Acute primary HIV-1 infection (PHI) follows exposure to the HIV-1 virus and results in a\n      rapid rise in plasma viremia within days to 1 to 3 weeks. Individuals with acute PHI or\n      early HIV-1 infection represent a potentially unique patient population in which to evaluate\n      potent antiretroviral therapies because of the degree of viral heterogeneity and the fact\n      that immunologic disruption is likely to be lower than in later stages of HIV-1 disease. The\n      optimal treatment for acute PHI is unknown. This study evaluates a regimen consisting of\n      enteric-coated didanosine (ddI-EC), stavudine (d4T), and the HIV-1 protease inhibitor,\n      BMS-232632.\n\n      Patients are enrolled into Group I or Group II and may participate in substudies. Patients\n      in Group I receive ddI-EC, d4T, and BMS-232632 daily for 52 weeks. Clinical, virologic, and\n      immunologic evaluations are performed on Days 2, 7, 14, 21, and 28, then every 4 weeks\n      through Week 24, and then every 8 weeks thereafter through Week 48. Based on laboratory\n      results from the Week 48 visit, a decision is made by Week 52 whether or not to continue\n      study medications for an additional 52 weeks. Evaluation schedules for those patients\n      enrolled in substudies may be different. Group II patients elect not to receive\n      antiretroviral treatment and are followed as a natural history disease group to be compared\n      with patients in Group I. They are followed according to the same schedule of evaluations as\n      those enrolled in Group I, unless otherwise specified as part of their participation in\n      substudies. All patients are followed in this study at 8-week intervals for a total duration\n      of 104 weeks (2 years). HIV will be measured in plasma and tissues to determine reduction in\n      replication for a duration of at least 48 weeks.\n\n      The 3 substudies in which patients may participate are AI-03-006, Lymphoid Tissue Substudy;\n      AI-03-007, Immunology Substudy of cytolytic and co-stimulatory markers, T-cell repertoire,\n      and cytokine and chemokine elaboration; and AI-03-008, Viral Dynamics and Diversity\n      Substudy."
