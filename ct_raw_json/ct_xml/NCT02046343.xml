  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study it to determine if a promotora-led  intervention that takes a
      comprehensive, multi-level, community-based approach to promoting physical activity (PA) is
      effective among a particularly underserved segment of Latinas. We hypothesize that Latinas
      in the promotora-led PA Intervention will significantly increase minutes per week of
      moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) compared to Latinas in the attention-control
      group.
