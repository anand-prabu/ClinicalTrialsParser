Donation of blood or blood products (e.g. plasma, platelets) within 90 days prior to\n             or intention to donate blood during the entire study.\n\n         12. Use of another investigational medicinal product within 90 days prior to receiving\n             the first dose of IMP or intention to enrol in another clinical study throughout the\n             entire study (up to and including Day 57),  including the 6 month follow-up period\n             for those subjects who consent to remain on study for this follow-up.\n\n         13. Subject with suspected recent (\u226412 months) pre-exposure to the influenza A virus -\n             flu like symptoms associated with \u2265 2 days off normal daily activities\n\n         14. Subjects who have received a flu vaccine in the last 12 months or who anticipate\n             receiving it within the duration of the clinical phase of the study (ie up to\n             completion of Day 57) or the period up to the 6 month safety follow-up telephone\n             call, for the subjects who consent to remain on study for this follow-up.\n\n         15. Any clinically significant abnormalities, in the opinion of the Principal\n             Investigator or Co-Investigator, on electrocardiograms (ECGs), as assessed against\n             the clinical site's reference range.\n\n        In addition, for each subject, a completed medical history questionnaire will be taken as\n        part of the consented study procedure."
