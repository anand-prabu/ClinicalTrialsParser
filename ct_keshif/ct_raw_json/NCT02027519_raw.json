The protocol team would like to explore new strategies for increasing the number of\n      partners who receive an HIV test and whether this increase in testing also results in\n      identifying HIV-discordant couples. These couples would be the focus of the future large\n      prevention trial, therefore it is critical that the protocol team explore effective\n      strategies for identifying and recruiting these couples. Men and women (index participants)\n      who are attending Antenatal Care (ANC),Tuberculosis (TB) and antiretroviral therapy (ART)\n      clinics will be recruited for this study. If they agree to take part, a testing team will\n      visit their household and offer all adults staying in the house the opportunity to conduct a\n      self-test for HIV.  Seventy-\ufb01ve index participants will be enrolled into the study and have\n      their homes visited by the testing team. The number of household members tested will depend\n      on the number of people living in each household."
