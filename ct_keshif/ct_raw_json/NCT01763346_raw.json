The\n      primary outcome will be change in \u03b2-cell compensation for insulin resistance, which the\n      investigators will compare between groups. Secondary analyses will include other potential\n      markers of \u03b2-cell health and potential mediators of treatment-specific effects. The main\n      focus will be on mediators related to obesity. Clinically, the project will serve as a test\n      of concept for use of gastric banding relatively early in the spectrum of obesity and \u03b2-cell\n      disease. Biologically, the results will provide crucial information on potential mediators\n      of \u03b2-cell failure and its arrest or reversal in the context of obesity. Those mediators will\n      guide the development of more effective treatment and monitoring for the \u03b2-cell disease that\n      causes type 2 diabetes."
