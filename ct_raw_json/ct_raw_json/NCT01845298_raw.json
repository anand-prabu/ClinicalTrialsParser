Rifampicin is the least well absorbed of the\n      first-line anti-tuberculosis drugs. Rifampicin malabsorption is frequently observed in\n      HIV-infected patients with active tuberculosis, but cannot be predicted by patient factors\n      such as CD4+ T cell count, viral load, or the presence of diarrhea. The mechanisms for\n      rifampicin malabsorption in HIV-infected patients are unknown. An understanding of\n      mechanisms for rifampicin malabsorption could eventually lead to new therapeutic targets,\n      with the ultimate goal of improving HIV/tuberculosis treatment outcomes."
