  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dyskeratosis congenita is a disease that affects numerous parts of the body, most typically
      causing failure of the blood system. Lung disease and a predisposition to cancer are also
      frequent causes of illness and death. Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) can cure the blood
      system but can make the lung disease and cancer predisposition worse, because of agents such
      as alkylators and radiation that are typically used in the procedure. Based on the biology
      of DC, we hypothesize that it may be possible to avoid these agents in patients with DC, and
      still have a successful BMT. In this protocol we will test whether a regimen that avoids
      alkylators and radiation can permit successful BMT without compromising survival in patients
      with DC.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dyskeratosis congenita (DC) is an inherited multisystem disorder, which classically presents
      with a clinical triad of skin pigment abnormalities, nail dystrophy, and oral leukoplakia.
      DC is part of a spectrum of telomere biology disorders, which include some forms of
      inherited idiopathic aplastic anemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, and pulmonary fibrosis and
      the congenital diseases Hoyeraal-Hreidarsson syndrome and Revesz syndrome. Progressive bone
      marrow failure (BMF) occurs in more than 80% of patients under 30 years of age and is the
      primary cause of morbidity and mortality, followed by pulmonary failure and malignancies.
      Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is curative for the hematological
      defects, but several studies have demonstrated poor outcomes in DC patients due to increased
      early and late complications. A predisposition to pulmonary failure, vascular disease and
      secondary malignancies may contribute to the high incidence of fatal complications following
      HCT in DC patients, and provides an impetus to reduce exposure to chemotherapy and
      radiotherapy in preparative regimens. Recent studies suggest that fludarabine-based
      conditioning regimens provide stable engraftment and may avoid the toxicities seen after HCT
      for DC, but studies to date are limited to case reports, retrospective studies and a single
      prospective trial. In this study, we propose to prospectively evaluate the efficacy of a
      fludarabine- and antibody-based conditioning regimen in HCT for DC patients, with the goals
      of maintaining donor hematopoiesis and transfusion independence while decreasing early and
      late complications of HCT for DC.
