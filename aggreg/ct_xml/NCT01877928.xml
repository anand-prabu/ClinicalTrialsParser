  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of the Boussignac positive airway
      pressure system (a mask) applied immediately following post-operative extubation in
      improving lung function in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Assessments will be
      done before surgery and then at 1, 2 and 24 hours following extubation and will be compared
      to standard care for perioperative airway support. The study aims to give a broader and more
      inclusive picture (than the current literature) in terms of whether the Boussignac CPAP
      system should be considered for utilization by anesthesiologists caring for surgical
      patients with OSA.

    <description>Is a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) system marketed in Canada and the US for the treatment of Obstructive Sleep Apnea. The main difference is that this system is portable wheres the standard hospital CPAP is not. This allows for the application immediately post-extubation.</description>
