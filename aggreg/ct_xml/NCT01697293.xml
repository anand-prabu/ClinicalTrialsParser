      The investigators hypothesize that the addition of a specific AKT inhibitor (triciribine) to
      the regimen of weekly paclitaxel (followed sequentially by AC) will enhance the pathologic
      complete response rate in patients with locally advanced breast cancer.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Phase I: Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed adenocarcinoma
             of the breast associated with the following clinical stage: clinical IIIC or IV .The
             tumor must be Her2/neu negative

          -  Phase II: Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed adenocarcinoma
             of the breast associated with the following clinical stage: IIB, IIIA, IIIB, or
             IIIC.The tumor must be Her2/neu negative

          -  Phase I: Up to two prior non-taxane chemotherapy regimens for metastatic disease is
             permitted for patients enrolled on the phase I portion.

          -  Phase II: No prior chemotherapy, irradiation, or definitive therapeutic surgery for
             this malignancy. Patients who have had a prior sentinel lymph node biopsy for this
             malignancy are eligible.

          -  Patients who received tamoxifen or another selective estrogen receptor modulator
             (SERM) for prevention or treatment of breast cancer or for other indications (e.g.,
             osteoporosis, prior DCIS), or who receive aromatase inhibitors for prevention or
             treatment of breast cancer, are eligible. Patients who are hormone-receptor positive
             and who have received other hormonal agents for the treatment of breast cancer (eg,
             Fulvestrant) are also eligible.

             diagnoses are eligible: lobular carcinoma in situ, contralateral ductal carcinoma in
             situ, or contralateral invasive ductal and/or lobular cancer (an no prior adjuvant
             chemotherapy for previous breast malignancy).

          -  Women of child-bearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal
             or barrier method of birth control) prior to study entry and for the duration of
             study participation due to the unknown effects.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents.

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to triciribine or other agents used in the study (e.g., imidazoles,
             quinolones)

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, diabetes mellitus requiring therapy (insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents),
             congenital prolonged QT syndrome, requirement for a drug known to prolong the QT
             interval, a history of QT prolongation, a screening QTc &gt;/= 450 msec,
             hypertriglyceridemia requiring therapy, symptomatic congestive heart failure,
             unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social
             situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study

          -  HIV-positive patients receiving combination anti-retroviral therapy are excluded from
