The America Heart\n      Association (AHA) defined cardiovascular health using as metrics smoking status, body mass\n      index, physical activity, diet, total cholesterol, blood pressure and fasting blood glucose.\n\n      Objective: Evaluate Bayer employees' cardiovascular health according to the AHA definition\n      and the acceptance to engage in lifestyle change programs.\n\n      Methods: By the time of the annual occupational safety periodic medical examination,\n      employees will receive an email with information about the cardiovascular health screening,\n      exams requisition (fasting blood glucose and total cholesterol) and a copy of the written\n      informed consent. If the employee accepts to participate, after providing a written informed\n      consent, he will be evaluated according to the AHA cardiovascular health metrics. Data will\n      be collected at the occupational safety electronic health record. After medical evaluation,\n      employees will receive a printed feedback with their cardiovascular health score and will be\n      referred to indicated lifestyle change programs (healthy weight, smoking cessation, diabetes\n      control, high blood pressure control, dyslipidemia control).\n\n      After 12 months we will evaluate the percentage of employees who accept to participate;\n      prevalence of the cardiovascular risk factors and distribution according to the AHA\n      classification in ideal, intermediate and poor; adherence to lifestyle change programs."
