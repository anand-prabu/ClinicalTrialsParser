All the patients where (1) opioids were administered\n      during the surgery, (2) general anesthesia was necessary, and (3) the urinary bladder\n      catheterization was perform during the surgery were excluded from the study.\n\n      The participants were randomly divided into the study and control groups. No oral\n      premedication was administered. All the patients were asked to empty their urinary bladders\n      before arrival to the operating theatre. When the standard monitoring (continuous\n      electrocardiogram, noninvasive blood pressure, pulse oximetry) was started, intravenous\n      premedication with midazolam was administered and lumbar spinal anesthesia with hyperbaric\n      0.5% solution of bupivacaine hydrochloride was performed.\n\n      In the study group, but not in the the control one, the 40 mg of drotaverine hydrochloride\n      was administered intramuscularly. The decresed intravascular volume was corrected with\n      cristalloids. During the surgery the adequate, not deeper than II grade according to Ramsay\n      scale, level of sedationt was obtained with midazolam and/or propofol. All the participants\n      received a questionaire in which we asked the  questions about (1) the duration of\n      anesthesia, (2) the time of micturition, (3) the time when discomfort or pain appeared in\n      the lower abdomen, (4)  the incidence of the urinary bladder catheterization and time to\n      catheterization. On the next day after the surgery the questionaires were collected. In\n      cases, when the patient's dischaged from the hospital was planned during the weekend, he or\n      she was asked to pass on the questionaire to the nurses."
