      Primary objective: To assess post-marketing immunogenicity of Optivate® by monitoring plasma
      inhibitor levels for at least 100 Exposure Days (EDs) for each subject.

      Secondary objectives: To assess efficacy and tolerability by monitoring FVIII recovery and
      adverse events

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Written informed consent or, if less than 18 years of age written assent  (where
             possible) and their parent/guardian's written informed consent.

          -  Severe haemophilia A (&lt; 1%# FVIII:C).

          -  Previously Treated Patients (PTPs) with &gt; 150 exposure days on prior Factor VIII
             therapy (of which at least the last 50 EDs or 2 years treatment can be confirmed by
             way of subject records).

          -  Immunocompetent with CD4 count &gt; 200 / µl.

          -  HIV negative or a viral load &lt; 200 particles / µl.

               -  subjects suffering from severe haemophilia A (&lt;2%) may be enrolled, but only
                  after approval by BPL.  Subjects with a Factor VIII of &lt;2% may not constitute
                  more than 50% of the total patient population.  A separate statistical
                  evaluation will be conducted for the &lt;1% and &lt;2% populations.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  • History of inhibitor development to FVIII or a positive result on the Nijmegen
             Bethesda at screening (quantitative result of &gt; 0.6 BU) prior to the administration
             of Optivate®.

               -  Known or suspected hypersensitivity to the investigational medicinal product or
                  its excipients.

               -  Clinically significant liver disease, renal disease, or coagulopathy other than
                  haemophilia A.

               -  History of unreliability or non cooperation (including not being able to
                  complete the study diary).

               -  Participating in, or have taken part in another trial within the last 30 days.
