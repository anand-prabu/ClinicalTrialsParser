  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a three year research project whose aims are to design and test a
      state-of-the-science smartphone Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) and sensor
      technologies to provide mobile monitoring of schizophrenia to detect early signs of relapse.
       The proposed system will be used to continuously capture multidimensional behavior as it
      occurs in real-time and in real-world environments, detect individual early warning signs,
      and trigger targeted interventions that may mitigate the severity of relapses or prevent
      their recurrence altogether. Mobile sensors include paralinguistic aspects of speech,
      physical activity and location, and sleep. The first hypothesis is that mobile sensing and
      EMA techniques will capture early behavioral warning signs. The second hypothesis is that
      machine learning, coupled with user input, will enable development of individualized
      predictive &quot;risk signature&quot; models. The third hypothesis is that automated system patient
      and provider functions will help prevent psychotic relapses.

    <description>The proportion or relapses is defined as one of the following events: psychiatric hospitalization, a significant increase in the level of psychiatric care (i.e. frequency and intensity of services), dosage or additional medication coupled with an increase  of 25 percent from baseline on PANSS total score or increase of 10 points if the baseline was 40 or less, suicidal or homicidal ideation that was clinically significant in the investigators judgement, deliberate self-injury, violent behavior resulting in damage to another person or property.</description>
