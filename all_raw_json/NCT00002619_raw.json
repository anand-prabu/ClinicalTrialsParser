Bone marrow or peripheral stem cell transplantation may be able\n      to replace immune cells that were destroyed by chemotherapy used to kill tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of chemotherapy followed by autologous\n      bone marrow or peripheral stem cell transplantation in treating patients with glioblastoma\n      multiforme or brain stem tumors."

Estimate the overall survival, progression-free interval, and time to\n      progression or recurrence in patients with nondisseminated glioblastoma multiforme or\n      diffuse intrinsic brain stem tumors that are nonprogressive following surgery (if feasible)\n      and involved-field irradiation and treated with intensive chemotherapy followed by\n      autologous peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) or autologous bone marrow (ABM) rescue. II.\n      Estimate the toxicity of myeloablative chemotherapy with thiotepa (TSPA) followed by\n      carboplatin (CBDCA) in these patients. III. Evaluate the pharmacokinetic interactions of\n      high-dose CBDCA, TSPA, and triethylenephosphoramide (a metabolite of TSPA) and any impact on\n      subsequent toxicity. IV. Evaluate the effectiveness of autologous stem cells in restoring\n      hematopoiesis following myeloablative therapy.\n\n      OUTLINE: All patients undergo bone marrow or stem cell harvest (investigator option) no\n      later than 12 weeks after completion of radiotherapy. The following acronyms are used: ABM\n      Autologous Bone Marrow CBDCA Carboplatin, NSC-241240 G-CSF Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating\n      Factor (Amgen), NSC-614629 PBSC Peripheral Blood Stem Cells TSPA Thiotepa, NSC-6396 2-Drug\n      Myeloablative Chemotherapy followed by Hematopoietic Rescue. TSPA; CBDCA; followed by ABM or\n      PBSC; G-CSF.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 60 patients will be entered over 3 years. If more than 5 patients on any\n      arm experience treatment-related mortality, accrual will be discontinued."
