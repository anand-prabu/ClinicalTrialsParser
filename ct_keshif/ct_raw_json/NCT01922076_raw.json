WEE1 inhibitor MK-1775 may stop the growth of\n      tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Radiation therapy uses\n      high energy x rays to kill tumor cells. Giving WEE1 inhibitor MK-1775 with local radiation\n      therapy may work better than local radiation therapy alone in treating diffuse intrinsic\n      pontine gliomas."

To define and describe the toxicities of MK-1775 given concurrently with radiation\n      therapy in children with newly diagnosed DIPG.\n\n      III. To characterize the pharmacokinetics of MK-1775 in children with newly diagnosed DIPG.\n\n      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I.
