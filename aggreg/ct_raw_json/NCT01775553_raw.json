Patients with\n      relapsed or relapsed/refractory myeloma and with progression of disease on standard dosing\n      (20/27 mg/m2) and schedule of carfilzomib will be initially treated at dose level 1,\n      carfilzomib 20/56 mg/m2. During Cycle 1, patients will receive either 20 mg/m2 on days 1,2\n      (if the subject has not received carfilzomib as part another clinical trial within the last\n      4 weeks) or 56 mg/m2 (if the subject is enrolling in the present study after progression of\n      disease on carfilzomib within the last month - for example subjects enrolled in CMAP\n      compassionate use carfilzomib).   Thereafter, all subjects will receive 56 mg/m2 for the\n      remaining doses given Cycle 1 Day 8 onwards. If a minimal response or better is achieved\n      (and therefore disease response is recaptured) a bone marrow biopsy will be repeated.\n\n      If 56 mg/m2 is not tolerated, the dose of carfilzomib will be reduced to dose level -1 i.e.\n      45 mg/m2. If a subject does not tolerate 45 mg/m2 then the dose would be further reduced to\n      dose level -2 i.e. 36 mg/m2. If the subject does not tolerate 36 mg/m2, then this subject\n      would have to come off study.\n\n      Dexamethasone 8 mg po/IV will be administered prior to all carfilzomib doses.\n\n      Once a patient develops disease progression on this study, the patient may return to\n      receiving the maximum tolerated dose of carfilzomib by that patient with the addition of a\n      therapeutic dosing of dexamethasone (a total of 20-40 mg weekly). An IMId  (e.g. thalidomide\n      or lenalidomide) and/or an alkylator can also be added to carfilzomib 27 or 36 mg/m2 per\n      investigator discretion either concurrent with the addition of dexamethasone or subsequent\n      to disease progression on carfilzomib with concurrent therapeutic dexamethasone."
