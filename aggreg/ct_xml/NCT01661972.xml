    <textblock>
      The Primary Phase I objectives are to determine the recommended phase II dose for the
      capecitabine and aflibercept doublet combination; and to describe any dose limiting and
      non-dose limiting toxicities. The Phase II Primary objective is to determine progression
      free survival associated with this regimen. The Phase II secondary objectives are to
      determine response rate associated with this regimen; to determine overall survival
      associated with this regimen; and to explore any correlation of clinical outcome with
      baseline and on treatment changes in blood-based angiogenesis biomarkers.

      This open-label, non-randomized phase I/II trial is designed to assess the safety,
      tolerability and RPTD of capecitabine plus aflibercept in adult subjects with metastatic
      colorectal cancer.

    <description>Phase 1 of this study will be the dose escalation component to determine safety and the RPTD for the capecitabine plus aflibercept combination. Dose escalation will begin with cohort 1 and continue as described in the protocol.  RPTD is determined by the dose limiting and non-dose limiting toxicities (Primary obj 2 for Phase I)</description>

    <description>The primary objective of Phase II is to describe any signs of clinical activity, including response rate and progression free survival in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.  For the purpose of sample size determination, a patient will be considered to have been successfully treated if the patient remained progression-free 2 months after the administration of the experimental treatment.</description>

    <description>A standard 3+3 dose escalation format will be used. Since each agent is well tolerated as monotherapy and in combination with other chemotherapy regimens, we will start at capecitabine 850mg/m2 to be given days 1-14 and off days 15-21. The dose will then be escalated to 1000mg/m2, given on the same schedule. The dose of aflibercept will be held constant at 6 mg/kg, given intravenously every 3 weeks. Both agents will be administered on a 21-day cycle. Once the RPTD of the doublet combination has been identified, an additional 50 subjects with metastatic colorectal cancer will be added to a single-arm, Phase II portion for expanded safety, response and biomarker data.</description>

             potential who are not using effective birth control methods. Two acceptable forms of
             contraceptives must be continued throughout the trial by either sex. Hormonal
             contraceptives are not acceptable as a sole method of contraception.  (Women of

             with the interpretation of study results, and in the judgment of the investigator
             would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study.
