            "textblock": "This research proposal concerns a study to monitor the effects of chemotherapy on breast\n      cancer tumour and peritumour stromal cells using ultrasound (US) elastography (also known as\n      strain imaging).\n\n      Many cancer treatments currently being developed are targeted; that is they exploit\n      particular biological processes in specific cancer cell types to disrupt tumour growth.\n      Being able to monitor the efficacy of these typically high-cost drug therapies is essential\n      both for the best patient outcome as well as offering economical benefits to the health care\n      system and much needed insight into future drug development.\n\n      Ultrasound provides a relatively inexpensive, non-invasive means for imaging cancers, and\n      has been used widely in breast cancer diagnosis for many years. Its role in therapy\n      monitoring has been suggested but has not been well explored. The purpose of this proposal\n      is to explore this potential in more depth.\n\n      It has been identified that significant interaction takes place between tumour and stroma\n      through all stages of tumour growth; this complex relationship is an ongoing topic of\n      research. Fibrotic changes occur during tumour growth and are also a quintessential process\n      of healing. Indeed, fibrosis is a common after effect to chemotherapy in many forms of\n      cancer. Elastography is an established imaging technique (based on ultrasound or MRI) which\n      can estimate the relative stiffness of tissues in vivo and is thus well-suited to monitor\n      these particular biological processes.\n\n      This elucidates the main hypothesis of this project: fibrosis, cancer cell necrosis and\n      inflammation may all contribute to a measurable response in elastography. These changes to\n      the tissue composition can be imaged over a course of a patient's treatment to assess the\n      response to chemo/hormonal therapy.\n\n      The ultimate project goals are to develop a clinical tool (based on ultrasound elastography)\n      to improve treatment management in addition to offering a better biological understanding of\n      tumour/stroma behaviour."
