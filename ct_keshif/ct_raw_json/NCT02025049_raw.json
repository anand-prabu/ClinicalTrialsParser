The secondary endpoints\n      are the safety of DP-b99 in this population of patients (through routine safety laboratory\n      tests, physical examination and vital signs monitoring, ECG and adverse event reporting),\n      DP-b99's effects on other plasma inflammatory markers (interleukin-6, matrix\n      metalloproteinase 9, tumor necrosis factor alpha) as well as its effects on the clinical\n      course of pancreatitis (based on changes in the Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome\n      (SIRS)  and Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation  II (APACHE II) scores, and on\n      contrast material-enhanced abdominal Computerised Tomography (CT), versus placebo.\n\n      Clinical trial material administration will begin within 48 hours of acute pancreatitis\n      symptoms onset. Subjects will be randomised at a ratio of 1:1 to receive either DP b99 or\n      placebo. The serum levels of DP-b99 at the end of each 2-hour infusion will also be\n      monitored.\n\n      The study duration per individual subject will be 14 days, consisting of a screening\n      evaluation followed by a 48-hour double blind treatment period, which will be part of an\n      in-hospital observation period of at least 6 days, and a follow-up final visit on Day 14."
