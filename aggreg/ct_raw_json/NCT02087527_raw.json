Using\n      corticosteroids during antibiotic treatment may reduce inflammation and length of stay.\n\n      Objective: to evaluate the efficacy of using corticosteroids as adjuvant treatment during\n      the first 48 hours of treatment after hospitalization in patients with cellulitis.\n\n      Patients and methods: this is a double blind, randomized, controlled trial that will take\n      place at pediatric hospital, during one year. It will include children aged 1 month to 18\n      years, admitted due to cellulitis. Once included in the clinical trial, the patients will be\n      randomized to receive dexamethasone 0,6 mg/kg/day or placebo (saline solution) during the\n      first 48 hours. Considering an average stay of 4 \u00b1 2 days, we calculated a sample size of\n      124 children (62 children per group) to detect a 25% difference (1 day reduction) in the\n      length of stay, with a power of 80% and a confidence of 95%."
