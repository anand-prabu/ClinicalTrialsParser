  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if sotatercept can help to control
      MPN-associated myelofibrosis and anemia.  The safety of this drug will also be studied.

      Study Groups:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to 1 of 2
      study groups, that will receive different doses of the study drug, based on when you join
      this study.

        -  Group 1 will receive sotatercept 1 time every 3 weeks (at a lower dose).

        -  Group 2 will receive will receive sotatercept 1 time every 3 weeks (at a higher dose).

      Study Drug Administration:

      Each cycle is 21 days.

      You will receive sotatercept at the clinic as an injection under the skin on Day 1 of every
      cycle.  The injections will be given in the upper arm, abdomen, or thigh.

      Study Visits:

      On Day 1 of every cycle:

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs
           (blood pressure, breathing rate, temperature, and heart rate).

        -  Your spleen and/or liver will be measured by feeling your abdomen.

        -  You will be asked about any drugs you are taking and about recent blood transfusions
           you may have had.

        -  You will also be asked about any new side effects or medical conditions you may have
           experienced.

        -  Your performance status will be recorded.

        -  Blood (about 4 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests

        -  Urine will be collected for kidney function tests.

      Weekly during Cycle 1-5 only:

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  You will have vital signs measured on Day 1 of Week 3 (around Day 15 of Cycle 1).

      On Day 1 of Cycle 6, and then every 6-12 cycles after that if the disease responds to
      treatment, a bone marrow biopsy will be performed to check the status of the disease.

      On Day 1 of Cycles 1-5, 7, 9, and 11, then every 6 cycles after that:

      -Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for antibody testing and pharmacokinetic (PK)
      testing.  Antibodies are created by the immune system and may attack foreign cells or
      substances, such as the study drug.  PK testing measures the amount of study drug in the
      body at different time points.

      Length of Study:

      You may continue taking the study drug for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best
      interest.  You will no longer be able to take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if
      intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

      Your participation on the study will be over after the follow-up visits.

      End-of-Treatment Visit:

      After your last dose of study drug, you will have an end-of-study visit and the following
      tests and procedures will be performed:

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs
           (blood pressure, heart rate, breathing rate, and temperature) and  your spleen and/or
           liver will be measured by feeling your abdomen.

        -  Your performance status will be recorded.

        -  Blood (about 4 teaspoons) will be collected for routine tests.

        -  You will be asked about any drugs you are taking and about recent blood transfusions
           you may have had.

        -  You will also be asked about any new side effects or medical conditions you may have
           experienced.

      Follow-up Visit:

      About 1 month after your last dose of study drug, you will receive a telephone call from
      someone on the study team.  You will be asked about any drugs you are taking, any recent
      blood transfusions you may have had, any new side effects or medical conditions you may have
      experienced.  This phone call should last about 10 minutes.

      This is an investigational study.  Sotatercept is not FDA approved or commercially
      available.  It is currently being used for research purposes only.

      Up to 50 patients will take part in this study.  All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.
