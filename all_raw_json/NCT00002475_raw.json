Vaccines made from a patient's tumor tissue may make\n      the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells. Chemotherapy combined with vaccine\n      therapy may kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining cyclophosphamide with tumor\n      cell vaccine in treating patients who have metastatic cancer or cancer at high risk of\n      recurrence."

Patients are stratified by tumor type.\n\n      Tumor tissue is removed from the patient and incubated with interferon alfa or interferon\n      gamma for 72-96 hours. (If autologous tumor cells are not available, an allogeneic vaccine\n      is prepared.) Harvested activated cells are irradiated immediately prior to use.\n\n      Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV. 48-72 hours after cyclophosphamide administration,\n      patients receive tumor cell vaccine intradermally. Patients also receive sargramostim\n      (GM-CSF) subcutaneously prior to vaccine administration and once daily for the next 8 days.\n      Treatment repeats every 2 weeks for 3 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.\n      Patients with responding or stable disease after completion of course 3 may receive\n      additional courses.\n\n      Patients are followed for survival.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study within 18-24\n      months."
