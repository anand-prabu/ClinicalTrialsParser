Image-guided adaptive radiation therapy aims\n      radiation therapy right at the tumor so that higher radiation doses can be given without\n      causing bad side effects. Giving these higher doses may help control the tumor better.\n      Breathing causes organs and tissues, including the tumor, to move within the chest. Active\n      breathing control may reduce the volume that needs to be treated. Drugs used in\n      chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel and carboplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth\n      of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving\n      image-guided adaptive radiation therapy using active breathing control with chemotherapy and\n      simultaneous integrated boost may be an effective treatment for non-small cell lung cancer."
