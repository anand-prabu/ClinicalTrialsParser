This can cause problems performing even the simplest of everyday tasks\n      such as eating, grasping, writing, and many others.  The purpose of this research study is\n      to examine how the central nervous system contributes to the control of hand movements after\n      cervical SCI and promote the recovery of hand movements by using non-invasive brain\n      stimulation and motor training. Results from this study could provide information that can\n      be used to develop the best possible rehabilitation for individuals with SCI to help improve\n      hand and arm function."

This study will examine physiological\n      changes in pathways controlling hand motor function after cervical SCI and novel methods to\n      enhance the recovery of hand motor function by combining non-invasive repetitive brain\n      stimulation with motor training. The repetitive brain stimulation will occur using a wire\n      coil placed over the participants head. When activated, this coil will generate a magnetic\n      pulse over a specified area of the head. During training, we will monitor muscle activity\n      through the use of surface electrodes. Subjects will perform precision grip and wrist\n      movements. Impairment in hand function is a major problem after stroke, amyotrophic lateral\n      sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, and other motor disorders, therefore, our work may also be\n      relevant for individuals with other lesions of the nervous system."
