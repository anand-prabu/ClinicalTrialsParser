        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients must have a diagnosis of transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) of the urinary
             bladder confirmed at the study institution. The patient must have demonstrated
             nonmuscle-invasive recurrent bladder cancer refractory or recurrent to standard
             intravesical therapy. Patients must exhibit disease recurrence after receiving
             adequate intravesical BCG (at least 6 weeks induction plus 3 additional doses of
             either induction or maintenance). Patients with a history of other intravesical
             agents in addition to standard BCG will also be allowed to enroll. All grossly
             visible disease must be fully resected and pathologic stage will be confirmed at the
             institution where the patient is enrolled. This will include stage Ta, T1, Tis and
             exclude all patients with muscle invasion (T2).

               1. For phase 1, patients with multifocal low-grade Ta histology will be eligible
                  for participation

               2. For phase 2, individuals with Ta disease only must have documentation of
                  high-grade histology

          2. Age &gt;18 and must be able to read, understand, and sign informed consent

          3. Performance Status: ECOG 0, 1, and 2 (See Appendix III)

          4. Hematologic inclusion within 2 weeks of start of treatment

               1. Absolute neutrophil count &gt;1,500/mm3

               2. Hemoglobin &gt;9.0 g/dl

               3. Platelet count &gt;100,000/mm3

          5. Hepatic inclusion within 2 weeks of entry

               1. Total bilirubin must be within normal limits.

               2. Adequate renal function with serum creatinine ≤2.5 mg/dL

               3. Aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) ≤2.5 x ULN for the
                  institution, alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2.5 x ULN for the institution, unless bone
                  metastasis is present in the absence of liver metastasis

          6. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test.

          7. All patients of childbearing potential must be willing to consent to using effective
             contraception, ie, intrauterine device, birth control pills, depo-provera, and
             condoms while on treatment and for 3 months after their participation in the study
             ends.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any other malignancy diagnosed within 1 year of study entry (except basal or squamous
             cell skin cancers or noninvasive cancer of the cervix) is excluded

          2. Concurrent treatment with any chemotherapeutic agent

          3. Women who are pregnant or lactating

          4. History of vesicoureteral reflux or an indwelling urinary stent

          5. Participation in any other research protocol involving administration of an
             investigational agent within 1 month prior to study entry

          6. History of radiation to the pelvis

          7. History of interstitial lung disease and/or pneumonitis

          8. Evidence of metastatic disease
