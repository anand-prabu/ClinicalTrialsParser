Once a patient makes a decision, he and his partner will complete another set of questionnaires. We will examine the associations between baseline assessments and the treatment decision as well as the changes in the assessments and the treatment decision. Data from patients and partners/close allies will generally be analyzed separately, thus patients who do not have a partner (or partner declines to participate) can still be enrolled and their psychosocial outcomes assessed.\nWe will also schedule interviews with approximately 36 patients and their partners/close allies to obtain the themes and subthemes of their decision-making. Those invited for interviews may or may not be from the same day."
