Identifying mechanisms for uncontrolled lower\n      respiratory symptoms (LRS) is imperative to guide therapy with the important potential to\n      reduce secondary adverse health outcomes.\n\n      To test this hypothesis, we will conduct a clinical study with aggressive treatment  for\n      lower respiratory symptoms in patients in the World Trade Center Environmental Health\n      Center.  Patients in the WTC EHC with uncontrolled LRS will be identified and placed on\n      high-dose inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting beta agonists for three months.  Adherence\n      will be assessed at monthly visits. Patients will perform spirometry and oscillometry at\n      baseline and after 3 months of treatment. They will also be assessed for markers of airway\n      inflammation, bronchial hyperresponsiveness and co-morbid conditions including\n      depression,anxiety,post-traumatic stress disorder, gastroesophageal reflux, paradoxical\n      vocal cord motion and rhinosinusitis."

            "textblock": "Exposure to the dust and fumes of the World Trade Center (WTC) disaster resulted in adverse\n      health including upper and lower respiratory symptoms in responders and community members.\n      The WTC Environmental Health Center (WTC EHC), initiated in 2005, was the first and remains\n      the only treatment program that targets community members, now called \"Survivors,\" including\n      local residents, local workers and clean-up workers with WTC dust and fume exposures.  Lower\n      respiratory symptoms are prevalent in patients in the WTC EHC. Most patients with these\n      symptoms in the \"Responder\" and \"Survivor\" programs are diagnosed with asthma and this\n      diagnosis has guided therapy. Although spirometry is often normal, diagnosis has been\n      supported by studies showing bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) in some, and distal or\n      small airways disease measured with impulse oscillometry (IOS). As a result, the WTC EHC\n      program has used a treatment algorithm based on guidelines for asthma from the National\n      Institutes of Health. These guidelines focus on the use of \"controller\" therapy, which\n      includes inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and long acting bronchodilators (LABA) for persistent\n      symptoms. Despite this approach, eleven years after the destruction of the WTC towers, many\n      patients in the WTC EHC report incomplete clinical response with continued lower respiratory\n      symptoms. In fact, patients with continued uncontrolled lower respiratory symptoms (LRS)\n      remain on treatment with long-term high dose ICS often with additional LABA use, rendering\n      them at risk for adverse health effects of long term ICS treatment. The persistence of\n      symptoms, despite therapeutic interventions, necessitates a reevaluation and a search for\n      causes of persistent symptoms. Possibilities include incomplete adherence with medical\n      regimens, continuing airways disease (BHR or small airways disease) with persistent lung\n      inflammation, or the presence of co-morbid conditions.\n\n      ."
