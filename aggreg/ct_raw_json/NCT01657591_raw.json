Everyone in this study will be given vemurafenib at the standard dose (the amount of the drug that is given as standard treatment) of 960 milligrams (mg) twice per day, unless the first people in the study have severe side effects when taking the lowest dose of XL888 along with vemurafenib. If that happens, the next people in the study may be given a lower dose of vemurafenib (720 mg twice per day) along with the lowest dose of XL888."
