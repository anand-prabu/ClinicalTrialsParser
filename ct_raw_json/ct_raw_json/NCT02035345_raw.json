            "textblock": "For women with recurrent ovarian cancer, re-treatment with carboplatin is frequently\n      recommended.  However, carboplatin re-treatment can result in an allergic or allergic-like\n      reaction called a hypersensitivity reaction.  Symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction can\n      include, but are not limited to itching, rash, swelling of the lips, tongue, or throat,\n      chest pain, chest tightness, shortness of breath, wheezing, abdominal pain, nausea,\n      vomiting, diarrhea, palpitations, dizziness, confusion, and low pressure.  Hypersensitivity\n      reactions occur in 20-40% of women with recurrent ovarian cancer who are re-treated with\n      carboplatin.  At least half of the hypersensitivity reactions are described as moderately\n      severe with symptoms of generalized rash, wheezing, facial swelling, difficulty\n      breathing/shortness of breath, and hypotension (low blood pressure).\n\n      Patients who suffer from a hypersensitivity reaction while receiving carboplatin and require\n      additional therapy may receive future carboplatin infusions utilizing a \"desensitization\"\n      technique. A desensitization is when carboplatin is administered in slowly increasing\n      amounts as an inpatient under the direction of the department of Allergy Immunology at\n      Massachusetts General Hospital.  A desensitization allows patient to safely receive\n      carboplatin, but requires an inpatient hospitalization, which may be of significant\n      inconvenience to some patients.\n\n      As part of this study, the participant will continue to receive carboplatin as part of their\n      standard therapy.  The change would be instead of carboplatin being administered over a 30\n      minute period, the carboplatin be administered intravenously according to the following\n      schedule:\n\n        -  First hour - Administer 1 percent of total dose\n\n        -  Second hour - Administer 9 percent\n\n        -  Third hour - Administer 90 percent\n\n      Standard pre-medications will be administered immediately prior to the carboplatin infusion\n      which will include of 20 mg of dexamethasone, 50mg of diphenhydramine, and famotidine 20 mg.\n\n      The participant's medical record will also be reviewed to evaluate whether age, cancer\n      stage/grade, number of previous carboplatin cycles, accompanying agents, and/or medical\n      conditions have an effect on hypersensitivity reactions.  The participant will also be asked\n      to fill out a short optional form regarding race and ethnicity to evaluate whether or not\n      these factors contribute to hypersensitivity reactions.\n\n      If the participant experiences a hypersensitivity reaction, the study protocol will be\n      discontinued.  A standard blood draw for a tryptase (a blood test for an allergic reaction)\n      will be obtained at the time of the reaction along with other discretionary laboratories\n      recommended by your oncologist.  The participant will then be referred to the Allergy\n      Immunology Department if carboplatin is determined to be necessary for future treatment."
