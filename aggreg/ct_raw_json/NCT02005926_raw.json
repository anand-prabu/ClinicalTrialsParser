If abnormal axillary lymph node was found, ultrasound-guided FNA cytology of these nodes were performed. The abnormal nodes were defined as completely hypoechoic node, asymmetric focal hypoechoic node, cortical lobulation and cortical thickness >3mm. Patients with negative results of FNA would undergo SLNB. Technetium-99m-labeled Rituximab was used for lymphatic mapping. Before the SLNB operation, a hookwire was placed at the suspicious axillary lymph node by ultrasound guidance. In the SLNB operation, radioactive nodes and wire-localized nodes were removed and labeled separately for pathological examination."
