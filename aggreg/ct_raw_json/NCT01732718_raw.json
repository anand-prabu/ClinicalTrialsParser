The investigators propose that atorvastatin will\n      improve endothelial dysfunction, decrease levels of sFLT-1, and decrease albuminuria in SCD\n      patients.\n\n      Participants will be individuals with sickle cell disease, age 18 to 60, who have some\n      degree of albuminuria. A total of 19 subjects, males and females, will be enrolled. The\n      study is made up of Screening, Treatment, and Follow Up phases and has a cross-over design.\n      After patients are screened for eligibility, they will be randomized to receive atorvastatin\n      or placebo in the initial six-week treatment period. When that is complete, there will be a\n      four-week washout period before they begin another six-week treatment period. In the second\n      treatment period, they \"cross-over\" to the other treatment arm. Four weeks after the end of\n      the second treatment period, follow-up safety assessments will be done."

            "textblock": "It is well recognized that sickle cell disease (SCD) is characterized by a vasculopathy,\n      with involvement of multiple organs including the brain, lung, spleen, and kidney. This\n      results in multiple clinical complications, including ischemic stroke, pulmonary\n      hypertension, autosplenectomy, as well as albuminuria and chronic renal disease. Several\n      recent studies have confirmed the association of both albuminuria and renal dysfunction with\n      echocardiographically-defined pulmonary hypertension and other vasculopathic complications\n      in SCD, suggesting that they may share a similar pathophysiology. Despite the high\n      prevalence of albuminuria in patients with SCD and the known association of renal failure\n      with increased mortality, the pathophysiology and treatment of albuminuria in this setting\n      remain poorly defined.\n\n      The treatment options for nephropathy in SCD are limited. Although ACE inhibitors are the\n      \"standard of care\" in the treatment of patients with proteinuria, there are to date no\n      controlled, long-term studies confirming their efficacy and safety in this setting.\n\n      In this study, the investigators will evaluate the efficacy and safety of atorvastatin in\n      SCD patients. At the completion of this trial, the investigators will have an improved\n      understanding of the contribution of endothelial dysfunction to the pathophysiology of\n      albuminuria in SCD. If the data support the hypothesis that atorvastatin is safe and\n      effective in this population, the investigators plan on carrying out adequately powered\n      studies to more definitively evaluate its safety and efficacy in the treatment and/or\n      prevention of albuminuria in SCD."
