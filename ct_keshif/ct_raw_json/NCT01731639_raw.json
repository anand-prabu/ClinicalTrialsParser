However, the standard morphology evaluation on random stained cells from the\n      ejaculate is of limited value during ICSI. Current research is directed towards the\n      dysmorphisms of the sperm head.A new technique based on the motile sperm organelle\n      morphology examination (MSOME) at a magnification of at least \u00d76000 has been developed. The\n      MSOME assesses the nucleus, for both shape and chromatin content, which is the most\n      important sperm organelle in influencing ICSI outcomes. The goals for this study are to\n      identify whether there is a connection between morphologic sperm normalcy under high\n      magnification and (i) semen analysis according to the new World Health Organization (WHO)\n      reference values and (ii) ICSI outcomes."
