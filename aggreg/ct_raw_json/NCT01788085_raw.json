Confirmation of capsule attachment may be done endoscopically.\n\n      These procedures will serve to evaluate overall system performance in actual clinical setup,\n      for instance: ergonomics and performance of delivery device, capsule transmission etc.\n\n      Physician may be asked to provide feedback on the procedure and/or document their activities\n      during the procedure."
