To our knowledge\n      no prospective, randomized study has compared modified St Thomas based Blood and Crystalloid\n      cardioplegia on the acknowledged markers (CK-MB, troponin-T) of myocardial damage during\n      aortic valve replacement on patients without additional significant coronary artery disease.\n\n      Methods:  100 patients with aorta stenoses undergoing aortic valve replacement without\n      significant coronary artery stenoses or other significant concomitant heart valve disease\n      were included in the study.  They were given antegrade cold blood or cold crystalloid\n      cardioplegia delivered through the coronary Ostia every 20 min throughout the period of\n      aortic cross-clamp. CK-MB and troponin-T were compared between the two groups.\n\n      Published 2010 in the journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery."
