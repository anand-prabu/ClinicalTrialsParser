            "textblock": "This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled study to evaluate the\n      effectiveness of two dose levels of topiramate (200 and 400 milligrams/day) compared with\n      lithium and placebo in the treatment of acute manic or mixed episodes in patients with\n      Biplar I Disorder. The trial consists of 3 phases: a screening period; double-blind\n      treatment for 12 weeks; and an optional open-label period of at least 6 months.  Efficacy\n      assessments include the change from baseline to Day 21 for the total Young Mania Rating\n      Scale (YMRS) score.   Also included as efficacy assessments during the 12 week study are the\n      Global Assessment Scale (GAS), Montgomery-\u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), Brief\n      Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), Clinical Global Impressions (CGI), and health-related\n      quality of life measures at specified time intervals.  Safety assessments include evaluation\n      of adverse events throughout the study, rate of withdrawal from the study due to adverse\n      events, and vital signs (blood pressure and pulse) througout the study, as well as changes\n      in clinical laboratory tests (hematology, chemistry, urinalysis), electrocardiograms (ECGs),\n      and physical examinations at specified times.  The study hypothesis is that  the change from\n      baseline in Young Mania Rating Scale (YMSR) total score at Day 21 will be significantly\n      better for the topiramate groups than for the placebo group and that the study drug will be\n      well tolerated by the patients. Topiramate: oral tablets (50 milligrams[mg]); increasing\n      from once daily (50mg) to 3-times daily; target total daily dose 200mg or 400mg, maintained\n      through Week 12. Lithium: oral capsules (300mg); increasing from once daily (300mg) to\n      three-times daily; target total daily dose 1500-1800 mg."
