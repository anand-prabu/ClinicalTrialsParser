            "textblock": "This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), single-sequence,\n      randomized (dose of JNJ-38518168 (3 mg or 30 mg) is assigned by chance), single-center,\n      multiple-dose study designed to assess the potential effects of multiple oral administration\n      of ketoconazole (KTZ) on the steady-state (a situation where the overall intake of a drug is\n      in equilibrium with its elimination) pharmacokinetics of JNJ-38518168. Pharmacokinetics (PK)\n      explores how the drug is absorbed in the body, distributed within the body, and how it is\n      removed from the body over time. The study consists of 3 phases: a Screening Phase of\n      approximately 3 weeks (Days -22 to -2); an Open-Label Phase (Days -1 to 26); and a Follow-up\n      Phase occurring from 7 to 10 days after the last dose of study drug. Participants will be\n      randomly assigned to receive either a daily dose of 3 mg JNJ-38518168 (Group 1) or a daily\n      dose of 30 mg JNJ-38518168 (Group 2) orally administered for 25 days. All participants will\n      receive multiple oral doses of KTZ (200 mg every 12 hours for both Groups 1 and 2) from Day\n      22 through Day 25.  An optional group of participants receiving 10 mg once daily of\n      JNJ-38518168 (Group 3) may be evaluated if the data from Groups 1 and 2 do not allow the\n      sponsor to estimate sufficiently the interaction between KTZ and daily dose of 10 mg\n      JNJ-38518168. The participants will receive an oral dose of the study drugs in the morning\n      of specified days, after an overnight fast for at least 10 hours. Blood samples will be\n      collected at various times throughout the study for evaluation of drug concentrations in\n      plasma. Safety will be assessed by reporting of adverse events, vital signs, physical\n      examination results, weight, and electrocardiogram (ECG) evaluations. Participants will\n      leave the study center on Day 26 after the collection of the last scheduled PK blood sample.\n      For each participant, a follow-up visit will occur 7 to 10 days after the last dose of study\n      drug. For each participant, the total duration of the study is approximately 8 weeks."
