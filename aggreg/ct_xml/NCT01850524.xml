    <textblock>
      This is a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, multicenter study to evaluate the safety and
      efficacy of MLN9708 versus placebo when added to lenalidomide and dexamethasone (LenDex) in
      patients with Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma (NDMM) who are not eligible for stem cell
      transplant.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female patients 18 years or older diagnosed with Multiple Myeloma according
             to standard criteria who have not received prior treatment

          -  Patients for whom lenalidomide and dexamethasone treatment is appropriate and who are
             not eligible for high-dose therapy followed by stem-cell transplantation (HDT-SCT)
             for 1 or more of the following reasons:

               1. the patient is 65 years of age or older

               2. the patient is less than 65 years of age but has significant comorbid
                  condition(s) that are, in the opinion of the investigator, likely     to have a
                  negative impact on tolerability of HDT-SCT

          -  Measurable disease as specified in study protocol

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)performance status of 0 to 2

          -  Meet the clinical laboratories criteria as specified in the protocol

             lenalidomide pregnancy prevention program

          -  Male patients who agree to practice effective barrier contraception or agree to
             practice true abstinence AND must adhere to the guidelines of the lenalidomide
             pregnancy prevention program

          -  Suitable venous access for the study-required blood sampling

          -  Must be able to take concurrent aspirin 70mg to 325 mg daily (or enoxiparin if

             investigational regimen

          -  Diagnosed and treated for another malignancy within 5 years before randomization or
             previously diagnosed with another malignancy and have any evidence of residual
             disease. Patients with nonmelanoma skin cancer or carcinoma in situ of any type are
             not excluded if they have undergone complete resection

          -  Inability or unwillingness to receive antithrombotic therapy

          -  Female patients who are lactating or pregnant

          -  Major surgery or radiotherapy within 14 days before randomization

             positive

          -  Comorbid systemic illnesses or other severe concurrent disease which, in the judgment
             of the investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study
             or interfere significantly with the proper assessment of safety and toxicity of the
             prescribed regimens (eg, peripheral neuropathy that is Grade 1 with pain or Grade 2
             or higher of any cause)

          -  Serious medical or psychiatric illness that could, in the investigator's opinion,

          -  Treatment with any investigational products within 60 days before the first dose of
             the study drug regimen
