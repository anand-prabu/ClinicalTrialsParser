Vaccines consisting of heat shock protein-peptide complexes made from a\n      person's own tumor tissue may help the body build an effective immune response to kill tumor\n      cells that may remain after surgery. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block\n      tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.\n      Others find tumor cells and help kill them. It is not yet known whether giving vaccine\n      therapy is more effective with or without bevacizumab in treating glioblastoma multiforme."

            "textblock": "The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of a vaccine with bevacizumab versus\n      bevacizumab alone on a patient's brain tumor. The vaccine is called heat shock protein\n      peptide complex 96 (HSPPC-96). HSPPC-96 is experimental.   Specifically, HSPPC-96 is a\n      protein that may work to help the body have a response against remaining brain tumor cells.\n       Bevacizumab has been approved by the Food and Drug administration for treating brain tumors\n      that grow back.  In this study, patients will either get HSPPC-96 vaccine at the same time\n      as bevacizumab, HSPPC vaccine first and then bevacizumab if the tumor comes back, or\n      bevacizumab alone. The use of HSPPC-96 and bevacizumab is investigational.\n\n      The primary objective of the study is to determine whether there is an overall survival\n      advantage of HSPPC-96 administered with bevacizumab, given concomitantly or at the point of\n      progression, in comparison with bevacizumab alone in patients with surgically resectable\n      recurrent glioblastoma multiforme.\n\n      The secondary objectives are:\n\n        1. to evaluate the safety and tolerability of HSPPC-96 with bevacizumab\n\n        2. to evaluate the progression free survival of HSPPC-96 with bevacizumab, given\n           concomitantly or at the point of progression.\n\n      Patients must undergo surgery within 28 days from pre-registration. Upon confirmation of\n      adequacy of tissue for vaccine manufacture and \u2265 90% resection by central radiology review,\n      patients will be randomized to one of three treatment arms. Please see the \"Arms\" section\n      for more details.\n\n      Patients will be monitored approximately 6.5 years post surgery."
