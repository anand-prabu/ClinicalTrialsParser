In a stage 3 trial, its' efficacy has been compared to that of itopride in\n      functional dyspepsia patients and proved to have comparable safety and efficacy. However,\n      its' exact effect on the gastrointestinal motility has not been completely elucidated. This\n      study will study the effects of DA-9701 on the healthy adult gastrointestinal tract."
