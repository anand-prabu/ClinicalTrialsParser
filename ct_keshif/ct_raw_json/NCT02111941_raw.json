Measure time to disease recurrence of patients treated with FRalphaDCs. II. Measure\n      overall survival of patients treated with FRalphaDCs.\n\n      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. Determine whether FRalphaDC vaccination induces an increase in the number of\n      FRalpha-specific interleukin (IL)-17-secreting T helper (Th) cells, as determined by\n      enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISpot).\n\n      II. Determine whether FRalphaDC vaccination induces an increase in the number of\n      FRalpha-specific T cells that secrete interferon (IFN)gamma, tumor necrosis factor\n      (TNF)alpha, IL-10, and granzyme B, as determined by ELISpot.\n\n      III. Determine whether FRalphaDC vaccination induces antibodies specific for FRalpha.\n\n      IV. Determine whether FRalphaDC vaccination induces a delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH)\n      skin reaction specific for FRalpha.\n\n      V. Measure FRalpha expression in patients' primary tumors and in tumors that recur after\n      FRalphaDC vaccine treatment (when available).\n\n      VI. Determine whether FRalphaDC vaccination is associated with changes in peripheral blood\n      immune cell subsets.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.\n\n      INDUCTION PHASE: Patients receive folate receptor alpha peptide-loaded dendritic cell\n      vaccine intradermally (ID) on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 5 courses in the\n      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      MAINTENANCE PHASE: Patients receive folate receptor alpha peptide-loaded dendritic cell\n      vaccine ID on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 months for 7 courses in the absence of\n      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3-6 months for up to 5\n      years."
