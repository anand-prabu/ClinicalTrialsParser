  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this proposed research study, the investigators plan to assess the efficacy of gametes'
      (egg and sperm) treatment on fertilization as well as pre- and post-implantation embryo
      development.

      The spermatozoa will be prepared in the standard fashion and utilized for injection after
      exposure to a membrane permeabilizing agent. The injected oocytes will be then exposed to
      the previously mentioned activating agents for the purpose of inducing embryo development.
      The successfully fertilized oocytes will be further kept in culture for up to 5 days as per
      standard IVF/ICSI. Results in terms of fertilization and embryo cleavage will be assessed
      and monitored for the remainder of the culture period. Developing embryos selected according
      to standard criteria will be replaced to the patient or will be cryopreserved.

      Because fertilization failure carries such a high emotional and financial toll on our
      patients, at the present time, the only method to generate an embryo for these cases is to
      perform assisted oocyte activation in conjunction with ICSI. The research intervention -
      assisted oocyte activation - is believed to help alleviate the failed fertilization by
      obtaining some zygotes for the patient. In these cases of complete failed fertilization,
      intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) will be performed as a routine clinical treatment
      even if they are not enrolled in the study. After several failures, their reproductive
      physician may recommend the use of donor spermatozoa instead of the male partner's.
