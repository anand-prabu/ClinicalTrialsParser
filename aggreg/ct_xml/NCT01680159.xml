      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of TA-650
      at increased dose of 10 mg/kg every 8 weeks in patients with psoriasis in whom  effect of
      the treatment was confirmed after the treatment with Remicade® at 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks but
      decreased thereafter.

      -  Patients with plaque psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis:

             1. Screening Period:

                TA-650 at 5 mg per kg body weight is administered on the day of TA-650
                administration at the start (week 0) and week 8 (if efficacy is not judged as
                decreased or maintained at week 8 of the screening period) , respectively, by
                intravenous infusion slowly over at least 2 hours.

             2. Increased Dose Period:

                If efficacy is judged as decreased in the screening period, TA-650 at 10 mg per kg
                body weight is administered on the day of TA-650 administration at the start (week
                0) and at every 8 weeks up to week 32 in the increased dose period , respectively,
                as one dose by intravenous infusion slowly over at least 2 hours.

        -  Patients with pustular psoriasis or psoriatic erythroderma:

      TA-650 at 10 mg per kg body weight is administered on the day of TA-650 administration at
      the start (week 0) and at every 8 weeks up to week 32, respectively, as one dose by
      intravenous infusion slowly over at least 2 hours.
