Research studies suggest that symptoms in\n      individuals with allergies may be aggravated by exposure to particulate air pollution.  We\n      sought to experimental determine this by exposing human volunteers to combustion particles,\n      a component of air pollution, and then challenge them with an allergen such as ragweed or\n      oak tree pollen. Using biological tests we can measure whether the allergen response is\n      magnified by prior particulate exposure."

The nasal cavity is both an excellent model of allergic inflammation and provides\n      an easily accessible site for study. We measured inflammatory cells and cytokines in the\n      nasal lavage fluid. Our specific hypothesis was that particulate exposure prior to allergen\n      challenge would enhance inflammatory cell recruitment and expression of inflammatory\n      cytokines."
