Expression of CD19 on\n      B-cells at various development stages makes it an ideal target to treat B-cell associated\n      malignancies, like Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and Acute lymphoblastic leukemia.The rationale for\n      the use of AFM11 is based on its ability to bind to both malignant cells via its anti-CD19\n      domain and to T-cells via its anti-CD3 domains. This results in the formation of the\n      \"immunological synapse\" and the subsequent T-cell activation on leading to killing of\n      malignant cells."
