  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a observational study in which healthy found volunteers are recruited to donate 50
      ml of bone marrow aspirate to enable preclinical studies to obtain proof of concept and
      safety of a bone marrow derived stem cell preparation named AMARCELL. The prepared AMARCELL
      is only for animal studies and after completion of the preclinical program, the intention of
      AMARCELL is to treat humans with a traumatic Spinal cord injury.
