Patients with peritoneal seeding, unresectable extrahepatic metastases,\n      or unresectable pathologically-involved lymph nodes outside area of portahepatis do not\n      receive treatment. Remaining patients receive isolated hepatic perfusion with melphalan.\n      Liver perfusion proceeds for 1 hour.\n\n      Patients are followed at 6 weeks, every 3 months for 2 years, and then every 4 months until\n      disease progression.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 67 patients will be accrued for this study."
