Historical research showed that among the ER-positive and HER2-negative breast\n      cancer,Luminal B breast cancer with Ki67>14% is more likely to be benefited from\n      chemotherapy,compared with the Luminal A breast cancer with Ki67<14%. And the results of our\n      previous research showed that, the neoadjuvant XT protocol has more than 17% pCR rate in\n      Luminal B subtype breast cancer.However,to those who didn't reach pCR,we've got no evidence\n      whether switching to Anthracycline-based  post operative protocol can benefit them.So\n      that,we sketch out a randomized controlled multicentric phase III clinical trail.HER2\n      negative Luminal B subtype breast cancer patients are included. After 4 cycles of XT\n      protocol neoadjuvant chemotherapy ,those who reach PR but not  pCR are randomly divided into\n      the group treated with XT protocol and the group with XEC protocol ,then compare the DFS and\n      OS of two subgroup."
