Called Telehome Care\n      (THC), in the form of equipment in the home, may provide an innovative and potentially\n      cost-effective solution to enhancing chronic disease management services using technology\n      and may influence the reduction in emergency department (ED) visits and hospitalizations in\n      rural areas. However, telehealth research is still in its infancy, it is not well\n      understood, and is often done without an overarching scientific framework. The provision of\n      in home health monitoring and health education also may be a potential population based\n      health research tool for chronically ill patients. Demonstration of the possible benefits,\n      patient acceptance and satisfaction with THC requires a scientific approach as is used in\n      this study."

            "textblock": "While the nation's overall health status has improved over the past decade, disparities\n      persist among racial/ethnic minorities, low-income whites, the medically under-served, and\n      rural residents. The disparities in disease morbidity and mortality are a compelling crisis\n      and the elimination of such disparities is a national priority. With an aging population,\n      the changing demographics are increasing the disease burden attributable to chronic\n      diseases.\n\n      The broad goal of this project is to evaluate the potential value of using THC technology in\n      chronically ill patients in rural Maryland, within the broad context of social determinants\n      of health. This builds upon a completed pilot research study in Garrett County on a small\n      scale THC program in rural Garrett County Maryland funded by the Maryland Cigarette\n      Restitution Fund (CRF) supported Other Tobacco Related Diseases (OTRD grant) (CBaquet PI) in\n      collaboration with the division of cardiology and department of family medicine. This\n      research study will look at whether the THC equipment in the home for 60 days will make a\n      difference in the health of the patients who get the unit in their home compared to the\n      patients who will not receive the unit for 60 days. And we will look at whether this\n      technology will support patient monitoring in the home. The use of the technology will be\n      evaluated to determine whether patient monitoring using THC equipment will influence the\n      hospitalization rates or emergency department visits for the patients. Evaluation of the\n      influence of the THC equipment on medical resource utilization in rural and medically\n      underserved communities will be studied.\n\n      Telehome care (THC) may provide augmentation to current face to face monitoring through home\n      visits (usual method for Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services (CMS) billable home\n      health services) of chronically ill patients and may provide an innovative and potentially\n      cost-effective solution to improving patients' outcomes and health care resource utilization\n      in rural areas. THC can support the coordination of care by assessing and monitoring\n      patients in their homes and giving health care providers appropriate feedback to assure\n      patient compliance with discharge instructions such as medication, home care and other\n      aspects of recommended treatment regimens. Further, THC may improve service coordination at\n      discharge and provide ongoing monitoring/engagement of patients, which is considered\n      essential to prevent re-hospitalizations and emergency department visits. Demonstration of\n      the potential benefits on care pathways, and patient and provider acceptance and\n      satisfaction with the technology requires systematic larger scale and scientifically\n      rigorous studies.\n\n      Purpose The project's broad goals are to evaluate the effects of telehome care (THC), a form\n      of remote patient home monitoring,(within the broad context of social determinants of\n      health) for chronic disease management among rural residing minority, low-income white, and\n      medically underserved patients by: (a) providing an innovative telehome care (THC) capacity\n      and infrastructure in two Maryland rural and medically underserved communities; and (b)\n      using the THC infrastructure to generate scientifically rigorous and high quality evidence\n      on whether the THC technology improves patient monitoring, influences clinical outcomes, and\n      has an impact on medical resource utilization. [NOTE: THC uses telecommunication\n      technologies to enable home health agency clinical staff at a rural home health agency to\n      monitor their patients in the home.]\n\n      The major aim for this study are: 1) To evaluate the impact of the 60-day in home THC\n      monitoring on medical resource utilization (emergency department visits; re-hospitalization\n      rates) and Quality of Life related to the management of Metabolic Syndrome/Diabetes Mellitus\n      (DM), Chronic Heart Failure (CHF), Hypertension (HTN), and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary\n      Disease (COPD) compared to those patients that receive only an educational pamphlet.\n      Secondary aim hopes to support patient education to enhance acceptability, patient\n      independence and satisfaction.\n\n      In this study, remote in-home patient monitoring using a THC system from VitelNet\n      (telehealth equipment vendor) will provide patient monitoring remotely or non billable\n      services for the experimental study arm for this project in addition to routine billable\n      home health services. This project does not substitute billable in-home monitoring of\n      patients which is a prerequisite for enrollment into this study(conventional home health\n      services) but provides remote monitoring for the study arm in addition to\n      conventional/billable services delivered.\n\n      Patients are randomized to either THC use for 60 days with 60, 90 day follow up or \"usual\n      care\" with 60, 90 day follow up.\n\n      In addition, new knowledge will be generated by this study on methods for conduct of health\n      disparities research and training of non-research clinical personnel who are community based\n      in data collection and research ethics."
