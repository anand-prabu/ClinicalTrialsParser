  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is one of the main causes of the metabolic syndrome, a condition which is becoming
      more common in Canada and worldwide.  Metabolic syndrome is a name for a group of heart
      disease risk factors that occur together: obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, and high
      cholesterol.  These patients have a high risk of developing narrowing and blockages of blood
      vessels which occur when fat and cholesterol build up in the walls of blood vessels and form
      plaque.  This is called atherosclerosis.  Plaque buildup leads to stroke, heart attacks, and
      death.  We do not understand the underlying mechanisms of the metabolic syndrome and we do
      not have a treatment for it.  L-carnitine, a dietary supplement, has been shown to treat
      some components of the metabolic syndrome, but its benefit to reduce plaque in the blood
      vessels has never been studied.  Recently there has been some controversy because a new
      study showed that L-carnitine could make heart disease worse in some patients.  Our goal is
      to study whether supplementation with L-carnitine does in fact prevent or reduce buildup of
      plaque in blood vessels of patients with the metabolic syndrome.  This novel therapy has the
      potential to decrease the burden of heart disease in obese and diabetic patients with the
      metabolic syndrome.

      Primary Question: Does L-carnitine (L-C) therapy slows down and/or regress atherosclerosis,
      as measured by total plaque volume (TPV) assessed by 3-dimensional (3D) carotid ultrasound
      in patients with metabolic syndrome?  We hypothesize that L-C will regress atherosclerotic
      plaque formation.

      To assess our primary outcome of L-C induced atherosclerosis regression, we anticipate a
      significant percent (%) difference in carotid total plaque volume (TPV) over six months of
      L-C treatment, compared to placebo.  For our secondary outcome, we expect to show that L-C
      therapy compared to placebo, induces a reduction in the proportion of small-sized LDL and an
      increase in large LDL particles.  As small dense LDL particles are more atherogenic than
      large buoyant ones, this would suggest a mechanism contributing to the atherosclerosis
      reduction induced by L-C therapy.

        Study Population: Patients, followed in our clinics for cardiovascular disease (CVD)
        prevention, fulfilling diagnosis criteria for MetS will be recruited.  Eligibility will
        require a 2 step process as described.

        Inclusion Criteria: STEP 1: Initial screening; BP, weight and fasting blood samples will
        be obtained.

          1. Men and women, &gt;18 years,  meeting the criteria for clinical diagnosis of MetS,
             according to the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) harmonized definition, where
             any 3 of the 5 following risk factors cut points constitutes a diagnosis of metabolic
             syndrome (MetS):

               1. Elevated waist circumference: Population- and country-specific definitions;
                  Health Canada recommends males 102 cm and women 88 cm.

               2. Elevated triglycerides: 150 mg/dL (1.7 mmol/L).

               3. Reduced HDL: 40 mg/dL (1.0 mmol/L) in males; 50 mg/dL (1.3 mmol/L) in females or
                  treated.

               4. Elevated BP: Systolic 130 and/or diastolic 85 mm Hg or treated.

               5. Elevated fasting glucose: 100 mg/dL or treated.

          2. Willing to provide informed consent. STEP 2: Baseline plaque volume &gt;50 mm3 by 3D US,
             to ensure sufficient detectable plaque.  This will be measured after consent (at Step
             1), but prior to randomization/enrolment (Step 2).

        Exclusion criteria:

          1. Patients who have had a change in statin therapy dosing in the last three months;

          2. Symptomatic heart failure or renal failure (GFR &lt;50 mL/min/1.73m2);

          3. Any condition expected to limit survival to less than three years;

          4. A condition limiting adherence (i.e. alcoholism, drug addiction, known poor
             adherence);

          5. Concomitant treatment with: anticonvulsants, L-C or derivatives, niacin, fibrates,
             &gt;1g fish oil, and/or drugs that affect insulin sensitivity, and/or thyroid treatment.

          6. A seizure disorder or at risk of seizure (CNS mass or medications that lower seizure
             threshold); receiving treatments for cancer or HIV infection (secondary L-C
             deficiency); currently pregnant or breastfeeding; a history of allergy to L-C or
             derivatives and/or lactose (placebo).

          7. Vegetarians due to potential for altered L-C metabolism.

          8. Patients who have had a carotid surgery (ie. endarterectomy (CEA) or stent) or who
             are scheduled to receive carotid surgery during the trial.
