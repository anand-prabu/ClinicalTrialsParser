Mindfulness meditation is a promising\n      treatment for chronic pain, mental health and addictive disorders.

            "textblock": "Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is one of the most common, costly and disabling conditions.\n      Treatment for refractory CLBP often includes opioid therapy even though it is often only\n      marginally effective. Prescription opioid abuse is a national epidemic; development of safe,\n      effective non-addictive therapies for chronic pain is a national priority. Mindfulness\n      meditation is a promising, safe treatment for chronic pain, mental health and addictive\n      disorders. No study has evaluated the potential of meditation to improve health, decrease\n      daily pain medication, including opioid, dose or modify CLBP on a biological level in adults\n      with opioid-treated refractory CLBP.\n\n      This unblinded 26-week pilot RCT will test methods feasibility and potential efficacy of\n      meditation in improving health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and reducing daily pain\n      medication, including opioid, use among opioid-treated CLBP adults. Up to 50 adults with\n      daily CLBP, treated with daily opioids for at least 3 months, will be recruited from\n      outpatient clinic and community settings, and randomly assigned to one of two balanced study\n      arms: meditation + standard of care (SOC) or SOC alone (wait-list control). The\n      CLBP-tailored meditation intervention will consist of a) therapist-led group training in\n      meditation and evidence-based cognitive therapy strategies (two-hours/week for 8 weeks), and\n      b) at-home meditation (30 minutes/day, 6 days/week). Controls will be offered meditation\n      training after study completion.\n\n      Outcome measures at 0, 8 and 26 weeks will gather data on potential efficacy and mechanism\n      of action of meditation intervention; stress reduction is hypothesized to be the primary\n      mechanistic pathway: 1. CLBP-related HRQoL and self-reported pain medication use (primary\n      outcomes); 2. Alcohol and drug use, and misuse; 3. Benefit/cost measures; and 4.\n      Stress-responsive measures (self-reported psychological health measures, serum profile of\n      stress-responsive biomarkers, and pain sensitivity and regulation measures).\n\n      This innovative study directly addresses national priorities aimed at development of an\n      effective, safe treatment for CLBP and reduction of opioid use. Potential benefits accruing\n      from positive findings include improved quality of life and reduced pain medication,\n      especially opioid, use among patients with refractory CLBP which may result in decreased\n      individual and societal harms that can be associated with opioid therapy; reduced pool of\n      circulating opioids may help alleviate the growing problem of prescription opioid abuse."
