      The electronic admission database or any other applicable database of the hospital will be
      reviewed to identify hospitalized children/children with outpatient visits/emergency room
      visits, less than five years of age who had been diagnosed with acute gastroenteritis (AGE)
      or RV GE either by the International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems
      10th Revision (ICD 10) diagnostic code (AA00-AA09 for intestinal infectious diseases and
      A08.0 for RV specific GE) or by RV positive rapid diagnosis kit results.

      Note: The outcomes for the outpatient and emergency room visits will be assessed only in
      case the data for outpatient and emergency room visits can be obtained from at least one of
      the study centers.
