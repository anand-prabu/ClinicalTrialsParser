  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 1 diabetes is caused by an autoimmune process resulting in a selective destruction of
      the pancreatic insulin-secreting beta-cell. DiaPep277® is a small, lyophilized powder
      containing 24 Amino-acids. We have proved in former studies that DiaPep277® can slow down
      beta cells destruction in the pancreas and therefore decelerate the progress of Diabetes.

      The objective of the study is to assess the efficacy and safety of administrating DiaPep277®
      in type 1 diabetes patients.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. The subject has any significant diseases or conditions, including psychiatric
             disorders and substance abuse that, in the opinion of the Investigator, are likely to
             affect the subject's response to treatment or the ability to complete the study.

          2. The subject has a history of any kind of malignant tumor (not including basal cell
             skin cancer).

          3. The subject has clinical evidence of any diabetes-related complication that in the
             opinion of the Investigator would interfere with the subject's participation in
             and/or completion of the study.

          4. Subject has history of endogenous allergic reactivity:

               -  Severe allergic reaction or severe exacerbation of allergic asthma within 12
                  months prior to the Screening-Ext Visit.

               -  Ongoing systemic asthma treatment.

               -  Subjects with history of life threatening or severe allergy, re-occurrence of
                  which cannot be ruled out based on the Investigator's judgment.

          5. The subject has known allergy to lipid emulsions.

          6. The subject has a known immune deficiency from any disease, or a condition associated
             with an immune deficiency.

          7. The subject is receiving immunosuppressive or immunomodulating agents or cytotoxic
             therapy or any medication that in the opinion of the Investigator might interfere
             with the study.

          8. The subject has any of the following clinically significant laboratory abnormalities:

               -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) greater than
                  three times the upper limit of the normal (ULN) at the Screening-Ext Visit.

               -  Total bilirubin greater than 1.3 times the ULN at the Screening-Ext Visit.

               -  Subjects with severe renal failure at the Screening-Ext visit (as defined by
                  glomerular filtration rate &lt; 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 by Cockroft und Gault calculation
                  • Clinically significant laboratory abnormalities, confirmed by repeat
                  measurement, which may interfere with the assessment of safety and / or efficacy
                  of the study drug, other than hyperglycemia and glycosuria at the Screening-Ext
                  Visit.
