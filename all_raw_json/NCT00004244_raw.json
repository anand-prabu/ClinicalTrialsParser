Obtain preliminary data on the antitumor efficacy of this combination in these\n      patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study, followed by a randomized study.\n\n      Patients receive interleukin-12 subcutaneously (SC) twice a week and interferon alfa SC\n      three times a week every week for 4 weeks. Treatment continues in the absence of\n      unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of interleukin-12 and interferon alfa until\n      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding\n      that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicities.\n\n      Once the MTD is established, additional patients are accrued and randomized to 1 of the\n      following treatment arms:\n\n      ARM I: Patients receive interleukin-12 SC twice a week for 2 weeks, followed by treatment\n      with interleukin-12 in combination with interferon alfa as described above.\n\n      ARM II: Patients receive interferon alfa SC three times a week for 2 weeks, followed by\n      treatment with interleukin-12 in combination with interferon alfa as described above.\n\n      ARM III: Patients receive treatment with interleukin-12 in combination with interferon alfa\n      at the MTD as described above.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-30 patients will be accrued for the dose escalation portion\n      of this study. An additional 18 patients (5 in arm I, 5 in arm II, and 8 in arm III) will be\n      accrued to the randomized portion of this study."
