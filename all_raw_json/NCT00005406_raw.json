Relatively little is known about these\n      risk factors in men and women 20-29 years of age.\n\n      This study provided important insights into the determinants of coronary heart disease risk\n      factors in young adults and bolstered the argument of those who favor the early\n      identification of and intervention in the young coronary candidate.\n\n      DESIGN NARRATIVE:\n\n      Three cross-sectional examinations had been carried out: 1) 1972-1973; 2) 1980-1981; and 3)\n      1988-1989.  The study examined the predictors of change in total cholesterol (from\n      examination 1 to examination 3, and change in LDL-C, HDL-C, and triglycerides between\n      examinations 2 and 3. It also investigated the stability in several health habits and\n      behaviors such as cigarette smoking, alcohol use, adherence to a low fat/low cholesterol\n      diet, and physical activity. Weight gain and oral contraceptive use had been shown in\n      previous analyses to be strong predictors of several lipids and lipoproteins."
