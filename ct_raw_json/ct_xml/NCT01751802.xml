    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to gather scientific information about the
      effectiveness and safety of the study drug, Ecopipam (PSYRX 101), for the treatment of
      self-injurious behaviors when compared with the effectiveness and safety of placebo
      (inactive substance) in subjects with Lesch-Nyhan Disease.

    <textblock>
      This study will be done in approximately 6 centers in approximately 4 countries, and
      approximately 24 subjects will be included.  This study is divided into two parts.  The
      first is a double-blinded portion lasting up to 18 weeks in total.  The second portion is an
      optional open-label extension and lasts up to 54 weeks total.  The total duration of the
      study, if you choose to participate in both portions, is anticipated to be up to
      approximately 78 weeks.

      The first portion of this study is double-blind and assignment to a treatment group is done
      randomly.  In this study, there are two treatment groups.  One group will receive Ecopipam
      for one 6-week period and placebo for two 6-week periods, and the other group will receive
      Ecopipam for two 6-week periods and placebo for one 6-week period.

      Subjects who did not experience any clinically significant side effects during the blinded
      portion of the study may be eligible to participate in an open-label extension that may last
      up to 54 weeks.
