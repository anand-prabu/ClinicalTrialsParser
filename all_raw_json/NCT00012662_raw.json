Sustained reduction in hyperglycemia can\n      reduce the incidence of these complications by as much as 50 percent.  Studies have\n      demonstrated improved glycemic control with nurse case-management or educational care\n      models. However, none have controlled for their independent contributions, intervened with\n      advanced practice nurses (APN), or targeted highest risk individuals.\n\n      Objectives:\n\n      The objective of this project is to examine whether interventions of diabetes\n      self-management education programs with or without APN case managers improve outcomes and\n      are cost effective.\n\n      Methods:\n\n      Patients were randomly assigned to one of four groups: 1) Disease-management and diabetes\n      education; 2) Disease-management alone; 3) Diabetes education alone; and 4) Routine Care.\n      Veterans receiving primary care in VISN-5 and meeting high-risk criteria (HbA1c \ufffd 9.0%) were\n      screened for inclusion.  Patient outcome measures were collected at baseline, three months\n      and twelve months. These included: Quality of Life (QOL), HgbAlc levels, and incidence of\n      diabetes-related hospitalizations/ER visits.  In addition, patient-level intervention costs,\n      health care use and costs were examined.  ANOVA comparisons were used to test hypotheses.\n\n      Status:\n\n      Recruitment is over and final analyses are underway."
