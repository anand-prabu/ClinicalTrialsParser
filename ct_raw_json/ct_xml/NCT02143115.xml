  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to compare, both clinically and from a cost-effectiveness
      perspective, virtual or CT-C (CT-Colonography) to standard CT scan and optical colonoscopy
      (OC).  Virtual colonoscopy is a combination of a radiologic evaluation of the abdomen and
      pelvis with intra-colonic imaging.   Previous research supports the concept that CT-C may be
      an effective substitute for the current OC and address limited compliance for surveillance
      for CRC survivors.
