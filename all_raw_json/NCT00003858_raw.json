Assess the feasibility of enrolling patients with adenocarcinoma of the\n      prostate at high risk for recurrence following radical prostatectomy in an adjuvant\n      mitoxantrone trial. II. Determine if this adjuvant therapy results in a delay in time to\n      failure or a decrease in the number of treatment failures compared to historical controls in\n      this patient population.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients receive mitoxantrone IV over 10-30 minutes every 21 days. Treatment\n      continues for a maximum of 6 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease\n      progression. Patients are followed every 3 months for the first 3 years, and then every 6\n      months for the next 3 years or until disease progression.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 60 patients will be accrued for this study over 18 months."
