  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group,
      dose-ranging phase 2b study to investigate the hepatic and renal safety and tolerability of
      multiple dose administration of two dose levels of CSL112 compared with placebo in subjects
      with acute myocardial infarction (AMI).
