To complete this aim, we will recruit patients who have undergone arthroscopic\n      iliopsoas release by Dr. Aoki. Each subjects contralateral nonoperative hip will serve as\n      their own control. To delineate the effects of arthroscopic surgery alone from those\n      resulting from iliopsoas release in addition to arthroscopic surgery, we will recruit a\n      second control group consisting of patients who have undergone arthroscopic surgery by Dr.\n      Aoki without iliopsoas release.\n\n      For both hips of each subject, we will:\n\n        -  Quantify the muscle volume of the iliopsoas muscle with MRI.\n\n        -  Quantify hip flexion strength with isokinetic dynamometry.\n\n        -  Quantify patient function and satisfaction with functional outcome surveys.\n\n      This data will allow us to test the following hypotheses:\n\n        -  Compared to the non-operative hip, hips undergoing arthroscopic iliopsoas release have\n           decreased iliopsoas muscle volume and hip flexion strength.\n\n        -  Compared to hips undergoing arthroscopic surgery without iliopsoas release, hips\n           undergoing arthroscopic iliopsoas release have decreased iliopsoas muscle volume and\n           hip flexion strength.\n\n        -  Patient function and satisfaction positively correlates to muscle bulk and strength."
