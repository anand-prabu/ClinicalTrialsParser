This\n      clinical study is comprised of 2 sequential parts: Part 1 (Dose Escalation) and Part 2\n      (Expansion). The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety (including the recommended\n      Phase II dose), pharmacokinetics (the amount of VS-5584 in subject's blood) and the\n      anti-cancer activity of VS-5584. Biomarkers (genes or proteins that may predict or show how\n      subject's body may respond to VS-5584) will also be assessed in archival tumor tissue, tumor\n      biopsies (in consenting subjects), and blood samples."
