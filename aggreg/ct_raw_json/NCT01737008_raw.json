Dacomitinib is an oral drug that blocks a\n      receptor called the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) which is found to be too active\n      in SCCHN patients. By blocking the signals for the cancer cells to grow, it is believed to\n      stop or slow the growth of tumor cells. The treatment of SCCHN usually includes chemotherapy\n      and radiation.\n\n      This study will have two phases: a dose escalation phase and a dose expansion phase. The\n      dose escalation phase will find the best dose as well as determine the safety of dacomitinib\n      when given with radiotherapy and with or without chemotherapy.The dose expansion phase will\n      further test the best dose determined in the dose escalation phase for safety and\n      effectiveness."
