Women randomized to TAU will be treated by UNC physicians according to the\n      UNC-CH Perinatal Psychiatry Program's algorithm for treatment of prenatal MDD (usually one\n      of a number of antidepressant medications, tailored to the individual, although some women\n      may opt against medication altogether and still be eligible to enroll). Women randomized to\n      PA-IPT will participate in 8 therapy sessions with their identified partner over a 12-week\n      period, along with one refresher session at or around 6 weeks postpartum.   Women and\n      partners will be assessed for change in depressive symptoms and relationship satisfaction\n      during pregnancy at visits 4 and 8, and postpartum at 6-week and 6-month visits.\n\n      Hypothesis: The investigators anticipate notable improvement in both groups similar in\n      magnitude, however it is hypothesized that couples participating in PA-IPT will have higher\n      relationship satisfaction post-treatment (controlling for baseline satisfaction) than those\n      receiving TAU."
