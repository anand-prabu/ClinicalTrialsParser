    <textblock>
      Syncope affects about 50% of Canadians, is the cause of 1-2% of emergency room visits, and
      probably is responsible for CDN $250 million in health care spending each year. It is
      associated with decreased quality of life, trauma, loss of employment, and limitations in
      daily activities. The most common cause is vasovagal syncope.

      This occurs in people of all ages, and is a lifelong predilection. While the median number
      of faints in the population is 2, those who come to the investigators care have a median
      10-15 lifetime spells, and have an increased frequency in the year before presentation.
      Vasovagal syncope is due to abrupt hypotension and transient bradycardia, which cause
      cerebral hypoperfusion. The pathophysiology may be either failure of venous return or
      progressive vasodilation, both due to inappropriately low sympathetic outflow. Sympathetic
      stimulation might be involved early in the reflex cascade. There is no known medical
      treatment for frequent fainting. The investigators performed the pivotal CIHR-funded
      randomized trials that showed that neither permanent pacing, beta blockers, nor
      fludrocortisone help the majority of patients.

      However 3 observational studies suggested that beta blockers prevent syncope in older
      subjects, and the Prevention of Syncope Trial (POST1) showed in a prespecified, -stratified
      analysis that patients ≥42 years tended to benefit. The investigators recent meta-analysis
      showed a benefit from metoprolol in these patients, with a hazard ratio of 0.52 (CI 0.27 to
      1.01), and an age-specific response to beta blockers (p = 0.007). These results suggest the
      need for a randomized clinical trial of metoprolol for the prevention of vasovagal syncope
      in older subjects. Accordingly,the investigators conducted a poll of 48 cardiologists and
      neurologists in Canada and abroad: 98% stated that a randomized trial was necessary, and 92%
      agreed to participate in such a trial. Separately, this study emerged as the first choice
      for syncope randomized trials after consultation with Canadian and international experts.

      Objective: To determine if treatment with metoprolol in patients ≥40 years old with moderate
      to severely frequent vasovagal syncope will better suppress syncope recurrences than
      placebo.

      Methods: This will be a longitudinal, prospective, parallel design, placebo-controlled,
      randomized clinical trial.

      Patients will be enrolled during a recruitment period of 4 years and followed for a fixed
      period of 1 year. Subjects will have had ≥1 faint in the previous year, and a diagnosis of
      vasovagal syncope based on a quantitative diagnostic score. They will be randomized to
      receive either metoprolol or placebo at an initial dose of 50 mg bid. Dose adjustments will
      be made according to treating physician discretion to optimize tolerance and compliance
      while maximizing dose. The primary outcome measure will be the time to the first recurrence
      of syncope (after a 2 week dose titration wash-in period) over the 1-year observation
      period. The primary analysis will be performed on an intention-to-treat basis. Secondary
      analyses will include an on-treatment analysis, as well as analyses comparing syncope and
      presyncope frequency, number needed to treat, quality of life, impact of syncope on daily
      living, and cost from the perspective of the publicly funded health care system. The
      investigators will enroll 248 patients to have an 85% power to detect a reduction (p&lt;0.05)
      in the primary outcome from 50% (placebo group) to 30% (midodrine group), a 40% relative
      risk reduction. This sample size also allows for a 11% rate of subject dropout with loss to
      follow-up before a syncopal event. The University of Calgary Syncope Clinic has a
      well-functioning clinical trial apparatus that successfully completed the randomized,
      multicenter Prevention of Syncope Trials (POST1: metoprolol for vasovagal syncope; POST2:
      fludrocortisone for vasovagal syncope) and SIRCAT (Statin-Induced Reduction of
      Cardiomyopathy Trial). Enrolment is underway in the CIHR-funded POST3 (pacing versus loop
      recorders in syncope patients with bifascicular block) and POST4 (midodrine for vasovagal
      syncope). Study centres that were highly productive in POST1-4 have agreed to participate.
      The investigators therefore will have ample syncope enrolling centres.

      Relevance: This study will provide evidence to inform the use of metoprolol in the treatment
      of moderate to severely frequent syncope in older patients with vasovagal syncope. Given the
      lack of any other conventional medical therapy the investigators expect it to have rapid
      impact on care.
