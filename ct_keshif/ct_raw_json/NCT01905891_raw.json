            "textblock": "Squamous cell carcinoma is the culmination of a multistep carcinogenesis process that is\n      preceded by early stages referred as squamous dysplasia and actinic keratosis. Squamous\n      dysplasia (SD) also known as \"field effect\" is clinically characterized by xerosis (dry,\n      scaly skin), lentigines and uneven pigmentation. While morphologically skin biopsies and\n      cytology samples show only minimal changes, at the molecular level it is known that SD is\n      characterized by small clone keratinocytes carrying mutations of the P53 gene.  An optical\n      technology called Partial Wave Spectroscopy (PWS) probes nanoscale structures in the order\n      of tens to a few hundred nanometers. PWS is a light back-scattering techniques that uses\n      light reflected off of a tissue sample. The measured biomarker is sensitive to the cytosolic\n      and nucleic architecture within the cell and quantifies the nanoscale disorder, which\n      conventional light microscopy fails to appreciate. PWS has allowed to identify various\n      grades of structural disorder at the nanoscale level of colonic and pulmonary premalignant\n      cell samples.  Using PWS we aim to study the spectrum of cutaneous SD from patients at high\n      risk for SCC development. Since squamous dysplasia is difficult to assess with routine\n      histology and cytopathology and a grading system for squamous dysplasia by routine histology\n      or cytology is not available, we propose to assess the value of PWS as a new and more\n      sensitive imaging technique. By identifying the degree of SD at the molecular level, we may\n      be able to intervene with close surveillance, early treatment and chemoprevention strategies\n      to achieve lower morbidity by means of fewer and smaller skin cancers."

Skin will first be wiped with an alcohol pad and 1% lidocaine will be superficially infiltrated per standard skin surgical procedures. 30% trichloroacetic acid (TCA, standard chemical peel) will then be applied for five minutes. TCA will be neutralized using bicarbonate. Using a cytology brush (a small brush which is used to collect cells during the course of a biopsy) cells will be collected by gentle scraping surface of the skin. Then, a superficial shave biopsy specimen, obtained by using a dermablade (a flexible, one piece blade specifically designed for shave biopsy and excision of skin lesions) will be obtained.",
