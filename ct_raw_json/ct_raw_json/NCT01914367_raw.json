One sib of each twin pair will\n      be given Cervarix according to the 0, 1, 6 month vaccination scheme, while the other sib\n      will be given Gardasil according to the 0, 2, 6 month vaccination scheme. Three blood\n      samples will be taken (the first prior to vaccine administration, the second and third  7\n      days after dose 2 and 3, respectively). The blood samples will be used to determine: 1) the\n      magnitude the anti-HPV 16 and anti-HPV-18 antibody responses, 2) as well as the\n      cross-reactive pattern of these responses towards related, non-vaccine HPV strains (HPV-31\n      and -33, and HPV-45). 3) plasmablast isolated from blood taken 7 days after the 3rd dose in\n      the first place (and eventually after the 2nd dose also) will be examined for for the usage\n      of VDJ and VJ segments in the immunoglobulin heavy (VH) and light (VL) heavy and light\n      chains. Gene useg in B cells induced by Cervarix and Gardasil will be compared. Finally the\n      cross-reactive potential of monoclonal antibodies obtained by eukaryotic expression of a\n      series of heavy (VH) and light (VL) chains from single ASC isolated after the 3rd dose of a\n      three-dose schedule of either Cervarix or Gardasil will be examined.\n\n      The duration of the study is approximately 187 days. Five study visits will take place, over\n      a time period of 6.5 months, followed by a telephone call after 12 months.\n\n      The purpose of the study is to learn more about the molecular mechanisms underlying the\n      cross-neutralizing capacity of AS04-adjuvanted HPV vaccine (Cervarix\u00ae) in comparison with\n      the aluminiumhydroxyphosphate sulphate adjuvanted HPV vaccine (Gardasil\u00ae)."
