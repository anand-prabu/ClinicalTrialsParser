    <textblock>
      This study aims to determine if treatment with apixaban, compared with aspirin, will reduce
      the risk of ischemic stroke and systemic embolism in pacemaker patients with sub-clinical
      atrial fibrillation and additional risk factors for stroke.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are over sixty thousand Canadians with pacemakers or implanted defibrillators. More
      than 40% of these patients will develop sub-clinical atrial fibrillation (SCAF), which is a
      short-lasting, typically asymptomatic arrhythmia that would not be detected by means other
      than a modern, dual-chamber pacemaker. Only 15% of patients with SCAF also have clinical
      atrial fibrillation (AF) and until recently, the significance of isolated SCAF was debated.
      However; our group published the ASSERT trial, which demonstrated that in patients with
      hypertension, but without clinical AF, SCAF ≥ 6 minutes in duration was associated with a
      2.5-fold increased risk of stroke; which among patients with CHA2DS2-VASC score &gt; 3 was
      associated with a stroke risk of 2.75% per year. However; the optimal approach to stroke
      prevention for patients with SCAF is controversial and oral anticoagulation (OAC) is usually
      not employed. As OAC can prevent 60-80% of ischemic strokes in patients with clinical AF, it
      is critical that we determine its roll in patients with SCAF.

      Many patients with pacemakers and implanted defibrillators are followed semi-annually by
      cardiologists and nurses in device clinics and many of them have a CHA2DS2-VASC score &gt; 3.
      They represent a large, high-risk and easily identifiable group of patients who are highly
      compliant with follow-up. ARTESiA will enroll 3,719 patients with a pacemaker or implanted
      defibrillator, a CHA2DS2-VASC score &gt; 3 and at least one episode of SCAF ≥ 6 minutes who do
      not have a history of clinical AF and who do not have a contra-indication to oral
      anticoagulation. Patients will be randomized to receive either the oral anticoagulant
      apixaban or aspirin, in a double-blind, double-dummy fashion and will be followed for the
      primary outcome of ischemic stroke or systemic embolism.

      ARTESiA will help define the role of OAC in patients with pacemakers and defibrillations who
      have SCAF; providing clinicians with important guidance for this common problem. However;
      the implications of ARTESiA go beyond the pacemaker population. New cardiac rhythm
      monitoring technologies are increasingly being used in clinical practice and suggest a high
      prevalence of SCAF among older individuals without pacemakers, but with cardiovascular risk
      factors. The results of ARTESiA will give insights for this much larger and rapidly growing
      group of patients.
