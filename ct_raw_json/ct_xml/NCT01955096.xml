    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to to investigate the feasibility and safety of fast-track
      surgery when combined with laparoscopic-assisted gastrectomy for advanced gastric cancer
      patients.

      Methods: We designed a prospective randomized, controlled clinical trial then recruited 61
      consecutive advanced gastric cancer patients. (Trial registration number: JLUFHC1722013)
      Further divide into a fast-track surgery group (n=30) and a conventional surgery group
      (n=31). Surgical technique in both groups is same laparoscopic-assisted gastrectomy with D2
      lymphadenectomy.  Compare outcomes includes length of hospital stay, return to normal diet
      and postoperative complications.Results: Recovery parameters such as the length of time to
      return to normal diet; to the first defection; start of ambulation time ;the mean hospital
      stay will be all less in patients assigned to the fast track surgery protocol compared with
      those in the conventional care programme.  Conclusion: We will consider fast-track
      rehabilitation to be safe and feasible in advanced gastric cancer patients. Moreover, it
      will result in decreased hospital stay.

    <description>The included patients will be randomly divided to two groups :30 that will undergo LAG with FTS rehabilitation programme and 31 that also will undergo LAG but receive conventional postoperative care.Laparoscopy-assisted gastrectomy will be carried out in this approach.There will be no difference in the surgical procedures of both groups.The criteria for discharge are: tolerance of solid diet, return of bowel habits and ability to walk on their own.</description>
