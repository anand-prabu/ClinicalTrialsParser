      Background The rates of perinatal depression in South Asian women are reported to be amongst
      the highest in the world, ranging from 18%-30% in urban areas and 28%-36% in rural areas. In
      addition to its profound impact on women's health, disability and functioning, perinatal
      depression is associated with poor child health outcomes such as pre-term birth, infant
      under-nutrition and stunting. There is robust evidence that perinatal depression can be
      effectively managed with psychological treatments delivered by non-specialist health care
      workers. The Thinking Healthy Program (THP), a psychological treatment delivered by
      community health workers (CHWs) in Pakistan, more than halved the rate of perinatal
      depression among mothers and led to significant improvements in child health outcomes. To
      enhance access to such evidence-based psychological treatments there is a need to examine
      the potential role of other human resources such as lay persons in delivering psychological
      treatments such as THP in poor resource settings.

      Objective To evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of THP delivered by peers
      (the Thinking Healthy Program-Peer delivered in Goa, India; THPP-I) over the duration of 6
      months. Peers will be healthy mothers who live in the same community as potential trial
      participants (TPs).

      Study design and outcomes Individual randomized controlled trial in Goa, India involving 280
      women. TPs will not be blinded to treatment allocation. Mothers attending antenatal clinics
      at hospitals will be assessed for eligibility to participate in the trial (e.g. whether they
      are in the second or third trimester of pregnancy). Those who are eligible will be invited
      to participate in screening for depression; mothers who consent will be screened for
      depression with a locally validated version of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9).
      Women who screen positive (PHQ-9 score â‰¥ 10) and give informed consent for further
      participation in the trial will be randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to receive enhanced
      usual care (EUC) or THPP-I+EUC, using a computer generated allocation sequence. The primary
      outcomes will be remission (i.e. recovery from depression and depressive symptoms), both
      assessed by the PHQ-9 at 6 months.  Secondary outcomes are depressive symptoms and remission
      at 3 months (PHQ-9), maternal disability at 3 and 6 months (measured with the WHO-DAS),
      breastfeeding rates and infant weight and height of children at 3 and 6 months. Outcomes
      will be analyzed on an intention to treat basis.

      Interventions EUC will comprise communicating the results of the screening to the mother
      through an information sheet on self-care for mental health, communicating the results to
      the mother's gynaecologist, providing the gynaecologist with the WHO mhGAP guidelines for
      the treatment of depression, and providing guidance on referral of depressed mothers to
      mental health services. TPs who are in the THPP-I group will receive, in addition to EUC,
      between 11 to 14 sessions of THPP starting from their recruitment in the second/ third
      trimester until up to 6 months after child birth. Sessions will be delivered by peers on an
      individual basis at a location of convenience to the TPs (usually at their own homes).

      Implications THPP-I has the potential to advance knowledge of the extent to which
      task-shifting of the delivery of evidence-based psychological treatments can be extended to
      peers in the community. If effectiveness is observed, this approach offers a potential
      opportunity to access a vast untapped human resource for maternal mental health care and
      addresses a major barrier in global mental health - the lack of skilled and motivated human
      resources in the formal health sector - offering a new avenue for the scaling up of
      evidence-based psychological treatments and mental health services in low resourced
      settings.
