A major reason why lenalidomide cannot be used for\n      the treatment of MDS is because of the occurrence of thrombocytopenia. The use of\n      eltrombopag will potentially raise platelet counts in these patients and enable a longer\n      exposure to lenalidomide. Secondly, thrombocytopenia in the first 2 months after\n      lenalidomide therapy predicts the subsequent response to lenalidomide treatment in patients\n      with low risk MDS thus raising platelet counts to enable continuation of Lenalidomide\n      therapy is important in these patients. Lastly, an increase in blasts has been a potential\n      concern with the use of thrombopoietin mimetics. Preclinical studies have indicated that\n      eltrombopag is less likely to increase blasts thus making it a possible potential\n      therapeutic candidate in low risk MDS."

                "textblock": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n          1. Age \u2265 18 years.\n\n          2. Patient must have a documented diagnosis of MDS of at least three months duration\n             (MDS duration \u2265 3 months) according to World Health Organization (WHO) criteria (see\n             Appendix IV) or non-proliferative chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) (WBC \u2264\n             12,000/L)).\n\n          3. Patients must have International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) categories of Low-\n             or Intermediate-1-risk disease (see Section 6).\n\n          4. Patients must have symptomatic anemia untransfused with hemoglobin \u2264 9.5 g/dL within\n             8 weeks of registration or with red blood cell (RBC) transfusion-dependence (i.e., \u2265\n             2 units/month) confirmed for a minimum of 8 weeks before randomization.\n\n          5. Patients must have IPSS score determined by cytogenetic analysis prior to\n             randomization. Patients with cytogenetic failure and \u2264 10% marrow blasts will be\n             eligible.\n\n          6. Patients must be off all disease modifying therapy for MDS for 28 days prior to\n             initiation of study treatment. Patients may receive hydrocortisone prophylactically\n             to prevent transfusion reactions.\n\n          7. Patients must not have documented iron deficiency. All patients must have documented\n             marrow iron stores. If marrow iron stain is not available, the transferrin saturation\n             must be \u2265 20% or a serum ferritin \u2265 100 mg/100 mL or soluble transferring receptor <\n             5mg/L.\n\n          8. Women must not be pregnant or breastfeeding. Females of childbearing potential should\n             have 2 negative pregnancy tests. The first test should be performed within 10-14\n             days, and the second test within 24 hours prior to prescribing lenalidomide.\n\n          9. Women of childbearing potential and sexually active males must agree to use 2 methods\n             of an accepted and effective method of contraception and counseled on the potential\n             teratogenic effects of lenalidomide. Effective contraception must be used by patients\n             for at least 4 weeks before beginning lenalidomide therapy, during lenalidomide\n             therapy, during dose interruptions and for 4 weeks following discontinuation of\n             lenalidomide therapy. Reliable contraception is indicated even where there has been a\n             history of infertility, unless due to hysterectomy or because the patient has been\n             postmenopausal naturally for at least 24 consecutive months. Two reliable forms of\n             contraception must be used simultaneously unless continuous abstinence from\n             heterosexual sexual contact is the chosen method. Females of childbearing potential\n             should be referred to a qualified provider of contraceptive methods, if needed.\n             Sexually mature females who have not undergone a hysterectomy or who have not been\n             postmenopausal naturally for at least 24 consecutive months (i.e., who have had\n             menses at some time in the preceding 24 consecutive months) are considered to be\n             females of childbearing potential. It is not known whether CC-5013 (lenalidomide) is\n             present in the semen of patients receiving the drug. Therefore, males receiving\n             CC-5013 (lenalidomide) must always use a latex condom during any sexual contact with\n             females of childbearing potential even if they have undergone a successful vasectomy.\n\n         10. Patients must not have received prior therapy with lenalidomide (for more than 2\n             months) nor eltrombopag.\n\n         11. Patients must not have uncontrolled hypertension.\n\n         12. Patients must have absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \u2265500 cells/L (0.5 x 109/L).\n\n         13. ECOG Performance 0-3 (ECOG).\n\n         14. Prothrombin time (PT/INR) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) must be\n             within 80 to 120% of the normal range at baseline.\n\n         15. Patient is able to understand protocol requirements.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          1. Pre-existing cardiovascular disease (including congestive heart failure, New York\n             Heart Association (NYHA) Grade III/IV), or arrhythmia known to increase the risk of\n             thromboembolic events (e.g. atrial fibrillation), or subjects with a corrected QT\n             interval (QTc) >450 msec.\n\n          2. Patients determined to be at increased risk of arterial or venous thrombosis by the\n             investigator\n\n          3. Bone marrow fibrosis that leads to a dry tap.\n\n          4. Female subjects who are nursing or pregnant (positive serum or urine -human chorionic\n             gonadotropin (-hCG) pregnancy test) at screening or pre-dose on Day 1.\n\n          5. Treatment with an investigational drug within 30 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is\n             longer) preceding the first dose of study medication.\n\n          6. Patients with documented liver cirrhosis\n\n          7. Patients with splenomegaly with a spleen size > 16cm."
