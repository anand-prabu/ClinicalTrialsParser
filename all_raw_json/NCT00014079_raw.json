Loss of heterozygosity is analyzed for at least four\n      chromosomal arms (5q, 8p, 17p, and 18q) and later other chromosomes (e.g., 1, 14, and 22).\n      Immunohistochemistry is used to test for the presence or absence of the genes involved in\n      DNA mismatch repair (hMLH1 and hMSH2).\n\n      Patients do not receive the results of the genetic testing and the results do not influence\n      the type or duration of treatment.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: This study will accrue up to 708 specimens."
