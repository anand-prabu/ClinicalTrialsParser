            "textblock": "Obese patients are prone to develop desaturation soon after initiation of anaesthesia\n      compared to patients of normal body weight. It is therefore important to keep the time from\n      when spontaneous breathing to when the airway is secured with a orotracheal tube as short as\n      possible. We will therefore investigate if it is possible to shorten this time by using a\n      Stortz videolaryngoscope.\n\n      Patients 18-60 years with ASA grade 1-3 and BMI < 35 that turn up for planned surgery that\n      demands the use of orotracheal tubing and controlled ventilation  will be randomly and\n      consecutively enrolled in either of two groups. Patients in both groups will be\n      anaesthetised with the same combination of drugs using  Propofol and Remifentanyl or\n      Fentanyl for induction of sleep, combined with Rocuronium for muscle relaxation.\n\n      After the induction and relaxation the intubation will be facilitated using either of two\n      laryngoscopes. In the first group a conventional Macintosh laryngoscope, and in the second\n      group a Stortz videolaryngoscope will be used. The time to intubation is defined as the time\n      from grabbing the laryngoscope to when the tube has been inserted and end-tidal carbon\n      dioxide appears on the monitor. Our hypothesis is that we will be able to achieve a faster\n      intubation with the use of videolaryngoscope."
