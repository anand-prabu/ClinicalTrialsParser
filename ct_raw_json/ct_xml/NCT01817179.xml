  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate how a functional electrical stimulation (FES)
      device worn on the lower leg effects how children (ages 6-17 years) with hemiplegic cerebral
      palsy walk and perform other functional activities.

      The investigators expect to find that wearing the functional electrical stimulation device
      will improve walking and other functional activities of children with hemiplegic cerebral
      palsy. Participants will be trained in use of the device and will be required to wear it
      daily for 3 months. Each participant will be evaluated before beginning the intervention and
      after completing the intervention.  This study will provide important information regarding
      the benefits of this treatment intervention in children with hemiplegic cerebral palsy.
