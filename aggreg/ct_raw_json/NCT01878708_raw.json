The combination may provide a collaborative attack\n      against the cancer cell; moreover, the dexamethasone could also prevent some of the side\n      effects of Oncaspar; especially allergic reactions. This study will test these two drugs\n      together to determine if they are an effective treatment for T-Cell Lymphoma. Each drug is\n      commercially available to the drug market."
