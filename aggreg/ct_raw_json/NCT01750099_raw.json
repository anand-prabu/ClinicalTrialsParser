The investigators hypothesize that the instantaneous pain relief that is\n      achieved with combined spinal-epidural analgesia reduces catecholamines quickly and to a\n      greater degree than the conventional epidural, leading to a more effective uterine\n      contraction pattern thus decreasing the duration of the active phase of the first stage of\n      labor."
