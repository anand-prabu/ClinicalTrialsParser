  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The birth of a child with a disorder of sex development (DSD) is stressful for parents and
      members of the healthcare team. The &quot;right&quot; decisions about gender assignment (is it a boy?
      a girl?) and the best course of action (e.g., should there be surgery? what kind? when?) are
      not obvious. While there have been large advances in diagnostic assessments like genetic and
      endocrine testing, the tests do not always show what caused the DSD. And, even when the
      tests do reveal an explanation for the DSD, knowing what happened genetically or hormonally
      does not usually lead to a single &quot;correct&quot; treatment plan. Instead, it is likely that there
      are different acceptable treatment options - and parents will need to make decisions based,
      in part, on their personal preferences, values, and cultural background. Adding more stress
      to the situation is knowledge that many of the decisions that need to be made by parents
      early in a child's life are irreversible and exert life-long consequences for the child and
      the family.

      To support parents becoming actively involved in making such decisions, and to reduce the
      likelihood of future worry and regret about decisions that have been made, the investigators
      will create a decision support tool (DST). The DST will help educate families about typical
      and atypical sex development of the body, the process by which DSD are diagnosed (especially
      how to interpret genetic test results), and possible relationships between
      diagnostic/genetic testing, decisions about care, and known consequences of those decisions
      on their child and entire family. The DST will be used by parents of young children together
      with their child's health care provider.

      The investigators will bring together a network of researchers, health care providers,
      representatives of patient support and advocacy organizations, and parents of children with
      DSD to share their experiences. Participants of this network will be involved at each stage
      of creating the DST, revising it, and putting it into practice. At the end of this project,
      the investigators will have a fully formed and tested DST that will be available for parents
      to use with their child's health care team as they are first learning their child may have a
      DSD.

    <description>To assess characteristics of communications during focus groups and between health care providers and parents before and during the implementation of the DST audiofiles will be coded and analyzed using SCCAP (Siminoff Communication Content &amp; Affect Program). SCCAPÂ© is a new computerized coding scheme used to facilitate, organize, and code health communication data. It is designed so that coders can code directly from audio recordings, allowing the coder to take advantage of the vocalic cues inherent in speech intonations. Transcriptions can also be uploaded and coded so specific text can be viewed and tagged for future use.</description>
