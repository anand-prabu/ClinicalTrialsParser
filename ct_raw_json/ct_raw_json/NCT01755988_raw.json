We also want to investigate if a higher quality of care is delivered despite of\n      less frequent visits to a nurse and/or doctor. The study takes place in the Netherlands and\n      is a randomized trial.  Patients with heart failure, registered by an outpatient heart\n      failure clinic or general practitioner can take part. They will be randomized to 3 groups:\n      group 1 receives standard care, group 2 receives standard care with the website, group 3\n      receives an adjusted care pathway, with both the website and the interactive web-based\n      platform connected to a telemonitoring system.
