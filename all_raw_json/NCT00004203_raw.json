Patients are stratified by platinum therapy status\n      (platinum sensitive vs platinum resistant). Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on\n      day 1. Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression, other illness\n      that would preclude administration of study drug, or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are\n      followed for a minimum of 2 years or until death.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-37 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years."
