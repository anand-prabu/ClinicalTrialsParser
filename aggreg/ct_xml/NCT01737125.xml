  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The distal tibio-fibular joint ( DTFJ) be an integral part of the ankle and its injury makes
      all the gravity, forecast and complexity of ankle fracture treatment. It's classically
      described and known by radiological point of view, but in static incidence and from
      anatomical studies. To our knowledge the dynamic dimension and its modelling is missing. Our
      study will use high spatial-resolution MRI acquisition to obtain the best possible
      definition of DTFJ but especially it will be associated with MRI acquisition in movement,
      using typical fast sequences &quot; TrueFISP &quot; and &quot;FLASH&quot; which will allow a precise modelling
      of joint physiological movements and biomechanics on healthy subjects by a not invasive
      method. This analysis will be made on a simple movement of flexion and extension, the other
      possible movements of the ankle being blocked what corresponds to the clinical situation of
      an osteosynthesis ankle immobilized in post-operative by a dynamic rehabilitation  shoe
      Axmed ® It will be associated an&quot;effort test &quot; with the reproduction of subjected joint of a
      load with MRI joint movement control This test will be made with an ankle fixed to 90 ° of
      flexion what reproduces the post-operative clinical situationThe meditative data will be
      associated with an anatomical biomechanical study of ankles presenting a syndesmosis injury
      repaired according to the classic protocol using in our department, by comparing them with
      the data of the literature to optimize techniques repair of this joint. Indeed there is not
      gold standard surgical technique Main PurposeTo understand, observe, analyze and quantify
      the joint movement during a simple movement of ankle extension and flexion, and during a
      simulation of axial load miming walk fixed to 90 ° as in post-operative. Secondary purpose -
      Modelling the DTFJ- Modify the post-operative care with hypothesis that load does not lead
      abnormal movement in DTFJ with an ankle fixed to 90 ° ( post-operative clinical condition).
      - Validate our technique of repair of this joint by comparing the data MRI with anatomical
      mechanical tests
