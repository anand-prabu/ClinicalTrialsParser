  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The NSCLC patients who experienced good clinical responses to an EGFR-TKI will inevitably
      develop acquired resistance. A great deal of research are focusing on this issue.  Arsenic
      trioxide showed efficacy and safety in acute promyelocytic leukemia, multiple myeloma and
      other solid tumors. Moreover, preclinical studies showed arsenic trioxide can reduce the
      resistance of tumor cells to chemotherapy and TKIs.

    <description>Icotinib is administered 125 mg three times per day, until disease progression or untolerated toxicity.
Arsenic trioxide is administered by intravenous injection with an initial dose of  4mg/m2 per day for day 1 to day 14 every 28 days.
Three dose levels, 4mg/m2, 6mg/m2 and 8mg/m2 will be evaluated according to predefined dose escalation decision rules. The Maximum Administered Dose (MAD) was reached at the dose level when at least 2 patients developed a DLT. There was no further dose escalation when this dose was achieved.</description>
