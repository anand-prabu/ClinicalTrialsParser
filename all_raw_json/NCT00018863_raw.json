Throughout the study, parents\n      and teachers will complete forms that report on the child's behavior and possible side\n      effects. Participants will be monitored by regular visits with a study physician. Most\n      participants will be involved in the study for up to 16 months to ensure optimal evaluation,\n      dosing, and monitoring"
