            "textblock": "Dental and health anxiety are common and potentially distressing problems, for both patients\n      and health care providers.  Anxiety has been identified as a barrier to regular dental\n      visits and as an important target for enhancement of oral health-related quality of life.\n      The goal of this project is to develop a computer-administered dental anxiety management\n      program that can easily be implemented in dental health care settings.  Our aim is for this\n      management program to: 1) integrate different treatments modalities such as\n      cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and motivational interviewing (MI) into one\n      computer-based protocol; 2) facilitate patient adherence to this protocol; 3) lend itself to\n      empirical validation; and 4) lend itself to dissemination to other research and treatment\n      settings. A randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be conducted (n=200). Based on the\n      subjects responses to the screening questionnaires, consenting dental patients at Temple\n      University Kornberg School of Dentistry will be assigned to one of 2 possible groups, (1)\n      high dental anxiety and (2) low dental anxiety. The intervention package will be delivered\n      to a randomly selected half of participants in group 1 (high anxiety group), whereas the\n      remaining participants in this group will be assigned to a delayed treatment control\n      condition. The low dental anxiety patients (group 2) will be used as a benchmark against\n      which to compare post-treatment (or post-control) outcomes for the high anxiety patients. We\n      hope to develop an intervention that can be easily implemented in a broader context without\n      the need for highly specialized personnel."
