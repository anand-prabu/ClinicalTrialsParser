Decreased sensitivity to insulin in\n      the liver, adipose tissue and the associated muscle will be associated at this ectopic fat\n      accumulation.\n\n      Purpose 2 : To determine the alteration of lipolysis in response to sleep restriction in\n      overfeeding condition.\n\n      Hypothesis 2: In overfeeding condition, sleep restriction will increase the concentrations\n      of circulating fatty acids and glycerol in relation to condition of normal sleep."
