    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of metformin in tumor metabolism in
      patients with head and neck cancer by evaluating metformin's ability to decrease TOMM20
      expression in squamous carcinoma cells and decrease MCT4 expression in fibroblasts.

          -  Newly diagnosed with HNSCC cancer.

          -  No prior therapy for HNSCC cancer is permitted for enrollment in the trial.

          -  Received iodinated contrast dye less than 48 hours prior to screening meet a
             temporary exclusion criteria to receive metformin. These patients cannot start
             investigational metformin until 48 hours have elapsed from contrast administration.
             Subjects who are scheduled for iodinated contrast dye administration within 48 hours
             of definitive surgery are excluded.

          -  Sepsis or severe infection.

          -  History of lung disease currently requiring any pharmacologic or supplemental oxygen
             treatment.

          -  Scheduled for definitive HNSCC cancer surgical resection less than two weeks from
             enrollment or greater than five weeks from enrollment.

          -  History of hepatic dysfunction or hepatic disease.
