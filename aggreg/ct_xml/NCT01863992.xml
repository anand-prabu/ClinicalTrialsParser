  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators wish to learn about the quality of life (QOL) of children needing long
      term home ventilation and also that of their regular caregivers. In addition, the
      investigators will monitor the extra health-related expenses these families must meet. Data
      will be collected using two age-specific questionnaires of QOL plus a third one validated
      for assessing chronic health care costs. Questionnaires will be administered at an initial
      face to face meeting, supplemented by two telephone follow-up calls, to monitor medical
      expenses, one and two months later.
