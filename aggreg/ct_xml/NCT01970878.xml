  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, parallel group, chronic dosing,
      active-controlled, 28-week safety extension study of the two pivotal 24-week safety and
      efficacy studies (Studies PT003006 and PT003007).  This study is designed to assess the
      long-term safety and tolerability of GFF MDI, GP MDI, and FF MDI in subjects with moderate
      to very severe COPD over a total observation period of 52 weeks.  Open-label Spiriva is
      included as an active control.  To be eligible for this study, a subject must complete
      participation in Study PT003006 or Study PT003007.

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Significant diseases other than COPD, i.e. disease or condition which, in the opinion
             of the investigator, may put the patient at risk because of participation in the

             pulmonary hypertension, or uncontrolled sleep apnea

          -  Hospitalized due to poorly controlled COPD within 3 months prior to screening or
             during the Screening Period

          -  Poorly controlled COPD, defined as acute worsening of COPD that requires treatment
             with oral corticosteroids or antibiotics within 6 weeks prior to screening or during
             the Screening Period

          -  Lower respiratory tract infections that required antibiotics within 6 weeks prior to
             screening or during the Screening Period

          -  Unstable ischemic heart disease, left ventricular failure, or documented myocardial
             infarction within 12 months of enrollment.

          -  Recent history of acute coronary syndrome, percutaneous coronary intervention,
             coronary artery bypass graft within the past three months

          -  Clinically significant abnormal 12-lead ECG

          -  Abnormal liver function tests defined as AST, ALT, or total bilirubin ≥ 1.5 times
             upper limit of normal at Visit 1 and on repeat testing

          -  Cancer not in complete remission for at least five years

          -  History of hypersensitivity to β2-agonists, glycopyrronium or other muscarinic
