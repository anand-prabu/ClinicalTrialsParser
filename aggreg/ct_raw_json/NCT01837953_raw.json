            "textblock": "Binge Eating Disorder (BED) affects as many as 3% of women and men in Ontario, 8% of obese\n      individuals, and 30% to 50% of those participating in weight loss programs. BED, the most\n      common eating disorder, is characterized by over-eating with loss of control (i.e., binge\n      eating), but with no purging (e.g., vomiting).Our previous research indicates that the total\n      health care costs for women with BED is 36% higher than the Canadian average for women of a\n      similar age, and that health care costs significantly decreased following intensive\n      treatment at our Centre. The main goal of our study is to inform the development of a\n      stepped care approach to the treatment of BED. Stepped care involves providing easily\n      accessible low intensity treatment first, and then providing more expensive intensive\n      treatment second, if necessary. The second goal is to assess if a second more intensive step\n      of treatment provides added value. Although stepped care for BED is suggested by a number of\n      clinicians and researchers, no study adequately tests predictors of who might benefit from\n      minimal treatment alone and who would require the more intensive second step. The results of\n      this study will guide decision making regarding who benefits from stepped care, and will\n      help to increase the accessibility, availability, and cost effectiveness of psychological\n      treatments for BED."
