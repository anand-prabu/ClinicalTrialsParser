  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive, fatal, fibrotic disorder of the lung.
      The estimated prevalence is 30-80/100,000 in the United States with incidence estimates
      clearly rising. A major challenge in the care of patients with IPF is determining prognosis.
      The natural history of IPF is usually one of inexorable decline in lung function, ultimately
      resulting in death from respiratory failure. However, longitudinal physiologic decline in
      IPF is heterogeneous and difficult to predict in individual patients. While some patients
      with IPF may remain stable for years, in others the disease may progress rapidly over a
      relatively short time. We hypothesize that peripheral blood biomarkers based on
      extracellular matrix and matrix-modifying molecules will improve prognostication in patients
      with IPF.

        The study population includes subjects with IPF identified via the University of Michigan
        Interstitial Lung Disease Clinical-Radiologic-Pathologic Conference. The investigators
        will only enroll subjects in whom an IPF diagnosis was established within the prior year.

          2. Diagnosis of IPF by HRCT or surgical lung biopsy

          3. Able to understand and provide informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. AE-IPF during the prior year

          2. Environmental exposure (occupational, drug, etc.) felt to be the etiology of the
             interstitial disease.

          3. Diagnosis of collagen-vascular conditions according to published American College of
             Rheumatology criteria.

          4. Significant airway obstruction (FEV1/FVC ratio &lt; 0.60) or bronchodilator response,
             defined as a change in FEV1 ≥ 12% and absolute change &gt; 200 mL OR change in FVC ≥ 12%
             and absolute change &gt; 200 mL at baseline

          5. Partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) &lt; 55 mm Hg

          6. Residual volume &gt; 120% predicted at screening

          7. Evidence of active infection

          8. Listed for lung transplantation

          9. Myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass, or angioplasty within 6 months

         10. Unstable angina pectoris or congestive heart failure requiring hospitalization or
             deteriorating within 6 months

         11. Uncontrolled arrhythmia or hypertension

         12. Known HIV, hepatitis C, cirrhosis, or chronic active hepatitis

         13. Active substance and/or alcohol abuse

         14. If you are pregnant or breastfeeding

         15. Any condition other than IPF that is likely to result in your death within the next
             year

         16. Any condition that, in the judgment of the PI, might cause participation in the study
             to be detrimental to you or that the PI deems makes you a poor candidate
