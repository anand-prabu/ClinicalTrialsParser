The expanded cohort will comprise approximately 96 patients randomized 1:1\n      to RU-101 or placebo, provided in a double-masked manner."

Conjunctival staining score with Lissamine Green \u2265 2/18\n\n          4. Patients who had been receiving treatment with eye drops of artificial tears,\n             Restasis, or topical steroids but have had insufficient efficacy or have found these\n             products to be intolerable. If using Restasis or topical steroids, patients must\n             agree to a 30-day washout period prior to the first IP dose (Day 0).\n\n          5. Female patients of child bearing potential must agree to have a urine pregnancy test\n             performed at Screening (must be negative) and agree to use a medically acceptable\n             form of birth control (e.g., intrauterine device, birth control pill, patch or\n             subcutaneous implant, condoms, diaphragm, or abstinence) throughout the duration of\n             IP instillation. Women considered capable of becoming pregnant include all females\n             who have experienced menarche and who have not experienced menopause (as defined by\n             amenorrhea for > 12 consecutive months) or have not undergone successful surgical\n             sterilization (hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy).\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          1.

Artificial tears are allowed\n             during the Screening Phase but must not be used from the first dose (Day 0) through\n             the Treatment Phase.\n\n          4. Use of eye drops of Restasis or topical steroids within 30 days of the first dose\n             (Day 0).\n\n          5. Use of antihistamines, beta blockers, tricyclic antidepressants, or antidepressants\n             with anticholinergic side effects during the Treatment Phase.\n\n          6.

Patients who have had other ocular surgery within 3 months prior to the first dose.\n\n          9. Patients with punctal plugs or punctal cautery < 3 months prior to the first dose.\n\n         10. Patients with severe dry eye due to Stevens-Johnson disease or ocular cicatricial\n             pemphigoid.\n\n         11. History of allergy to human serum protein products and/or any history of allergy to\n             yeast.\n\n         12. History of allergies to recombinant products, ophthalmic solutions, any constituents\n             of RU 101, or any solutions planned for use in this study.\n\n         13. Any significant chronic illness that, in the opinion of the Principal Investigator\n             (PI), could interfere with the study parameters.\n\n         14. Use of any investigational product or device within 30 days prior to the Screening\n             Visit or during the study.\n\n         15. Known history of alcohol and/or drug abuse within the past 12 months, which in the\n             opinion of the PI could interfere with study compliance, outcome measures including\n             safety parameters, and/or the general medical condition of the patient.\n\n         16.
