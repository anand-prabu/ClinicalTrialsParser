Topically administered lubricants are the basis for treatment of this\n      disease. However, information about the corneal residence time of topical lubricants is\n      still sparse, therefore no ideal treatment regimen has been found.\n\n      Recently a new method for assessment of tear film thickness based on optical coherence\n      tomography (OCT) has become available. The aim of the present study is to assess corneal\n      residence time of three different formulations of topical lubricants, in particular Thealoz\n      Duo\u00ae Eye Drops, Hyabak\u00ae Eye Drops and Hydrabak\u00ae Eye Drops in patients with moderate dry eye\n      disease. In addition, standard tests for dry eye syndrome, such as the ocular surface\n      disease index (OSDI\u00a9), Schirmer I test and determination of tear break up time (BUT) will be\n      performed.."
