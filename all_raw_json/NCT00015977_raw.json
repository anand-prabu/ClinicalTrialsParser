Interleukin-12 may kill cancer cells by stopping blood\n      flow to the tumor and by stimulating a person's white blood cells to kill cancer cells.\n      Combining vaccine therapy with interleukin-12 may kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of vaccine therapy combined with\n      interleukin-12 in treating patients who have metastatic prostate cancer that has not\n      responded to hormone therapy."

Treatment repeats every 21 days for 3-9 courses in the absence of disease progression or\n      unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-37 patients will be accrued for this study within 37 weeks."
