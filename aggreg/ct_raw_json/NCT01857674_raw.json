            "textblock": "Definitions:\n\n      Intubation is a traumatism for laryngeal mucous membrane. Due to local inflammatory\n      reaction, laryngeal edema occurs in nearly all intubated patients, but only some of them\n      develop clinical symptoms, as post-extubation stridor or acute respiratory distress. Stridor\n      is commonly defined as a high-pitched sound produced by airflow through a narrowed airway,\n      and accepted as a clinical marker of post-extubation laryngeal edema. The main complication\n      of post-extubation laryngeal edema is reintubation, defining major post-extubation laryngeal\n      edema. Early recognition of laryngeal edema is essential since these patients have the\n      highest risk of evolving to respiratory distress and extubation failure. Even before\n      extubation, signs indicative of laryngeal edema may be present. The search for a test that\n      adequately identifies patients at risk for extubation failure is ongoing.\n\n      Trial Procedures:\n\n        -  At day 0: Selection of patients filling inclusion criteria. Oral and written\n           information of patient and his refer person, and collecting of non-opposition.\n\n        -  At day 0: inclusion of patients ventilated with inspiratory assistance just before\n           schedulded extubation. Information of patient on procedure course.\n\n        -  First ultrasonography of protocol: The patient is in the supine position, with the neck\n           hyper-extended, and the probe is placed on cricothyroid membrane with a transverse view\n           of the larynx.  The standard scanning plane is predetermined: it should contain several\n           landmarks, including the vocal cords, false cords, thyroid cartilage and arytenoids\n           cartilage. The oral and laryngeal secretions are suctioned. Ultrasonic air-leak volume\n           is defined by difference between air-column width cuff inflated and air-column width\n           cuff deflated. Shape of air-column cuff inflated and cuff deflated is also recorded in\n           observation notebook.\n\n        -  Then the patient is extubated after spontaneous ventilation trial, according to unit\n           protocol, by the physician in charge. After extubation, surveillance of post-extubation\n           stridor and acute respiratory distress occurrence during the first 24 hours.\n\n        -  If the patient is reintubated for major post-extubation laryngeal edema, onset of 48\n           hours corticotherapy, and realization of second, third and fourth laryngeal\n           ultrasonography, daily to next schedulded extubation.\n\n        -  At discharge of intensive care unit, data collection about mechanical ventilation\n           duration, intensive care hospitalization duration, occurrence of ventilation-acquired\n           pneumopathy, mortality at 28 days."
