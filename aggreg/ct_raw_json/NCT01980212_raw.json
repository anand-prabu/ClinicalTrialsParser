Blood will be collected\n      before chemotherapy, after every 2 cycles of chemotherapy, every 3 months after all\n      first-line chemotherapy till 2 years, then every 6 months till 3 years, or collect blood\n      till tumor progression, evaluation CT results every time collecting blood samples."
