      BACKGROUND:

      Allergic asthma (AA) is the most commonly encountered respiratory disease in children and
      adults in the United States and is a leading cause of morbidity worldwide. Among the most
      disruptive expressions of disease in AA is acute asthma exacerbation. The CDC lists ambient
      air pollutants and environmental tobacco smoke as among the most common triggers for acute
      asthma exacerbation. Ozone (O3) is the most commonly encountered ambient air pollutant in
      the US. Endotoxin (or lipopolysaccharide or LPS) is a component of bioaerosols found in both
      the indoor and outdoor environment, is a component of tobacco smoke, and is increased in
      indoor settings where smokers live. LPS is also a component of coarse and fine mode particle
      matter air pollution.

      OXIDATIVE STRESS AND ASTHMA:

      Increased oxidative stress and decreased antioxidant capability have been observed in
      asthmatics. These pollutants are pro-inflammatory and are associated with increased
      oxidative stress, which would exacerbate reactive oxygen and reactive nitrogen species (ROS
      and RNS)-induced injury in asthmatics. O3 injures epithelial cells, releasing secondary
      mediators which activate inflammatory cells, in part by ligation of TLR4, the primary
      receptor for LPS. TLR4 activation of inflammatory cells activates NF-kB and induces
      oxidative stress. O3 and LPS has been associated with exacerbation of asthma, and we have
      reported that O3 and LPS augments allergic airway inflammation in allergic asthmatics (AA).
      Development of interventions to mitigate these responses will greatly decrease disease
      morbidity.

      Given the role that oxidants play in the pathophysiology of asthma exacerbation, defects in
      antioxidant levels would increase risk for acute asthma exacerbation. Nutritional
      deficiencies in vitamin E, ascorbate and selenium have been linked to asthma severity, and
      asthmatics have decreased antioxidant levels in airway fluid. We and others have shown that
      vitamins C and E are decreased in airway fluids of asthmatics. Additionally, genetic factors
      may increase risk for oxidant induced exacerbation of asthma. Many investigators have
      reported that persons who are homozygous for the null polymorphism of the
      Glutathione-S-Transferase Mu1 (GSTM1) gene and unable to produce GSTM1 protein (the GSTM1
      null genotype) have increased risk of acute pollutant-induced exacerbation of asthma. We
      have shown in healthy volunteers that the GSTM1 null genotype is associated with increased
      inflammatory response to O3, with no impact on the nociceptive response to this pollutant.
      We have also shown that GSTM1 null volunteers have enhanced airway and systemic inflammation
      following LPS challenge.

      Others have shown that the GSTM1 null genotype is associated with increased response to
      secondhand tobacco smoke, diesel exhaust, and other particulate matter components. Romieu et
      al demonstrated that children with asthma in Mexico City were had increases susceptibility
      to O3-induced exacerbations if they had the GSTM1 null genotype. This group also found that
      GSTM1 null AAs selectively benefited from antioxidant intervention. The GSTM1 null genotype
      is found in 20-40% of the population, and may be overrepresented in allergic populations.
      Taken together, these observations show that the sizable GSTM1 null population is at risk
      for pollutant-induced airway disease, and that antioxidant intervention targeting the action
      of ROS and RNS will benefit asthmatics and especially GSTM1 null asthmatics.

      ANTIOXIDANTS AND ASTHMA:

      A non-exclusive list of proposed antioxidants includes radical scavengers such as ascorbate,
      a-tocopherol (aT), y-tocopherol (yT) or inducers of NRF2, which activate NRF2 with
      subsequent broad upregulation of acute phase II and antioxidant proteins. These agents are
      available in naturally occurring foods and as nutritional supplements. A number of animal,
      cell culture and epidemiological studies support the idea that antioxidant supplementation
      is useful in allergic airway disease. However, despite these studies and widespread public
      and scientific enthusiasm regarding use of such agents in asthmatics, there are scant human
      data to support or refute the use of such interventions for either acute or chronic allergic
      airways disease. It is crucial that adequate, well-designed human studies assess the role of
      antioxidants for allergic asthma to either confirm their efficacy, or refute claims that
      these are effective, safe and low cost interventions for allergic disease.

      GAMMA TOCOPHEROL AND ASTHMA:

      Gamma tocopherol has both radical scavenging and anti-inflammatory actions which may play
      important roles in decreasing pollutant-induced and allergic injury to the airway.

      Like other isoforms of vitamin E, yT is a potent ROS scavenger and is also a powerful
      nucleophile that traps electrophiles such as peroxynitite in lipophilic compartments. One
      mechanism by which y-T is cytoprotective is scavenging of RNS at the un-substituted C-5
      position on the hydroxy-chroman ring of y-T to form 5-NO-y-tocopherol (5-NO-yT). Overall,
      vitamin E provides general protection of DNA, lipids and proteins from radical stress. An
      example of such protection is shown in rodent studies of prostate cancer in which intake of
      yT is associated with decreased DNA methylation of CpG rich regions of the NRF2. NRF2 is a
      master regulator of numerous cytoprotective antioxidant enzymes.

      Supplementation with yT also prevents protein nitration and attenuates loss of plasma
      vitamin C in plasma in a rodent peritonitis model of inflammation. Our group has also shown
      that yT  inhibits COX-2 and 5-LO in LPS-stimulated macrophages and IL-1b stimulated
      epithelial cells. These actions are mediated primarily by the yT metabolite 2, 7,
      8-trimethyl-2S-(.-carboxyethyl)-6-hydroxychroman (y-CEHC) which requires hydroxylation of
      the y-methyl group of yT by cytochrome P450 (CYP450). In carrageenan- induced inflammation
      in male Wistar rats, yT decreases prostaglandin (PGE2) and leukotriene (LTB4) production,
      suggesting that LO-mediated production of leukotrienes may also be inhibited by yT.
      Tocopherols, including yT, also modulate gene expression of a number of inflammatory genes.
      Thus, yT and other tocopherols decrease production of a number of pro-inflammatory cytokines
      at the transcriptional level.

      In animals, we have also shown that gamma tocopherol reduces baseline eosinophilia in the
      airway. In our early phase I studies of gamma tocopherol-enriched mixed tocopherols (gT-mT)
      we have shown that gT-mT inhibits monocyte induced cytokine production, decreases baseline
      nitrosative stress, and inhibits LPS eosinophil and neutrophil influx in healthy volunteers.

      SUMMARY:

      There is widespread opinion that antioxidant nutrients like gamma tocopherol ( yT, a form of
      Vitamin E) are an untapped and inexpensive intervention for environmentally triggered acute
      asthma. However, there is a crucial gap in evidence-based support of such interventions in
      asthma. A lack of coordinated research assessing specific antioxidant regimens from
      preclinical, phase I and phase II studies impedes development of phase III antioxidant
      trials in asthmatic populations. It is also unclear which physiological endpoints are most
      relevant in such studies. This project focuses on phase II studies of yT in AA based on our
      preclinical and phase I studies. For this protocol we will be testing the hypothesis that a
      gamma tocopherol supplement will baseline eosinophil numbers in airway sputa of asthmatcs
      (specific aims 1) and (specific aim 2) inhibit LPS induced airway inflammation in mild
      allergic asthmatics.

      The investigators will also do an exploratory assessment of the specific impact of the GSTM1
      null genotype on response to LPS and effect of gamma tocopherol enriched supplementation on
      this response.

      If gamma tocopherol decreases LPS-induced respones in asthmatics, this would provide proof
      of concept that this agent would be a useful intervention for asthma, confirming teh need
      for a phase III study of gamma tocopherol enriched supplements as a treatment for asthma.
