This affirms the extreme need for alternate and/or adjunct\n      therapies. Although convincing data from animal studies and a few adult human studies on the\n      benefits of a natural product, N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), in a variety of liver conditions\n      including NAFLD have emerged, studies in children are scarce. Therefore, the aim of the\n      study is to test the use NAC as an innovative approach to attenuate the progression of NAFD\n      in obese children. The central hypothesis is that NAC supplementation will reduce liver fat\n      and liver enzymes and ameliorate risk factors of cardiometabolic disease in children with\n      NAFLD."

Although few promising\n      approaches have been reported, the benefits are incongruent and mostly marginal. N-acetyl\n      cysteine (NAC), a derivative of the natural amino acid, cysteine, appears to be promising as\n      an adjunct therapy to PA. Animal and a few adult human studies suggest NAC-induced\n      attenuation of liver abnormalities, oxidative stress, insulin resistance and inflammation.\n      The primary aim of the proposal is to determine in obese children with elevated liver\n      enzymes the effect of NAC at two different doses on liver fat using magnetic resonance\n      imaging (MRI), liver enzymes and risk factors of cardiometabolic disease. We hypothesize\n      that NAC will produce beneficial effect on these parameters."
