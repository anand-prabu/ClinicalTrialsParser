The study also aims to build a collaborative\n      partnership between the US and Mexico research teams. The Bi-National QUIT Study will\n      conduct a randomized control trial for risky drug use in several Los Angeles area community\n      health centers. The intent of the trial is to interrupt the progression to addiction for the\n      casual and occasional users of illicit drugs and non-medical users of pharmaceuticals. The\n      Bi-National QUIT protocol will include (1) a computerized assessment of the patient's\n      drug-use history (2) very brief (<5 minutes) clinician advice during a patients pre-arranged\n      medical visit which will be preceded by a computerized assessment of the patient's drug-use\n      history (3) a post visit assessment and video doctor (repeating the very brief clinician\n      advice) in the waiting room (4) two post-visit telephone drug-use counseling sessions to be\n      conducted by drug-health educators at approximately 2 and 6 weeks after the start of the\n      intervention. Follow-up assessments will be conducted at 3 months post-randomization.\n      Parallel activities will take place in the U.S./Los Angeles sites and Mexico/Tijuana sites.\n      Data will be shared between both teams. Data analysis will be collaboratively conducted by\n      both teams."
