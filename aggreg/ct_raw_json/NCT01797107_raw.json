Secondary outcome measures will be a global symptom score, tear film\n      break up time, meibomian gland secretion characteristics, best-corrected distance visual\n      acuity, corneal staining, axial topography based astigmatism patterns, and IOL Master\n      keratometry.\n\n      We will enroll 60 eyes of 30 patients, and each patient will be randomly assigned to receive\n      Azasite in one eye and vehicle (Durasite\u00ae) in the fellow eye."
