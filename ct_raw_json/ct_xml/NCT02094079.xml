      monitoring the patients every 4. week during pregnancy to keep the thyroid function
      parameters within the recommended range?

      A retrospective study of  consecutive pregnant women with hypothyroidism followed at the
      outpatient clinic at the Endocrinology Unit, Herlev Hospital, Denmark during 2012. Patients
      selected through electronic medical system. Blood tests for the The hormone levels  drawn
