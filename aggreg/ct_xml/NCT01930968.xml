  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis is that microbubbles may be used as a contrast agent to help image tumors in
      the eye. In this study, patients with eye melanoma who are going to have their eye removed,
      will have their eye imaged by ultrasound (sound waves) before and after intravenous
      injection of microbubbles. The pathology characteristics of the tumor in the removed eye
      will be compared with the images.

      We plan to enroll and image 10 patients with intraocular tumors who are going to undergo
      enucleation of their eye for the tumor. Definity®, a perflutren containing microsphere
      manufactured by Lantheus Medical Imaging, Inc., is commercially available and FDA approved
      for cardiac imaging. It is contraindicated for use in patients with pulmonary hypertension,
      unstable cardiopulmonary conditions, and cardiac shunts (right-to-left, bi-directional, or
      transient right-to left).  After informed consent is obtained, a cardiologist  will examine
      the patient's history, perform lung and heart auscultation, and obtain a blood pressure in
      order to ensure the patient has no contraindications to using Definity®. If there are no
      contraindications, routine ocular ultrasonography, both A and B scans, will be performed in
      the 3rd floor ultrasound suite at the Emory Eye Center using an Ellex Eye Cubed ultrasound
      machine. Definity® will be prepared per package instructions. A physician will obtain the
      patient's weight and calculate the dose according to the following formula:

        -  Patient weight (kg) X 10 microliters = Definity® dose

        -  If necessary, a second 10 microliter/kg dose may be give 30 minutes after the first IV
           injection A bubble test (intravenous small amount of Definity injected with cardiac
           echo) will be performed in the cardiology imaging suite, clinical building A, in order
           to ensure that the patient does not have a right to left shunt. After that, Definity®
           will be administered as a slow IV bolus followed by a normal saline 10cc flush. The
           ultrasonographer will continue the ocular B scan during administration of Definity®.
           Vital signs will be obtained  and documented at 30 minutes after administration of the
           last dose of Definity® and as the patient's condition warrants.
