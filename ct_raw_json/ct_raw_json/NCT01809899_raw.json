The investigators intend to examine trauma\n      history, cognitive, interpersonal, and genetic predictors of participants' unfavorable\n      reaction to participation in research involving trauma-related script-driven imagery (SDI).\n      The design includes comparing participants in a consent as usual group to participants in an\n      enhanced consent group to see which minimizes unfavorable effects of participating in a\n      research provocation study. In addition, the two different consent groups will be assessed\n      for their effects on psychobiological and neurobiological stress response. Furthermore, the\n      investigators will examine the relationship between the psychobiological responses and\n      neural mechanism during SDI, and unfavorable reactions to participation in symptom\n      provocation research."
