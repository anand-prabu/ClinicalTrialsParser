These findings suggest\n      a possible association between growth hormone deficiency (GHD) and the ageing process.GH\n      replacement is well known to improve body composition, leading to a decrease in total body\n      fat and an increase in lean body mass. However, GH replacement has only shown an effect on\n      muscle strength in GH-deficient adults subjected to long-term GH therapy. Few studies have\n      evaluated the effect of GH replacement on muscle strength in elderly people engaged in a\n      program of exercise training.Our purpose is to evaluate the effect of GH therapy on muscle\n      strength in healthy, non-sedentary men over 50 years old."

To determine the load associated with 10 MR, each subject can initially performed 10 repetitions of each exercise with a sub maximum load, which is considered a load that was possible to mobilise. Then, the loads are progressively increased and with a maximum of 3 trials, the load of 10 MR is reached. During the 10 MR test, a 2-5 minute interval is provided between the attempts of each exercise. After the load was obtained for a determined exercise, intervals not less than 10 minutes were given before moving on to the next exercise.",
