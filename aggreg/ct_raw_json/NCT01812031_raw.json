            "textblock": "Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) is now widely used for cancer\n      imaging purpose, notably for preoperative work-up. It aims at visualizing organs metabolism.\n      In case of cancer, metabolism is, classically, increased and some hot spots are visible on\n      PET images. Because of respiratory motion some lung tumours (especially the smallest ones)\n      can be falsely interpreted by the clinician.\n\n      The investigators developed a respiratory-gated PET method in order to reduce the motion\n      issue. The investigators designed a study to investigate its effect on lung cancer (primary\n      or metastasis) to check if it improves the sensitivity/specificity of PET imaging of the\n      lungs.\n\n      To that aim, patients presenting a lung nodule on a CT examination can be proposed to\n      participate this study. After the standard PET acquisition (acquired in free-breathing), an\n      additional 10 minutes respiratory-gated PET acquisition is performed without additional\n      injection. After that, a breath-hold (~10s) CT is performed."
