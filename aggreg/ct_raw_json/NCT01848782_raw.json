Participants will be invited to\n      participate in an online survey.\n\n      Participants: Eligible participants are corresponding authors of clinical trials published\n      between 2010 and 2012 and referenced in Medline.\n\n      Intervention: The investigators will evaluate the impact of the presence of a \" limitations\n      \" section in abstract of systematic review with meta- analysis. The investigators selected\n      abstracts of meta-analysis from a sample.\n\n      Selected abstract will be standardised and the treatment's name hidden. Two groups of\n      abstract will be presented as follow: 1) abstract without \" limitations \" section 2)\n      abstract with \" limitations \" section. The \" limitations \" section will be written by\n      authors and will briefly describe the risk of bias of included studies.\n\n      Selected participant are invited by e-mail to answer the survey. After reading one abstract\n      from his/her group of randomisation they are invited to answer 5 questions about their\n      interpretation of the results."
