      This study will evaluate the efficacy of duloxetine in reducing depressive symptoms,

      This study is a 12-week open trial to assess the efficacy of duloxetine (Cymbalta) for the
      treatment of Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) symptoms and comorbid Major Depressive Disorder
      (MDD).

      Participants will visit the clinic 8 times to meet with the psychiatrist.  They will receive
      duloxetine to see if it helps their major depression and Irritable Bowel symptoms.  Upon
      study completion at 12 weeks, they will receive an additional 3 months of free medication
      treatment at our clinic.
