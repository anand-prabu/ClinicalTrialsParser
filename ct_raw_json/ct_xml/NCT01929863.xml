  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Metformin may have complex interactions in the gut and is generally first line therapy for
      type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). It is important to understand whether there are significant
      pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions when GSK2330672 is co-administered with
      metformin in subjects with T2DM. The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety and
      tolerability of GSK2330672 administered for 7 days to subjects with T2DM taking metformin.
      This will be a two-period crossover study; subjects will receive either GSK2330672 or
      placebo for 7 days in each period separated by a washout period of 13 to 15 days. All
      subjects will receive metformin throughout the study

             twice daily (BID) (or the equivalent of 1700 mg/day) for at least 4 weeks prior to
             screening and a glycosolated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) of &gt;=7.0% to &lt;=11% at screening;
             OR taking stable metformin of &gt;=1000 mg/day to &lt;1700 mg/day for at least 4 weeks
             prior to screening and a HbA1c of &gt;=7.5% to &lt;=11% at Screening; OR taking stable
             metformin of &gt;1700 to &lt;=2000 mg/day for at least 4 weeks prior to screening and a
             HbA1c of &gt;=7.0% to &lt;=10% at screening; not taking other anti-diabetic medications.

          -  All T2DM subjects must meet label recommendations for metformin, including: Adequate
             renal function, as evidenced by the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease estimate of
             glomerular filtration rate &gt;=60 milliliters (mL)/minute (min); No conditions which
             make hypoxia, dehydration, or sepsis likely; No clinical or laboratory evidence of
             hepatic disease (including history of cholecystitis or symptomatic gallstones) and
             cardiac disease (including a history of myocardial infarction or heart failure).
             Subjects with a history of cholelithiasis and uncomplicated cholecystectomy more than
             3 months before screening may be eligible if approved by the GlaxoSmithKline (GSK)
             Medical Monitor; No excessive alcohol intake.

          -  C-peptide of &gt;0.8 nanogram (ng)/mL at screening visit.

          -  Urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio &lt;30 mg/gram (g).

          -  Fasting plasma glucose &lt;280 mg/decilitre (dL)

          -  Body mass index (BMI) of 24 to 40 kilograms (kg)/square meter (m^2), inclusive

          -  In good general health with (in the opinion of the investigator) no clinically
             significant and relevant abnormalities of medical history or physical examination
             that would introduce additional risk factors or interfere with study procedures or
             objectives, based on a medical evaluation including medical history, physical
             examination, vital signs and laboratory tests.

          -  Female subjects of non-childbearing potential. Non-childbearing potential is defined
             as: Pre-menopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy [for this
             definition, &quot;documented&quot; refers to the outcome of the investigator's/designee's
             review of the subject's medical history for study eligibility, as obtained via a
             verbal interview with the subject or from the subject's medical records].
             Postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea. In questionable cases
             a blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt; 40 milli
             international units (MIU)/mL and estradiol &lt; 40 picograms (pg)/mL (&lt;147 picomole
             [pmol]/liter [L]) is confirmatory.  Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and
             whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the acceptable
             contraception methods if they wish to continue their HRT during the study.
             Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of post-menopausal status
             prior to study enrollment.  For most forms of HRT, at least 2 to 4 weeks will elapse
             between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends on the
             type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their post-menopausal status, they
             can resume use of HRT during the study without use of a contraceptive method.

          -  Male subjects with female partners of child-bearing potential must agree to use one
             of the acceptable contraception methods.  This criterion must be followed from the
             time of the first dose of study medication until follow up visit.

          -  Capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the
             requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  CRITERIA BASED UPON MEDICAL HISTORIES:

             be obtained for subjects with a past history of pancreatitis more than 12 months from
             the start of the treatment period (subjects with a history of pancreatitis within 12
             months prior to the start of the treatment period are excluded).

          -  History of gastrointestinal (GI) disease (e.g., irritable bowel disease, chronic or
             current diarrhea, inflamed bowel, steatorrhoea/fat malabsorption, celiac disease,
             symptomatic lactose intolerance). Subjects with gastroparesis requiring treatment are
             excluded.

          -  History of significant cardiovascular disease including acute myocardial infarction,
             stroke, hospitalization for acute coronary syndrome, heart failure within the
             previous 12 months.

             red blood cells count and/or haemoglobin level).

          -  Current or relevant previous significant medical disorder that may require treatment
             or make the subject unlikely to fully complete the study, or any condition that, in
             the opinion of the investigator, presents undue risk from the study medication or
             procedures.

          -  Thyroid Disease: Uncorrected Thyroid Dysfunction:  Fasting plasma thyroid stimulating
             hormone (TSH) outside of the normal range, as determined at the screening visit;

          -  Alanine transaminase, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin &gt; 1.5x upper limit of normal
             (ULN) (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and
             direct bilirubin &lt;35%).
