Patients are stratified according to ECOG performance\n      status (0 vs 1 or 2), and prior radiotherapy (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to 1 of 3\n      treatment arms.\n\n      Arm I:  Patients receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes and oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours\n      on day 1.  Patients also receive leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours and fluorouracil (5-FU)\n      IV over 22 hours on days 1 and 2.\n\n      Arm II:  Patients receive oxaliplatin, leucovorin calcium, and 5-FU as in arm I.\n\n      Arm III:  Patients receive bevacizumab as in arm I. (Arm closed to accrual as of\n      03/11/2003).\n\n      Courses in all arms repeat every 2 weeks in the absence of disease progression or\n      unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve a complete response may receive 2 additional\n      courses.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then\n      annually thereafter."
