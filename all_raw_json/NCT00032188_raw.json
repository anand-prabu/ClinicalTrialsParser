Determine the objective response rate in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma\n      treated with interleukin-2 (IL-2) and bryostatin 1.\n\n      II. Compare the toxicity of 3 different doses of bryostatin 1 given in combination with a\n      fixed dose of IL-2 in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to one of three\n      dose levels of bryostatin 1.\n\n      ARM I: Patients receive interleukin-2 (IL-2) subcutaneously on days 1-4, 8-11, and 15-18.\n      For the second and subsequent courses of IL-2, patients also receive lowest dose bryostatin\n      1 IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for at least 3\n      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      ARM II: Patients receive IL-2 as in arm I and middle dose bryostatin 1 IV over 1 hour on\n      days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for at least 3 courses in the absence of\n      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      ARM III: Patients receive IL-2 as in arm I and highest dose bryostatin 1 IV over 1 hour on\n      days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for at least 3 courses in the absence of\n      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Patients with stable or responding disease may receive 3 additional courses of therapy. An\n      additional cohort of patients receives treatment as above at a higher dose to evaluate\n      toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed for 1 year.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24-65 patients (8-16 per bryostatin 1 dose level) will be\n      accrued for this study within 14-27 months."
