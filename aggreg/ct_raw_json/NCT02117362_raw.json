Galectins are a family of proteins that have numerous functions in normal\n      mammalian biology including the facilitation of cell-cell interactions, regulation of\n      cell-death and regulation of immune system responses.  The hypothesis is that a safe dose of\n      GR-MD-02 when given with the FDA-approved dose of ipilimumab can be found."
