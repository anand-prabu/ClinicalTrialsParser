Patients are stratified according to\n      disease stage (unresectable nonmetastatic vs metastatic). Patients are randomized to one of\n      two treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes once weekly on weeks 1-7 for the\n           first course only. Beginning on week 9, patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes\n           once weekly for 3 weeks. Treatment then repeats every 4 weeks for up to 6 months in the\n           absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive gemcitabine as in arm I and dalteparin subcutaneously once\n           daily for 6 months in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Quality of life is assessed at baseline and every 4 weeks during study therapy.\n\n      Patients are followed every 4 weeks.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 400 patients (200 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this\n      study within 40 months."
