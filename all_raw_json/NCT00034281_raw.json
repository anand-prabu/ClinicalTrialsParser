            "textblock": "The human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is a member of the Type 1 family of\n      growth factor tyrosine kinases. HER2 forms hetero- and homo-dimers with other members of\n      this family of tyrosine kinases. As a result of dimerization at the cell surface,\n      intracellular signal transduction is initiated, resulting in cell proliferation.\n\n      HER2 expression has been observed in a variety of human tumors including breast cancer,\n      non-small cell lung cancer, prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer, renal cell cancer, and\n      ovarian cancer. HER2 overexpression is associated with clinically more aggressive breast\n      cancer, and is an independent predictor of poor prognosis in patients with breast cancer.\n\n      TAK-165 is an active and selective inhibitor of tyrosine kinase activity of HER2 being\n      developed for patients with lower levels of HER2 expression. This study will seek to\n      determine the safety, tolerability, maximum tolerated dose and pharmacokinetics of  TAK-165\n      administered to subjects with tumors known to express HER2.\n\n      The total duration of the study will be at minimum 8 weeks, or 56 Days. Subjects without\n      progressive disease after 8 weeks may continue to receive study drug, provided that they do\n      not meet criteria for withdrawal."
