  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hearing loss is the second most prevalent service-connected disability among Veterans.
      Hearing aids are the most common technological intervention for hearing loss. The VA,
      therefore, spends a considerable amount of money on them. Despite these expenditures, there
      are some Veterans who do not use their hearing aids successfully. Research has demonstrated
      that this inconsistent use may be related to a patient's inability to effectively take care
      of, and use, hearing aids. The proposed investigation will compare the effectiveness of
      three different tools for enhancing the educational efforts (hearing-aid orientation)
      typically provided by clinical audiologists when dispensing hearing aids. Each of these
      educational tools were developed using established methods for improving patient-provider
      communication. We hypothesize that the use of these tools will result in better hearing-aid
      outcomes for our Veteran patients than using the current standard-of-care procedures.

    <textblock>
      Objectives: Reasons for non-use of hearing aids are varied, but many studies have suggested
      that a lack of knowledge about how to use and/or take care of the hearing aids is a major
      factor. This is not surprising given that other healthcare fields have reported that between
      40-80% of information provided during a clinical appointment is forgotten by the patient
      immediately after the appointment and almost half of what is remembered is not correct. The
      long-term goal of this project is to improve the delivery of information during the
      hearing-aid orientation, as better delivery of information will result in better hearing-aid
      handling skills and thus better overall hearing-aid outcomes. To accomplish this goal, we
      propose to refine and evaluate the effectiveness of three forms of supplemental
      hearing-aid-orientation tools, each of which was developed using established guidelines for
      good patient-provider communication

      Plan: The purpose of the proposed application is to evaluate the relative effectiveness of
      four forms of hearing-aid orientation provided to first time hearing-aid users, three of
      which use some of the aforementioned strategies to enhance the standard of care. The four
      forms of orientation will be: (1) the standard-of-care hearing-aid orientation; (2) the
      standard of care plus provision a one-page hearing-aid information guide (HAIG) (3) the
      standard of care supplemented by an explanation of its content using the talk-back technique
      to confirm patient understanding; and (4) the standard of care plus provision of a take-home
      hearing-aid orientation DVD (HAO DVD). The content of the HAIG will be field tested and
      finalized following input obtained via focus groups with clinical audiologists and
      first-time hearing aid users.

      Methods: For the field testing up to 16 clinical audiologists and 10 new hearing aid user
      Veterans will be recruited to participate in focus groups during which they will view and
      then be asked questions about the content of the HAIG. Information learned during these
      focus groups will then be incorporated into the HAIG , at which time they will be ready for
      use in the study. For the comparative effectiveness study, up to 468 hearing-impaired
      Veterans who are about to become first-time hearing-aid users will be enrolled to
      participate in this investigation. These individuals will be recruited from the Portland VA
      Medical Center's Audiology and Speech Pathology Service (ASPS). Prior to receiving their
      hearing aids, subjects will be enrolled in the study at the National Center for
      Rehabilitative Auditory Research (NCRAR), and will conduct health literacy, manual dexterity
      and hepatic sensitivity, visual acuity, and learning and memory assessments. They will then
      attend their hearing aid fitting in the ASPS and will receive standard-of-care hearing-aid
      orientation. At the end of that appointment, they will be assigned to one of the four arms
      of the study described above and receive that intervention. Subjects will return to the
      NCRAR 4-6 weeks after the hearing-aid-fitting appointment to complete the following outcome
      measures: a knowledge test and a practical test regarding hearing-aid use and care, a
      measure of self-efficacy, and a measure of hearing-aid outcomes. They also will be
      interviewed so that we can learn their opinions about the intervention. A subset of the
      initial 50 participants enrolled into each study arm will attend a second follow-up
      appointment 6 months after the fitting appointment so we can examine longer-term impacts of
      the hearing aid orientation interventions.
