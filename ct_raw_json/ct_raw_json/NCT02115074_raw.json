Unlike other sites, many of these tumors are not amenable to complete\n      resection either because of anatomical location, and sometimes they only can be biopsied. A\n      substantial number of children will have recurrences following resection or will experience\n      progression following incomplete tumor removal or biopsy.\n\n      Celebrex is a Cox-2 inhibitor with anti-angiogenic and anti-tumor properties, while statins\n      are known to increase the sensitivity of gliomas to anti-tumor agents. Their association\n      could be administered for long periods, in the hope of much reduced risk of toxicities.\n\n      This is a national, multicentric, interventional,  open-label, non-comparative, and\n      non-randomized phase I study evaluating the maximum tolerated dose of the Fluvastatin in\n      combination with fixed-dose of Celebrex.\n\n      This project involves 10 SFCE health centers accustomed to phase I / II studies(Soci\u00e9t\u00e9\n      Fran\u00e7aise de Lutte contre les Cancers et Leuc\u00e9mies de l'Enfant et de l'Adolescent - French\n      Society for the Fight against Cancer and Leukemia in Children and Adolescents)."
