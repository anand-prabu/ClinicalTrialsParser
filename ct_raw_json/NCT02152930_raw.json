Etiologic factors are similar to those of cardiovascular disease.\n      Primary treatment consists of cardiovascular risk management and improvement of functional\n      capacity with supervised exercise therapy (SET). A potential additional therapy is the\n      administration of fish oil supplements containing high amounts of omega-3 Poly Unsaturated\n      Fatty Acids (PUFAs). In earlier clinical and experimental trials omega-3 PUFA's improved\n      hemorheological parameters such as erythrocyte deformability and aggregation, and a number\n      of cardiovascular risk factors. Hemorheological parameters determine the blood flow in the\n      microcirculation, which is of main importance in patients with IC since the macrocirculation\n      is compromised. Inflammation is considered an important etiologic factor in the pathogenesis\n      of atherosclerosis and contributes to peripheral arterial disease Since omega-3 PUFAs also\n      have a strong anti-inflammatory effect, they might be effective in patients with IC by\n      lowering the inflammatory response. In addition, visceral fat rather than obesity in general\n      has been recognised as an etiologic and prognostic factor in atherosclerosis.\n\n      We hypothesise that the administration of omega-3 PUFA's in patients with IC has a\n      synergistic effect with SET and improves walking distance after SET, by improving\n      hemorheological parameters resulting in a better microcirculation. Second, we hypothesise\n      that omega-3 PUFA's result in a less proinflammatory of whole blood in response to ex vivo\n      stimulation with endotoxin. Third, we hypothesise that omega-3 PUFA's and SET result in a\n      decrease in visceral fat mass."}, "overall_status": "Not yet recruiting", "start_date": "June 2014", "completion_date": {"@type": "Anticipated", "#text": "December 2015"}, "primary_completion_date": {"@type": "Anticipated", "#text": "December 2015"}, "phase": "Phase 3", "study_type": "Interventional", "study_design": "Allocation: Randomized, Endpoint Classification: Efficacy Study, Intervention Model: Parallel Assignment, Masking: Open Label, Primary Purpose: Treatment", "primary_outcome": {"measure": "Maximal walking distance with standardised treadmill test", "time_frame": "After 12 weeks of supervised exercise therapy", "safety_issue": "No"}, "secondary_outcome": [{"measure": "Hemorheological parameters", "time_frame": "After 12 weeks of supervised exercise therapy", "safety_issue": "No"}, {"measure": "Visceral fat mass", "time_frame": "After 12 weeks of supervised exercise therapy", "safety_issue": "No"}, {"measure": "Ex vivo cytokine production after stimulation with lipopolysaccharide", "time_frame": "After 12 weeks of supervised exercise therapy", "safety_issue": "No"}, {"measure": "Assessment of the microcirculation with side stream dark field technology", "time_frame": "After 12 weeks of supervised exercise therapy", "safety_issue": "No"}], "other_outcome": {"measure": "Bloodpressure, heart rate, cholesterol, triglycerides, hemoglobin, leucocytes, C-reactive protein, ankle brachial index,", "time_frame": "After 12 weeks of supervised exercise therapy", "safety_issue": "No"}, "number_of_arms": "2", "enrollment": {"@type": "Anticipated", "#text": "136"}, "condition": "Intermittent Claudication", "arm_group": [{"arm_group_label": "Supervised Exercise Therapy", "arm_group_type": "Active Comparator", "description": "Standard treatment: Supervised Exercise Therapy during 12 weeks"}, {"arm_group_label": "Controlled group", "arm_group_type": "No Intervention"}], "intervention": {"intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "Omega-3 fatty acids", "description": "1000 mg of omega-3 fatty acid ethylesters, 2 times daily, for 4 weeks, followed by 12 weeks of supervised exercise therapy in combination with 2 times daily omega-3 fatty acid supplementation.", "arm_group_label": "Supervised Exercise Therapy", "other_name": "Fish oil supplements"}, "eligibility": {"criteria": {"textblock": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  Age \u2265 18\n\n          -  Newly diagnosed intermittent claudication\n\n          -  Ankle Brachial Index < 0.8 at rest or > 0.15 decrease after exercise\n\n          -  Able to perform standardised treadmill walking test for 2 min\n\n          -  Written informed consent\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  Unable to fill out a questionnaire (cognitive impairment or insufficient knowledge of\n             the Dutch language)\n\n          -  Heart failure or unstable cardiac status (angina pectoris class III or IV or recent\n             myocardial infarction < 3 months)\n\n          -  Any illness with rapid evolution or a life expectancy < 3 months\n\n          -  Recent cerebrovascular accident (< 3 months)\n\n          -  Current use of fish oil supplements or > 2 times a week dietary fish\n\n          -  Pregnancy\n\n          -  Fish, soybean or peanut allergy\n\n          -  Contra indications for the use of omega-3 fatty acids\n\n          -  Use of oral anticoagulants (coumarin derivatives)"}, "gender": "Both", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No"}, "overall_official": {"last_name": "Alexander P.J.
