Airway\n      wall thickness is evaluated in high resolution computed tomography (HRCT), endobronchial\n      ultrasound (EBUS) and basement membrane thickness (BMT) in biopsy specimens.\n\n      We plan to compare airway inflammation and features of airway remodeling in asthma and COPD\n      patients."
