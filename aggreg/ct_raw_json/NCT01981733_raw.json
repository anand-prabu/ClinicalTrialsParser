            "textblock": "The THRIVE-1 study will examine novel methods for enhancing blood flow in the lower limb\n      using electrical stimulation. Increases in lower limb blood flow improve venous return and\n      thereby reduce venous stasis. Since stasis is one of the compounding factors in the\n      development of deep vein thrombosis, the risk of developing thrombosis should theoretically\n      be proportionally reduced. This technique may prove to be a useful tool in preventing and\n      reducing the incidence of deep vein thrombosis in both medical and surgical patients\n      together with passengers undertaking significant duration travel (as travel - related deep\n      vein thrombosis is not exclusively related to flying)."
