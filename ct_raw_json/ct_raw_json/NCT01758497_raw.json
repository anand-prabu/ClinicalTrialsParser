Eligible patients were adults, ASA physical status I-III,\n      and BMI <30) with no contraindication to study procedures. In the PACU, all patients\n      received morphine sulfate IVPCA; patients reporting pain > 3 on the NRS-11 despite IVPCA\n      were randomized by the method of sealed envelopes to receive US guided injections of 30ml\n      0.5% ropivacaine (FICB) or 30ml 0.9% NaCl (sham block, SB) beneath the fascia iliaca.\n\n      The primary outcome variable was opioid analgesic consumption during the first 24 h\n      postoperatively.
