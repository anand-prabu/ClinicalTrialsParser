  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesize that successfully treating maternal Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder
      (ADHD) will have a beneficial effect that extends to the child.  We believe that
      multi-component interventions combining maternal stimulant medication, Lisdexamfetamine
      (LDX), and Behavioral Parent Training (BPT) will improve parenting, maternal, and child
      outcomes.  In terms of improved parenting, we hypothesize that some mothers may respond well
      to LDX or BPT alone and therefore may not require multi-modal treatment, whereas others may
      benefit most from multi-modal treatment

      The overarching goal of this study is to construct and evaluate an adaptive intervention
      (i.e., an individualized treatment protocol that is adjusted based on the child-mother
      dyad's initial response to treatment) to improve the trajectory of ADHD outcomes in at-risk
      children.  Our primary outcome measure for the child will be whether child ADHD symptoms on
      the Conners Parent and Teacher Rating Scales decreased at the completion of the study.  Our
      secondary outcome measure will be whether there was a need for medication for the child over
      the course of the study. The primary outcome for the mother will be the Conners Adult ADHD
      Rating Scale (CAARS) Attention Scale and the Clinical Global Impression-Severity scale
      (CGI-S).
