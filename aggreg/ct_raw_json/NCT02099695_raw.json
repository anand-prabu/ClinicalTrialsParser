It affects both sexes similarly and in all age groups, varying only the starting\n      age of symptoms according to the most affected part of the body:\n\n      childhood - plantar and palmar hyperhidrosis adolescence - axillary  hyperhidrosis adult -\n      craniofacial hyperhidrosis\n\n      There is a family history associated with between 12.5% and 56.5% of the participants,\n      according to epidemiological studies.\n\n      Initially the subjects will be evaluated on the inclusion and exclusion criteria through\n      screening and safety tests such as blood tests , ECG and tonometry, to confirm enrollment.\n\n      When included will be randomized into the corresponding study arm to start study treatment.\n\n      During the period of the study it will evaluate the efficacy parameters of the drug.\n\n      The treatment for each subject will be about 8 weeks. The inclusion period is foreseen for 6\n      months and may be extended or decreased according to the pace of inclusion.\n\n      The data are summarized according to the study group (per dose and per visit, if applicable)\n      through appropriate descriptive statistics to the variable type. Frequency and percentage\n      will be used for the variables.\n\n      The Adverse Events (AE) will be analyzed based on questioning by the investigators in\n      relation to the AE experienced by the subjects. The orientation will be to the subject to\n      note the symptom, the date and time that the event appeared."
