The study will include\n      150 subjects treated with the Treovance Stent-Graft at a maximum of 30 investigational\n      sites. There will be no prospective control group. Subjects diagnosed with infrarenal\n      abdominal aortic aneurysms enrolled in the trial will be treated with the Treovance\n      Stent-Graft with Navitel Delivery System. Pre-procedure baseline data will be gathered, as\n      well as post-procedure assessments prior to hospital discharge and 30 days, 6 months, and 12\n      months post-implantation. In addition, annual follow-up visits out to 5 years will be\n      conducted.\n\n      The primary goal of this study is to gather safety and effectiveness data on the Treovance\n      device.  A maximum of 150 endovascular subjects will be required to fulfill the U.S. Phase\n      II requirements.  The data from this study will be submitted to the FDA and used to support\n      approval in the U.S.\n\n      There are two primary objectives, efficacy and safety of the Treovance Stent-Graft in\n      subjects with infrarenal aortic aneurysms:\n\n        -  Primary Efficacy will be evaluated by successful aneurysm treatment 12 months\n           post-implant\n\n        -  Primary Safety will be assessed by composite major adverse event (MAE) rate at 30-days\n\n      Secondary objectives involve assessment of major device-related events and major morbidity."
