In a\n      randomized control trial, the primary aim of this study is to test the initial efficacy of a\n      program of enhanced home visitation with neighborhood and community support to change\n      maternal behaviors related to infant nutrition (sweetened beverage/juice consumption,\n      breastfeeding and introduction of solids), parenting skills (establishing routines around\n      sleep, reading cues for hunger, satiety, television time) and family wellness (improving the\n      home food environment, enhancing physical activity).  The investigators hypothesize that at\n      12 months of age, infants in the intervention arm will drink less sugar sweetened\n      beverages/juices, will have ingested solids at an older age, will have been breastfed longer\n      and more exclusively than infants in the control arm and will have less TV viewing, more\n      established sleep routines and greater soothability (primary outcomes)."
