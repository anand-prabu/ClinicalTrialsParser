    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to measure nicotine cue- and withdrawal-induced craving in current
      smokers under four distinct conditions: after smoking a conventional cigarette, an
      electronic cigarette (e-Cigarette) containing nicotine, an e-Cigarette without nicotine, and
      after taking a nicotine lozenge. Participants will be asked to attend four morning study
      visits after overnight smoking abstinence. Standardized questionnaires will be used to
      assess changes under each condition, allowing for the investigation of the efficacy of
      e-Cigarettes in reducing craving by replacing the behavioral component of smoking with
      minimal risk of adverse effects.

    <textblock>
      Many addiction models postulate stimuli to be linked with nicotine intake and reward after
      prolonged use. As such, smoking becomes more heavily based in habit, initiated by cues.
      Craving has been found to be a crucial component of continued smoking and relapse in
      response to various environmental and behavioral cues. Electronic Cigarettes (e-Cigarettes)
      are new smoking products emerging in consumer markets that often mimic conventional tobacco
      cigarettes. E-Cigarettes commonly include a cartridge, a heating element, a puff sensor, and
      a battery. When a user draws on the device, the heating element is activated and the
      cartridge fluid is vaporized. Users then inhale the aerosol containing droplets of the
      vaporized fluid. This study will empirically assess the efficacy of e-Cigarettes in
      alleviating craving by replacing the behavioral component of smoking. Using standardized
      questionnaires, intra-subject changes in cue- and withdrawal-induced craving after smoking
      an e-Cigarette without nicotine will be compared with that after either smoking a
      conventional cigarette, an e-Cigarette with nicotine, or taking a 4mg lozenge.
