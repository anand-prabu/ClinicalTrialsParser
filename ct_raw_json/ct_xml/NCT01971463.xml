    <textblock>
      This study is a non-randomized, Phase 2 clinical trial designed to assess optical cerebral
      blood flow (CBF) response to bolus normal saline.  Subjects will have had an ischemic stroke
      within 96 hours of enrollment.  The study intervention will be a one hour monitoring
      session.  There will be a 15 minute baseline measurement period, followed by intravenous
      administration of 500cc of 0.9% NaCl over 30 minutes, and finally 15 minutes of monitoring
      post-bolus. All study measurements will cease after 1 hour.  Subjects will be followed
      during their hospitalization for 7 days or until discharge, whichever is sooner, to monitor
      for adverse events and to collect clinical information.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age â‰¥ 18 years

          -  Acute ischemic stroke in the territory of the anterior, middle, or posterior cerebral
             artery territory on either side of the brain

          -  Study intervention can be initiated within 96 hours of symptom onset

          -  Willingness and ability to sign informed consent by patient or legally acceptable
             surrogate decision-maker

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Infarct limited to the brainstem and/or cerebellum with no involvement of the
             cerebral hemispheres

          -  Bi-hemispheric infarction or acute infarct in the contra-lateral hemisphere within
             the past 30 days

          -  Symptoms of active congestive heart failure (dyspnea, orthopnea, increased oxygen
             requirement)

          -  Exacerbation of congestive heart failure, requiring hospitalization, within the past
             30 days or severe systolic dysfunction with a known ejection fraction &lt;20%

          -  End stage renal disease requiring hemodialysis or a creatinine clearance &lt;20
             ml/min/1.73 m2

          -  Hemicraniectomy or other skull defect that would interfere with monitoring

          -  Pregnant women are excluded. Women of child-bearing age must have a negative
             pregnancy test prior to enrollment

          -  Participation in another clinical trial

          -  Any other illness or condition that the investigator feels would pose a hazard to the
             subject from participation in the study
