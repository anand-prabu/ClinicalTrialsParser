    <description>Stopped  Closed-loop target controlled infusion of cisatracurium and propofol  30 minutes before awaken test.
In dexmedetomidine group,dexmedetomidine infusion rate will be reduced to 0.1 μg•kg-1•h-1. In control group ,normal saline infusion will be given with the same infusion rate as dexmedetomidine group .
Call patients' name and require them to move  both feet every 30 seconds after patients recovered normal respiration.
Patients will be considered  to be awake when  recover normal respiration  and make  responsive to verbal commands correctly .
Patients will receive initial  anesthesia after finish awaken test.</description>
