They will be approached by their physician or a\n      genetic counselor for recruitment. Once enrolled, a clinical geneticist or genetic counselor\n      will obtain consent and collect blood samples to be analyzed using WES. Results may include\n      information related to a diagnosis and incidental information. Medically actionable\n      incidental findings will be CLIA-certified and returned to participants in a routine genetic\n      counseling session, along with diagnostic findings. Eligible adult participants will be\n      randomized to have the opportunity to choose to get certain types of non-medically\n      actionable incidental findings, as well. Their decisions will be investigated, as will\n      psychosocial and behavioral responses to sequencing and receiving sequencing information.\n      This is a longitudinal, mixed methods study (i.e., multiple assessments pre- and post-return\n      of results, with both quantitative and qualitative methods used to gather data). Because\n      only the quantitative component of the study uses randomization, only measures and\n      procedures associated with that component are described here."
