These injections may have several\n      side effects, including suppression of the body's adrenal glands to produce steroids\n      (adrenal suppression) and negative effects on metabolism (weight gain, increased blood\n      pressure, and high blood sugar levels).\n\n      The purpose of this study is to determine the time course and predictors of adrenal\n      suppression and the metabolic effects of corticosteroid injections for chronic pain.\n\n      The investigators hypothesize normalization of adrenal function to occur within three weeks\n      of injection in most individuals. An increased frequency of injections is predicted to lead\n      to prolonged adrenal suppression. Corticosteroid injections are also hypothesized to lead to\n      increases in body weight, blood pressure, and blood sugar levels, particularly in diabetic\n      individuals."
