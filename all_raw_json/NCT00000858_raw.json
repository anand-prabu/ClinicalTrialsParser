To ascertain whether the presence of specific infectious agents\n      (e.g., HPV, HSV, CMV, etc.) influences the amount and type of virus isolated from VCS.\n\n      Predictors for the development of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in HIV\n      infected individuals have been studied primarily among adult males and in selected small\n      populations. Although many of these predictors may be relevant to women, HIV infection does\n      manifest itself differently between the sexes. Therefore, it is important to study the\n      spectrum of HIV disease in women and to identify unique and common markers, cofactors, and\n      predictors of disease progression."
