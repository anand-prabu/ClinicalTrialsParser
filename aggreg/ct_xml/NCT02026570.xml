      Objectives: The purpose of this study is to investigate attentional (internal vs. external)
      focus effects on persons with amputation to perform a defined compensatory movement to
      reduce the likelihood of a fall.  An internal focus of attention directs a person's
      conscious attention to their body's movements, whereas an external focus of attention
      directs a person's conscious attention to the effects of their movements or specific
      features in the environment. Numerous experiments have investigated the effects of an
      internal and external focus of attention on motor performance and the findings are in favor
      of an external focus of attention. In our work, we propose a motor learning research
      experiment to evaluate attentional focus strategies on the rehabilitation outcomes of
      learning and adaptation to the new proprioceptive information for persons with a recent
      transtibial amputation.

      Research Design and Methodology:  For this pilot study, six participants with recent
      unilateral transtibial amputation will be recruited. Four participants will receive internal
      and external focus of attention training methods while the other two (control group) will
      receive standard prosthetic training instructions. The experiment will be conducted in three
      phases: Phase 1 -- Baseline Performance Test, Phase 2 -- Training sessions, and Phase 3 -
      Learning Test. The training will utilize a vibrotactile device designed to generate tactile
      sensations at the skin-socket interface simulating contact of the prosthesis with the
      environment. The sensation simulates a perturbation that signals a potential fall event.
      During the experiment the augmented sensory information will be introduced randomly while
      participants walk at a preferred pace on a level surface. Movement kinematics and kinetics
      of the body will be recorded for analyses using a motion capture system with force plates.

      Finding: It is hypothesized that the external focus of attention condition will outperform
      the internal focus of attention condition when responding to perturbations. The external
      focus of attention condition will yield faster response time and show improved compensatory
      responses compared to the internal focus of attention group by producing a greater lateral
      displacement of the artificial limb relative to the line of progression. In addition, the
      external condition will demonstrate a greater step length and step height than the internal
      focus of attention condition when provided with a perturbation.

      Clinical Significance: Current practices within the field of Physical Therapy reveal that
      there is little therapeutic intervention for fall prevention. Instructions are traditionally
      provided on how to reduce the risk of falling through preparation of a room or obstacle
      avoidance or on the proper way to fall to decrease injury. However, there are no protocols
      for providing a prosthetic user with compensatory strategies to avoid a fall after a
      perturbation occurs. The research findings can result in improved training protocols, which
      can improve rehabilitative outcome.

      Impact/Significance: The growing number of prosthetic users presents a need for improved
      patient care and effective prosthetic training and rehabilitation methods. Complimentary to
      the mission of the VA, the results of this research could enhance the quality of patient
      care and further assist these patients toward becoming prosthetically rehabilitated.
