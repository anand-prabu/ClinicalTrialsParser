These questionnaires have\n      been used in other types of disease, but have not all been tested and validated in patients\n      with cough due to IPF.  Our hypothesis is that worsening of cough, dyspnea, and\n      cough-related QOL questionnaire scores will correlate with physiologic markers of IPF\n      severity and worsening of disease. Written, valid questionnaires measuring cough, dyspnea,\n      and QOL are important to assess the benefit of investigational drugs under development to\n      treat patients with IPF."

Both the SGRQ and ATAQ include\n      cough questions. Study participants will complete all questionnaires at baseline, 6, 12, and\n      18 months at the time of their usual clinic visits.  Physiologic data will be collected at\n      the same time of these visits including pulmonary function testing, exercise oxygen\n      saturation, and changes in medications and health status. Changes in cough, dyspnea and QOL\n      scores will be correlated with concurrent changes in physiologic markers of IPF severity. If\n      a study participant has an acute worsening of their IPF, or undergoes lung transplantation,\n      study questionnaires may be given at these additional timepoints when possible."
