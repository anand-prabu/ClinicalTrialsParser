            "textblock": "General medical hospitals provide care for a disproportionate share of patients who abuse or\n      are dependent upon substances. This group is among the most costly to treat and has the\n      poorest medical and substance use outcomes. Motivational interviewing(MI) is a\n      well-recognized, evidenced-based substance abuse treatment that has been adapted for use as\n      a brief intervention in health care settings.MI is applicable to many health-related\n      behavioral problems, and can be taught to a broad range of health care clinicians. However,\n      it is unclear which implementation strategies will lead to the efficient and proficient\n      uptake of MI in general medical settings, such as medical inpatient units.\n\n      Primary care clinicians have multiple practice demands and time constraints. New practices\n      have the greatest chance of being implemented if they are simple and compatible with\n      existing workflows and systems. Two widely used strategies to bring specialized practices\n      into use within general hospital settings are the \"see one, do one\" apprenticeship model of\n      training and use of consultation-liaison (CL) services. \"See one, do one\" has been a modus\n      operandi in medical education for centuries and relies upon a competency-based supervision\n      training approach. While it has been empirically validated in the specialty addiction field,\n      less controlled testing of this implementation strategy is available in general medical\n      settings. The apprenticeship approach requires that appropriate patients and trainers are\n      available with high flexibility for teaching and supervision; when applied to behavioral\n      counseling approaches, this may be seen as incompatible with the medical role and time\n      constraints of clinicians. In contrast, ordering MI through CL is a relatively simple,\n      minimally burdensome process and highly compatible with the way clinicians secure other\n      specialist services for their patients in the hospital.\n\n      We propose to conduct a randomized controlled trial using mixed quantitative and qualitative\n      methods to examine the effectiveness of three different strategies for integrating MI into\n      the practice of physician assistants (PAs) working within Yale New Haven Hospital's internal\n      medicine hospitalist service. Specifically, we will randomize 30 PAs to one of three\n      conditions: (1) a continuing medical education workshop that provides background and \"shows\"\n      PAs how to conduct MI (the control condition, called SEE ONE); (2) a \"see one, do one\"\n      apprenticeship model involving workshop training plus live supervision of bedside practice\n      (DO ONE); and (3) ordering MI from CL after learning about it in a workshop (ORDER ONE).\n      Following the respective MI trainings, each PA will be assessed for the provision of MI to\n      40 study-eligible inpatients, recruited by the research team after admission to our general\n      medical units."
