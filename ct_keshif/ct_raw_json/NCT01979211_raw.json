However, the cancer can recur or can spread to\n      other parts of the body. Cetuximab is a drug that may delay or prevent tumor growth by\n      blocking certain cellular chemical pathways that lead to tumor development.  It was approved\n      by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2006 for the treatment of head\n      and neck cancer.\n\n      The purpose of this study is to determine how easily cetuximab can be added to treatment\n      with radiation therapy in patients with cutaneous cancer of the head and neck.  This study\n      will also look at how well cetuximab added to radiation therapy works over time and how well\n      this treatment is tolerated."
