Recent research has shown that SD, even in\n      the short-term, may be related to echo and electrocardiographic changes that may potentially\n      be predictors of cardiac arrhythmias.\n\n      The objective is to evaluate the effects of early treatment with zolpidem controlled release\n      (CR\u00ae) compared to a placebo on clinical and polysomnographic parameters for patients in a\n      cardiac ICU who had recently been diagnosed with acute coronary syndrome.\n\n      A double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study will be conducted in cardiac ICU\n      patients who had been diagnosed with acute coronary syndrome. The patients in group A will\n      receive placebo and patients in group B will receive zolpidem CR\u00ae 12.5 mg from the first\n      night of hospitalization until their discharge. Patients will undergo overnight full\n      polysomnography on the first night in the ICU and will complete a sleep diary with a visual\n      analogue scale to evaluate sleep quality in the morning after the first 3 nights of\n      hospitalization. The results of the routine ICU laboratory tests including the serum levels\n      of cardiac enzymes [troponin T and creatine kinase MB (CK-MB)] will be collected preceding\n      the first dose of the drug/placebo, and then daily thereafter."
