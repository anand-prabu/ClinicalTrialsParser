Subjects will be\n      required to meet several inclusion and exclusion criteria, which will be assessed through\n      online and clinic screening mechanisms, including questionnaires, fasting glucose\n      concentration, and anthropometric measurements. Eligible subjects will be invited to\n      participate in the study. Subjects will begin by completing a 3-day pre-study assessment of\n      their usual dietary intake using 3-day food diary. After reviewing baseline food records,\n      subjects will be instructed to avoid polyphenolic-containing foods for 2 days prior to the\n      study visit, while maintaining their usual diet pattern and physical activity.\n\n      Subjects will participate in 6 h postprandial study days. Subjects will be randomized on the\n      first day of starting the first post prandial visit day.\n\n      For each 6 h postprandial study visit, subjects will arrive fasted and follow procedures\n      published by our lab previously. This includes: pre-study evaluation for compliance\n      (fasting, dinner consumption, limited polyphenol intake) and readiness for study visit,\n      catheter placement by registered nurse, fasting blood sample, consumption of high\n      fat/carbohydrate meal accompanied by 1 of the treatment beverages, subsequent blood sampling\n      from catheter [ ~1 tablespoon (12ml)] at designated time points for 6 hours.\n\n      Each postprandial study visit day will last approximately 7 hours and subjects will be\n      required to remain at the Clinical Nutrition Research Center at the Illinois Institute of\n      Technology main campus for the duration of the visit. The visit procedures are repeated four\n      times ~ 1 week apart to accommodate subject testing with all four beverages; all procedures\n      are identical on each postprandial study test visit with the exception that only an assigned\n      test beverage per each visit will be consumed with the breakfast."
