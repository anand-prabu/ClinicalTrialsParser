    <textblock>
      Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a common and disabling psychiatric disorder. Left
      untreated or under-treated, it can become a chronic condition associated with significant
      distress, depression, aggression, family disruption, and substance abuse. There is also
      accumulating evidence that combat-related PTSD is associated with an increased risk of
      morbidity and mortality. For the welfare of returning veterans with PTSD and their families,
      it is critical that this disorder is promptly identified and effectively treated.
      Considerable advances that have been made in the assessment and treatment of PTSD in recent
      years; however, psychopharmacological treatments have been shown to be largely ineffective
      for veterans with PTSD.

      To address this gap, this proposal seeks to test an innovative treatment approach in PTSD -
      pharmacological manipulation of the body's major stress system (the
      hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis) with mifepristone. At high doses mifepristone is
      a glucocorticoid receptor (GR) antagonist with peripheral and central nervous system
      effects, making it a compound of interest in the treatment of stress related disorders.
      There is abundant evidence of enhanced GR sensitivity in veterans with PTSD which is thought
      to underlie some of the symptoms of PTSD and associated disturbances in mood and cognition.
      Thus, blockade of the GR receptor with mifepristone may target unique aspects of PTSD and
      lead to clinically meaningful improvement in symptoms and cognition. There is preliminary
      evidence that short-term mifepristone treatment has sustained beneficial effects on mood,
      cognition and sleep disturbance in some neuropsychiatric conditions (major depression,
      bipolar disorder, primary insomnia). That there can be sustained clinical and
      neuropsychological effects of mifepristone and normalization of basal HPA axis activity
      after drug discontinuation in these disorders, has led to the view that mifepristone's
      actions include recalibration of a dysregulated HPA axis. Accordingly, the investigators
      propose to study the effects of mifepristone in veterans with chronic PTSD to determine if
      it is efficacious in improving PTSD symptoms and associated clinical outcomes. To better
      understand the mechanism of action of mifepristone the investigators propose to assess the
      effects of mifepristone on HPA axis activity and their relationship to treatment outcome and
      clinical response.

      To achieve these objectives, the investigators propose to conduct a Phase IIa, multi-site,
      double-blind, placebo controlled trial of mifepristone in veteran outpatients with
      military-related PTSD through the VA's Cooperative Clinical Trial Award program. The
      investigators propose to enroll 136 unmedicated male veterans with military related PTSD at
      four VA sites (Albuquerque, NM, Bronx, NY, Durham, NC, and San Diego, CA). Eligible veterans
      will be randomly assigned in parallel groups to treatment with 600 mg/day mifepristone or
      placebo for one week and followed for up to three months. In this initial trial we propose
      to study the effects of mifepristone in veterans with PTSD as monotherapy, rather than as an
      adjunctive treatment, in order to better detect a signal if there is one.

      The investigators will also describe the effects of mifepristone on several other clinical
      parameters including PTSD symptomology, depression severity, sleep quality, and functional
      impairment. Several measures of neuroendocrine functioning will also be obtained to explore
      the relationship of plasma cortisol and ACTH levels to clinical response and the time to
      addition of rescue medications.

      Novel approaches to the treatment of post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in veterans are
      urgently needed. This proposal seeks to test an innovative approach, one that involves
      careful pharmacological manipulation of the body's major stress system, the
      hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, using one dose of the FDA-approved drug,
      mifepristone (600 mg/day).

      The rationale for a treatment trial of mifepristone in PTSD is based on the wealth of
      knowledge available about persistent alterations of the HPA axis in PTSD and their
      interactions with the central and autonomic nervous system and the immune system. The most
      consistent HPA axis findings in PTSD, taken together, suggest there is increased sensitivity
      to the effects of glucocorticoids in the presence of increased central activation of the HPA
      axis. Among the most replicated neuroendocrine findings have been of elevated levels of CRF
      in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), an exaggerated cortisol response to emotional stressors,
      and an exaggerated suppression of cortisol to the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone
      (DEX). The earliest studies of the effects of dexamethasone (DEX) using the standard 1.0 mg
      dose, found that PTSD, unlike major depression, was not associated with higher rates of
      cortisol non-suppression and there was a trend for lower cortisol levels post-DEX in PTSD. A
      lower dose (0.5 mg) was employed to test the hypothesis of enhanced suppression of cortisol
      to DEX in Vietnam veterans with PTSD, which was confirmed.  Since then, with few exceptions,
       greater suppression of cortisol to low-dose DEX has been found in PTSD subjects, compared
      to unexposed and/or  trauma-exposed controls without PTSD, in diverse samples, including
      samples of persons exposed to combat, natural disasters, domestic violence, the Holocaust,
      and childhood physical and sexual abuse. Furthermore, the extent of cortisol suppression is
      associated with PTSD symptom severity. The finding of a greater down-regulation of
      lymphocyte GR post-DEX suggests that the DST findings may be attributable to more responsive
      glucocorticoid receptors. More recent studies have demonstrated increased suppression of
      ACTH to DEX confirming increased glucocorticoid responsivity at the level of the pituitary.
      The studies of the effects of DEX on HPA axis activity suggest there is enhanced negative
      feedback inhibition of the HPA axis in PTSD. Such inhibition could help to explain why
      despite evidence of central HPA axis activation and an exaggerated response of cortisol to
      stressors and to ACTH stimulation in PTSD, 24-hour basal cortisol levels are not typically
      elevated and indeed are even sometimes low.

      Mifepristone is a selective type II glucocorticoid receptor antagonist with a favorable
      safety profile. It binds to the same site as the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone and
      blocks the negative feedback control of cortisol on the pituitary. Thus, mifepristone,
      because it directly antagonizes the glucocorticoid receptor, which has been found to be more
      sensitive in PTSD in several models, is ideally suited for use in determining the
      pathophysiological significance of increased glucocorticoid receptor sensitivity in PTSD and
      whether its attenuation is of therapeutic value.

      The investigators propose to study the clinical, neuropsychological, and neuroendocrine
      effects of short-term treatment with one dose of mifepristone (600 mg/day) in a
      well-characterized sample of veterans with PTSD to determine if this treatment is effective
      in achieving a clinical response in PTSD, as well as improving clinical symptoms and quality
      of life. Furthermore, if pulse therapy with mifepristone has sustained effects, it holds out
      the promise of a very different approach to pharmacological treatment, one that may be
      preferable to veterans who do not want to be on psychopharmacological treatments
      continuously or long-term.

      Primary Objective

      1. To determine whether 600 mg of  mifepristone daily for one week in male veterans with
      chronic PTSD yields a sufficiently high proportion of clinical responders after one month to
      warrant more extensive and definitive research.

      Secondary Objectives

        1. To study the trajectories of CAPS (past week symptom status) scores over the study
           duration for mifepristoneand placebo.

        2. To determine the effect ofmifepristone compared to placebo on the time to addition of
           rescue medication.

        3. To determine if a Phase III study is justified.

        4. To compare adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) in the two groups.

      This Phase IIa clinical trial seeks to enroll 136 eligible male combat veterans with chronic
      PTSD. Participants will be randomly assigned to treatment with 600 mg/day mifepristone or
      placebo for one week and assessed for clinical outcomes at one and three months follow-up.
      Eligibility will be based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria which are enumerated below
      and in the Human Participants section.  We plan to include male combat veterans with chronic
      PTSD who are not receiving psychotropic medication. The inclusion and exclusion criteria
      were selected in order to include as representative a sample as possible while also
      addressing safety concerns. Veterans who are actively suicidal as assessed by the
      Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) or who have attempted suicide within the
      past two years will be excluded. (If suicidality is identified, the necessary steps will be
      taken to ensure the appropriate clinical care is provided, and the local suicide prevention
      policies implemented.) Veterans with adrenal insufficiency will be excluded, as will
      veterans with other major medical or neurological illnesses, as they may be at increased
      risk of developing adverse events.   Veterans with renal disease/impairment, hepatic
      disease/impairment, cardiac illness (e.g. coronary vascular disease, congestive heart
      failure), or hypokalemia at screening will also be excluded. Since mifepristone use can
      prolong the QTc interval in a dose-related manner, veterans with a prolonged QTc interval,
      defined as &gt;450 msec, on the ECG at screening will be excluded. To evaluate QTc prolongation
      post-mifepristone treatment, an ECG will also be performed at both the 3 day follow up visit
      (visit 1.5) and 1 week follow-up visit (week 1, visit 2).

      Participants on potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (fluconazole, ketoconazole, itraconazole,
      erythromycin, rifampin) and some anticonvulsants (e.g., phenytoin, phenobarbital, and
      carbamazepine) will be excluded since these medications impact the metabolism of
      mifepristone (see Risk/Benefit Assessment for details).  Due to an increased risk of adverse
      drug reactions, veterans taking simvastatin, lovastatin, fentanyl, pimozide, bupropion,
      nefazodone, dihydroergotamine, ergotamine, quinidine, sirolimus, carvedilol, propanolol,
      diltiazem, verapamil or tacrolimus will also be excluded. Since the impact of mifepristone
      on the male reproductive system has not been extensively studied, only veterans willing to
      use effective means of birth control for up to 90 days after mifepristone ingestion will be
      eligible; this will cover the critical period of fetal development.

      Psychotropic medication use is exclusionary at study entry; veterans who have been
      previously treated with a stable regimen may not be enrolled until a minimum of five
      half-lives have elapsed since the veteran last took any psychotropic medications.  (Sleep
      aids such as trazodone (up to 50 mg/day) or zolpidem (up to 10 mg/day) may be offered to
      veterans with insomnia on an as-needed basis at the onset of the study.)  Major depression
      and other anxiety disorders are not exclusionary since they frequently co-occur with PTSD
      and it remains unclear whether their presence represents true comorbidity, symptom overlap,
      or severe illness. Since mild head trauma is common in the military population in general,
      excluding such participants would diminish the generalizability of the sample; participants
      with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI), defined as an extended period of unconsciousness
      or amnesia following injury, will be excluded. The Ohio State University (OSU) TBI
      Identification Method will be used to assess lifetime history of TBI. This method first
      establishes all significant injuries in one's life and then determines if a TBI may have
      occurred based on whether the participant experienced a loss of consciousness (LOC) and, if
      so, for how long. A person is said to have a mild TBI if LOC does not exceed 30 minutes for
      any injury, a moderate TBI if LOC is between 30 minutes and 24 hours, and a severe TBI if
      LOC exceeds 24 hours. The OSU TBI assessment will be administered by a trained rater during
      the psychiatric evaluation conducted at screening.

      Additionally, veterans diagnosed with alcohol/substance abuse and dependence will be
      excluded only if they are recently engaged in a maladaptive pattern of use or abuse. More
      specifically, persons who meet diagnostic criteria for alcohol/substance dependence will be
      excluded if they have manifested dependence within the previous three months (i.e., have met
      three or more of the seven criteria for a maladaptive pattern of use in the last three
      months). Persons with alcohol/substance abuse (who, by definition, do not meet criteria for
      alcohol dependence) will be excluded if they have shown a maladaptive pattern of alcohol use
      during the past one month (i.e., have met one or more of the four criteria for a maladaptive
      pattern of abuse).

      Veterans who are currently receiving psychotherapies - individually or in a group setting -
      that are considered to have significant benefit for PTSD, according to the VA and DoD's
      Treatment Guidelines, will also be excluded. These therapies are cognitive therapy for PTSD
      (e.g. cognitive processing therapy (CPT)), exposure therapy (e.g., prolonged exposure
      therapy), stress inoculation training, and eye movement desensitization and reprocessing
      (EMDR). Other forms of therapy and case management which do not specifically target PTSD
      symptoms and/or have not been shown to provide significant benefit in PTSD will be allowed
      at entry and throughout the study (e.g. supportive therapy, psychodynamic therapy, anger
      management, cognitive behavioral therapy for symptoms or problems other than PTSD).

      We recognize that military-related PTSD in women is increasingly common and effective
      treatments are needed for this group as well.  However, women will be excluded from this
      initial trial for safety reasons, since mifepristone is an abortifacient. Should
      mifepristone prove to be effective in male veterans with PTSD, this would provide a
      rationale for future studies in women, employing additional safeguards.
