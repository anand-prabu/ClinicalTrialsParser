  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is conducted in Europe, and North and South America. The aim of this study is to
      provide additional documentation of the immunogenicity, and obtain additional clinical data,
      of turoctocog alfa in the setting of normal clinical practise in patients previously treated
      with a factor VIII agent (FVIII) and naïve to turoctocog alfa.

             of severe and moderately severe haemophilia A (FVIII below or equal to 2%)

          -  The decision to initiate treatment with commercially available turoctocog alfa has
             been made by the patient/parent and the patient's treating physician before and
             independently from the decision to include the patient in this study

          -  No previous exposure to turoctocog alfa

          -  No clinical suspicion of FVIII inhibitors

          -  Availability of an FVIII inhibitor test obtained not more than four weeks prior to
             first dosing with turoctocog alfa

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Contraindications for use according to the approved product information text (US
             Package insert (PI), European Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC), or
             corresponding local prescribing information)

          -  Treatment with any investigational drug within 30 days prior to enrolment into the
