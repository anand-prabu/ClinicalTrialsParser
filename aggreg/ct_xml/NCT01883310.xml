      Aims of the study:

      This is a double-blind randomized-controlled trial to test the effects of a task oriented
      training combined with cerebellar transcranial direct current stimulation on locomotor
      function, mobility and balance in multiple sclerosis subjects with moderate gait impairments
      (EDSS 4-5,5).

      Subjects and methods: 40 multiple sclerosis patients will be recruited in an outpatient
      rehabilitation clinic University Hospital Ferrara and Pisa. Informed consent will be
      obtained. Participants enrolled will included in 2 different treatment groups: Task Oriented
      Circuit Training (TOCT) + anodal cerebellar transcranial direct current stimulation
      (experimental group) and TOCT + sham transcranial direct current stimulation over the
      cerebellum (control group). The group with anodal transcranial direct current stimulation
      will receive continuous stimulation with intensity of 2 mili Ampere during the first 15
      minutes of functional circuit training. In the sham session, anodal transcranial direct
      current stimulation was applied for 30 s and then shut off. Each subject will receive 10
      task-oriented training sessions over 2 weeks (5 sessions/week). 3 subjects with a supervisor
      physiotherapist will take part at the TOCT. During the stimulation sessions both the subject
      and the researcher, responsible for carrying out clinical tests, will be unaware of the type
      of stimulation set.

      Treatment efficacy outcome measures will be clinical test for gait speed (Timed 25-Foot
      Walk), walking endurance (six minute walking test), balance (Dynamic Gait Index) and
      mobility (Time Up and Go Test); self-assessment questionnaire for motor fatigue (Fatigue
      Severity Scale FSS) and quality of life (Short Form (36) Health Survey).

      Outcome measures will be assessed the week prior to treatment initiation (T0), the week
      after the end of treatment (T1) and at 3 months follow-up (T3) to evaluate treatments
      retention, by a clinician blinded to the treatment. At the end of each session, the subject
      will complete a questionnaire where report side effects due to stimulation (headache, neck
      pain, burning, redness and/or itching in the site of stimulation).

      The inclusion criteria will be:

        -  males and females, community dwelling, age 18 or older;

        -  diagnosis of multiple sclerosis in a stable phase, which will be defined as a chronic

        -  moderate gait impairments referred to Expanded Disability Status Scale between 4 and
           5,5 (this EDSS scores refers to people with restricted ambulation who do not need
