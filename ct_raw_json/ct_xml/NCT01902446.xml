  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Traumatic injury in rural America is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality, and the
      challenges of a rural trauma system can put patients at unique risk. Prolonged transport
      times to a trauma center, stopping for care at referring hospitals, and longer exposure to
      care-associated factors distinguish rural patients from their urban counterparts.
      Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a significant risk in rural patients, increasing
      hospital stay, healthcare costs, and even mortality in the critically injured. The
      investigators propose a pilot study to test the hypothesis that a single dose of oral
      chlorhexidine gluconate (antiseptic) for trauma patients in the prehospital environment will
      decrease subsequent development of early VAP. Chlorhexidine is currently a standard therapy
      in intensive care units to prevent airway colonization and subsequent development of VAP.
      Demonstrating safety and effectiveness of prehospital infection control practices could
      significantly improve outcomes of traumatic injury in rural America.
