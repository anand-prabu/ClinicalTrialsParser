Disturbed T lymphocyte response\n\n             1. TH1 response predominant over TH2 response\n\n             2. Implication of TH17 L\n\n             3. Quantitative and/or functional deficit of regulatory T L\n\n             4. Involvement anti-apoptotic mechanisms of TL\n\n        2. Disturbed B lymphocyte response\n\n             1. Hyperactivation of B lymphocytes and involvement of memory BL\n\n             2. Secretion of autoantibodies\n\n        3. Implication of ImC and disturbance of the pDC/mDC ratio\n\n        4. Study of splenic immune cells (TL, BL, DC)\n\n      The study will in no way modify the investigation procedures (diagnostic and therapeutic\n      strategy), which will be carried out as usual.\n\n      Blood samples related to the study will be taken in the context of a pathology investigation\n      and will not require an additional puncture.\n\n      Spleen samples will be obtained with the consent of the patient if therapeutic splenectomy\n      is planned, which is usually proposed to patients with ITP."
