Subjects with varying degrees of renal\n      insufficiency (i.e. kidney function) will be included in the study. Tirofiban is known to be\n      cleared from the blood by the kidneys and so people with kidney problems clear tirofiban to\n      a slower extent compared to people without kidney problems. By comparing the tirofiban\n      concentration profile between subjects with healthy kidney function versus with impaired\n      kidney function, a tirofiban dosing recommendation for subjects with impaired kidney\n      function can be made.\n\n      This is a non-randomized, single-center, open-label study. A single dose of tirofiban (25\n      \u00b5g/kg administered intravenously over a 3 min period) will be administered to subjects with\n      normal renal function (>90 mL/min CrCl), moderate (30-59 mL/min CrCl), and severe (<30\n      mL/min CrCl) renal impairment with non-dialysis-dependent renal insufficiency"
