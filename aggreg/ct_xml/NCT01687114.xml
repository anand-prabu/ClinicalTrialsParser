      This protocol is a clinical trial to validate proanthocyanidin A2 (PAC-A2) as a useful
      marker of cranberry intake. We hypothesize the consumption of this cranberry beverage in a
      progressive dosing schedule will increase PAC-A2 excretion in urine. Five generally healthy,
      nonsmoking, pre-menopausal women (absent major chronic diseases including cardiovascular,
      endocrine, gastrointestinal, and renal conditions), age 20-40 years, with a body mass index
      (BMI) of 18.5-25 kg/m2 will be recruited from the Boston area because sexually active women
      in this age range are particularly vulnerable to urinary tract infection. Volunteers will be
      asked to consume their assigned cranberry beverage at a dose of 8 oz/day according to a
      weekly dosing schedule. Relevant clinical information and eleven 24-hour and morning spot
      urine samples each will be collected from subjects during the study. Urinary PAC-A2
      concentration will then be determined to validate if it can serve as a marker of compliance
      of cranberry juice consumption.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      People who frequently eat whole grains, fruits and berries, vegetables, beans and legumes,
      nuts, seeds, cocoa, tea, wine, and fruit or vegetable juices may have decreased risk of
      diseases.  It is believed that some of these health benefits are due to phytochemicals
      present in these foods and beverages. Phytochemicals are nutrients that are naturally
      present in plant-based foods and beverages. Recently, cranberry containing foods and
      beverages are believed to prevent urinary tract infection. However, how cranberry decrease
      urinary tract infection is not very clear. To better understand how phytochemicals in
      cranberries may benefit health, we want to learn how they are absorbed and eliminated from
      the body. Thus, the purpose of the main study is to see whether we can measure
      phytochemicals from cranberries in health volunteers after they drink cranberry juice.
