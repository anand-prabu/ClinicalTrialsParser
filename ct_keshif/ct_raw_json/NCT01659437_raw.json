In March 2010, a WHO Technical Advisory\n      Group recommended that a trial be carried out to develop a fully oral treatment for the\n      disease. Although the current treatment is effective, injection with streptomycin is a\n      problem. Several small observational studies (published and unpublished) have shown that a\n      fully oral treatment is promising.\n\n      This WHO sponsored study will be a randomized, controlled open label non-inferiority phase\n      II/III, multi-centre trial (1 centre in Benin and 4 centres in Ghana), with two parallel\n      treatment groups. The ultimate goal is to search for an effective alternative treatment to\n      the current standard WHO-recommended therapy for all forms of Buruli ulcer, which includes\n      injections of streptomycin with inherent logistic, operational and safety disadvantages.\n\n      Financial and material support:\n\n        1.
