  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Milking the umbilical cord from the placental end toward the infant has been shown to
      benefit preterm infants when compared to either clamping the umbilical cord immediately or
      waiting delaying the clamping of the cord. Delaying cord clamping for 30-120 seconds has
      been shown to improve heart and lung function, reduces the need for blood transfusion, and
      reduces the risk for brain bleeding seen in some preterm infants. Delaying the clamping of
      the umbilical cord, however in extremely premature infants is not considered safe, since it
      also delays the resuscitation that these infants need immediately after birth. Milking the
      umbilical cord is believed have similar benefits to delaying the clamping of the cord, but
      can be done much faster (seconds rather than minutes). In this study, the cord will milked
      three times over about 10-20 seconds and the infant will be passed to the awaiting newborn
      medical team for routine care. Participants of this study will be randomly assigned to one
      of two study groups: the first group will have the cord milking intervention and the second
      group will not have any intervention other than routine, immediate cord clamping with
      routine care of mother and infant. Data will be collected about the mother prior to delivery
      and data will also be collected about the baby using computerized health records. The data
      will look at short term changes in red blood cell volumes, the need for blood transfusions,
      and rates of known complications of prematurity, including longer term developmental
      complications at 18-24 months.

      The hypothesis is that milking the umbilical cord before cutting the cord will lead to a
      higher hemoglobin concentration and decrease the need for blood transfusions in extremely
      preterm neonates compared to the current standard of immediately clamping the umbilical
      cord.

    <description>The procedure will involve positioning the neonate below the level of the placenta and milking approximately 20cm of umbilical cord three times over 10-20 seconds total from the placental end to the neonate. The cord will then be clamped and the neonate handed to the awaiting medical team for routine care of a premature infant.</description>
