In recent\n      years, the development of more sophisticated segmental instrumentation techniques and\n      hardware has allowed for incorporation of multiple spinal levels in single settings. The\n      long-term consequences for spinal motion segments adjacent to such fusions remain unknown.\n\n      The investigators propose to undertake a retrospective case study analysis evaluating both\n      radiologic and clinical parameters indicative of adjacent-segment pathology in patients who\n      have undergone instrumented arthrodesis procedures at Ohio State University, performed by\n      either Dr.  Francis Farhadi, James B. Elder, or Gary Rea."
