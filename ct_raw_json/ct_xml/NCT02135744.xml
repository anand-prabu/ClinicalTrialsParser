  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hospital readmissions for acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
      (AECOPD) pose burdens to the healthcare system and patients. The aim of this study was to
      determine whether a screening and educational tool, administered prior to discharge, would
      result in a decrease in the rate of hospital readmissions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hospital readmissions for acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
      (AECOPD) pose burdens to the healthcare system and patients.  A current gap in knowledge is
      whether a pre-discharge screening and educational tool, administered to patients with COPD,
      reduces readmissions and emergency department (ED) visits.

      A single center, randomized trial of patients admitted with AECOPD.  Patients will be
      randomized to control (standard care) or &quot;bundle&quot; group in which patients receive smoking
      cessation counseling, screening for gastroesophageal reflux disease and depression or
      anxiety, standardized inhaler teaching, and a 48-hour post-discharge phone call.
