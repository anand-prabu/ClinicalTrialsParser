It has\n      both immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory activities.Our previous animal studies have\n      revealed that the major component of T2, triptolide, could prevent the development of\n      chronic colitis in interleukin-10 deficient mice. The phase I clinical trial in our\n      institute also demonstrated that T2, or combined with enteral nutrition, is efficient for\n      induction of remission in patients with active Crohn's disease.The common adverse effects of\n      T2 are leucopenia,liver renal toxicity,oligospermia and amenorrhea.\n\n      The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of Tripterygium Glycosides Combined with\n      enteral nutrition in the treatment of Crohn's disease for induction remission and compare\n      the therapeutic effect with patients who only received Tripterygium Glycosides or enteral\n      nutrition."
