  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will enroll 100 overweight and obese adolescents ages 11-16 in a lifestyle
      modification program focusing on dietary modification and exercise.  Parents will be
      randomized into control and motivational interviewing-based intervention groups.  The
      primary hypothesis is that adolescents whose parents are in the intervention group will have
      improved compliance, weight loss and health outcomes compared with adolescents whose parents
      do not receive the intervention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adolescents will participate in a 6-month intensive lifestyle modification that includes a
      structured exercise program, nutrition education and dietary modification and behavioral
      support, followed by a 6-month maintenance phase with monthly booster sessions.  Parents
      will be randomized to participate in 4 dedicated &quot;pre-treatment&quot; parent psychoeducational
      sessions vs. control (no pscychoeducational sessions).  The sessions will explore parents'
      feelings about participation in a weight management program, explore their reasons for
      wanting to make behavioral changes, and enhance motivation.  All parents will participate in
      monthly parent support groups while their adolescents are participating in the intervention
      phase of the study.  The 6-month adolescent intervention will include biweekly sessions with
      a registered dietitian for dietary education; biweekly interactive group discussion sessions
      on topics pertaining to motivation, strategies for changing health behaviors, setting and
      keeping goals and dealing with peer pressure; and exercise sessions three times a week with
      30 minutes of cardiovascular exercise and 30 minutes of strength training each session.
      Comprehensive assessments, including nutrition, behavior and exercise assessments,
      laboratory work, body composition measurements and medical assessments will be conducted at
      baseline, 6 months and 12 months.
