Determine the maximum tolerated dose, dose limiting toxicity, recommended\n      phase II dose, and safety of BMS-184476 in patients with advanced solid tumors. II.\n      Determine the pharmacokinetic profile of BMS-184476 and its metabolites in these patients.\n      III. Determine preliminary evidence of antitumor activity of BMS-184476 in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is an open label, dose escalation study. Patients receive BMS-184476 IV over 1\n      hour. Treatment is repeated every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or\n      unacceptable toxicity. In the second part of the study, patients receive BMS-184476 IV over\n      1 hour weekly. Cohorts of 3-6 patients are treated at escalating doses of BMS-184476. The\n      maximum tolerated dose is defined as the dose at which fewer than 2 of 6 patients experience\n      dose limiting toxicity. Patients are followed every 4 weeks until toxicity is resolved.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-18\n      months."
