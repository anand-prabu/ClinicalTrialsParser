Determine the\n      qualitative and quantitative toxic effects of this regimen in this patient population. III.\n      Determine the pharmacokinetics of these drugs in this patient population. IV. Determine the\n      antitumor activity of this regimen in this patient population.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive doxorubicin HCl liposome IV over\n      60 minutes followed by ZD0473 IV over 60 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 28 days\n      for a maximum of 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n      Patients with partial response (PR) or complete response (CR) may continue treatment until\n      disease progression or until 2 courses after maximum response. Cohorts of 3-6 patients\n      receive escalating doses of doxorubicin HCl liposome and ZD0473 until the maximum tolerated\n      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which 2 of 3 or 3 of 6 patients\n      experience dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed at 4 weeks and 3 months. Patients\n      with PR or CR ongoing continue follow-up every 3 months until relapse.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 24 patients will be accrued for this study."
