It is not yet known if paclitaxel is more effective with or\n      without carboplatin in treating stage IV breast cancer.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of paclitaxel with or\n      without carboplatin in treating women who have stage IV breast cancer."

Patients are stratified according to prior\n      adjuvant chemotherapy (yes vs no) and ECOG performance status (0-1 vs 2). Patients are\n      randomized to one of two treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour weekly for 3 weeks.\n\n        -  Arm II:Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes\n           weekly for 3 weeks.\n\n      Treatment in both arms continues every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or\n      unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, before each course during study, and then after\n      completion of study.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 220 patients will be accrued for this study."
