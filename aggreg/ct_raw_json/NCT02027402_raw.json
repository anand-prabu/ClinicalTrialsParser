This study is coordinated to find\n      out the surgical outcomes and perioperative morbidity according to the insertion of drain\n      after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Inverstgators expect that the routine use of a drain\n      after laparoscopic cholecystectomy for an acutely inflamed gallbladder will have no effects\n      on the postoperative morbidity."
