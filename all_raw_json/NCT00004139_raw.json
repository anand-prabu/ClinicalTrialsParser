Compare the complete and overall response rate to gemcitabine and docetaxel\n      versus gemcitabine and irinotecan in chemotherapy naive patients with stage IIIB or IV\n      non-small cell lung cancer. II. Compare the overall and failure free survival, duration of\n      response, and toxicity associated with these combination regimens in this patient\n      population.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified according to disease stage\n      (stage IIIB vs stage IV without CNS involvement vs stage IV with CNS involvement vs\n      recurrent/progressive disease post surgery and/or radiotherapy). Patients are randomized to\n      one of two treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes\n      immediately followed by irinotecan IV over 90 minutes on days 1 and 8. Arm II: Patients\n      receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes immediately followed by docetaxel IV over 60 minutes\n      on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or\n      unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving partial or complete response or stable disease\n      receive treatment for least 6 courses and for 2 additional courses beyond the maximum\n      response, and then at the investigator's discretion. Patients are followed every 3 months\n      for 1 year, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter until disease\n      progression or death.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 72 patients (36 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this\n      study within 12 months."
