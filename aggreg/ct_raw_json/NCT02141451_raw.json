Up to three dose levels will be tested (100 mg bid, 200 mg bid, and 300 mg\n      bid).  As the 300 mg bid has been proven safe in the non-transplant setting, dose escalation\n      follows a Fast-Track Design with 1 patient enrolled per dose level unless a grade 2 or\n      greater treatment emergent event occurs within the 1st 14 days of INCB7839.  At that point,\n      dose escalation converts to a standard 3+3 design and two additional patients are enrolled\n      at the current dose level.  If dose level 3 is completed without dose limiting toxicity\n      (DLT) in the 1st 3 patients, an additional 3 patients will be enrolled at this level\n      (without the staggering required by the DLT rules) prior to moving to the phase II\n      component.\n\n      Once the phase I dose escalation is completed, an additional 12 patients will be enrolled at\n      the MTD (or dose level 3, if no DLT) to obtain a more detailed toxicity profile as well as a\n      preliminary estimate of progression free survival at 6 months post-transplant."
