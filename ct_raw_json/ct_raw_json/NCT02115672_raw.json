The first part of the study will include escalating dose groups. Up to 4 dose levels will be investigated starting at dose level 1. Patients will be accrued in a conventional 3+3 design. Applying this study design, the first cohort of 3 patients will be treated at dose level 1 (0.5 mg/kg) on Day 1, 15, 29 and 43. Patients will continue taking Imatinib 400 mg/day throughout the study. Dose escalation will continue until the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) is established and protocol specific stopping rules for toxicity are met. If no MTD is reached, dose escalation will continue up to dose level 4 (1.25 mg/kg)."
