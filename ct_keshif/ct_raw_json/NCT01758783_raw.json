The patients were administered total parenteral nutrition\n      for at least four weeks (two weeks pre-operation and two weeks post-operation). The\n      nutritional status, immunologic function, plasma concentration of glutamine and intestinal\n      permeability were measured at 1 day, 1 week and 2 weeks pre-operation, 3 day, 1 week and 2\n      weeks post-operation. Nutrition status was determined the plasma concentrations of\n      hemoglobin, albumin, prealbumin, transferrin and triglyceride. Immunologic function were\n      measured by the percentages of CD4+T cells and CD8+T cells, the ratio of CD4 +T cells to\n      CD8+T cells ( CD4 +/CD8 +) was calculated\uff0c and serum IgA, IgM and IgG\uff0eThe intestinal\n      permeability was detected by the urinal ratio of lactulose and mannitol."
