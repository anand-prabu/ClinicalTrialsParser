As a positive control were considered composites with\n      alpha values \u200b\u200bin marginal adaptation. The protocol was approved by the Institutional\n      Research Ethics Committee of the Dental School at the University of Chile (Project\n      PRI-ODO-0207).

Restorations in functional occlusions with an opposing\n      natural tooth. Asymptomatic restored tooth. At least one proximal contact area with a\n      neighbouring tooth. Patients are older than 18 years. Patients who agreed and signed a\n      consent form for participating in the study. Area out of the restoration\u00b4s failure is in\n      good condition.\n\n      Inclusion Criteria for Positive Control group :\n\n      Composite resins with alpha value in adaptation marginal criterial\n\n      Exclusion criteria:\n\n      Patients with contra-indications for regular dental treatment based on their medical\n      history.\n\n      Patients with xerostomia or taking medication that significantly decreased salivary flow.\n\n      Patients with a high risk of caries. Patients with psychiatric or physical diseases, which\n      interfered with oral hygiene.\n\n      Patients with localized marginal deficiencies > 1 mm. and/or secondary caries adjacent to\n      composite restorations , or major defects 2.2 Treatment Group Criteria Initially, 356\n      restorations (28 patients) were evaluated and assigned in accordance with the modified USPHS\n      criteria, from which 80 were selected in accordance with the inclusion criteria.\n      Restorations with marginal defects (>0.5mm and <1mm) and/or marginal staining (Bravo) were\n      randomly assigned to the Sealing (n = 20) or no treatment (n = 20) group. The randomization\n      was performed by the Power Analysis and Sample Size System (Excel 2000,Microsoft,SEA, USA).\n\n      2.3 Restoration Assessment The quality of the restorations was scored according to the\n      modified USPHS criteria. Two examiners underwent calibration exercises each year (JM and\n      EF). The Cohen's Kappa inter-examiner coefficient was 0.74 at the baseline and 0.87 at ten\n      years. Immediately after the treatment (baseline) and 10 years later, the examiners assessed\n      the restorations independently by direct visual and tactile examination with mouth mirror\n      number 5 and explorer number 23 (Hu Friedy Mfg. Co. Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) and indirectly\n      by radiographic examination (bite wing). The four parameters examined were anatomic form,\n      secondary caries, marginal staining and marginal adaptation. If the difference was recorded\n      between the two examiners, and if they could not reach an agreement, a third clinician, who\n      also underwent the calibration exercises (GM), made the final decision.\n\n      2.4 Treatment Groups 2.4.1 Sealing For this group, defective areas were acid etched with 35%\n      phosphoric acid for 15 seconds. A resin-based sealant (Clinpro Sealant, 3M ESPE) was applied\n      over the defective area. The sealant was polymerized with a photocuring unit (Curing Light\n      2500, 3M ESPE) for 40 seconds. Rubber dam isolation was used for this procedure.\n\n      2.4.2 No treatment The composite resin restorations had marginal defects, but were\n      clinically acceptable, did not receive treatment.\n\n      2.4.3 Positive control Composite resins with alpha value in marginal adaptation criteria"
