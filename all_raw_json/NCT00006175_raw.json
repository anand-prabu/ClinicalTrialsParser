            "textblock": "This study will measure levels of an enzyme called cyclooxygenase in gum tissue following\n      third molar (wisdom tooth) extraction.  Cyclooxygenase is thought to contribute to pain that\n      normally follows tissue injury or surgery.\n\n      Healthy volunteers between 16 and 35 years of age who require removal of their third molars\n      may be eligible for this study.  Participants will receive an injection of a local\n      anesthetic (lidocaine) in the mouth and a sedative (midazolam) through an arm vein before\n      surgery.  Before the tooth is removed, a small tissue sample (biopsy) will be collected from\n      the gum tissue covering one of the lower third molars to be extracted.  After surgery, a\n      second biopsy will be taken at some point between just after surgery to the time when pain\n      from the extraction starts to develop.  These tissue samples will be analyzed for\n      cyclooxygenase levels.\n\n      Patients will stay in the clinic for up to 4 hours after surgery while the anesthetic wears\n      off.  During this time, they will complete pain questionnaires.  If needed, patients may\n      receive additional medicine for pain relief at any time during the surgery or the 4-hour\n      observation period.  They will also be given standard pain medication to take home at the\n      end of the study."

            "textblock": "Prostanoids are inflammatory mediators that have been implicated in all stages of acute and\n      chronic inflammation.  The inhibition of prostanoid synthesis by NSAIDs forms the basis of\n      their therapeutic as well as side effects.  NSAIDs directly inhibit cyclooxygenase [COX],\n      which leads to reduction of prostaglandin synthesis but also to gastric erosions, inhibition\n      of platelet aggregation and nephrotoxicity.  The identification of the two isoforms of COX\n      lead to the hypothesis that COX-2 is responsible for the production of prostaglandins\n      following tissue injury, while COX-1 is involved in normal homeostasis.  This hypothesis is\n      primarily based on the results of animal studies and chronic inflammatory conditions such as\n      arthritis.  Recent results in the oral surgery model of acute inflammation suggest that\n      COX-2 is present in the oral mucosa and may contribute to prostanoid production during acute\n      inflammation rather than require induction in response to the injury.  The proposed study\n      aims to evaluate the time course of COX-1 and COX-2 in acute inflammation by evaluating\n      levels of mRNA at baseline prior to surgery, at the completion of surgery, and at one, two\n      and three hours following surgery."

Erupted tooth:  Clinical crown is present in the mouth and is not covered by soft\n             tissue.\n\n          2.

Partial bony impaction:  Clinical crown is not present in the mouth and the alveolar\n             bone covers some but not all of the crown in the radiograph.\n\n          4. Full bony impaction:  Clinical crown is not present in the mouth and the alveolar\n             bone covers most or all of the crown in the radiograph.\n\n        Patients will be eligible for inclusion in this study if the two mandibular molars are\n        classified as partial or full bony impactions.\n\n        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:\n\n        Patients who are pregnant or nursing.\n\n        Presence of infection or inflammation [pericoronitis] at either extraction site.\n\n        Patients who are taking any of the following drugs:  anti-depressants, diuretics, aspirin\n        on a near daily basis, coumadin or other blood thinners; or other drugs that might\n        influence pain report or COX formation, e.g. steroids."
