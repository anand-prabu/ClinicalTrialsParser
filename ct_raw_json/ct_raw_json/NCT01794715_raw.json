All patients\n      will be examined twice (by two nurses), one will routinely add ultrasound examination of the\n      pleural space and the inferior vena cava to assess volume state, the other nurse will not\n      perform ultrasound examination. Full cross-over design were nurses do ultrasound\n      examinations at a random matter.\n\n      Patients will then be examined by echocardiography by experience cardiologist's\n      echocardiographers. Outcome measures:Change in therapy after routinely performed ultrasound\n      examinations vs controls, detection of volume state when performing ultrasound examinations\n      compared to controls with cardiologist's echocardiographic examination as a gold standard.\n\n      Descriptive data of patients before, under and after examinations."
