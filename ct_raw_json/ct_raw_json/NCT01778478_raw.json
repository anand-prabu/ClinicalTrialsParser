Both the child and a parent are asked questions about the\n      child   s behaviors and symptoms that might indicate such problems. Researchers want to see\n      if the K-SADS-PL can help identify mental health problems in young adults (ages 18 to 25).\n      Two groups of young adults, including healthy volunteers and people with cancer, and their\n      parents will participate in this study.\n\n      Objectives:\n\n        -  To see if the K-SADS-PL interview used for children and teens can also be used for\n           young adults.\n\n        -  To see whether information provided by parents will affect the rate of mental health\n           problems found.\n\n      Eligibility:\n\n        -  Individuals aged 18-25 years who have cancer and are participating in research studies\n           at the National Institutes of Health.\n\n        -  Healthy volunteers aged 18-25 years.\n\n        -  A parent of a young adult who is participating in this study.\n\n      Design:\n\n        -  This study requires one study visit that includes an interview and self-report\n           questionnaires. It will take about 1 to 3 hours. A follow-up phone call or visit will\n           also be required.\n\n        -  Young adult participants will be given the K-SADS-PL interview and four questionnaires\n           that ask about mood, anxiety, distress, parental contact, and development during\n           childhood. The K-SADS-PL interview will be video recorded or audio recorded.\n\n        -  Parents will also be given the K-SADS-PL interview. This interview can be done in\n           person or by phone, and will also be recorded.\n\n        -  No treatment will be provided as part of this study."

            "textblock": "Objective:\n\n      The goal of this pilot project is to describe the feasibility of using the Schedule for\n      Affective Disorders and Schizophreni\\a for School Age Children Present and Lifetime Version\n      (K-SADS-PL) to screen and evaluate older adolescents and young adults (ages 18-25) for mood\n      and anxiety disorders. An additional aim is to describe the contribution of the parent\n      interview portion of the instrument for this age group. Two groups of 18-25 year old\n      participants will be enrolled: healthy volunteers and patients with cancer. The information\n      gained in this pilot study will inform the design of future intervention studies that target\n      mood and anxiety disorders among pediatric oncology patients.\n\n      Primary aim:\n\n      Aim 1: Feasibility - Describe the feasibility of using the K-SADS-PL interview to screen and\n      evaluate for mood and anxiety disorders among two groups of 18     25 year olds (healthy\n      volunteers and patients with cancer) and their parents.\n\n      Hypothesis 1: The K-SADS-PL interview is feasible to use in the two groups of 18     25 year\n      olds; the feasibility of completing the parent portion of the K-SADS-PL will be better among\n      parents of cancer participants compared to parents of healthy volunteers.\n\n      Secondary aim:\n\n      Aim 2: K-SADS-PL outcomes - Compare and contrast K-SADS-PL findings based on responses\n      provided by participants versus summary ratings that take into account both parent and child\n      responses.\n\n      Hypothesis 2: Summary ratings of K-SADS-PL screening and diagnostic questions will yield\n      more positive screening findings (subthreshold or threshold) compared to participant ratings\n      alone.\n\n      Study population\n\n      This pilot study will include a convenience sample of young adults, aged 18-25, from two\n      groups     healthy volunteers and individuals who are participants in oncology protocols at\n      the NIH Clinical Center (inpatient or outpatient) and who agree to participate.\n      Participants may be from any institute, but must have a parent who will agree to be\n      interviewed.\n\n      Design\n\n      This is a pilot study to describe the feasibility of extending the K-SADS-PL diagnostic\n      interview to screen and evaluate young adults 18-25 years of age for psychiatric disorders.\n      Informed consent will be obtained from the participant and his/her parent. The interview\n      will be administered by a interviewer trained to administer the K-SADS-PL instrument. The\n      same interviewer will administer the K-SADS-PLL to both the participant and the parent. The\n      participant will be interviewed first, and the parent second. If there is more than one\n      parent who is eligible, the parent who knows the participant best will be chosen. All\n      interviews will be recorded. A subset of interview recordings will be randomly rated by a\n      gold standard    expert rater to determine inter-rater kappa coefficients for screening and\n      diagnostic questions about mood and anxiety disorders.\n\n      Availability of parents to complete the K-SADS-PL interview will be optimized by allowing\n      either face-to-face or phone interviews. If a parent interview reveals clinically\n      significant information that the participant did not report, the interviewer will re-contact\n      the participant to complete the necessary diagnostic module. Summary screening and\n      diagnostic ratings will be determined by the interviewer, taking into account both\n      participant and parent responses as per the K-SADS-PL design.\n\n      We will also ask participants to complete several short questionnaires:1) Hospital Anxiety\n      and Depression Scale (HADS); 2) Parent-child frequency of contact; 3) Distress Thermometer;\n      4) Course of Life questionnaire."
