Patients are stratified according to length of time\n      since prior treatment (less than 3 months (stratum A) vs 3 months or more (stratum B)).\n      Stratum A closed to accrual effective 06/20/2000.\n\n      Patients receive topotecan IV over 30 minutes on days 1-3 and paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on\n      day 3. Courses repeat every 4 weeks.\n\n      Patients who achieve partial response or stable disease continue treatment in the absence of\n      complete response or disease progression. Patients who develop disease progression in the\n      CNS only should receive whole brain radiotherapy and then continue treatment. Patients who\n      achieve complete remission receive a maximum of 6 courses of treatment. Patients may then\n      undergo prophylactic cranial irradiation and/or thoracic radiotherapy at the discretion at\n      the attending physician.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then at 3 years after study.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 19-55 patients will be accrued for stratum B of this study\n      over 12-21 months. Stratum A closed to accrual effective 06/20/2000."
