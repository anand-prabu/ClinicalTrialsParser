However, anticoagulation during hemodialysis of the\n      patient at high risk for bleeding remains a frequently encountered problem in both inpatient\n      and outpatient dialysis practice.\n\n      Streamline bloodlines are designed to eliminate blood-air contact.

The need for\n      anticoagulation to prevent clotting of the extracorporeal blood circuit and the need to\n      prevent anticoagulation related bleeding complications in the patient has led to the\n      development of numerous strategies; the safest from a bleeding standpoint being\n      anticoagulant-free hemodialysis.\n\n      Streamline\u00ae bloodlines (Medisystems\u00ae Corporation, Lawrence, MA) are designed to eliminate\n      blood-air contact. A pressure pod measures arterial and venous pressures without any\n      blood-air contact. The venous chamber is run without an air gap. It is also designed so that\n      blood flows in a circular vortex manner. This airless system is thought to provide several\n      benefits: improved dialysis efficiency and blood flow rates, reduced heparin use and\n      clotting rates.\n\n      The goal of this study is to prospectively examine the Streamline\u00ae airless tubing system in\n      an inpatient setting and its association with clotting rates, and dialysis efficiency."
