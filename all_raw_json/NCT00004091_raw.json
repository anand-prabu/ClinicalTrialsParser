Compare the detection of transferrin receptor, epidermal growth factor\n      receptor, and the MaTu-MN protein in exfoliated cervical epithelial cells from women with\n      abnormal Pap test using fluorescent labeled antibody probe vs histology.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients undergo a Pap test and a colposcopy. Cervical epithelial cells are\n      collected from the most abnormal appearing lesion. Cells are examined for molecular markers\n      using a fluorescent antibody test. The presence or absence of these markers is compared to\n      results of the Pap test and the histology of the cells.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 100 patients will be accrued for this study within 6 months."
