A significant number of mTBIs also occurs in\n      non-deployed service members during training exercises.\n\n      There are currently no drugs available to reduce the brain damage or sequelae that result\n      from TBI. Clearly, a safe and effective treatment for concussion injury and all forms of TBI\n      would be an important development for military personnel as well as the general population.\n\n      This study will investigate the safety and tolerability of treatment with oral\n      administration of NNZ-2566 at 35 mg/kg or 70 mg/kg BID in adults with mTBI. The study also\n      will also investigate measures of efficacy during treatment."
