  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to test the feasibility and acceptability of providing an
      experiential assessment interview that targets emotional and stressful experiences in
      primary care. In this randomized, controlled trial, the investigators will compare an
      interview condition to a wait-list control condition. The investigators hypothesize that
      helping individuals first identify the links between their stress and symptoms will likely
      increase their awareness and endorsement of the link between stress and physical symptoms,
      including a willingness to engage in stress management techniques. It is also expected that
      helping raise an individual's awareness about their symptoms, followed by an experience and
      expression of unexpressed emotions is likely to influence their physical symptoms and
      psychological status.
