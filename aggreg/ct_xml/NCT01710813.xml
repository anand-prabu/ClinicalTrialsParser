        Patients who enrolled in the Pompe Registry will be enrolled in this sub-registry. include
        patients with infantile-onset Pompe disease, as well as those with late-onset Pompe
        disease.

        An approximately equal proportion of currently treated and treatment-naïve patients is
        targeted for enrollment at each site.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  the patient must be enrolled in the Pompe Registry;

          -  have a confirmed diagnosis of Pompe disease (confirmation of diagnosis is defined as
             documented GAA enzyme deficiency from any tissue source and/or documentation of 2 GAA
             gene mutations);

          -  be naïve to treatment with alglucosidase alfa (4000-L), plan to be treated with
             alglucosidase alfa, or have been treated with alglucosidase alfa for less than 2
             years.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  if the patient does not plan to receive treatment with alglucosidase alfa (4000-L
             scale)

          -  patients who have received an investigational drug (excluding alglucosidase alfa)
             within 30 days prior to signing a sub-registry consent form

          -  if they are taking or plan to take any investigational product while enrolled in the
             sub-registry.
