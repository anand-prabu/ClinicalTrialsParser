  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall purpose of the study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of ALECSAT in
      patients with relapse of GlioBlastoma Multiforme (GBM) after first line treatments (followed
      by reoperation if possible). The efficacy and safety of ALECSAT treatment is, compared to
      standard Bevacizumab/Irinotecan second line treatments for these patients.

      This study is an open-label, randomized, prospective, parallel group phase II study with
      ALECSAT compared to Bevacizumab/Irinotecan in patients with verified relapsed glioblastoma
      multiforme after or during treatment with recognised first-line treatment. After 62 PFS
      events have been recorded, an interim analysis will be conducted under the auspices of the
      Data Monitoring Committee.

      The patients in the two treatment groups will be followed for up to 62 weeks by planned
      study visits. Patients with, at least, stable disease will continue the allocated treatment
      after the study period as judged by the Investigator. Patients allocated to the
      Bevacizumab/Irinotecan (control group) will receive their treatment according to standard
      praxis, i.e. up to 16 treatment cycles with 4 weeks duration. Each cycle of
      Bevacizumab/Irinotecan consist of 2 dosing days; day 1 and day 15 in the cycle.
