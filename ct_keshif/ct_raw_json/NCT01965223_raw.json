            "textblock": "Stereotactic Ablative Body Radiotherapy (SABR) is an exciting novel radiotherapy technique\n      that is delivered over very few sessions. In the case of limited pulmonary\n      'oligometastases', SABR can result in long-term survival. It is non-invasive and associated\n      with high rates of tumour control and relatively low toxicity. Additionally, the large doses\n      of precision radiotherapy involved may evoke a strong immune response to recognise and\n      attack any remaining tumour cells. In the future, SABR may be an attractive alternative to\n      invasive surgery. There are two SABR techniques emerging in Australia; fractionated and\n      single fraction treatments. We aim to conduct the first clinical trial of SABR in patients\n      with limited pulmonary metastases testing fractionated versus single fraction treatments.\n\n      The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the toxicity, Quality of Life, clinical\n      efficacy and cost effectiveness of single fraction SABR compared to multi-fraction SABR in\n      patients with oligometastases to the lung.\n\n      The secondary aim of this study is to assess the immune response evoked by both fractionated\n      and single fraction SABR and its prognostic implications for patient outcomes."
