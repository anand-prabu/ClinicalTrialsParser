  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our aim was to establish a feasible method to prospectively register all tonsil
      surgery-related complications and to find their possible predictive factors. Our long-term
      objective is to create a surgical complication registration database, which would provide
      valuable information for quality assurance and give us a benchmarking tool to improve the
      results of this surgery in our department.

      In a six-month period all patients undergoing tonsillectomy or tonsillotomy with or without
      adenoidectomy were assessed for enrolment. Demographic and clinical data were recorded
      prospectively in a database which included 57 variables, such as age, gender,
      co-morbidities, body mass index, American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status
      Classification, indication for surgery, educational level of surgeon (consultant vs.
      resident), surgical technique, duration of operation and length of hospital stay.

      After the operation, all patients were given instructions to contact our emergency
      department (ED) if experiencing any adverse event. Incidents of postoperative complications
      were recorded during the post-surgical visits to the ED. Only complications warranting a
      visit to the outpatient department or hospital admission were registered.
