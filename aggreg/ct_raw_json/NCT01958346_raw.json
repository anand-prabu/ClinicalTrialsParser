Induction of general anesthesia causes relaxation and approximation of\n      the soft palate, base of the tongue, epiglottis, and posterior pharyngeal wall, creating\n      unfavorable anatomic changes in the pharynx for successful intubation.  The use of lingual\n      traction can assist in diminishing these problems by clearing the tongue away from the soft\n      palate and uvula and lifting the epiglottis from the posterior pharyngeal wall, especially\n      in the unanticipated difficult airway patient."
