Despite the\n      availability of effective analgesic drugs, published guidelines and educational programs for\n      Health Care Professionals the symptom is still under-diagnosed and its treatment is not\n      appropriate  in many patients.\n\n      The objective of the study is  to evaluate the efficacy of the Pac-IFicO programme  in\n      improving the quality of pain management in  hospitalised cancer patients.\n\n      This is a before-after cluster phase II study. After the before assessment, the  Pac-IFicO\n      programme will be implemented in ten medicine, oncology and respiratory disease hospital\n      wards. The same assessment will be repeated after the completion of the intervention.\n\n      The Pac-IFicO programme is a complex interventions with multiple components. It includes\n      focus group with ward professionals for identifying  possible local obstacles to optimal\n      pain control, informative material for the patients, an educational programs performed\n      through guides from the wards, and an organisational intervention to the ward.\n\n      The primary end-point of the study is the proportion of cancer patients with severe pain.\n      Secondary end-points include opioids administered in the wards, knowledge in pain\n      management, quality of pain management. We plan to  recruit about 500 cancer patients from\n      ten hospital wards. This sample size should be sufficient, after appropriate statistical\n      adjustments for clustering, to detect an absolute decrease in the proportion of cancer\n      patients with severe pain (the primary end-point) from 20% to 9%."
