      This is an open label, investigator-blinded, cross over, prospective, single center study of
      subjects with plaque psoriasis.  Taclonex® (calcipotriene 0.005% and betamethasone
      dipropionate 0.064%) Ointment  and Taclonex Scalp® (calcipotriene 0.005% and betamethasone
      dipropionate 0.064%) Topical Suspension will each be applied topically once daily.

      The primary objective is to assess the patient preference for Taclonex® (calcipotriene
      0.005% and betamethasone dipropionate 0.064%) Ointment compared to Taclonex Scalp®
      (calcipotriene 0.005% and betamethasone dipropionate 0.064%) Topical Suspension in the
      treatment of plaque psoriasis.

      The secondary objective is to assess the efficacy for Taclonex® (calcipotriene 0.005% and
      betamethasone dipropionate 0.064%) Ointment compared to Taclonex Scalp® (calcipotriene
      0.005% and betamethasone dipropionate 0.064%) Topical Suspension in the treatment of plaque
      psoriasis.

      -  Following satisfaction of entry criteria, all subjects at the Baseline/Screening visit
           will be randomized 1:1 to receive  either Taclonex® (calcipotriene 0.005% and
           betamethasone dipropionate 0.064%) Ointment or Taclonex Scalp® (calcipotriene 0.005%
           and betamethasone dipropionate 0.064%) Topical Suspension to use once daily for three
           days to affected areas of the body, excluding face and intertriginous areas.  Subjects
           will be aware of which product they are using. Investigators will remain blinded.

        -  Subjects will be randomized to use either the ointment or the scalp suspension for
           three days, then cross over to use the other product for three days.

        -  Each medication will be used within its FDA-approved label for the treatment of plaque
           psoriasis in subjects aged 18 and older.  Subjects may not treat areas of the face,
           axilla or groin in this study.

        -  Subjects will return to the study center at Day 3 (for cross over) and Day 6 (or end of
           study).  At each visit, the subject will be scored for status of the representative
           target lesion severity and have an Investigator Global Assessment of their current
           psoriasis condition.

        -  At the Day 3 and Day 6 visits the subjects will complete a questionnaire about their
           psoriasis treatment preferences.

        -  Pregnancy tests will be done on females of childbearing potential at
           Baseline/Screening.

        -  Adverse events will be monitored at each visit.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has used experimental drugs or devices at least one month prior to Baseline.

          -  Subject has used systemic corticosteroid, phototherapy, retinoids, methotrexate,

          -  Subject has used topical therapy, corticosteroid therapy,  topical vitamin D analog
             or calcineurin inhibitors or , tazarotene within two weeks prior to the Baseline

          -  Subject has a skin condition or disease that may require concurrent therapy or may
             confound the evaluation; a history of hypersensitivity to any of the formulation
