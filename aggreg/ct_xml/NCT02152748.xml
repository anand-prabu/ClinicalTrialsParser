      Summary of scientific evidence and rationale of this project:

      Integrative molecular-genetic approaches have provided important insights in the biology of
      glioblastoma. It has meanwhile become clear, that glioblastoma is not a single tumor entity
      but comprises different molecular subtypes, which are associated with a distinct
      genetic/epigenetic signature and prognosis. Multimodal treatment approaches combining radio-
      and chemotherapy as well as the recent introduction of novel antiangiogenic agents have
      resulted in increasing survival times and improved quality-of-life of glioblastoma patients.
      Yet, despite these intense treatment efforts the therapeutic efficacy in glioblastoma
      patients is limited, leading in virtually all cases to tumor recurrence and death of the
      patients.

      As only a limited fraction of glioblastoma patients undergo second neurosurgery at tumor
      recurrence (&lt; 10%), post-therapeutic samples are rare  and no systematic, large-scale
      studies exist, which address post-therapeutic morphological and molecular alterations in
      glioblastoma tumor tissue. Yet, these data would help to improve the understanding of
      mechanisms involved in therapy-resistance and tumor progression, to develop new therapeutic
      approaches and could pave the way for personalized treatment strategies.

      Objectives of the project:

      The aim of this study is to analyze systematically morphological and molecular changes
      associated with glioblastoma progression and therapy-resistance in matched pre- and
      post-therapeutic glioblastoma samples.

      The following primary aims will be addressed:

        1. Morphological characterisation of changes in a large series of matched glioblastoma
           tissues pertaining to i. Vascularization and hypoxia-mediated factors ii. Tumor
           necrosis and chemoradiation-induced necrosis iii. Inflammatory response iv. Tumor
           cellularity and proliferation v. Tumor cell phenotype after treatment e.g.
           glial-mesenchymal transition

        2. Molecular analyses

           i. Transcriptomic, DNA methylation and genomic profiling will be performed to detect
           changes in gene expression, methylation and copy number aberrations in post-therapeutic
           as compared to pre-therapeutic tumor tissue. ii. The relationship between the
           transcriptomic, DNA methylation and genomic profiles will be analyzed.

        3. Exploratory analysis of associations between morphological and molecular changes in a
           screening set of 30 glioblastoma cases (with available fresh frozen tissues at first
           and second surgery) and subsequent validation of relevant findings in a larger
           glioblastoma cohort (150 cases with matched formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues)
           by appropriate methods including immunohistochemistry,
           fluorescence-in-situ-hybridization, and sequencing.

        4. Special attention will be paid to gender-specific patterns of therapy-related changes
           and tumor progression.

        All newly diagnosed GB patients will be identified in the Austrian population since 2007 -
        after the current firstline therapy has become standard, in order to warrant a
        homogenously treated patient cohort. GB patients with multiple resections will be
        identified.
