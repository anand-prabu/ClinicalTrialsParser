In animal studies, AZT has prevented the\n      development of infections after exposure of the animals to a retrovirus (the HIV is a\n      retrovirus). In patients with AIDS, AZT has been effective in delaying the progression of\n      the disease. For these reasons a trial of AZT is indicated."

Treatment with AZT should start as soon as possible, but no later than 5 days, after\n      exposure to the HIV. Blood and urine samples for various studies will be taken at intervals\n      during the 42-day treatment period, and blood samples will be taken every 3 months for 1\n      year and every 6 months for 2 years and tested for signs of HIV infection (HIV antibody\n      determinations)."
