      The immune system is central to human health and its impairment can have serious
      consequences.

      One of the hallmarks of aging is the progressive loss of immune function  exposing older
      people to increased risk from infectious diseases that would not normally be more than an
      inconvenience.  This project will use state-of-the-art technology developed by the Stanford
      Human Immune Monitoring Center to survey older individuals for signs of immune system aging
      and to gather information about the factors associated with the decline of immune function.

      At the initial study visit each year, volunteers will provide information about their
      current health and health history.  Vital signs will be assesed and the volunteer will be
      immunized with the current licensed seasonal influenza vaccine.   Follow-up visits will be
      conducted on Day 6-8 and Day 28, with a phone call at 6 months post-immunization.  A blood
      sample will be collected pre-immunization and at each follow-up visit.  Volunteers will be
      followed for up to 8 years.

      Our main effort will be to survey elderly and younger control subject responses to influenza
      vaccination using our functional cellular array technology.  We will compare these results
      with serum antibody responses from day 28 blood samples measuring hemagglutination
      inhibition (HAI) titers against the vaccination strains.  This is the accepted standard for
      determining whether there is an effective antibody response to influenza vaccine antigens.
      In addition, we will follow-up subjects yearly by phone to ask whether they have experienced
      any influenza-like illness episodes or serious adverse events following immunization.  In
      this way, we will be able to correlate the accepted standard assay for an appropriate
      antibody response to influenza vaccination with our new assay, and also begin what we hope
      will be a valuable longitudinal study of immune responsiveness in the elderly.

      We also think that there will be a T-cell array &quot;signature&quot; of immune senescence both in
      terms of the number of responding cells and their cytokine profile that will both allow a
      more rapid read-out of this condition (day 6-8 after vaccination) and give some mechanistic
      clues regarding this phenomenon.  In addition, we want to obtain as much information as
      possible with these samples and thus propose to do the following assays:

        -  Subject Analysis - We will use fluorescence activated cell sorting to determine the
           precise number of each white blood cell type in a given patient sample and their
           activation state (B cells, T cells, NK cells, gamma-delta T cells, monocytes, dendritic
           cells).  We are particularly interested in whether the reports of increased CD8+CD28- T
           cells or decreased gamma-delta T cells  correlate with immunosenescence.  This subset
           analysis also will be important for normalizing the gene expression data.

        -  Gene Expression Analysis- We will collect part of the blood sample in a PAX gene tube
           and prepare probes from the mRNA for gene expression analysis using Agilent microarrays
           that survey global gene expression.  This will tell us if there is a particular &quot;gene
           expression signature&quot; that correlates with immune senescence.

        -  Serum Cytokine Analysis - As there have been reports of changes in the serum cytokine
           repertoire in older people, we will survey serum samples for 26 different cytokines
           using the Panomics/Luminex system now running the Human Immune Monitoring Center at
           Stanford.

        -  Monocyte Activation Potential - As antigen presentation capacity may also be a variable
           influencing the robustness of the adaptive immune response, in Year 1 we examined
           circulating monocytes as a source of antigen presenting cells. We examined the
           potential of these cells to respond to in vitro activating stimuli ( cytokines and LPS)
           as measured by expression of cell surface activation markers (DR, CD86, CD40) and
           intracellular phosphoproteins ( eg. pp38, pSTATs). Expression of these markers was
           measured by FACS analysis.
