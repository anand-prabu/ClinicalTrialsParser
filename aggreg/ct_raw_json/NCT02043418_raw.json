            "textblock": "The follow-up of HIV infected children is an important part of their access to\n      antiretroviral drugs. This therapeutic follow-up has an impact on infant morbidity and\n      mortality and remains challenging due to its complexity (multi-drug therapy), the use of\n      galenic forms that are not well adapted to children, the risks of toxicity and their\n      prolonged administration, and the evolution of this syndrome in the patients' parents.\n      Currently, while access to ARV is being ameliorated for children in Sub-Saharan Africa,\n      little information is available on medium to long-term evolution of early treated HIV\n      infected infants on ARV treatment. In Cameroon, the PEDIACAM ANRS12140 study has assessed\n      for a period of 2 years, the impact of early ARV treatment in HIV infected children and\n      their humoral responses to EPI vaccines. The prolongation to 5 years of follow-up of these\n      children, including HIV non-infected children is a unique opportunity to describe in terms\n      of medium to long-term response: the clinical and immunovirological prognosis of the HIV\n      infection in children and to identify factors associated with treatment failure.\n\n      This is a prospective longitudinal, observational, national multi-centred study including\n      two groups of infants: one group of HIV infected infants treated early, and one group of HIV\n      non-infected infants (born to either HIV infected or HIV non-infected mothers).\n      Participation in the study will be proposed to all the infants included in PEDIACAM\n      ANRS12140, if possible before the age of 2 years. Only children whose parents or legal\n      guardians consent to this continuation of the follow-up will be included. The children\n      participating in the study will be followed up every 6 months until the age of 5 years\n      (duration of prolongation of study is 3 years). In the course of each visit, a clinical\n      examination will be carried out as well as a complete laboratory examination. Antiretroviral\n      treatment will be in line with the national recommendations and guidelines. The PEDIACAM\n      ANRS12225 two year follow-up concerns 340 children divided into 200 non-infected infants and\n      140 HIV positive infants. Population size has been calculated taking into account possible\n      deaths, loss to follow-up and refusal to participate.\n\n      This cohort will enable us to answer the questions that arise regarding the long-term\n      outcomes of HIV infected children in terms of clinical prognosis and immunology, and the\n      impact of family environment and lifestyle on ARV treatment adherence. It will also aid in\n      structuring the follow-up of children treated with ARVs in Cameroon. Furthermore, a study on\n      the response to vaccines will enable the identification of possible failures and to propose,\n      if necessary, an adjustment of the vaccine calendar."
