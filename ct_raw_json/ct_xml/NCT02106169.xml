  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine whether therapeutic education can improve the
      quality of life of the child from 8 to 12 years old suffering of food allergy.

      This study also show us if therapeutic education has an effect on the quality of life of
      child's family.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Food allergy affects 5 - 6% of children. The major risk is anaphylaxis by ingestion of the
      forbidden allergen. The child and his family have to learn to deal with this risk.
      Therapeutic education can help the children to take care of their allergy.

      Food allergy limits the child socialisation, leads to anxiety/fear, and impairs
      health-related quality of life. In the day of today, there is no cure treatment. Also,
      improve the quality of life is one of the goals of the food allergy management.

      The impact of therapeutic education on quality of life has never been studied. We intend to
      study the impact of therapeutic education on the quality of life of children from 8 to 12
      years old with IgE mediated food allergy.

      Our hypothesis is the quality of life can be improved by therapeutic education.
