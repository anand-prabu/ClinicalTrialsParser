This\n      combination strategy will address the acute inflammatory component of the disease (anakinra)\n      and protect against development of hepatorenal syndrome (pentoxifylline), one of the most\n      frequent causes of death in severe acute alcoholic hepatitis, and improve gut mucosal\n      integrity (zinc supplements). The primary outcome will be 6 month mortality rate.
