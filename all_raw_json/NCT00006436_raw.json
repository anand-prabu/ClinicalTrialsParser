A bone marrow biopsy is repeated after cycle 2 if a biopsy was initially positive on\n           screening for participation in the study.\n\n        -  Anti-HIV therapy is stopped before chemotherapy begins and is restarted when EPOCH-R\n           treatment ends.\n\n        -  Patients are monitored for treatment response with blood tests and imaging scans at\n           baseline, when treatment ends, 2 months after treatment ends and then every 3 to 6\n           months for a total of 24 months following chemotherapy."

Following cycle 2, CT, positron emission tomography scans (PET), and bone\n      marrow biopsies (if initially positive) will be performed.\n\n      At the conclusion of the study, we will estimate whether the number of cycles can be reduced\n      using the paradigm.  If the cumulative number of patients to relapse exceeds 25 percent by 6\n      months, the study will be closed.\n\n      Following the completion of chemotherapy, restaging will be performed 2 months following the\n      end of treatment, then every 3 months for one year, every 6 months for one year, then every\n      12 months until relapse, death, or loss to follow up.\n\n      Anti-HIV therapy will be suspended prior to initiation of the chemotherapy and optimum\n      therapy will be reinitiated after all the cycles have been administered.\n\n      To study the effects of treatment approach on parameters of HIV disease, measurements of CD4\n      cells and viral loads will be made at baseline and at the completion of therapy, and then 2\n      months following the end of treatment, and then every 3-6 months for a total of 24 months\n      following chemotherapy."
