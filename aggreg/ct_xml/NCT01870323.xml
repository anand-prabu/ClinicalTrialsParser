      In an effort to address the physical inactivity crisis among adolescents, the present study
      will examine the efficacy of using an already established Web-based social networking

      In an effort to address the physical inactivity crisis among adolescents, the present study
      will examine the efficacy of using an already established Web-based social networking
      platform (i.e., Facebook) to deliver a physical activity intervention to adolescents.  The
      primary objectives of this trial are to 1) test the efficacy of a social media-delivered
      physical activity program for increasing lifestyle physical activity in adolescents, and 2)
      determine the effectiveness of a physical activity intervention based on social cognitive
      principles in comparison to a simple information-based physical activity condition.
      Additional objectives include an examination of how program participation may influence
      psychosocial health and how these changes affect physical activity patterns in youth.
