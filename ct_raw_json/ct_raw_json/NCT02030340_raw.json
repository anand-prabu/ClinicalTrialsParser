Water filled tube -systems are the most commonly used and\n      should be regarded as the contemporary standard. A water filled system is however sensitive\n      to tube and or patient movement artefacts and prone to erroneous calibration. Air charged\n      catheters are less sensitive to patient and especially tubing- movements, and calibrate\n      easier. However, in vitro tests have demonstrated that air charged catheters respond\n      somewhat slower and relatively damped, especially to rapid pressure changes as in\n      (simulated) coughing, in comparison with water filled systems. The clinical relevance of\n      these observations is unknown.\n\n      This is a study to compare the technical reliability and clinical applicability of the two\n      types of catheter systems for cystometry in a synchronous double catheter testing procedure\n      in a prospective group or patients scheduled for urodynamic investigation."
