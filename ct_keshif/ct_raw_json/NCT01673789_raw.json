The Stem Cell Educator functions as part of a closed-loop system that circulates a patient's blood through a blood cell separator, briefly co-cultures the patient's lymphocytes with CB-SCs in vitro, and returns the educated lymphocytes to the patient's circulation. CB-SCs tightly attached to interior surfaces in the device, and only the CB-SC-educated autologous lymphocytes are returned to the subjects. The Stem Cell Educator therapy requires only two venipunctures with minimal pain, and does not introduce stem cells or reagents into patients."

            "textblock": "Alopecia Areata (AA) is one of the most common T cell-mediated autoimmune diseases, leading\n      to the chronic and relapsing hair loss. The prevalence of AA worldwide is 0.1 to 0.2%,\n      affecting an estimated 5.3 million people in the United States. To date, the clinical\n      therapies are limited and disappointed for the treatment of AA. Alternative approaches are\n      needed. Increasing evidence demonstrates that stem cells possess the function of immune\n      modulation. We established the Stem Cell Educator therapy by using cord blood-derived\n      multipotent stem cells (CB-SCs)(Zhao Y, et al. BMC Medicine 2012). A closed-loop system that\n      circulates a patient's blood through a blood cell separator, briefly co-cultures the\n      patient's lymphocytes with adherent CB-SCs in vitro, and returns the educated lymphocytes\n      (but not the CB-SCs) to the patient's circulation. Our clinical trial reveals that a single\n      treatment with the Stem Cell Educator provides lasting reversal of autoimmunity that allows\n      regeneration of islet beta cells and improvement of metabolic control in subjects with\n      long-standing type 1 diabetes (T1D), which is another most common T cell-mediated autoimmune\n      disorder in the United States. Here, we develop and explore the therapeutic effectiveness of\n      Stem Cell Educator therapy in AA patients."
