    <textblock>
      Study the effectiveness of the treatment detachment of retinal pigment epithelium secondary
      to polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy. Efficacy will be assessed by regression of polyp area
      after twelve months, compared to baseline. Treatment under study is a triple therapy with:
      1) reduced-fluence photodynamic therapy (PDT), 2) intravitreal (IVT) triamcinolone and, 3)
      IVT ranibizumab, for the treatment of detachment of the retinal pigment epithelium (PED)
      secondary to Polypoidal Choroidal Vasculopathy (PCV).

After 10 days, patients will be subjected to an injection of Intra-vitreous ranibizumab (0.5 mg/0.05 ml). After this first injection, Intra-vitreous ranibizumab will be repeated twice, on a monthly basis, for a total of three injections</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with PCV associated with PED near the polypoidal lesion recently diagnosed,
             documented by FA, ICGA and OCT.

          -  Visual acuity between 20/40 and 20/400.

          -  Patients older than 50 years (both genders).

          -  Women must be postmenopausal for at least 12 months or surgically sterile.

          -  No previous treatment in the study eye.

          -  Accept and sign the informed consent.

          -  No condition that prevents the monitoring of the patient for one year.

          -  Transparent ocular media and adequate pupillary dilation to allow good images of the
             fundus.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Blepharitis or external eye infection.
