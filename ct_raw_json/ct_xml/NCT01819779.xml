      The purpose of this study is to assess the pharmacokinetic characteristics of valsartan and
      S-amlodipine after single oral administration of Exforge tab. 10/160mg, a combination
      formulation of valsartan and amlodipine as reference drug and Lodivixx tab. 5/160mg, a
      combination formulation of valsartan and S-amlodipine as test drug in healthy male adults.
      Additionally the safety and tolerability of two drugs will be evaluated.
