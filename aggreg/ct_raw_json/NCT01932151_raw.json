Type-1 HRS is often precipitated by a bacterial infection, though it may occur\n      spontaneously.  It has been demonstrated that vasoconstrictor agents plus albumin are\n      effective in the reversal of the renal failure.  A large number of studies have shown that\n      terlipressin improves renal function in patients with type 1 HRS; treatment is effective in\n      50-75% of patients approximately.  Currently there are no specific studies about the\n      treatment of type-1 HRS with ongoing infections."
