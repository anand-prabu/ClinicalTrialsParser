Mature gametocytes are responsible for malaria\n      transmission. Artemisinin based combination therapies (ACTs) has limited effect on the young\n      gametocytes. Primaquine is able to clear mature gametocytes that remain after treatment with\n      ACTs. Complete clearance of mature gametocytes will depend on the ideal time primaquine is\n      given after ACT. It is important therefore that is administered at optimal time in order to\n      have significant impact on clearing gametocytes to interrupt malaria transmission. An\n      additional consideration is operational administration of Primaquine and compliance both of\n      which are likely to be enhanced if the drug is administered on the day of diagnosis.\n\n      In this study, the investigators aim to determine optimal timing of primaquine\n      administration in addition to ACT by comparing administration on day 0 with administration\n      on day 2.\n\n      The investigators' primary end points are gametocyte prevalence and density by microscopy\n      and Quantitative Nucleic Acid Based Amplification (QT-NASBA) on day 14, which will be\n      compared between the two primaquine treatment arms."
