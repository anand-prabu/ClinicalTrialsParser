Disease control rate is defined as the combination of complete (CR) and\n      partial (PR) response and stable disease (SD).  The investigators further propose that this\n      infusion of donor NK cells will influence the development of particular NK and T cell\n      subtypes which will provide immediate/long-term tumor surveillance, infectious monitoring,\n      and durable engraftment.\n\n      Patients with high-risk solid tumors (Ewings Sarcoma, Neuroblastoma and Rhabdomyosarcoma)\n      who have either measurable or unmeasurable disease and have met eligibility will be enrolled\n      on this trial for a goal enrollment of 20 patients over 4 years."
