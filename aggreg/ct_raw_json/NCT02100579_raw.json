Fast track\n      recovery programs including early therapy protocols and early hospital discharge are being\n      implemented at various hospitals. The postoperative analgesic pain regimen should enhance\n      functional recovery in addition to providing efficient analgesia with minimal side effects.\n      Adductor canal blockade is commonly used to provide postoperative analgesia for total knee\n      arthroplasty (TKA) surgery. The investigators hypothesize that an ultrasound guided adductor\n      canal block will lower narcotic consumption and improved overall satisfaction compared to\n      ultrasound guided sham block with normal saline (placebo) for patients undergoing minimally\n      invasive TKA surgery."
