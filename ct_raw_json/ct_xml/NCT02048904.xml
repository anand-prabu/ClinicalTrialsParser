  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The people being asked to participate in this study have type 2 diabetes and abnormal levels
      of protein in their urine. This indicates that they are starting to develop diabetic kidney
      disease. The standard treatment for this is the use of one of two blood pressure medicines,
      either an ACE inhibitor or ARB. However, these medicines are not always completely effective
      in stopping/reversing the kidney disease. Some studies have previously suggested that
      another type of medicine, called sitagliptin, normal used to treat diabetes may also help
      prevent diabetic kidney disease from getting worse.

      This study is being performed to test the effectiveness of sitagliptin as compared to a
      placebo, along with a stable dose of an ACE inhibitor or ARB, to determine whether or not it
      will reduce protein levels in their urine. Protein levels in the urine are a marker of the
      severity of kidney disease.
