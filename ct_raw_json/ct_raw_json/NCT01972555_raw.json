CE-marked and FDA-approved mechanical and\n      bioprosthetic aortic valves (conventional stented or sutureless bioprostheses) will be\n      implanted. Transthoracic echocardiography will be performed before surgery, and at day 1, 4,\n      and 40. Echocardiographic parameters as well as preoperative clinical characteristics and\n      postoperative clinical outcomes will be registered. Routine blood sampling will be performed\n      pre- and postoperatively. All available data will be collected prospectively.
