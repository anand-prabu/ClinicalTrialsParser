CNS imaging and cerebrospinal fluid sampling are not\n             mandatory in the absence of a clinical suspicion of lymphomatous involvement of the\n             CNS.\n\n          -  Current infection with HIV, Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C. Patients will have serologic\n             testing performed during screening for HIV and Hepatitis B and C.  Any serologic\n             results suggestive of an ongoing viral infection will be further investigated as\n             necessary to clarify the patient's status.\n\n          -  Impairment of gastrointestinal (GI) function or GI disease that may significantly\n             alter the absorption of CPI-0610, including any unresolved nausea, vomiting, or\n             diarrhea that is CTCAE grade >1.\n\n          -  Impaired cardiac function or clinically significant cardiac diseases, including any\n             of the following:\n\n               -  Acute myocardial infarction or angina pectoris \u2264 6 months prior to starting\n                  study drug\n\n               -  Serum cardiac troponin (cTn) level \u2265 99% percentile of the upper reference limit\n\n               -  QTcF > 470 msec on the screening ECG\n\n               -  Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < 40%\n\n          -  Uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia (patients with rate-controlled atrial fibrillation\n             are not excluded.)\n\n          -  Any other concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled concomitant medical condition that\n             could compromise participation in the study (e.g., clinically significant pulmonary\n             disease, clinically significant neurological disorder, active or uncontrolled\n             infection)\n\n          -  Systemic anti-cancer treatment or radiotherapy less than 2 weeks before the first\n             dose of CPI-0610\n\n          -  Radioimmunotherapy (e.g., 131I-tositumomab, 90Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan) less than 6\n             weeks before the first dose of CPI-0610\n\n          -  Treatment with an investigational small molecule less than 2 weeks before the first\n             dose of CPI-0610.  In addition, the first dose of CPI-0610 should not occur before a\n             period equal to or greater than 5 half-lives of the small molecule investigational\n             agent has elapsed.\n\n          -  Treatment with a therapeutic antibody less than 4 weeks before the first dose of\n             CPI-0610.  A minimum 2-week period between the last treatment with a therapeutic\n             antibody and the first dose of CPI-0610 may be permitted in patients with rapidly\n             progressive or aggressive subtypes of lymphoma following discussion with the medical\n             monitor.\n\n          -  Treatment with medications that are known to be strong inhibitors or inducers of\n             CYP450 enzymes.\n\n          -  Treatment with medications that are known to carry a risk of Torsades de Pointes.\n\n          -  Immunosuppressive treatment that cannot be discontinued both prior to study entry and\n             for the duration of the study. Oral prednisone at a dose of 10 mg or less per day is\n             allowed, as are other oral corticosteroids given at glucocorticoid-equivalent doses.\n             Topical, nasal and inhaled corticosteroids are also allowed.\n\n          -  Pregnant or lactating women\n\n          -  Women of child-bearing potential and men with reproductive potential, if they are\n             unwilling to use adequate contraception while on study therapy and for 3 months\n             thereafter\n\n          -  Patients unwilling or unable to comply with this study protocol"
