Epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine\n      kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) show great efficacy in patients with advanced non-small cell\n      lung cancer (NSCLC) with EGFR mutation. Icotinib is a novel EGFR-TKI developed by a group of\n      Chinese scientists. In the phase III ICOGEN trial, icotinib had non-inferiority efficacy to\n      gefitinib with better safety. In phase II trial, chemotherapy followed by 6-month gefitinib\n      as adjuvant therapy can confer longer disease-free survival compared with chemotherapy alone\n      in patients with resected stage IIIA-N2 non-small cell lung cancer harboring EGFR mutations.\n      This study is to studying 6-month or 12-month icotinib following chemotherapy to see how\n      well it works compared to chemotherapy in treating patients with resected stage IIA-IIIA\n      NSCLC harboring EGFR mutation."
