            "textblock": "Background: Contemporary therapy in patients with an on-going ST-elevation myocardial\n      infarction (STEMI) is to reperfuse the ischemic myocardium as soon as possible to reduce\n      infarct size and associated complications. A recent pilot-study showed a significant\n      reduction in infarct size by the induction of pre-reperfusion hypothermia.\n\n      Objectives: To demonstrate a reduction in infarct size/myocardium at risk (measured by\n      magnet resonance imaging) in patients with ST-Elevation myocardial infarction by strategic\n      temperature management with the use of external cooling pads in the out-of-hospital setting\n      and the continuation with cold saline and central venous catheter cooling in hospital. In a\n      parallel translational study, the molecular effects of rapid and early cooling on\n      inflammatory processes at the culprit lesion site will be defined.\n\n      Methodology: Randomized, prospective, controlled trial Number of subjects: 120 patients (60\n      per group) Investigational medical device: EMCOOLS flex pad is an external cooling pad, that\n      consists of multiple cooling cells filled with a patented cooling gel. EMCOOLS flex pad will\n      be used in the out-of-hospital setting to initiate cooling. The Philips RTx Endovascular\n      System\u2122 is an endovascular thermal control system that circulates cooled saline through an\n      indwelling central venous catheter in a closed-loop manner. It will be used in combination\n      with 1-2 litres of intravenous cold saline to induce hypothermia below 35 degrees Celsius.\n\n      Duration: One hour after successful revascularization the cooling procedure will be stopped,\n      subjects will be covered with a blanket and are allowed to passively re-warm. Clinical\n      follow-up for 180 days.\n\n      Primary endpoint: Myocardial infarct size (as a percentage of myocardium at risk) assessed\n      by cardiac MRI at 4\u00b12 days. Influence of target temperature management on coronary\n      macrophages and monocytes as well as impact on plasma levels of immune cell chemotaxis and\n      activation."
