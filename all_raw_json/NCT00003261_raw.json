Combining radiation therapy with chemotherapy may kill more\n      tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving methotrexate and zidovudine\n      together with radiation therapy works in treating patients with HIV-related primary central\n      nervous system lymphoma."

Patients\n      receive 3 courses of therapy. Following chemotherapy, patients receive radiation therapy to\n      the lesion site daily.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: This study will accrue 14 patients."
