            "textblock": "Observational studies support an association between bottle feeding beyond 15 to 18 months\n      of age and lower socioeconomic status, excessive milk intake, dental caries, iron\n      deficiency, behavioral issues and obesity. Yet many parents, particularly those from low\n      socioeconomic households, choose to feed their children by bottle much beyond this age.\n      Recognizing the need for further educational interventions for bottle feeding, the TARGet\n      Kids! Research Collaboration recently developed a 5-minute bottle weaning educational\n      intervention for the 9 month well-child visit. We undertook a pragmatic randomized\n      controlled trial to evaluate its effectiveness involving 251 children recruited through\n      TARGet Kids! (PMID: 20624802) We hypothesize that by 7 years of age, children randomized to\n      the bottle weaning intervention will have better oral health status, higher iron stores,\n      lower body mass index (BMI), and fewer behavioral issues. If the 5 minute bottle weaning\n      educational intervention should demonstrate lasting effects on health at 7 years of age,\n      this simple intervention could have important implications for the long term health and\n      development of Canadian children."
