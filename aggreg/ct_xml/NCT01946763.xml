  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The recovery and emergences from anesthesia is a critical phase. Previous studies focused on
      pharmological and anesthetics techniques to improve the quality of this stage (duration,
      complications).

      In this study, our first aim is to test the impact of pre operative education on the post
      operative recovery for morbidly obese patient  underwent laparoscopic bariatric surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of our study is to compare post operative immediate recovery and emergence for
      educated and non educated morbidly obese patients underwent laparoscopic bariatric surgery.

      Elligibles patients are informed and consented by  anesthesiologist. Patients are randomized
      in 2 groups (G1: educated, G2:non-educated) Patient of G1 are educated in OR before starting
      anesthesia. This education includes :  information about anesthesia emergence, recovery and
      extubation.

      Anesthesia and education are conducted by the same anesthesiologist. All patients are
      operated by the same surgeon. All patients receive same balanced general anesthesia
      protocol. The recovery starts immediately after the end of the procedure, when the patient
      has BIS ≥90 and TOF≥9.

      Recovery assessment and data recording is done by a blinded anesthesiologist.
