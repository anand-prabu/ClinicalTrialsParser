  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A non-randomized, prospective, global clinical trial of the Avinger  Pantheris System, an
      atherectomy device that provides directional visualization and imaging as an adjunct to
      fluoroscopy  to aid removal of plaque in diseased lower extremity arteries.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial will enroll up to 173 subjects diagnosed with peripheral arterial disease of the
      lower extremities at up to 20 sites (up to 3 international sites), including 133 Intention
      to Treat subjects and up to 2 additional Roll-In subjects at each site (up to 40 Roll-In
      subjects total). The primary disease must be located in reference vessel diameters ≥ 2.5 mm
      and ≤ 7.0 mm.  Trial success is focused on safety including rates of major adverse events
      through 6 months as adjudicated by a Clinical Events Committee.  Effectiveness will be
      evaluated using technical success, defined as the percent of target lesions that have a
      residual diameter stenosis &lt;50% post-treatment with the Pantheris device alone as assessed
      by Angiographic Core Lab.

    <description>The primary safety endpoint is defined as freedom from a composite of major adverse events (MAE) through 6-Month follow-up as adjudicated by an independent Clinical Events Committee (CEC). Individual MAEs include:
Cardiovascular related death
Unplanned, major index limb amputation
Clinically driven target lesion revascularization (TLR)
Myocardial infarction
