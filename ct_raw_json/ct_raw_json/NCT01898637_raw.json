The investigators propose to evaluate a simple, non-invasive clinical tool\n      to help rule out PE.  The investigators plan to measure the oxygen saturation of 40\n      consecutive patients with newly-diagnosed PE (within 60 minutes of diagnosis) and 80 matched\n      controls who do not have a PE.  Trained, blinded Respiratory Therapists will record each\n      patient's oxygen saturation before, during, and after a 2-minute period of deep inspirations\n      (vital capacity [the maximal amount of air that can be inhaled, measured in milliliters])\n      using an incentive spirometer.  The investigators' central hypothesis is that persons with a\n      PE will not respond to augmented pulse oximetry and will not significantly improve or\n      normalize their oxygen saturation."
