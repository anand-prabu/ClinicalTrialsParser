            "textblock": "ChAd63 METRAP and MVA METRAP are investigational vaccines for malaria which have been\n      studied in clinical trials for 4 years, and 10 years, respectively. These vaccines are\n      inactivated viruses which have been modified so that they cannot reproduce in humans.\n      Genetic information has been added to make them express proteins of the malaria parasite so\n      that they stimulate an immune response against malaria. This trial examines whether a\n      compound called Matrix M\u2122 can be used in efforts to improve on how well the vaccines work at\n      preventing malaria.\n\n      Matrix M\u2122 is a vaccine adjuvant, a compound used to improve the immune responses to\n      vaccines. In this trial, Matrix M\u2122 will be combined with each of the vaccines. The\n      objectives are to assess the safety of the vaccines when combined with Matrix M\u2122, and to\n      determine what effect Matrix M\u2122 has on the immune responses to the vaccines.\n\n      We will assess the safety of the vaccines (ChAd63 METRAP combined with Matrix M\u2122\u037e and MVA\n      METRAP combined with Matrix M\u2122) by administering them to healthy volunteers and monitoring\n      them for 6 months in total. Eight volunteers will receive the vaccines with the low dose of\n      Matrix M\u2122, eight will receive the vaccines with the standard dose of Matrix M\u2122, and six\n      volunteers will receive the vaccines alone as a comparison group. We will also look at what\n      effect Matrix M\u2122 has on the immune responses to the vaccines, as measured from blood tests.\n      Volunteers will have study visits to the Clinical Centre for Vaccinology and Tropical\n      Medicine on the Churchill Hospital site, Oxford, where they will have vaccinations, have\n      blood taken to monitor safety and measure immune responses to vaccination, and be monitored\n      for symptoms/side effects from vaccination."
