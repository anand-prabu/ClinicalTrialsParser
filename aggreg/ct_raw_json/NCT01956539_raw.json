In addition, the therapeutic management changes\n      regularly.\n\n      New European recommendations (endorsed by the French Society of Cardiology = FSC) were\n      published in May 2012. Many therapeutic approaches are being evaluated. The course of care\n      and how to take non-drug load (network monitoring, rehabilitation ...) have become important\n      issues that have hardly been analyzed by existing records.\n\n      This also leads to better define the different forms of this disease, their natural history\n      and methods of management applied in real life. The register of FSC follows the registry of\n      the European Society of Cardiology (ESC)\"Heart Failure (HF) Long Term\" (CCTIRS No.\n      11.355bis) with inclusions will be completed in November 2012. This new study aims to\n      generate more accurate data on a number of points and be more representative for a wider\n      selection of patients, the French level."
