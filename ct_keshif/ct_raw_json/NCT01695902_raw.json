Plasma levels of levonorgestrel (LNG) were also evaluated after\n      various periods of time. The residual amounts of LNG in the devices were finally measured\n      after withdrawal at completion of the study. Plasma levels of LNG and residual amounts of\n      LNG were compared between the two treatment groups. Contraceptive effect of Levosert was\n      estimated by Pearl Index."
