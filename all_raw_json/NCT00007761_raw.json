The major\n      characteristics of this program are that it emphasizes (1) aggressive guideline-driven\n      pharmacotherapy, (2) continuity of care with identified primary mental health nurse\n      clinicians supported by psychiatrist back-up, and (3) patient education to improve treatment\n      alliance and illness management skills.\n\n      Patients with bipolar disorder will be randomly assigned to either standard care or the high\n      intensity ambulatory program for three years.  Outcome variables will cover three distinct\n      domains:  disease-specific outcome (number, length, and severity of manic and depressive\n      episodes), functional outcome (social and occupational role function and subjective quality\n      of life), and total treatment costs (direct treatment costs and indirect costs of illness).\n      Preliminary data indicate that these domains are related but not redundant.  Each of these\n      is relevant to patient well-being and to VHA management."
