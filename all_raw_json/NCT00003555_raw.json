Chemoprotective drugs, such as amifostine, may protect normal\n      cells from the side effects of chemotherapy.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of paclitaxel plus chemoprotection with\n      amifostine in treating patients with recurrent or refractory solid tumors."

Assess tumor response\n      rate and survival in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of paclitaxel. Patients receive amifostine IV over\n      5 minutes or less on day 0, followed by paclitaxel IV over 1 hour once a week for 6 weeks\n      followed by 2 weeks of rest. Patients with complete or partial response may receive\n      additional courses of therapy. Cohorts of 3-5 patients each receive increasing doses of\n      paclitaxel. The maximum tolerated dose is defined as the dose level prior to the cohort at\n      which 1 of 3-5 patients experience dose limiting toxicity.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 20 patients will be accrued for this study."
