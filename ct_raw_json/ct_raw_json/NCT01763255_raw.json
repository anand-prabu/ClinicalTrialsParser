Most of these\n      problems occur as the baby grows in the womb, but they can happen at any time during the\n      first 2 years of life, while the baby's brain is still developing.Bone marrow derived stem\n      cells are known as a effective therapy.\n\n      In this study the investigators evaluate the side effect of multiple intrathecal injection\n      of bone marrow stem cell in patients with cerebral palsy."
