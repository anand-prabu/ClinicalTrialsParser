Drugs used in\n      chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel, carboplatin, and fluorouracil, work in different ways to\n      stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Giving radiation therapy with\n      chemotherapy and giving them before surgery may shrink the tumor so that it can be removed\n      during surgery.\n\n      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving radiation therapy together with\n      combination chemotherapy followed by esophagectomy works in treating patients with locally\n      advanced cancer of the esophagus or gastroesophageal junction."

Beginning on day 1 of chemotherapy, patients\n      undergo radiotherapy to the esophagus 5 days a week for 5 weeks. Treatment continues in the\n      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with stable or responding\n      disease at 4-8 weeks after completion of radiotherapy undergo esophagectomy and complete\n      dissection of the mediastinal and perigastric lymph nodes. Beginning 8 weeks after surgery,\n      patients who underwent curative resection may receive a maximum of 2 additional courses of\n      paclitaxel and carboplatin in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, before chemotherapy on days 1 and 22, and within 2\n      weeks before surgery.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 4 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study."
