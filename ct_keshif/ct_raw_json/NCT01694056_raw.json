In the field of obesity and blood lipids soy\n      protein is well-studied and appreciated; it improves circulating blood lipids and is\n      associated with weight reduction. The effect of soy on insulin resistance, glucose\n      homeostasis and the metabolic syndrome is less frequently studied. However, several\n      molecular mechanisms of action of soy protein make it a promising approach."

Secondly, the present study will evaluate whether\n      reduced low-grade inflammation is a possible mechanism underlying the improvement in insulin\n      resistance and glucose homeostasis. Finally, it will be assessed whether soy protein has\n      beneficial effects on components of the metabolic syndrome, such as cardio-metabolic risk\n      factors, blood lipid profile, blood pressure and endothelial function, fat storage in the\n      liver and gene-expression in subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue.\n\n      Study design: Single-blind, cross-over strictly-controlled dietary intervention."
