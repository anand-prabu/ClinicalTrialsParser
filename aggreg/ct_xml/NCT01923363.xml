  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Worldwide rates of obesity have doubled in the last 30 years, and obesity has been
      associated as a risk factor for hospital-acquired infections and increased occurrence of
      death in critically-ill patients.  Piperacillin/tazobactam is a commonly prescribed
      antibiotic for critically ill patients with an infection, however, limited information
      exists for dosing this drug in obese patients.  In these limited reports, standard doses of
      piperacillin/tazobactam given to the small number of obese patients resulted in lower blood
      concentrations, which could lead to inadequate killing of bacteria.  The purpose of this
      study is to compare blood concentrations from standard piperacillin/tazobactam dosing
      compared to higher dosing regimens in obese patients.  This study will also include
      information on the safety and tolerability of the higher dose regimens.  The study
      investigators believe that the higher dosing regimen will produce adequate blood levels in
      obese patients and will not add any more risk of harm to obese patients receiving this
      higher dose.
