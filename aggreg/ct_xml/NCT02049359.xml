  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the impact of two-way short message service (SMS)
      on glycemic control in low-income, poorly-controlled adult diabetic patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This single-center, unblinded, prospective randomized controlled trial will enroll adult
      diabetic patients of the Wilson Community Health Center (Wilson, NC) living below 200% of
      2013 poverty level with a serum hemoglobin A1C &gt;9% and who currently own a mobile device
      with text messaging capacity.  After written informed consent has been obtained, subjects
      will be randomized to intervention or control group (1:2), stratified based on insulin
      initiation within 1 week of study inclusion. Participants randomized to the intervention
      group will be further divided into subgroups as &quot;insulin user&quot; or &quot;non-insulin user&quot; and
      both will receive SMS messages every 7 days.  The content of the message consist of
      medication reminders, reporting of blood glucose results, insulin technique assessment (if
      applicable), or d) medication adherence assessment.  Participants will be asked to respond
      with a simple text within 7 days.  The intervention group will receive the standard medical
      appointment reminder via telephone one to two business days prior to the appointment at WCHC
       PLUS a unidirectional text message two business days prior to scheduled health center
      appointments.   Control group participants will receive the standard medical appointment
      reminder via telephone one to two business days prior to the appointment at WCHC.  All
      participants in the study (control and intervention) will undergo venipuncture at 3 months
      (+/-) 2 weeks for the determination of hemoglobin A1C.  Demographic information, and
      frequency of hemoglobin A1C concentrations in the past 6 months will be assessed at
      baseline.  Each week for 12 weeks, the number of texts sent per week and by type, percent of
      respondents weekly by text or by phone, content of participant responses, number of patients
      unable to be reached via text, total investigator time spent per week, and time spent per
      contact will be recorded.  At the three month visit, the hemoglobin A1C concentration, blood
      transfusions since study initiation, and medication changes will be recorded.
