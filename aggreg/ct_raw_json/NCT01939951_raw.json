Written informed consent must be obtained before any assessment is performed\n\n          2. Males and females of any race who are between 18 and 65 years old at the time\n             informed consent is obtained.\n\n          3. Physician diagnosis of asthma, as per NIH ( National Institutes of Health)\n             guidelines, for at least 3 months.\n\n          4. Patients with a pre-bronchodilator FEV1 ( forced expiratory volume in 1 second)\n             value of 40% to 90% of individual predicted value at screening and at randomization,\n             and the value at the randomization should be within 15% of the screening FEV1. The\n             results of spirometry should meet the ATS/ERS ( American Thoracic Society/European\n             Respiratory Society)  criteria for acceptability and repeatability.\n\n        6.  Patients who are demonstrated to have reversible airway obstruction or airways hyper-\n        reactivity or have shown either of such responses in previous test(s) within the last\n        year.\n\n        \u2022 Reversible airway obstruction is defined as an increase of \u226512% and \u2265200 ml in FEV1 over\n        the patient's pre-bronchodilator value in litres within 10-15 minutes after inhaling a\n        total of 360 \u00b5g of albuterol or 400 \u00b5g salbutamol via MDI (metered dose inhaler)\n        (reversibility test). The administration of albuterol or salbutamol for the reversibility\n        test is to be within 30 minutes after pre-bronchodilator spirometry.\n\n        7.  An ACQ ( Asthma Control Questionnaire) score \u2265 1.5 at randomization. 8.

History of hypersensitivity to any AES products.\n\n          3.

Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women, where pregnancy is defined as the state of a\n             female after conception and until the termination of gestation, confirmed by a\n             positive hCG ( human chorionic gonadotropin) laboratory test (> 5 mIU( milli\n             international unit)/mL).\n\n        6. Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of\n        becoming pregnant, must use effective contraception during the study and for 4 days (5\n        half-lives) after treatment.  Effective contraception is defined as either:\n\n          -  Barrier method: c) Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap\n             (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal\n             suppository.  Spermicides alone are not a barrier method of contraception and should\n             not be used alone. The following methods are considered more effective than the\n             barrier method and are also acceptable:\n\n          -  Total abstinence: When this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the\n             subject. [Periodic abstinence (e.g. calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,\n             post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception].\n\n          -  Female sterilization: have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without\n             hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least 6 weeks before taking study treatment.  In\n             case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been\n             confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment.\n\n          -  Male partner sterilization.  [For female study subjects, the vasectomised male\n             partner should be the sole partner for that patient]\n\n          -  Use of established, oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception,\n             intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS) 7.  Patients with serious\n             co-morbidities including uncontrolled diabetes (HbA1c \u22658%),  heart failure, cancer,\n             neurodegenerative diseases, rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune diseases, other\n             lung diseases including chronic bronchitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or\n             emphysema or other conditions  characterised by eosinophilia and pulmonary symptoms\n             (i.e.   Churg-Strauss   syndrome,   allergic   bronchopulmonary   aspergillosis,\n             eosinophilic pneumonia, etc.).\n\n             8.

History  of\n             life-threatening  asthma,  including  a  history  of  significant  hypercarbia\n             (pCO2>45mmHg), prior intubation, respiratory arrest, or seizures as a result of\n             asthma.\n\n             10. History of alcohol or other substance abuse. 11. Patients who have had a\n             respiratory tract infection within 2 weeks of the screening visit.  Patients who\n             develop a respiratory tract infection between screening and   the randomization visit\n             must be screen failed, and may be permitted to re-enroll at a later date.\n\n             12. Patients who have been hospitalized due to their asthma, or that have required\n             treatment with systemic steroids, within 6 weeks of the screening visit.\n\n             13. Patients with clinically significant laboratory abnormalities (not associated\n             with the study indication) at screening .\n\n             14.

Patients on stable maintenance\n             immunotherapy for at least one month prior to Visit 1 can be enrolled.\n\n             19. Patients who have been previously randomized into this study. 20. Who are unable\n             to perform spirometry ,peak flow measurements, fractional exhaled nitric oxide ,\n             complete a patient diary or complete questionnaires as required by the protocol.\n\n             21. With any medical or mental condition that, in the investigators opinion, renders\n             the patient unable to understand the nature, scope, and possible consequences of the\n             study.\n\n             22.

History of any known immunodeficiency disorder. 27. Any condition that, in the\n             opinion of the investigator, would interfere with evaluation of the investigational\n             product or interpretation of study results.\n\n             28.
