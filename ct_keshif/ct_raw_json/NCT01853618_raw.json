            "textblock": "Background:\n\n      - Tremelimumab is a cancer treatment drug that helps the immune system recognize and destroy\n      cancer cells. Researchers want to see if it can be used to treat advanced liver cancer. The\n      drug will be given with one of two types of treatment for liver cancer. The first type,\n      transarterial catheter chemoembolization (TACE), injects chemotherapy drugs into the tumor\n      through the main blood vessel that is feeding it. That blood vessel is then closed off to\n      help keep the drugs in the tumor longer. The second type, radiofrequency ablation (RFA),\n      uses a heated probe to destroy the tumor tissue. Researchers want to study how safe and\n      effective these treatments are with the study drug.\n\n      Objectives:\n\n      - To test the safety and effectiveness of Tremelimumab with TACE or RFA for advanced liver\n      cancer.\n\n      Eligibility:\n\n      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have advanced liver cancer that has not responded\n      to other treatments."
