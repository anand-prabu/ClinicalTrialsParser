However, these individuals are increasingly developing a number of\n      chronic diseases of aging, such as atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). The\n      proposed studies will examine the role of highly active antiretroviral therapy in restoring\n      the mucosal immunity and the systemic effect on immune activation, bacterial translocation,\n      and change in HIV-associated cardiovascular disease risk."
