      The primary objective for this study is to evaluate the efficacy of doxycycline +
      ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) on disease progression in Transthyretin Amyloidosis (ATTR)
      subjects with cardiomyopathy with or without neuropathy.

    <description>The primary endpoint of the study is the response rate to doxycycline + UDCA treatment at month 12. A responder is an ATTR subject with:
- a reduction of, or an  increase in serum NT-proBNP concentration of less than 30% of pre-treatment level will be regarded as consistent with treatment efficacy</description>

    <measure>Number of patients with adverse events</measure>
    <time_frame>During 12 month treatment and during 6 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>Yes</safety_issue>
    <description>To assess the tolerability and safety of the treatment, the number of patients with adverse reactions will be recorded.
Monthly phone contacts will be performed for monitoring of the treatment safety.
The safety profile of doxycycline + UDCA will be assessed through the recording, reporting and analysis of baseline medical conditions, physical examination findings including vital signs and laboratory tests. These will be compared to analysis results observed during the study.</description>

    <measure>Blood work for potential drug-related adverse events</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>Yes</safety_issue>
    <description>To assess the tolerability and safety of the treatment, blood work [e.g.complete blood count, creatinine and aspartate transaminase (AST), alkaline phosphatase(ALT)] for potential drug-related adverse events will be drawn at 1, 3, 6, 9, 12 and 18 month.
The safety profile of doxycycline + UDCA will be assessed through the recording, reporting and analysis of baseline medical conditions, physical examination findings including vital signs and laboratory tests. These will be compared to analysis results observed during the study.</description>

             of green birefringent material in Congo red-stained tissue specimens, and typing of
             amyloid deposits as TTR and identification of amyloid fibril type.
