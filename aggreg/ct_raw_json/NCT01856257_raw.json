            "textblock": "Transplant recipients have to take anti-rejection medications to prevent their immune system\n      (the body's natural defense system against illness) from rejecting their new kidney.   Most\n      patients who get a kidney transplant must take these anti-rejection medications for the rest\n      of their lives, or for as long as the kidney continues to work.  Taking standard\n      anti-rejection medications for a long time can cause serious side effects, including kidney\n      damage. There would be a benefit to finding new anti-rejection medications that work just as\n      well, but don't damage the kidney.\n\n      The purpose of this study is to find out if NULOJIX\u00ae (belatacept), will minimize serious\n      long term side effects seen with anti-rejection medications while still protecting your new\n      kidney from damage.  The researchers also want to learn more about the safety of this\n      treatment and long term health of your transplanted kidney."
