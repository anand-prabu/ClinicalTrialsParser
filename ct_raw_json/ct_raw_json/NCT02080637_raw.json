            "textblock": "A. Purpose of the Study The purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics\n      (PK) and  pharmacodynamics (PD) of ambrisentan in children with single ventricle heart\n      defects that are undergoing Fontan (stage III) surgical palliation. This is a double blind,\n      placebo controlled study.  The primary objective of this Phase I/II study is to assess the\n      plasma PK, safety and PD of oral ambrisentan in children with surgically palliated single\n      ventricle heart defects. A secondary objective will be to assess whether ambrisentan\n      improves post-operative outcomes including amount and duration of chest tube drainage and\n      hospital length of stay.\n\n      B. Background and Significance Complex congenital heart defects associated with\n      underdevelopment of a ventricle account for ~8% of congenital heart disease with a birth\n      incidence of 4-8/10000 live births. These single ventricle lesions are associated with high\n      morbidity and 5 year mortality rates that approach 50%. Staged surgical palliation directs\n      returning venous blood flow directly into the lungs so that pulmonary blood flow occurs\n      without the aid of a pumping chamber. The final stage of surgery (stage III - the Fontan\n      procedure) incorporates inferior caval blood flow directly into the pulmonary arteries.\n      Consequently pulmonary blood flow and cardiac output are directly related to pulmonary\n      vascular resistance and ventricular function. The limitations of single ventricle surgical\n      palliation often result in a prolonged post-operative course with pleural effusions a\n      particular concern.  There is also continued long term attrition. Elevated pulmonary\n      vascular resistance and impaired systemic ventricular function are important risk factors\n      for early and late failure of single ventricle palliation.\n\n      Ambrisentan is an endothelin receptor antagonist that improves pulmonary and possibly\n      systemic endothelial function. Ambrisentan is approved for treatment of pulmonary arterial\n      hypertension in adults and is used off-label for treatment of pulmonary hypertension in\n      childen.  Children with single ventricle heart defects demonstrate both pulmonary and\n      systemic endothelial dysfunction and may benefit from treatment with this drug. However\n      pharmacokinetics and hemodynamic efficacy of ambrisentan have not been studied in single\n      ventricle patients. The most widely used alternative agent, sildenafil, was recently\n      associated with increased mortality in children.  There is now a Food and Drug\n      Administration (FDA) safety warning against use of sildenafil in children.  The\n      investigators have previously demonstrated hemodynamic benefits with use of sildenafil in\n      these patients but ambrisentan is a potentially safer agent. Therefore this study would fill\n      an unmet need to guide dosing and evaluate efficacy of ambrisentan in this vulnerable\n      population.\n\n      C. Design and Procedures\n\n      This is a single-center, randomized, blinded PK study of ambrisentan in children ages \u2265 24\n      months and \u2264120 months with single ventricle anatomy. There will be up to 20 subjects\n      enrolled; 16 will receive ambrisentan and 4 will receive placebo. A small placebo control\n      group is warranted to ensure that any treatment effect is not a result of post-operative\n      improvement. Patients will be enrolled at the time of their routinely scheduled Fontan\n      surgery.\n\n      Initial Dose: Oral ambrisentan 2.5 - 5 mg, single dose, once daily (nasogastric and\n      gastrostomy tube administration will be considered only when a nasogastric or gastrostomy\n      tube is already in place as part of routine post-operative care).Subjects will be randomized\n      by Investigational Drug Services (IDS) to placebo (n=4) or oral ambrisentan (n=16) using\n      permuted blocks. Subjects will receive either an oral suspension (2.5 or 5mg)  or a 5mg\n      tablet depending on their ability to swallow a tablet.  To begin to ensure safety, the\n      initial 5 subjects enrolled in the study (at least 4 active drug) will receive a dose of\n      2.5mg in a liquid suspension prepared by IDS.  After enrollment of these subjects the\n      investigators will perform a preliminary PK/safety analysis and evaluate ambrisentan\n      exposure.   If the drug is well tolerated (no grade III or greater adverse events) and\n      exposure is less than the target exposure of 500-800ng/mL, then the investigators may\n      increase the dose to 5mg/dL provided via tablet in those able to take a tablet or suspension\n      for all others. If drug exposure is less than 100ng/mL then the investigators will enroll\n      additional study subjects to ensure that at least 16 study subjects achieve adequate drug\n      exposure. If drug exposure is in the target range then the investigators will continue to\n      enroll study subjects to receive the 2.5mg suspension.\n\n      The total study duration is expected to be approximately 24 months for enrollment of up to\n      20 subjects.  Study participants will remain in the study until 1 month after discharge\n      following stage III surgery intervention or for 6 months - whichever is shorter.  The\n      subjects will receive routine care before, during and immediately after surgery and after\n      hospital discharge. The investigators will record all in-hospital adverse events and\n      tabulate by organ system. One month after the last study drug administration (dose #3), the\n      investigators will contact patients by phone or evaluate in person if they remain\n      hospitalized.\n\n      Plasma PK will be evaluated using a limited sampling scheme. A preliminary safety and PK\n      analysis will be performed after 5 subjects are enrolled. Ambrisentan PK will be evaluated\n      and dosing may be adjusted to achieve levels consistent with those reported in the adult and\n      pediatric literature.\n\n      D. Study Interventions:\n\n      Baseline/Pre-Dose Assessment\n\n      After the parent or legally authorized representative has signed the Internal Review Board\n      (IRB) - approved informed consent form, and after it has been determined that the patient\n      satisfies all inclusion and exclusion criteria, the following evaluations will be performed\n      and recorded in the case report form (CRF):\n\n        1.
