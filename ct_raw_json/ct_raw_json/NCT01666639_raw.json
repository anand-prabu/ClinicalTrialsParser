Exercise therapy plays a major role in such a\n      combination of treatments. There is a considerable need to develop theory-based exercise\n      interventions which foster a long-term adherence to physical activity. Furthermore, an\n      integration of behavioral elements such as coping competencies regarding back pain is\n      needed. It is not yet clear, which specific part of multidisciplinary rehabilitation causes\n      its effects. The role of exercise therapy has yet to be investigated. Aim of this study is\n      the implementation of a standardized behavioral exercise therapy into an existing\n      behavioral-medical rehabilitation for patients with chronic back pain. The main hypothesis\n      is that the participation in the behavioral exercise therapy leads to greater short- and\n      long-term improvements in functional capacity compared to the usual care."
