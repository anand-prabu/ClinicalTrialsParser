  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess the anti-tumor activity of CAP7.1 based on the observed objective response rate
      and rate of disease stabilization, as defined by the below primary and secondary endpoints,
      in patients with NSCLC, SCLC or biliary cancer who have progressed despite one or more
      previous chemotherapy line.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A phase II evaluation will be performed in adult patients in parallel studies in 3 tumor
      types: NSCLC, SCLC and Biliary Tract Cancer.  All patients will have advanced or metastatic
      disease with primary or secondary resistance to standard therapy.  In each tumor type the
      patients will be randomized to receive either therapy with CAP7.1 or best supportive care
      according to institution standards. Patient in the Control group who progress may cross over
      to CAP7.1, however these patients will be analyzed separately from the patients randomized
      to CAP7.1.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically- or cytologically-confirmed, advanced disease with documented
             progression (RECIST1.1.) after one or several chemotherapy line

             therapy or after completion

          -  Must have recovered from the acute reversible effects of previous anti-cancer
             chemotherapy, usually 3-4 weeks after myelosuppressive chemotherapy

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Serious concurrent medical condition, which could affect compliance with the protocol
             or interpretation of results.

          -  Patients with uncontrolled infection and patients known to be infected with the human
             immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or  hepatitis  infection are not eligible for the study
