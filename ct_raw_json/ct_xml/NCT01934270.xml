  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Proper growth in children is a complex process regulated by a combination of genetic,
      nutritional, environmental, hormonal, and others. Growth hormone (GH) is the main hormone
      regulating the growth from childhood to adulthood. Despite great progress in the field, with
      the development of recombinant GH for the treatment of growth hormone deficiency (GHD),
      there is still no reliable method for testing GHD. Physical exertion is one of the
      significant physiologic stimuli for GH secretion, and it is reliable test for identification
      of GHD. It is not in use in the clinics because of its complexity. Recently GH secretion
      following short anaerobic exercise in young adults was tested and also demonstrated
      significant growth hormone secretion

      In contrast to adult children's exercise is characterized by an anaerobic nature. There is
      no data about secretion of growth hormone in response to anaerobic exercise in children.

      Purpose of the experiment:

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the secretion of growth hormone in response to
      anaerobic exercise (Wingate test) in children.

    <textblock>
      40 children (20 boys and 20 girls) aged 6-16 years, followed at the endocrinology unit for
      short stature clinics and need assessment of their growth hormone axis will be evaluate in
      parallel according to the currently accepted pharmacological GH testing as accepted and also
      following anaerobic physical test with the Wingate test.

      After explanation to the patient and his parent and obtaining an informed consent, the
      children will be instructed to pedal at maximum speed for 30 seconds against a resistance
      adjusted according to their body mass index.

      The test will perform in similarity to GH provocative protocols by mean that they will be
      performed in the morning after a night's sleep and overnight fasting. The patients will be
      remained fasting during the test.

      They will be asked not to exercise a day before the test. Thirty minutes before the test,
      Venflon will be inserted and the child will receive an explanation and rest until the
      beginning of the test. blood GH, IGF-1, cortisol will be taken at the beginning of exercise
      (time 0), at the end of exercise (30 seconds), after 10 minutes, 30 minutes and 60 minutes
      is customary according to criteria set pharmacological inventory growth hormone.

      The test results will be compared to pharmacological testing of the child.
