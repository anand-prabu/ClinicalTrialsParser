        The study will enroll subjects undergoing one of the following surgical procedures:

          -  Vascular Surgery

          -  Hepatic resection

          -  Soft tissue dissection

        Inclusion Criteria (pre-surgery):

          1. Age is 0 days through &lt; 18 years of age at time of randomization

          2. Subject's legal representative (parent or guardian) has signed an institutional
             review board (IRB)-approved informed consent document

          3. If a subject is ≥ 7 years old, or appropriate age as defined by local regulations,
             the subject may be required to have signed an IRB-approved assent document

          4. Subject is scheduled to undergo one of the surgical procedures described above

          5. If female and of child-bearing potential, subject has negative pregnancy test at
             baseline

          6. If subject is a sexually active male or a sexually active female of child-bearing
             potential, subject agrees to use a medically accepted form of contraception from the
             time of consent to completion of all of the follow-up study visits.

             Inclusion Criteria (during surgery):

          7. Mild or moderate bleeding/oozing when control by conventional surgical techniques,
             including but not limited to suture, ligature and cautery is ineffective or
             impractical

          8. Approximate Target Bleeding Sites surface area of ≤ 100 cm2

          9. No prior use of a topical hemostat containing thrombin during prior surgeries

         10. Has not received any blood transfusions between screening and study treatment

         11. No complication during surgery other than bleeding which, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, may interfere with the assessment of efficacy or safety

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Gestational age of &lt;36 weeks at birth (for infants less than 2 years of age)

          2. Any clinically-significant congenital coagulation disorder (e.g., hemophilia A or B)
             that may interfere with the assessment of efficacy or pose a safety risk to the
             subject according to the Investigator

          3. Baseline abnormalities of international normalized ratio (INR) &gt; 2.5 or activated
             partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) &gt; 100 seconds during screening that are not
             explained by current drug treatment (e.g., warfarin, heparin)

          4. Aspartate Aminotransferase (ASAT/AST) and Alanine aminotransferase (ALAT/ALT) &gt; 3 x
             upper limit normal range during screening, except for subjects undergoing liver
             resection surgery or with a diagnosis of liver disease where there is no upper limit
             for these analytes due to nature of their disease

          5. Subject is unwilling to receive blood products

          6. Platelets &lt; 100 x10ᴧ9 PLT/L during screening

          7. Subject has history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (only for vascular subjects
             where heparin use is required)

          8. Known hypersensitivity to Fibrocaps or any of its components

          9. Subject has known antibodies or hypersensitivity to thrombin or other coagulation
             factors

         10. Known allergy to porcine gelatin

         11. Medical, social, or psychosocial factors that, in the opinion of the Investigator,
             could impact subject safety or compliance with study procedures

         12. Subject is currently participating or has participated in another clinical study
             involving an investigational agent within 30 days of the planned date of surgery

         13. Subject is planning to participate in another clinical trial within the 90-day
             follow-up period
