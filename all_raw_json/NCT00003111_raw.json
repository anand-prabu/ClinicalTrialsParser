Treatment repeats every 6 weeks for 3 courses until\n      disease progression. Once potential candidates for resectability are determined, patients\n      undergo thoracotomy or concurrent chemotherapy/radiation therapy within 6 weeks of\n      completing the last course of chemotherapy. Following resection, patients responding to\n      chemotherapy receive 3 additional courses of IV carboplatin and paclitaxel over 3 hours.\n      Patients may undergo local irradiation beginning with the second course of carboplatin and\n      paclitaxel. Chemotherapy ceases if disease remains stable after 8 weeks.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for the first year after treatment, then every 6 months\n      thereafter for survival.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: This study will accrue 20 patients over 18 months."
