    <textblock>
      The purpose of this expanded access study is to be able to provide treatment with HBOC-201
      to patients with life-threatening anemia for whom blood is not an option.

      HBOC-201 is not FDA approved for use in the United States, but is approved as an oxygen
      carrier in South Africa and Russia.

      i. Initial Dose

      For patients with a hemoglobin level less than 6 mg/dl, an initial dose of 32.5 g (one unit)
      of HBOC 201 is recommended, to be followed by infusion of additional units as necessary to
      achieve and maintain a total hemoglobin concentration above 6 g/dl, provided that the
      patient's circulatory volume is properly controlled and will not impose an inappropriate
      risk.

      ii. Subsequent Doses

      The need for additional dose administration should be assessed after each infusion as
      clinically indicated.

      Dosing will be stopped if any one of the following occurs:

        -  resolution of critical ischemia

        -  death

        -  recovery of native Hemoglobin levels to &gt; 6 g/dL,

        -  evidence of reticulocytosis
