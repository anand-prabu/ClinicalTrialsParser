Time to healing, as well as repeat interventions and adverse events, will be\n      tracked. The rationale for doing a large sample size multi-center trial is the hope that a\n      clear answer to whether or not one of these two methods is significantly better than the\n      other will become apparent and thus aid surgeons in making a more informed operative\n      treatment choice."
