Combining chemotherapy with peripheral stem cell\n      transplantation may allow the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill\n      more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of high-dose thiotepa plus peripheral\n      stem cell transplantation in treating patients with refractory solid tumors."

Patients who do\n      not have peripheral blood stem cells available may undergo a bone marrow harvest instead.\n      Thiotepa is administered as a 3 hour infusion daily for 3 consecutive days. Stem cells are\n      reinfused approximately 72 hours following the completion of thiotepa. Filgrastim is\n      administered the day following reinfusion of stem cells and continues until there is\n      sufficient hematopoietic recovery.\n\n      The second course of thiotepa is administered 4 weeks following the first course in patients\n      who have responding or stable disease, adequate stem cells, and no unacceptable toxicity.\n      Patients receive a maximum of 2 courses.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 36 patients will be accrued for this study over 2 years."
