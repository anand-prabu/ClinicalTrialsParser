Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients undergo standard hyperfractionated radiotherapy 5 days a week for 5-5.6\n           weeks. Patients receive oral fluconazole on days 1-4 and 28-31 of radiotherapy.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients undergo radiotherapy as in arm I. Patients who develop a\n           microbiologically proven fungal infection or clinically evident oral cavity and/or\n           oropharyngeal thrush may receive fluconazole as in arm I.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: At least 42 patients (26 per arm) will be accrued for this study."
