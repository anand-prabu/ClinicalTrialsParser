Conventional dose escalation with at least 3 patients per dose level (3 selected dose\n           levels).\n\n        2. Expansion of each dose level to a total of 7 patients for assessment of immune response\n           levels.\n\n      13 UV1 vaccinations will be given during the first 6 months (week 26) of treatment, unless\n      clinical deterioration or unacceptable toxicity is encountered. Granulocyte-macrophage\n      colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) (Leukine \u00ae) will be administered locally 10-15 minutes\n      before each UV1 vaccination.\n\n      After completion of the main study treatment period at week 26, if the patient agrees,\n      additional vaccinations may be considered for the following patients:\n\n        -  Immune responders within first 6 months\n\n        -  Immune non-responders providing they have at least SD"
