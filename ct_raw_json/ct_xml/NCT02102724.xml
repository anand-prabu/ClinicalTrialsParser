  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HIV infection is associated with premature aging of the immune system.  It is believe that
      the persistent inflammation that accompanies HIV infection is a major contributor to
      premature immune aging.  Fish oil has well-documented anti-inflammatory properties.  In this
      randomized, clinical trial, we're testing whether a 12-week course of fish oil
      supplementation will reverse premature aging in HIV-infected African American older adults.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Due to treatment advances, the number of persons &gt; 50 years old who are living with HIV/AIDS
      in the United States (US) has steadily increased. African Americans (AA) represent a
      disproportionate number of HIV/AIDS cases in this age group, with infection rates 12 times
      higher than among whites (51.7 per 100,000 compared to 4.2 per 100,000).  Limited data
      suggest that older HIV+ AA are characterized by health status disparities.  One cohort study
      of older, largely minority  HIV+ persons (N=121, AA=83%;mean age=54), found that 34% had
      metabolic syndrome and 50% had a Framingham Cardiac Risk score &gt; 10%. HIV+ older adults of
      all races show a premature onset of other age-associated co-morbidities, such as
      osteoporosis, non-AIDS malignancies, and cardiovascular disease (CVD).  These co-morbidities
      have been linked to persistent inflammation and persistently elevated serum levels of
      proinflammatory cytokines that mimic an aging phenotype known as &quot;inflamm-aging.&quot; In both
      middle-aged HIV+ persons and older HIV seronegative adults, inflamm-aging is associated with
      more limited T cell repertoires and increased risk for morbidities and mortality. In HIV
      infection, inflamm-aging is postulated to be maintained (a) by the constant antigen burden
      imposed by HIV and other chronic viral co-pathogens, such as cytomegalovirus (CMV), and (b)
      by HIV-induced disruption of intestinal epithelial integrity with subsequent translocation
      of gut microflora into the systemic circulation. Our hypothesis is that inflamm-aging is
      responsible for the premature immune senescence associated with HIV infection in aging
      individuals.  Immune senescence, characterized by diminished replicative capacity, has been
      observed in middle-aged persons treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART)
      who achieve immune reconstitution and undetectable viral loads. Senescent cells are
      characterized by the absence of the surface marker CD28, and in advanced senescence express
      CD57 (CD28-/CD57+ phenotype).  Because premature senescence leads to loss of anti-HIV
      cell-mediated immune responses and accelerated HIV disease progression,there is an urgent
      need to test new treatment strategies to reduce inflamm-aging and subsequent immune
      senescence.

      Fish oil may be an effective treatment option for reducing HIV-related inflamm-aging.  Cold
      water fish are rich in the omega-3 highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFA) eicosapentaenoic
      acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), which have anti-inflammatory effects. When
      consumed as fish or fish oil supplements, EPA and DHA replace arachidonic acid in cell
      membranes and inhibit the synthesis of proinflammatory arachidonic acid metabolites, such as
      prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Moreover, animal and in vitro studies have shown that EPA
      and DHA stimulate regeneration of intestinal mucosa damaged by methotrexate,16 IL-4, and
      experimental ulcerative colitis. Yet, to date, no studies have been conducted on the effects
      of fish oil for reducing HIV-related inflamm-aging and reversing immune senescence.

      The purpose of this study is to explore the safety and estimate the effect size of fish oil
      to modulate parameters of inflamm-aging and immune senescence in HIV+ African American older
      adults. Participants will receive either 1.6 grams of omega-3 fatty acids (800 mg of EPA,
      600 mg DHA, 200 mg other omega-3 fatty acids) or placebo for 12 weeks. We expect to find a
      reduction in inflammatory markers and the percentage of CD8+ and CD4+ T lymphocytes that
      exhibit a senescent phenotype in the fish oil condition, but not in the control condition,
      at 12 weeks. We expect to find no difference between the conditions on the safety parameters
      at 4 and 12 weeks.

      The specific aims are:

      Aim 1. To assess the safety of the fish oil condition by comparing it to the control
      condition at 4 and 12 weeks, controlling for covariates (demographics, lifestyle,
      medications including HAART, fish oil supplement adherence, intercurrent illnesses), on

        1. HIV disease parameters (CD4+ T cell counts and HIV RNA levels)

        2. Drug toxicity (liver function tests and serum creatinine)

        3. Adverse events (e.g., diarrhea, vomiting)

      Aim 2. To estimate the effect size of the fish oil condition at 12 weeks, controlling for
      covariates, by comparing the following cell surface molecules and intracellular and soluble
      inflammatory markers before and after fish oil

        1. Markers of immune senescence on CD8+ T lymphocytes: percentage of CD8+/CD28- T
           lymphocytes, a phenotype of immune senescence (primary outcome); percentage of
           CD8+/CD28-/CD57- T lymphocytes (an intermediate senescent phenotype); percentage of
           CD8+/CD28-/CD57+ T lymphocytes (a terminally differentiated senescent phenotype)

        2. Markers of immune senescence on CD4+ T lymphocytes: percentage of CD4+/CD28- T
           lymphocytes; percentage of CD4+/CD28-/CD57- T lymphocytes; percentage of
           CD4+/CD28-/CD57+ T lymphocytes

        3. Markers of inflammation: plasma hsCRP and intracellular concentrations of TNF-alpha,
           IL-6, and gamma IFN

      Aim 3:    To estimate the effect size of the fish oil condition at 12 weeks on gut
      permeability, controlling for covariates, by comparing the following indirect markers of gut
      permeability before and after fish oil

        1. Endotoxin

        2. Soluble mouse CD14

        3. Endotoxin binding antibody

        4. Lipopolysaccharide binding protein
