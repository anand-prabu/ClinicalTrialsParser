  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the early 2000s , professional and patient organizations are mobilizing to highlight the
      psychosocial impact of cancer disease , not only during but also after the acute phase.

      In 2003, the government launched the Cancer Plan I reinforced in December 2011 by the Cancer
      Plan II whose objectives include : &quot; Develop a personalized care taking into account the
      pain and psychological and social support &quot; and &quot; increase opportunities for patients to
      benefit from supportive care &quot;and&quot; promote the professional integration .

      This study aims to show that beyond the immediate benefits of the social aesthetic cares in
      hospital (direct soothing, improving the quality of the skin injured by chemotherapy ,
      feeling of escape ... ), these treatments can also affect quality of life for patients
      during and after hospitalization. They also may have an impact on the maintenance of social
      and / or professional satisfactory throughout the planned chemotherapy aplastic period .
