      effective add-on treatment for schizophrenia in adolescents.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a two-part, multi-center, prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled,
      parallel-group study, in which adolescent subjects with schizophrenia will be enrolled.
      Overall, eligible subjects will be randomized in a pre-defined 1:1 ratio to NaBen® or
      placebo.

      This study will be conducted in two parts:

      In Part 1 (Phase IIb) of the study, 76 subjects (~ 60% of the total planned subjects) will
      be randomized in a 1:1 ratio (NaBen® or placebo), of which 38 subjects will be randomized to
      the NaBen® group and 38 subjects to the placebo group.  An interim analysis (IA) will be
      conducted after the randomization of the 76th subject in Part 1 of the study. The data will
      be analyzed after all enrolled subjects in Part 1 of the study complete Visit 5 (week 6) or
      are withdrawn from the study, whichever occurs first. The data from IA will be reviewed by
      an independent Data Safety and Monitoring Committee (DSMC) that will be responsible for the
      review of the data from the Part 1 (Phase IIb) of the study for both safety and the
      effectiveness.

      In Part 2 (Phase III) of the study, a total of 50 subjects will be randomized, of which 25
      subjects will be randomized to the NaBen® group and 25 subjects to the placebo group. The
      final subject numbers in the study will depend on the sample size re-estimation after Part 1
      of the study.
