  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be randomized in a ratio of 1:1 to receive either 60 mg of ospemifene
      (Osphena, Shionogi, Florham, NJ) or placebo tablet.  Placebo tablets will be identical in
      appearance and packaging will be identical for the two pills.  The participants will be
      instructed to take one tablet in the morning with food for twelve weeks.  Basic demographic
      information will be obtained on all participants.  All women will undergo a pelvic
      examination, and questionnaires regarding pelvic floor dysfunction and sexual function
      before and three months after treatment.  3-D ultrasound with Doppler blood flow analysis
      will be performed before the patient is started on the treatment.  3 months after treatment,
      the 3-D ultrasound with Doppler blood flow analysis will be repeated.  Four areas will be
      measured:

        1. The urethra in exactly the same section at the same level with the same setups.

        2. 3 and 9 O'clock position

        3. 6 o'clock position

        4. Clitoral blood flow Doppler blood flow will be visualized using the Doppler color mode
           of the ultrasound machine and will be applied for the assessment of the vascularity
           pattern.  Additionally, we will record a film with the use of Color Doppler in a video
           file. The transducer will be immobilized at one selected section and record a ten
           seconds of film. This film will be further analyzed in special software called Pixel
           flux after the examination. Dr. Pawel Wieczorek and Dr. Magdalena Wozniak will read
           these deidentified video files in a randomized fashion based on their previous research
           experience with similar video interpretations of pelvic color Doppler imaging [8-11].
