  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the addition of High-resolution,
      relational, resonance-based, electroencephalic mirroring (HIRREM) to usual care will improve
      insomnia symptoms based on changes in the Insomnia Severity Index at two months following
      completion of the intervention, compared to placebo plus usual care.

    <textblock>
      Insomnia is the most prevalent sleep disorder and is associated with significant
      psychosocial and somatic pathology.  Effective noninvasive interventions for insomnia are
      lacking.  High-resolution, relational, resonance-based, electroencephalic mirroring
      (HIRREM), is a noninvasive, brain feedback technology to facilitate relaxation and
      auto-calibration of neural oscillations by using auditory tones to reflect brain frequencies
      in near real time.  An open label, randomized, crossover pilot trial showed that HIRREM was
      safe and effective, with significant benefits for individuals with moderate to severe
      insomnia, based on differential change with symptoms of insomnia (Insomnia Severity Index,
      ISI).  This study will extend those results in a larger cohort using a single blind, placebo
      controlled study design.

    <description>The ISI is a 7 question, self-reported measure to evaluate symptoms of insomnia, with responses from 0-4 for each question, yielding scores ranging from 0-28.  The ISI will be collected at enrollment (pre-intervention), and at 1-7 days, 8-10 weeks, and 16-18 weeks after completion of the intervention.  The primary outcome will be change from enrollment to 8-10 weeks after completion of the intervention.</description>

    <description>This ten item instrument will be an online daily sleep diary to evaluate the amount and quality of sleep.  This allows evaluation of the timing and trajectory of any improvements in sleep, including appreciation of the presence and duration of placebo effects.</description>

    <description>Anxiety will be measured by the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), which will be completed at the enrollment visit (pre-intervention), as well as 1-7 days, 8-10 weeks, and 16-18 weeks after completion of the intervention.

    <description>Health-related quality of life will be measured by the EQ-5D, which will be collected at the enrollment visit, as well as 1-7 days, 8-10, and 16-18 weeks after completion of the intervention.  The EQ-5D consists of 5 items assessing an individual's current health status (values from 0-2), yielding scores ranging from 0-10.  Overall health status is also assessed with values from 0-100.</description>
