To estimate the progression-free survival (PFS) achieved with XL184 in metastatic\n      castrate resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) patients.\n\n      II. To evaluate the feasibility of the therapy, and the toxicities associated. III. To\n      evaluate overall survival (OS) in metastatic CRPC patients post androgen deprivation therapy\n      (ADT) treated with XL-184.\n\n      OUTLINE:\n\n      Patients receive cabozantinib-s-malate orally (PO) daily in the absence of disease\n      progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4 weeks and then\n      periodically thereafter."
