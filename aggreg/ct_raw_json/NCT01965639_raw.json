The investigators will use descriptive, parametric and non-parametric statistics to\n      describe baseline characteristics (demographics and clinical measures of disease severity)\n      of the sample and will compare responders and dropouts on independent and dependent\n      variables, report any significant differences, and include this in the interpretation of\n      results."
