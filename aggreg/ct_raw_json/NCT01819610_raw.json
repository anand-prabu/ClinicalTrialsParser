Following\n      surgery subjects will receive their 1st dose of SPRIX, if and when pain reaches a VAS of 40\n      or more, followed by SPRIX administration every 6 hours. Blood samples for PK assessment\n      will then be collected for PK assessment pre-dose, at 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 2, and 4 hours\n      after the first dose, at 6 hours (immediately before the 2nd dose), and immediately before\n      each of the next several subsequent q6h doses up to the dose to be administered on the\n      morning of post-operative day 2. Blood samples will then be collected at 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12,\n      and 24 hours after receiving the morning dose on day 2 (i.e., last blood sample for PK will\n      be collected on the morning of post-operative day 3). Pain intensity (PI) will be assessed\n      using the 0-100 VAS at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 6 hours post dose, at 2 hours after the 2nd dose,\n      and then immediately prior to each dose at 12, 18, and 24 hours from baseline. Patients may\n      elect to continue taking SPRIX for a total of 5 days with daily assessments of pain\n      intensity using a diary. A final follow-up phone interview will be conducted 14 days after\n      the final dose of study drug.  Thus, each subject's study participation will consist of a\n      screening visit, a treatment/assessment period of up to 5 days, and a follow-up interview."
