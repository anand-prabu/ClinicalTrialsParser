            "textblock": "Strip harvesting technique, a conventional hair transplantation procedure, is widely used in\n      the treatment of androgenetic alopecia for more than half a century. It provides less\n      time-consuming, more feasible and more cost-effective comparing with follicular unit\n      extraction (FUE) technique. However, linear scar at the donor site is also introduced.\n\n      The latest method to fine the scar at the donor site was invented and known as 'Trichophytic\n      closure technique'. It can be done by trimming upper or lower wound edge for about 1\n      millimeter (as Fig.1) before wound closure. Then the linear scar will be less visible after\n      hair growth. Anyway, there is no exactly wound edge (upper, lower or both) that recommended\n      for the excellent cosmetic results without any severe side effects. Therefore, this study\n      was designed to determine which is the best trichophytic closure technique.\n\n      This research is a pilot, split-wound comparison study of trichophytic closure techniques\n      for donor site in hair transplantation.10 males, aged \u2265 25 years, who require strip\n      harvesting follicular unit transplantation in the treatment of androgenetic alopecia will be\n      enrolled. Preoperative and perioperative process will be conducted as standard procedure\n      except wound closure technique. Each incision wound of donor site will be equally divided\n      into 3 parts (marked with tattoos as Fig.2) and each part will be randomly treated with\n      different trichophytic closure techniques as below.\n\n        -  The 1-millimetre trimming of upper edge of linear incision before wound closure\n\n        -  The 1-millimetre trimming of lower edge of linear incision before wound closure\n\n        -  The 0.5-millimetre trimming of both edge of linear incision before wound closure For\n           evaluation, we have planned to assess both cosmetic results and side effects as shown\n           in the table. ( Table 1 - image file ) After data collecting process, we have planned\n           to analyze the demographic data, rate of infection and other side effects in a\n           descriptive manner. However, the evaluation for cosmetic results will be analyzed by\n           paired t-test in the same technique at different follow up period and by one-way ANOVA\n           between each technique at the same follow up period."
