Participants in the self-management group are\n      expected to emphasize on self-managed interventions, including self-monitoring and records\n      keeping, self-education with digital video disc (DVD) courses. We negotiated their behavior\n      change set goals for them etc. The peer-assisted management group received similar program\n      for 3 months, the peer oriented group activities followed, including group discussions to\n      share experience and sports map etc. The effectiveness assessments have been set for the\n      baseline, 3rd, 6th, 12th and 18th months.
