This study will look at how well\n      different doses of ITI-214 are tolerated in healthy people and in people with stable\n      schizophrenia.  In addition,  exploratory neuroimaging will be conducted in participants\n      with schizophrenia.\n\n      This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States. The study will be comprised\n      of 2 parts: Multiple-Rising Dose (MRD) and Neuroimaging (NI). Approximately 40 healthy\n      participants are planned to be enrolled in the MRD part of the study and approximately 24\n      patients with stable schizophrenia are planned to be enrolled in the Neuroimaging part of\n      the study.\n\n      Participants in the MRD (parallel design) part will be enrolled in cohorts for different\n      dose levels. In each dose cohort, participants will be randomly assigned to active dose or\n      placebo\u2014which will remain undisclosed to participants and study doctor during the study\n      (unless there is an urgent medical need).  The following dose cohorts will be enrolled:\n      Doses A, B, C, and D.\n\n      Participants will be asked to take the study drug in oral solution once daily for a total of\n      14 days while confined at the study site. Participants will be contacted by telephone 22 and\n      44 days after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.\n\n      Participants in the Neuroimaging (NI) part of the study will be randomly assigned to one of\n      six treatment sequences. Each sequence consists of 3 cross-over treatment periods. The\n      following doses will be tested: Doses E, F, G, and H.\n\n      Each participant will undergo 3 treatment periods of placebo or ITI-214 once daily dosing\n      for 7 days in each of the periods. There will be a washout period of a minimum of 7 days\n      between treatment periods. Participants will be confined at the study site for 5 days of\n      each treatment period and will report to the site on other dosing days for study drug\n      administration. There will be follow-up assessments on Days 14 and 37 of Period 3."
