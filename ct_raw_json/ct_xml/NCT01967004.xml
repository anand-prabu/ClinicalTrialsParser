  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) can lead
      to greater prosthesis function and control. Subjects are asked to perform specific tasks and
      actions using the traditional control method, as well as RFID control.

    <description>Each participant will perform functional tests on the first visit. These tests consist of moving objects from one location to another, and performing certain muscle contraction patterns when prompted. The participant will then take the prosthesis, installed with morph, home for 3 months at most, and then return to perform another set of timed trials.</description>
