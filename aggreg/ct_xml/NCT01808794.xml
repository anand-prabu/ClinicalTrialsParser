      The purpose of the study is to compare one material called &quot;Mucograft&quot; with another material
      called &quot;Dynamatrix.&quot; These materials are used as a type of a barrier (made from pig material
      also known as porcine material) in a preservation technique to increase the thickness and
      width of tissues at a tooth extraction site. The investigators want to see if one works
      better than the other or if they work equally as well. These materials are made up of
      collagens, which are naturally occurring proteins found in the skin, specifically connective
      tissue. Dynamatrix is made up of many types of collagens whereas Mucograft is only made of
      fewer collagens. These materials have been given something called a 510(k) status by the
      FDA. This means that the FDA determines them to be equivalent to another product that they
      have previously approved. You will be put into one of two groups at random, and will not
      know which one you are in. Like flipping a coin, you will have a 50/50 chance to be in
      either one of the two groups. You will either be in a group using Mucograft or in a group
      using Dynamatrix. Both of these materials are regularly used in the dental clinics.

      A) Aim/Hypothesis/Objective The objective of this study is to compare two different
      membranes, Mucograft and Dynamatrix, clinically, radiographically, and histologically when
      used for the ridge preservation procedure in combination with bone allograft at the
      extraction site in terms of soft and hard tissue remodeling after 4 months healing period.

      Hypothesis

        1. MucograftTM will exhibit greater increase or preservation of the thickness and width of
           keratinized tissue than DynamatrixTM at the extraction site.

        2. MucograftTM will exhibit greater preservation of the alveolar bone width and height
           than DynamatrixTM   at the extraction site.

        3. MucograftTM will exhibit greater preservation of the soft and hard tissue height than
           DynamatrixTM   at the adjacent teeth.

        4. MucograftTM will exhibit a better outcome than DynamatrixTM   in the histological and
           histomorphometric results of the soft and hard tissue healing.

      Specific Aims

        1. Primary aim The primary aim is to compare MucograftTM when used as a barrier membrane
           in the ridge preservation technique to increase or preserve the thickness and width of
           keratinized tissue at the extraction site in comparison to DynamatrixTM.

        2. Secondary aims

      The secondary aims are to compare clinically, radiographically, and histologically
      MucograftTM with DynamatrixTM in relation to:

        1. Changes of the alveolar bone height and width at the extraction site.

        2. Changes of the soft and hard tissues at the adjacent teeth.

        3. Histological and histomorphometric assessment of the soft and hard tissue healing at
           the extraction site.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Be at least 18 years of age.

          2. Have unsalvageable non-adjacent non-molar teeth: maxillary incisors, canines, and
             premolars, and mandibular canines and premolars that require an extraction with bone
             augmentation planned for delayed implant placement. If a subject has multiple teeth
             to be extracted, only one tooth will be included in the study.

          3. Patients who are currently treatment planned in the Tufts University School of Dental
             Medicine (TUSDM) periodontology clinic to receive bone augmentation and delayed
             implant placement and meet all medical and dental requirements of the TUSDM
             periodontology clinic for periodontal surgery (e.g., subjects with no diseases or
             medication allergies contraindicating periodontal surgery).

          4. Display no evidence of acute periodontal infection: e.g., abscess, suppuration,
             severe swelling and/or spontaneous bleeding.

          5. Smoke less than 10 cigarettes per day.

          6. Not participating in any other dental research study for the duration of this study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Have any known disease that interferes with periodontal surgery and would not allow
             the patient to be treatment planned for the procedures in the TUSDM periodontology
             clinic (e.g., severe anemia, low white blood cell count, bleeding or coagulation
             disorder, uncontrolled hypertension, recent myocardial infarction (within 6 months of
             enrollment), poorly controlled diabetes, HIV/AIDS (self-reported), history of or
             currently undergoing head and neck radiation, history of or currently taking
             bisphosphonates).

          2. Have a history of severe psychological conditions or limited mental capacity.

          3. Be a pregnant or lactating female (self-reported) (following TUSDM periodontology
             clinic guidelines elective surgical procedures and radiographs/CBCT scans are usually
             postponed until after delivery).

          4. Individuals opposed to having porcine derived materials placed in their mouth.
