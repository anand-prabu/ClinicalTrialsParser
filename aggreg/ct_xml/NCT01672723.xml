  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      From birth we rely on others for comfort and care and derive pleasure from being together.
      Research from the fields of health psychology, social psychology, and public health converge
      to highlight the importance of having and maintaining good relationships for overall health.
      Indeed, having close friends and family and feeling connected to them has been called a
      basic need, similar to our need for food and water. It may not be a coincidence then that
      feelings of connection rely on similar systems in the body as other needs that are both
      basic and highly pleasing and rewarding. For instance, its possible that opioids, a
      substance in the body associated with pleasant, euphoric feelings, may also be important for
      connecting with others. This study will examine the role of opioids in feeling connected to
      others by administering a drug called naltrexone, that effects opioid processing in the
      body, on perceptions and feelings toward a number of tasks in the lab. Additionally, to
      assess the effects of naltrexone outside of the lab, participants will complete daily diary
      responses via text and online surveys.

      40 participants will take both placebo and naltrexone. Participants will complete two
      sessions, one in each drug condition, in which they complete a number of tasks including
      reading messages on a computer screen, holding a number of objects, and viewing images while
      undergoing electric shocks. Participants will also complete a daily diary for 14 days while
      on naltrexone and placebo. Prior to these lab sessions participants will be screened at
      UCLA's Clinical &amp; Tranlational Research Center (CTRC) to ensure that they are healthy and
      that it is safe for them to take the study drug.

      We hypothesize that people will report feeling less socially connected when on naltrexone
      compared to placebo and will show subsequent changes in social behavior outside of the lab.

    <description>Participants will take 4 doses of naltrexone over 4 days (25mg/day for days 1 and 2, 50mg/day for days 3 and 4) as well as 4 matched placebo pills for a total of 8 days. Capsules will be packaged into blister packs.
Participants will be asked to take the first drug, either naltrexone or placebo, once a day for three days prior to the first experimental session and when they arrive at the lab for the experimental procedure . After the first session, participants will take the second study drug for three days prior to the second experimental session and when they arrive for the second experimental procedure.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Inclusion criteria for the study require that participants be in good health, between the
        ages of 18 and 35, fluent in English, have access to text messaging technology, and have
        at least 8 close friends and family members who would be willing to be contacted in
        regards to the study (for the social connection lab task) and be willing to provide 2
        pictures of a close other (for the threat of shock task).

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Following an email screening and structured telephone interview, prospective participants
        with the following conditions will not advance to the in- person screening session:
        pregnant or planning to become pregnant in the next 6 months, presence of chronic mental
        or physical illness, history of allergies, liver, or other severe chronic diseases,
        current and regular use of prescription medications, or previous history of fainting
        during blood draws.

        Furthermore, the absence of significant health problems or medication use history will be
        confirmed by an in-person screening session. Any participant who has any of the following
        conditions will be ineligible for the study: (1) Any and all medical conditions,
        especially hepatitis or liver failure.

        Psychiatric Disorders. (2) current and/or lifetime history of a major Depressive Disorder
        or other DSM-IV psychiatric disorder (e.g. substance dependence) (3) current and/or past
        regular use of analgesics such as opioids; (4) current and/or past regular use of
        psychotropic medications, including selective serotinergic reuptake inhibitors,
        antidepressants, anxiolytics, hypnotics, sedatives and barbiturates. Health factors. (5)
        current smokers (13) body mass index (BMI) greater than 35, (14) shows evidence of drug
        use from a urine test, (15) has a positive pregnancy test, if female, or (16) shows any
        abnormalities on screening laboratory tests.
