This pilot study involved 30 Individuals (having at least six teeth with a\n      clinical attachment loss of \u2265 5 mm and probing pocket depth (PPD) of \u22655 mm) that were\n      randomly assigned into three groups (n=10): 1) PD plus 3 g of placebo gel daily topical\n      application 2) PD plus daily topical application of 3 g of 15% Mtz benzoate gel; and 3) PD\n      plus a daily single dose of 750 mg Mtz (Flagyl\u00ae). Clinical parameters visible plaque index\n      (VPI), gingival bleeding index (GBI), relative attachment level (RAL) and PPD; and the\n      quantitative analysis (real-time PCR) of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans,\n      Porphyromonas gingivalis and Tannerella forsythia were assessed baseline, 1, 3 and 6 months\n      after PD."
