Cognitive assessments will be made on 2 subsequent days (Days 1\n      and 2) which are separated by overnight sleep. In addition, a session will be performed on\n      Day 7. Completion of the cognitive test batteries can occur at any time during the day\n      provided that the completion time is comparable on all test days.
