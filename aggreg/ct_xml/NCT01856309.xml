    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of CNTO 136
      (sirukumab) in participants with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who are unresponsive to treatment
      with modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) or anti-TNF alpha agents.

    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, long-term study of sirukumab (CNTO 136) that will be conducted in two
      groups of participants at the same time (parallel-group study).  The maximum duration of
      participation in this study is 208 weeks, followed by approximately 16 weeks of safety and
      efficacy follow-up after the administration of the final study agent injection of sirukumab.
       Participant safety will be monitored throughout the study.
