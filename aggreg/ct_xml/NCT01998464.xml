  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Retinal vasculitis is a sight-threatening inflammation that involves the blood vessels of
      the retina, the tissue that lines the inside of the eye. This inflammation may occur on its
      own or as a result of an infectious, cancerous, or inflammatory disorder.

      Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an imaging technology that can perform non-contact
      cross-sectional imaging of retinal and choroidal tissue structure in real time. It is
      similar to ultrasound imaging, except that OCT measures the intensity of reflected light
      rather than sound waves.

      The purpose of this study is to see if non-invasive OCT technology can diagnose retinal
      vasculitis as well as the more invasive fluorescein angiography, which requires an injection
      of dye into the vein of an arm of a patient. The study will also compare the mapping of
      blood vessels (angiography) and loss of blood flow (ischemia) by fluorescein angiography and
      OCT.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of retinal vasculitis

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Inability to give informed consent.

          -  Inability to complete the qualifying study tests within a 30 day period from date of
             enrollment

          -  Significant renal disease, defined as a history of chronic renal failure requiring
             dialysis or kidney transplant.

          -  A prior history of reaction to fluorescein or other dyes.

          -  A condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude participation in
             the study (e.g. unstable medical status including blood pressure, cardiovascular
             disease, and glycemic control).

          -  Blood pressure &gt; 180/110 (systolic above 180 OR diastolic above 110). If blood
             pressure is brought below 180/110 by anti-hypertensive treatment, subject can become
             eligible.

          -  Systemic anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) or pro-VEGF treatment within
             4 months prior to treatment.

          -  Women of child-bearing potential: pregnant or lactating or intending to become
             pregnant within the next 12 months due to unknown safety of fluorescein angiography.

          -  Prior panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) or focal laser that would alter the macular
             perfusion and retinovascular features.

          -  Inability to maintain stable fixation for OCT imaging.

          -  Other ocular condition is present such that, in the opinion of the investigator, may
             alter the retinal perfusion.

          -  An ocular condition is present that, in the opinion of the investigator, might affect
             or alter visual acuity during the course of the study (i.e. cataract)

          -  Substantial cataract that, in the opinion of the investigator, is likely to decrease
             visual acuity by 3 lines or more (i.e. cataract would be reducing acuity to 20/40 or
             worse if the eye was otherwise normal).

          -  Media opacity or otherwise that would prevent either fixation or ability to obtain
             adequate images as determined by the examiner.

          -  History of major ocular surgery (including vitrectomy, cataract extraction, scleral
             buckle, any intraocular surgery, etc) within prior 4 months.
