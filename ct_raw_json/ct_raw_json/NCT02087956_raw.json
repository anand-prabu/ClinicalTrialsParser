Participants assigned to ESR will receive a personalized report\n           of community resources that may be helpful for their identified needs.\n\n        -  The investigators will use a simple 1:1 randomized design with treatment assignment\n           being conducted using a random number generator. All analyses will follow an\n           intent-to-treat protocol, such that all participants randomized will be followed for\n           data collection and analyzed according to her randomized condition\n\n        -  Each participant will be assessed 4 times for outcome changes: at baseline, post\n           treatment (4 months), and two follow up ( at 7 and 10 months).\n\n        -  Assessments are self report on iPads and they are linked directly to a Red Cap\n           database."
