  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anodal tDCS increases the excitability of the cerebral cortex and its daily application
      during intercritical phase, may have a therapeutic effect in episodic migraine.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During the interictal phase, the cerebral cortex is characterised by hyperresponsiveness to
      repeated sensory stimuli, manifested by a lack of habituation or adaptation of cortical
      evoked responses. Such habituation deficit can be shown in the visual cortex by the study of
      visual evoked potentials (VEP) and it is possibly explained by a reduction in the cortical
      pre-activation level due to thalamo-cortical dysrhythmia. In healthy subjects and in
      migraineurs between attacks, anodal tDCS increases VEP habituation and 1st block amplitude.
      In a proof-of-concept trial, the investigators have shown in 10 episodic migraine without
      aura patients that 2 weekly 15-minute sessions for 8 weeks of anodal tDCS over the visual
      cortex significantly decreased attack frequency, migraine days, attack duration and acute
      medication intake for more than 4 weeks after the last treatment session.

      This randomized trial was designed to prove the preventive effect in episodic migraine of
      anodal tDCS over the visual cortex compared to sham stimulation.

    <description>Cefaly tDCS (transcranial direct current stimulation) is able to modify cortical excitability, in particular anodal tDCS increases it.  The side effects of tDCS are minor, especially sensations of itching and scalp paresthesias.</description>
