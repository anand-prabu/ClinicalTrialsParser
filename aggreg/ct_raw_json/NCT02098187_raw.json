Iohexol will also be administered followed by saline.\n      Prior to administration of MP-3180 and Iohexol, the ORFM sensor probes will be affixed to\n      four locations on the body of each subject.  The noninvasive fluorescent signal from MP-3180\n      will be measured using the ORFM investigational device continuously for approximately four\n      (4) hours post MP-3180 administration. For the determination of the pharmacokinetic\n      disposition of the MP-3180 and iohexol, there will be blood samples collected from each\n      subject provided the individual completes all blood collections in the study. The\n      pharmacokinetics of MP-3180 and iohexol will be assessed by statistical comparison of\n      pharmacokinetic parameters derived from plasma concentration-time curves and urine recovery\n      data."
