            "textblock": "Unfortunately, despite the best clinical efforts and breakthroughs in biotechnology, most\n      patients diagnosed with advanced stage melanoma continue to die from their disease. Reasons\n      for this include: 1) patients are often diagnosed at a time when their melanoma has already\n      spread to other sites such as the chest cavity, bone, liver, and brain limiting the options\n      for surgical excision and 2) the cancer cells are resistant or become resistant to\n      chemotherapy drugs used to treat the patient. Resistance to one type of chemotherapy agent\n      often rapidly leads to resistance against many other chemotherapy drugs. These reasons are\n      the major causes of cancer progression that are usually discussed when considering treatment\n      options for patients with disease that continues to grow and spread. However, another\n      important part of the body should be considered-- the immune system. Scientists have clearly\n      shown that melanoma cells produce a number of abnormal proteins or abnormal amounts of\n      certain proteins found in normal melanoma cells. Normally one would expect a patient to\n      develop an immune response against these abnormal proteins found in their cancer and attack\n      them much the way we would fight off an infection from a foreign bacteria or virus. However,\n      for reasons that scientists do not fully understand, the immune system fails to respond\n      adequately to these abnormal proteins and does not destroy the melanoma cells. This human\n      clinical trial proposes a new way to make the immune system recognize the cancer cells and\n      encourages it to attack and destroy them.\n\n      In this project, we have put a mouse gene into human melanoma cancer cells, so that those\n      cells produce these abnormal sugar patterns and stimulate the immune system to attack the\n      melanoma. This strategy works well to kill other human cancer cells in the laboratory, but\n      it needs to be tried in melanoma patients to see if it will be effective and to determine if\n      such a treatment causes any side effects. We propose to test this new treatment in patients\n      with melanoma to see if it can stop, slow or destroy tumors in these patients. Patients will\n      be injected with an anti-tumor immunotherapy consisting of three types of dead human\n      melanoma cancer cells that have been genetically altered to express the mouse gene\n      responsible for making this abnormal sugar-protein on the cells.\n\n      In this Phase IIB Study, patients with advanced stage melanoma will undergo a series of\n      intradermal injections with an immunotherapy(HyperAcute\u00ae-Melanoma) composed of irradiated\n      allogeneic melanoma cell lines (HAM-1, HAM-2 and HAM-3). These cell lines have been\n      transduced with a recombinant Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV)-based retroviral vector\n      expressing the murine \u03b1(1,3)GT gene. In addition to the HyperAcute\u00ae-Melanoma immunotherapy,\n      some patients will also receive ipilimumab as an important component of this immunization\n      strategy that will attempt to enhance and activate the host immune system to destroy growing\n      tumor cells. Endpoints of the study include safety assessments, and clinical, tumor and\n      immunological responses."
