However, some lesions are not seen by initial skeletal survey.  And\n      the investigators have to complete the skeletal survey with either bone-scan or CT scan or\n      whole-body MRI. whole-body MRI has proved its worth in the pediatric population for the\n      evaluation of skeletal and extraskeletal lesions in children with cancer or infectious\n      diseases. Thus, whole-body MRI would allowed to have total picture of children without\n      ionising radiation exposure."
