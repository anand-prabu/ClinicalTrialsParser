    <description>The culturally-tailored program includes 9 individual Internet-based sessions across a 12 week period and an additional individual Internet-based session at 6 months. Web sessions will last about half-an-hour (30 minutes) and will discuss topics that are important to quitting smoking (like: preparing to quit, dealing with cravings, and support systems, etc.) and topics relevant to American Indian culture (like traditional use of tobacco).</description>
