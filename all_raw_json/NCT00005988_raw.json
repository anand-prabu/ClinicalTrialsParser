Sometimes the\n      transplanted cells can make an immune response against the body's normal tissues. Treatment\n      of the donor bone marrow with the patient's white blood cells and a monoclonal antibody may\n      prevent this from happening.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of bone marrow transplantation with\n      specially treated bone marrow in treating patients who have hematologic cancer that has not\n      responded to previous therapy."

Determine if patients with refractory, high risk hematologic malignancies or\n      bone marrow failure who receive HLA haploidentical bone marrow treated with anti-B7 antibody\n      have normal engraftment. II. Determine if these patients are free of hyperacute graft versus\n      host disease (GVHD), defined as grade D GVHD in the first 10 posttransplant days, when\n      treated with this regimen. III. Determine if these patients have an acceptable incidence of\n      life threatening grade D GHVD in the first 50 posttransplant days following this treatment\n      regimen. IV. Determine the safety and tolerability of this treatment regimen in this patient\n      population.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients undergo leukapheresis to collect white blood\n      cells which are incubated with donor bone marrow cells in the presence of anti-B7.1 and\n      anti-B7.2 antibodies for 36 hours. Patients receive total body irradiation twice daily on\n      days -6 to -3, cyclophosphamide IV daily on days -2 and -1, and methylprednisolone IV every\n      12 hours for a total of 4 doses on days -2 to 0. Patients are infused with the treated donor\n      bone marrow on day 0. Patients then receive methotrexate IV on days 1, 3, 6, and 11 and\n      leucovorin calcium IV 24 hours after each dose of methotrexate every 6 hours for 3-8 doses\n      each time. Patients also receive cyclosporine IV or orally twice daily on days -2 to 100.\n      Patients are followed every 2 months for 1 year.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued for this study."
