We hypothesize that physostigmine-induced\n      elevated ACh levels will lead to a reduction in the availability of nicotinic receptors for\n      the binding of the radioligand. We hypothesize there will be greater increase in ACh level\n      (or greater reduction in radio tracer binding) in smoking as compared to nonsmoking\n      subjects. We hypothesize there will be greater increase in ACh level (or greater reduction\n      in radio tracer binding) in smoking as compared to nonsmoking subjects with schizophrenia,\n      but the extent of this change will be different than in controls."

            "textblock": "-  Magnetic resonance image. Within approximately two weeks of the PET study, anatomical\n           MRIs will be acquired at the Yale University MRI Center. Subjects will be taken through\n           a ferromagnetic metal detector before entering the scan room. The purpose of the MRI\n           scan is to direct the region of interest placement on the lower resolution PET images.\n           The T1 weighted images will be acquired on a 3 Tesla Siemens Scanner. There will also\n           be an additional resting state scan with subjects in the scanner, eyes open, fixating\n           on a cross.\n\n        -  Physostigmine challenge Physostigmine will be administered as follows. Glycopyrrolate,\n           a cholinergic antagonist that does not have central side-effects, will be administered\n           prior to physostigmine challenge to block physostigmine peripheral side-effects (e.g.\n           nausea). Subjects will receive 200 mcg /ml x 1 ml of glycopyrrolate through an IV.\n           Physostigmine administered i.v. has a short half life of 20 min with peak plasma levels\n           20-30 min post administration. The same dose of physostigmine will be administered as\n           in the preliminary data: 1.5 mg/hr for 1 hr. Vital signs, including systolic and\n           diastolic blood pressure, heart rate and respiration rate, will be monitored before\n           physostigmine and then at 10, 20, 30, 60 min after the beginning of the infusion and\n           then hourly until the end of the study day. Subjects will be questioned before, during,\n           and after physostigmine challenge about potential adverse reactions typical to this\n           medication (nausea, upset stomach, etc., as in Risks section). [If there is a\n           significant and persistent drop in subjects' heart rate (>15% for at least 1 min), the\n           IV physostigmine infusion will be stopped but the subject will continue to be monitored\n           and will be discharged at the discretion of the study doctor. In emergency situation,\n           PET center protocol will be followed accordingly (on file with HIC).\n\n        -  Positron emission tomography PET scans may be performed on the High Resolution Research\n           Tomograph (HRRT, 2-3 mm resolution) or another similar camera. Venous catheters will be\n           used for i.v. administration of the radiotracer, venous blood sampling of AChE\n           activity, and for the administration of glycopyrrolate and physostigmine. A radial\n           artery catheter will be inserted by an experienced physician before the PET scan to\n           draw arterial blood samples for metabolite analysis and for determination of the\n           fraction of plasma radioactivity unbound to protein. At the beginning of scan, the\n           subject's head will be immobilized and a transmission scan will be obtained for\n           attenuation correction. PET scans will be acquired using bolus or bolus to infusion\n           administration of up to 10 millicuries of NCFHEB. Dynamic images of radioactivity\n           concentration are reconstructed with corrections for attenuation, normalization, random\n           events, scatter, and deadtime. Subject motion is corrected automatically on an\n           event-by-event basis with the Vicra motion tracking system. Vital signs (blood\n           pressure, pulse and respiration) are collected prior to and during each PET scan. Urine\n           pregnancy test will be again administered on the PET scan day prior to the initiation\n           of any imaging procedures. Smoking abstinence, when appropriate, will also be confirmed\n           for smoking subjects prior to PET scanning.\n\n      PET scanning will then proceed as following for each aim:\n\n      Aim 1. Subjects will be asked to come to the PET center on two separate days to participate\n      in one NCFHEB PET scan each time to assess test retest reproducibility of binding parameters\n      measured with the radiotracer.\n\n      Aim 2. Subjects will participate in one PET scan day. Aim 3. Subjects from Aim 2 who are\n      able to continue smoking abstinence will be asked to come back for another PET scan after\n      about 6-8 weeks of smoking abstinence.\n\n      Aim 4. Baseline NCFHEB PET imaging will be conducted followed by administration of\n      physostigmine. Preferably, this will be done on the same day. However, at times there is not\n      enough radiotracer or subject is not able to tolerate a longer scan day. Therefore, some\n      subjects may complete the study over two separate days (preferably within 1 month apart\n      based on the availability of PET scanning times and subject's schedule).\n\n      Aim 5. Baseline NCFHEB PET imaging will be conducted followed by administration of\n      physostigmine. Preferably, this will be done on the same day. However, at times when there\n      is not enough radiotracer or when a subject is not able to tolerate a longer scan day.\n      Therefore, some subjects may complete the study over two separate days (preferably within 1\n      month apart based on the availability of PET scanning times and subject's schedule).\n\n      Control subjects may participate in more than 1 aim. For example, nonsmoking subjects may\n      complete Aim 1 and if chose, participate in Aim 4. Thus, subjects may participate in up to 4\n      PET scans for this protocol."
