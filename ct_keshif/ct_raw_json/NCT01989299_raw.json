Use of an Implantable Cardioverter\n      Defibrillator (ICD) may be useful in some patients with HFPEF.\n\n      The purpose of this study is to investigate the incidence of appropriate ICD shocks\n      (efficacy) and inappropriate ICD shock (safety) in patients with HFPEF at high-risk for\n      arrhythmic mortality."
