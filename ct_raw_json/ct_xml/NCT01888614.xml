  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to evaluate exhaled carbon monoxide (CO) in patients with sickle
      hemoglobin types: hemoglobin SS (HbSS), hemoglobin SC (HbSC), and hemoglobin S (HbS)-beta
      thalassemia during routine clinic visits, and longitudinally.  The investigators goal is to
      know whether exhaled carbon monoxide (etCO) differs amongst subjects with different sickle
      cell syndrome genotypes, and whether it is a stable marker of hemolytic rate, as reflected
      in routine labs obtained for clinical care (including total hemoglobin, reticulocyte count,
      lactate dehydrogenase, and, when sampled, total and direct bilirubin). The investigators
      hope to establish whether this inexpensive and non-invasive test faithfully reflects
      hemolytic parameters in sickle cell syndromes.
