Giving chemotherapy drugs before surgery may shrink the tumor\n      so that it can be removed during surgery.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare surgery with or without chemotherapy in\n      treating patients who have stage IB cervical cancer."

            "textblock": "OBJECTIVES: I. Compare disease free survival, overall survival, and local control in\n      patients with bulky stage IB carcinoma of the cervix treated with radical hysterectomy and\n      pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy with or without neoadjuvant vincristine and\n      cisplatin. II. Compare adverse effects of radical hysterectomy and pelvic and para-aortic\n      lymphadenectomy with or without neoadjuvant vincristine and cisplatin in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. Arm\n      I: Surgery. All patients undergo intra-abdominal and retroperitoneal exploratory laparotomy.\n      Patients without metastases also undergo radical hysterectomy with pelvic and para-aortic\n      lymphadenectomy. Beginning 2-4 weeks after surgery, patients with 1 or more positive lymph\n      nodes or positive surgical margins on the radical hysterectomy specimen receive adjunctive\n      radiotherapy 5 days each week for 4-6 weeks. Patients with histologically confirmed\n      metastases do not undergo radical hysterectomy with pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy,\n      but receive radiotherapy 5 days each week for 6-8 weeks beginning 2-4 weeks after the\n      laparotomy. Patients who undergo radiotherapy also receive cisplatin IV over 1 hour on days\n      when radiotherapy is administered for up to 6 doses of cisplatin. Arm II: Patients receive\n      vincristine IV bolus immediately followed by cisplatin IV over 1 hour on days 1, 11, and 21.\n      Courses repeat every 21 days for up to 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or\n      unacceptable toxicity. Beginning approximately 4 weeks after the last doses of neoadjuvant\n      vincristine and cisplatin, patients receive surgery, radiotherapy, and cisplatin as in Arm\n      I. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then\n      annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 170-340 patients will be accrued for this study over\n      approximately 4.5 years."
