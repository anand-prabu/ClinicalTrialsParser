Previous studies indicated that ibuprofen has similar effect on ductal\n      closure as indomethacin but has less adverse effects on renal function, cerebral blood flow\n      and mesenteric blood flow.1-7 There are, however, very few studies being done specifically\n      on extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infant < 1000 g. This group of infants has immature\n      kidney and often has poor response to PG inhibitors and has high mortality and morbidity. We\n      hypothesized that, in ELBW infants, the ductal and renal response to PG inhibitors may be\n      different between indomethacin and ibuprofen."
