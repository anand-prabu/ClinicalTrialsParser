Eight ounces of cherry juice standardized to its proanthocyanidin\n      content in the morning and 8 ounces of cherry juice standardized to its procyanidin content\n      1-2 hours before bedtime for 14 days; 2. A similar amount of placebo juice with the same\n      timing for the cross-over.  There will be a 2-week washout between each of the treatment\n      periods.  Subjects will be scheduled for two overnight PSGs, one at the end of each two-week\n      treatment period.  On the morning following each test the insomnia severity index and other\n      questionnaires will be repeated.  The order of the placebo juice and cherry juice will be\n      random and balanced."
