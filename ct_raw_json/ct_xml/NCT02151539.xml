      This research trial studies medical chart review in determining outcomes of second-line
      therapy in patients with acute graft-versus-host disease previously treated with
      extracorporeal photopheresis or other systemic therapies. Gathering information about
      second-line therapy in patients with acute graft-versus-host disease may help doctors learn
      more about the disease and find better treatment.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine 6-month freedom from treatment failure for second-line therapy for acute
      graft versus host disease (aGVHD).

      II. To show that extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) is associated with a superior 6 month
      (m) freedom from treatment failure (FFTF) as compared to other treatment modalities for
      second line therapy for aGVHD.

      III. To describe health care burden in patients receiving second line therapy for acute
      GVHD.

      IV. Quality of life measurement using Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Bone Marrow
      Transplant (FACT-BMT) in patients receiving second line therapy for aGVHD.

      OUTLINE:

      Study data are collected and managed using Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) tools
      at baseline and on days 5, 28, and 56.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 6 months, and 1 and 2 years.

    <description>The incremental budget spend between the patients receiving treatment with ECP and patients receiving other modalities will be measured and economic methods will be used to calculate an incremental cost effectiveness ratio for relevant clinical end points. Health economic data relating to hospitalizations (length of stay in myelosuppressive unit, high-dependency unit [step-down unit], intensive care unit), high cost drugs, total parenteral nutrition and surgical procedures will also be collected allowing comparisons to be made between patients treated with ECP and other treatment options.</description>
