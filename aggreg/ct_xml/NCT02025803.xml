  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this exploratory study is to investigate the safety and determine the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) of TAS-114 in combination with capecitabine in patients with advanced
      solid tumors for which the patients have no available therapy likely to convey clinical
      benefit.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In animal models, co-administration of TAS 114 and capecitabine has shown antitumor effects
      exceeding the maximum efficacy obtained by capecitabine alone. Developing a novel
      chemotherapy based on the combined use of  TAS-114 and capecitabine may fulfill the need for
      more efficacious treatment for patients with advanced solid tumors.

      The study, evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary antitumor
      activity of the TAS-114/ capecitabine regimen in patients with advanced solid tumors, will
      be conducted in two parts: a Dose-Escalation Phase (Part 1) to determine the MTD; and an
      Expansion Phase (Part 2) to further evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy with the
      MTD.

    <description>Part 1 (dose-escalation phase):
Treatment cycles of TAS-114 and capecitabine orally BID for 14 days followed by 7 days rest until at least one of the discontinuation criteria are met TAS-114 dose starting at 20mg/m2/day with capecitabine dose of 760 mg/m2/day. TAS-114 doses will be escalated for each cohort up to 480mg/m2/day.  If MTD is not reached by TAS-114 dose of 480mg/m2/day, the capecitabine dose will be escalated
Part 2 (expansion phase):
TAS-114 and capecitabine MTD established in Part 1 administered BID for 14 days followed by 7-day recovery period (21-day cycle).</description>
