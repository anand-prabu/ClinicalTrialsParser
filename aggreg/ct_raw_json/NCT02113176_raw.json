You will have a medical and neurological\n      examination, CT scan and/or an angiogram to look at the blood vessel and blood supply going\n      to the brain, and blood samples drawn for a complete blood count, chemistry analysis and\n      cardiac enzymes (to assess any recent damage to your heart). You will have a surgery or an\n      image guided procedure to close your aneurysm.\n\n      Additionally, during the course of the study you may be asked to have a computerized\n      tomography (CT scan) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) if there is a necessity.  These\n      tests will reveal areas that might have been damaged in your brain.\n\n      Drug:\n\n      If the tests show that you qualify as a candidate for this study, you will be randomly\n      assigned (like a flip of a coin) to have either the minocycline drug or a dummy drug that\n      looks the same but does not have the drug in it. For the first 7 days, the drug will be\n      given as an injection two times a day and after that for 14 days once a day by mouth. Rest\n      of the care will be standard like in any aneurysm patient. We study the status of your blood\n      vessel surrounding the brain with ultrasound daily to see if they have any narrowing. If the\n      doctors find any narrowing, you will be treated to relive the narrowing.  If you are\n      discharged home at any point in the 21 days, you will be switch the oral drug and given the\n      required drugs with instructions.\n\n      Follow up:\n\n      Before you are discharged from the hospital and at 7, 21, 30 and 90 days after the start of\n      the drug, the following evaluations will be performed:  a complete physical and neurological\n      examinations.\n\n      As part of this study, you are required to return to the hospital or to your physician at\n      one (1), seven (7), twenty-one (21), thirty (30), ninety (90) days after stroke onset.  You\n      will have a physical exam, a complete neurological exam. Additionally, you will be asked\n      questions about any health problems or hospitalizations you have had since you were\n      discharged from the hospital."
