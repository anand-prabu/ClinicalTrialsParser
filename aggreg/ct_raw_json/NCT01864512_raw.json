The initial dose of eltrombopag\n      administration is 25 mg orally once daily. During the 6 weeks follow-up, dose of\n      investigational product will be adjusted according to the weekly subject platelet count, and\n      a battery of immune parameters will be monitored at the end of each week. Additionally, the\n      efficacy of oral eltrombopag for ITP will be assessed after 6 weeks administration."
