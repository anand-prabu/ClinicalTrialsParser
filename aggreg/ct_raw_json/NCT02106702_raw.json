Two thirds of those released with HIV-focused discharge planning are\n      reincarcerated within one year.  More than half of HIV-infected jail inmates are diagnosed\n      with mental health conditions severe enough to require medication and a similar proportion\n      report substance use disorders at the time of detention.  While some community-based\n      services exist, there remains a critical need to improve linkages to care and adherence to\n      care plans for HIV-infected adults as they move between community and jail. The Navigator\n      Project is a five-year randomized study that will test the effectiveness of an intensive\n      enhanced case management intervention to reduce sex and drug-related HIV transmission risk;\n      increase HIV medication adherence; reduce drug dependence; and reduce reincarceration."
