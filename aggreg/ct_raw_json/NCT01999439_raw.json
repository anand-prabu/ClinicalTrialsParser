Chronic dysphagia and\n      acute food impaction (swallowed food stuck in the esophagus) are common symptoms of EoE and\n      are associated with esophageal wall thickening and stiffness.\n\n      Current diagnostic techniques such as endoscopy with biopsy give only limited information\n      about changes in the esophageal wall in eosinophilic esophagitis(EoE).  In routine clinical\n      practice, repeat endoscopic evaluation with biopsy is commonly performed about 3-6 months\n      after initial therapy for eosinophilic esophagitis(EoE).  However, follow-up endoscopy with\n      biopsy has drawbacks as it is invasive, costly and typically requires deep sedation or\n      general anesthesia.\n\n      We propose to evaluate quantitative MRI as a potential non-invasive diagnostic option for\n      evaluating esophageal wall remodeling in patients with eosinophilic esophagitis(EoE)."
