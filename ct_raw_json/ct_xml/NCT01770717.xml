  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pressure ulcers are a significant problem in institutionalized, elderly, and critically ill
      patients. Pressure ulcers result in significant  pain, changing quality of life, and often
      leading to significant morbidity and prolonged hospital stays, and ultimately increased the
      healthcare cost.

      According to the International Pressure Ulcer Prevalence Survey, the prevalence of hospital
      acquired pressure ulcers in the United States was 13.5% in 2008 and 12.8% in 2009.  This
      survey also indicated that the highest rate of pressure ulcers is in the long term acute
      care population (22%).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Researchers at the Beckman Laser Institute at the University of California, Irvine invented
      and developed a non-contact optical imaging technology call Spatial Frequency Domain Imaging
      which can identify the tissue regions that are at risk of developing pressure ulcers prior
      to development of irreversible tissue damage. The SFDI imaging can identify metabolic and
      biochemical differences in the tissues near bony prominences which are at risk for
      developing pressure ulcers.
