However, the\n      optimal postoperative pain management method for patients undergoing laparoscopic colorectal\n      surgery is still under evaluation and most of the recommendations are based on studies\n      performed in open approach procedures.\n\n      Recently, the analgesic effect of pregabalin, as a part of a multimodal analgesia, has been\n      evaluated in many studies. They have shown that pregabalin may have a role in the post\n      operative pain management, as an adjunct. Pregabalin is an anticonvulsant and anxiolytic\n      drug, which have a more favorable pharmacokinetic profile from its predecessor gabapentin."
