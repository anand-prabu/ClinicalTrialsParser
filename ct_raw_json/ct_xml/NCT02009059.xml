  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In pre-hospital care, there are few non-invasive thermometers that are proved both robust
      and accurate. The aim of this study is to investigate the accuracy of a certain ear-canal
      based thermometer on patients undergoing thoracic surgery in deep hypothermia.

    <textblock>
      The study is a prospective cohort study on patients undergoing elective thoracic surgery in
      deep hypothermia. The goal is to assess the accuracy of epitympanic temperature compared to
      a gold standard representing core temperature.

      At the study hospital, Oslo University Hospital Rikshospitalet, patients undergoing thoracic
      surgery will already have several routes of temperature monitoring as part of standard
      procedure. Before cardiopulmonary bypass bladder temperature is normally used as a reference
      for core temperature. After cardiopulmonary bypass is established, temperature is monitored
      directly in the circulating blood, hence reflecting core temperature.

      For measuring the epitympanic temperature we will use the Metraux Thermometer (Walpoth,
      Galdikas et al. 1994). The Metraux Thermometer is widely used in pre-hospital care in Norway
      and internationally. The ear-sensor will after induction of anaesthesia be inserted
      according to the manufacturers specifications in the auditory canal and activated. The
      sensor is two tiny and soft metal wires covered in a plastic wrapping integrated in a soft
      rubber earplug. The depth of the measuring point is pre-set from the manufacture to be
      approximately 10 mm from the tympanic membrane. The display will then show the epitympanic
      temperature in real-time.

      The temperature will be measured in degrees Celsius. The first reading will be noted just
      after induction of anaesthesia and compared to the bladder temperature. After
      cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is established and therapeutic hypothermia is induced, the
      values for both epitympanic and blood temperature will be written down every minute. After
      reaching the target temperature according to the blood temperature, we will continue
      recording the epitympanic temperature until relative similarity is established. The process
      will be repeated during re-warming.
