        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects will be enrolled if the following criteria are met:

             substantial cataracts, advanced glaucoma, optic neuritis, optic neuropathy or
             atrophy, marked macular atrophy, ocular vascular occlusion, history of retinal
             detachment, uveitis, viral or other forms of chorioretinitis, etc.

          -  Prior treatment with anti-VEGF therapy in the study eye within 90 days of baseline

          -  Prior treatment with dexamethasone in the study eye within 30 days prior to baseline.

          -  Intraocular surgery (including cataract surgery) in the study eye within 60 days
             preceding baseline

          -  History of vitrectomy surgery in the study eye.

          -  Active intraocular inflammation (grade trace or above) in the study eye

          -  History of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment or macular hole (Stage 3 or 4) in the
             study eye

          -  Active infectious conjunctivitis, keratitis, scleritis, or endophthalmitis in either
             eye

          -  Uncontrolled glaucoma in the study eye (defined as IOP â‰¥ 25 mmHg despite treatment
             with anti-glaucoma medication)

          -  History of cerebral vascular accident, myocardial infarction, transient ischemic
             attacks within 180 days of study enrollment.

          -  History of allergy to fluorescein, topical antibiotic, povidone iodine (Betadine) or
             aflibercept.

          -  Presence of vitreous hemorrhage that completely obstructs the view of the optic nerve
             (amount of vitreous hemorrhage will also be gated by 20/320 criteria)

          -  Presence of TRD in the study eye.
