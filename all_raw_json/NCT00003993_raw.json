Interleukin-2 may stimulate a person's white blood cells to\n      kill cancer cells. Combining chemotherapy and interleukin-2 may kill more cancer cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of interleukin-2 when\n      given together with bryostatin 1 in treating patients with refractory solid tumors or\n      lymphoma."

Treatment continues every 28 days in the absence\n      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of interleukin-2 until the maximum\n      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2\n      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-24 patients will be accrued for this study in less than 2\n      years."
