  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The early stages of the schizophrenia illness are associated with significant decreases in
      social and intellectual abilities, with more modest declines seen with chronic disease.
      Multiple studies have identified a relationship between the longer duration of untreated
      psychosis (the duration between the onset of positive symptoms and treatment) and worse long
      term outcomes. However, the neurobiology of this phenomenon and its implications for
      response to antipsychotic medications remain poorly understood.

      Glutamatergic excess altering brain connectivity might provide an explanation for why those
      with longer duration of untreated psychosis have worse clinical outcomes. The investigators
      propose to use neuroimaging to study 67 first episode psychosis subjects before and after
      sixteen weeks of treatment with risperidone, a commonly prescribed antipsychotic. We will
      measure indices of (1) glutamate and (2) structural and functional brain connectivity and
      test the hypotheses that glutamatergic abnormalities are present in first episode patients
      and that longer duration of untreated psychosis is associated with greater connectivity
      abnormalities that set the stage for poor response to treatment. 67 demographic-matched
      healthy controls will also be recruited as a comparison group - healthy controls will not be
      administered antipsychotic medication.

      The investigator's previous neuroimaging studies have made progress in the understanding of
      abnormalities in the glutamate system and brain connectivity in unmedicated patients with
      schizophrenia and modulation of these by antipsychotic medication. Two indices of
      glutamatergic dysfunction suggestive of glutamate/ glutamine cycle abnormalities have been
      identified. While antipsychotic medications appear to modulate glutamate, the disturbance in
      the correlation between metabolites is not restored with treatment. In addition, the
      investigators found that both structural and functional connectivity abnormalities in
      unmedicated patients with schizophrenia predict patients' subsequent response to treatment.

      To the investigator's knowledge, no other group has performed a study that uses a
      combination of complementary neuroimaging techniques that will allow generating a broad
      characterization of glutamatergic function and brain connectivity in first episode psychosis
      and their change with treatment. The results of the proposed studies could suggest a
      mechanism by which the duration of untreated psychosis is associated with poor treatment
      response which might lead to new interventions to target the illness.

        The investigators expect to enroll a total of 67 male and female patients with first
        episode psychosis and 67 male and female healthy controls.

        Among patients who participate in research at the University of Alabama at Birmingham
        (UAB) the approximate gender, ethnic and race distribution is 75% male and 25% female; 1%
        Hispanic and 99% Non-Hispanic; 54% White, 44% Black, and 1% Asian/Pacific Islander. The
        gender distribution is consistent with that observed in clinical populations with
        schizophrenia.

        Persons below the age of 17 and above the age of 35 are excluded to minimize the variance
        in cognitive functioning or brain connectivity that might be attributable to development
        or aging effects rather than diagnosis, and because adults over 35 are more likely to be
        taking medications that could put them at greater risk.
