Levels of mindfulness:\n\n      Participants in the mindfulness intervention will report increased mindfulness levels\n      post-program completion as compared to pre-program completion\n\n      Hypothesis 4. Levels of stress:\n\n      Participants in the mindfulness intervention will report lower levels of stress post-program\n      completion as compared with pre-program commencement.\n\n      Hypothesis 5. Levels of residual depressive symptoms post-mindfulness intervention program:\n      Residual symptoms of depression are a risk factor for relapse of depression. Post -program\n      participants of mindfulness will purport fewer residual depressive symptoms compared with\n      pre-program.\n\n      Hypothesis 6. CF is associated with severe neutrophilic inflammation of the airways. As\n      mindfulness intervention has been shown to modulate immune system it may improve physical\n      aspects of CF  including markers of inflammation and markers of lung disease (lung function\n      tests and rate of pulmonary exacerbations) and nutritional state."

Participants will learn and engage\n      in various formal and informal meditation practices during experiential learning of skills,\n      including concentration, mindfulness of thoughts, emotions, feelings and bodily sensations,\n      decentering, and letting go. Each group will include both practical exercises and a\n      psycho-educational component.  Daily homework, an essential aspect of the course, will\n      include meditation practices together with exercises designed to integrate application of\n      awareness skills into daily life. On day 0, participants will complete a battery of\n      questionnaires as well as tests of the physical status of CF disease. This battery will be\n      repeated at 8 weeks, and again at 6 months."
