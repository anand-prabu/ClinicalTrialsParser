            "textblock": "Rationale: Polycystic liver disease (PLD) is a rare disorder characterized by >20\n      fluid-filled hepatic cysts. Polycystic livers are present in the combination with renal\n      cysts as a manifestation of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), or\n      isolated in the absence of renal cysts as autosomal dominant polycystic liver disease (ADPLD\n      or PCLD).  PLD patients are confronted with symptoms caused by the mass effect of their\n      polycystic liver every day for the rest of their life. There is no standard therapeutic\n      option for symptomatic PLD patients. Current options are fairly invasive or their efficacy\n      is only moderate.\n\n      Preliminary data in our research lab have shown that ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) inhibited\n      the proliferation of polycystic human cholangiocytes in vitro through the normalization of\n      the intracellular calcium levels in cystic cholangiocytes. The investigators also found that\n      daily oral administration of UDCA for 5 months to PCK rats, an animal model of ARPKD that\n      spontaneously develops hepato-renal cystogenesis, resulted in inhibition of hepatic\n      cystogenesis.\n\n      The investigators hypothesize that UDCA is an effective therapeutic tool in reducing liver\n      volume in PLD.\n\n      Objective: First, to demonstrate whether UDCA-therapy is effective in reducing total liver\n      volume in PLD patients. Second, the investigators want to assess if UDCA modifies quality of\n      life. Finally, the investigators want to assess safety and tolerability.\n\n      Study design:  International, multicenter, randomized, controlled trial Study population:\n      34 subjects (18 \u2264age \u2264 80 years) suffering from symptomatic polycystic liver disease with\n      underlying diagnosis of (PCLD or ADPKD), defined as \u2265 20 liver cysts on CT-scan and liver\n      volume of \u2265 2500. Symptomatic is defined as ECOG-PS \u2265 1 and having at least three out of ten\n      PLD symptoms.\n\n      Intervention: The patients will be randomized (1:1) into two groups.  One group of patients\n      will receive 15-20mg/kg/day UDCA for 24 weeks. The other group will receive standard care.\n\n      Main study endpoint:  Proportional change of total liver volume in UDCA treated patients\n      versus non treated patients, as assessed by CT at baseline and  6 months.\n\n      Main secondary outcome variables:\n\n        -  To demonstrate whether UDCA-therapy changes absolute total liver volume\n\n        -  To demonstrate whether UDCA-therapy changes gastro-intestinal symptoms measured by a\n           GI-questionnaire\n\n        -  To demonstrate whether UDCA-therapy changes quality of life as measured by SF-36\n\n        -  To demonstrate which proportion of patients has any reduction in total liver volume\n           after 24 weeks\n\n        -  To demonstrate whether UDCA is well tolerated\n\n        -  To demonstrate whether UDCA-therapy changes absolute total kidney volume (TKV)."
