  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In women with unexplained recurrent miscarriages, progesterone (400 mg pessaries, twice
      daily), started soon as possible at luteal phase and after a positive pregnancy test and
      continued to 32 weeks of gestation, compared to placebo, increases live births beyond 32
      completed weeks by at least 10% (principal objective).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Progesterone improves secondary outcomes such as gestation at delivery, on-going pregnancy
      at 12 weeks, survival at 28 days of neonatal life.

      . Progesterone, compared to placebo, does not incur substantial adverse effects to the
      mother or the neonate.

      Explore differential or subgroup effects of progesterone in prognostic subgroups.

      . Perform an economic evaluation for cost-effectiveness.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Women with unexplained recurrent miscarriages (2 or more consecutive first trimester
             miscarriages).

          2. Age 18-39 years at randomisation (likelihood of miscarriages due to chromosomal
             aberrations is higher in older women; such miscarriages are unlikely to be prevented
             by progesterone therapy).

          3. Spontaneous conception (as confirmed by urinary pregnancy tests).

          4. Willing and able to give informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Age above forty years old.

          2. Antiphospholipid syndrome (lupus anticoagulant and/or anticardiolipin antibodies [IgG
             or IgM]); other recognised thrombophilic conditions (testing according to usual
             clinic practice).

          3. Intrauterine abnormalities (as assessed by ultrasound, hysterosonography,
             hysterosalpingogram, or hysteroscopy).

          4. Fibroids distorting uterine cavity.

          5. Abnormal parental karyotype.

          6. Other identifiable causes of recurrent miscarriages (tests initiated only if
             clinically indicated) e.g., diabetes, thyroid disease and systemic lupus
             erythematosus (SLE).
