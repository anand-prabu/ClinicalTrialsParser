The study includes spinal cord injured patients who require at least seven days\n      of urethral catheterization as a method of bladder voiding. Participants are on-line\n      centrally randomized and allocated to one of the two interventions (Antiseptic Urinary\n      Catheters or Conventional Catheters). Catheters are used for a maximum period of 30 days or\n      removed earlier at the clinician criteria.\n\n      The main outcome is the incidence of urinary tract infections by the time of catheter\n      removal or at day 30 after catheterization, the event that occurs first. Intention-to-treat\n      analysis will be performed, as well as a primary analysis of all patients.\n\n      The aim of this study is to assess whether silver alloy-coated silicone urinary catheters\n      reduce urinary infections in spinal cord injured patients."
