            "textblock": "Background: More than 42% of older people (aged +65) have a stroke and most of them require\n      some type of help to self-care at home. Informal caregivers have reported different types of\n      need and have shown dissatisfaction with technical and emotional support delivered by\n      community health teams. Furthermore, empowering informal caregivers who care after older\n      stroke survivors is an important challenge, preventing them from negative outcomes such as\n      burden, anxiety and depression or loss of physical function or hospitalization in older\n      people.\n\n      Objectives: This pilot study aims to implement and evaluate the impact of an intervention\n      based on training and telephone support delivered to informal caregivers who care after\n      older people post-stroke.\n\n      Setting: Community health units in Northern Portugal region. Design/Methods: This single\n      blinded randomized trial will be delivered by a community nursing team to informal\n      caregivers 1 week, 1 and 3 months after a hospital discharge.\n\n      Study outcome(s): The primary outcomes will be informal caregivers\u00b4 empowerment. Secondary\n      outcomes will include burden and health quality of life in caregivers; functionality,\n      hospital readmission and institutionalization of older people stroke survivors, measured 1\n      and 3 months after intervention.\n\n      Results/Conclusion: Data collection started in February and will be concluded in August\n      2014. First results will be published at the beginning of 2015. The InCARE programme will be\n      the first pilot in informal caregivers study ever conducted in Portugal. It will highlight\n      new ways to support caregivers who take care of older people after a stroke. If successful,\n      this study will be translational and it will also allow to disseminate the results in\n      Portugal and abroad and implement it as best practice."
