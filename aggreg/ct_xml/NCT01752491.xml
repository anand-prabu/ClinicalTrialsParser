  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1 (first in man) study testing the safety of adding high dose ascorbate
      (vitamin C) to standard radiation and chemotherapy for initial treatment of glioblastoma
      multiforme (GBM).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This phase 1 study will test the safety of adding high dose ascorbate (vitamin C) to
      standard chemoradiation and, after the radiation is completed, during 6 cycles of
      temozolomide.

      Standard treatment for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) involves surgery followed by radiation
      combined with temozolomide (a chemotherapy). After radiation, patients receive cycles of
      temozolomide (adjuvant chemotherapy)

      Participants will:

        -  receive high doses of intravenous (IV) ascorbate three times a week during
           chemoradiation

        -  receive high doses of intravenous (IV) ascorbate twice a week during adjuvant
           chemotherapy (after radiation)

      This is a phase 1 study will evaluate the side effects of adding this drug to the standard
      therapy. The dose given to a participant will be determined by how well other participants
      have tolerated the drug.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have newly diagnosed (i.e., within 5 weeks), histologically or
             cytologically confirmed glioblastoma multiforme.

          -  Diagnosis must be made by surgical biopsy or excision.

          -  Therapy must begin ≤ 5 weeks after surgery.

          -  Age ≥ 18 years

          -  ECOG performance status 0-2 (Karnofsky &gt; 50%).

          -  A complete blood count and differential must be obtained within 21 days prior to the
             first dose of radiation, with adequate bone marrow functions as defined below:

               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1500 cells per mm3

               -  Platelets ≥ 100,000 per mm3

               -  Hemoglobin ≥ 8 g/dL

          -  Serum blood chemistries within 21 days before the first day of radiation, as defined
             below:

               -  Creatinine ≤ 2.0 mg

               -  Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 mg/dL

               -  ALT (Alanine Aminotransferase)≤ 3 times the institutional upper limit of normal

               -  AST (Aspartate Aminotransferase) ≤ 3 times the institutional upper limit of
                  normal

          -  Tolerate one text dose (15g) of ascorbate

          -  Not pregnant

          -  Ability to understand and willingness to sign a written informed consent document

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Recurrent high grade glioma

          -  G6PD (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase) deficiency

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to temozolomide.

          -  Significant co-morbid central nervous system disease, including but not limited to,
             multiple sclerosis.

          -  Patients who are on the following drugs and cannot have a drug substitution:
             flecainide, methadone, amphetamines, quinidine, and chlorpropamide. High dose
             ascorbic acid may affect urine acidification and, as a result, may affect clearance
             rates of these drugs.

          -  Prior invasive malignancies (except non-melanomatous skin cancers and carcinoma in
             situ of the cervix or bladder) unless disease free for ≥ 5 years.

          -  Patients who have received prior chemotherapy (including Gliadel wafers) for the
             current glioma.

          -  Prior radiation therapy to the head or neck, which would result in overlap of
             radiation therapy fields.

          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because ionizing radiation is a known
             teratogen, and temozolomide is a Class D agent with the potential for teratogenic or
             abortifacient effects.

          -  Known HIV-positive individuals. High-dose ascorbate acid is a known CYP450 3A4 (an
             enzyme pathway) inducer, which results in lower serum levels of antiretroviral drugs
