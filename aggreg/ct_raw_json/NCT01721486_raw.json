            "textblock": "Tonsillectomy with or without adenoidectomy is a common surgical procedure in children and\n      adolescents.  Usually performed for recurrent tonsillitis or symptoms of airway obstruction,\n      the procedure can result in significant post-operative pain.  Common analgesic techniques\n      include the use of oral acetaminophen, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID, such as\n      ibuprofen PO or ketorolac IV), and narcotics.  Acetaminophen has been shown to be effective\n      in reducing pain and post-operative opioid requirements.   Its administration can be oral,\n      rectal, or intravenous.  NSAIDs, though effective for pain control, have been shown to\n      increase bleeding risk and disrupt hemostasis.  Narcotics are effective for pain control but\n      increase the risk of nausea and vomiting.  They also have the potential to cause respiratory\n      depression.\n\n      IV acetaminophen (OFIRMEV) is indicated for management of mild to moderate pain, and as an\n      adjunct to opioids for severe pain. Several studies have examined the efficacy of IV\n      acetaminophen vs placebo and/or active controls (meperidine, rectal acetaminophen (PR),\n      tramadol).  IV acetaminophen has been shown to be superior to placebo for pain control.\n      Though there is data regarding peak plasma and Cerebral Spinal Fluid (CSF) concentration of\n      acetaminophen when given by different routes (PO vs IV vs PR), there is no data comparing\n      the efficacy of oral vs IV administration for pain control post-tonsillectomy in children."
