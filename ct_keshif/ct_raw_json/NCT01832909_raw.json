The aim of\n      this study is to determine the energy value of walnuts in the human diet and to probe\n      mechanisms by which walnuts impart health benefits. The metabolizable energy value of\n      walnuts will be calculated based on the chemical composition and energy content of the\n      consumed diet and excreta. This will provide a better estimate of the energy value of\n      walnuts than simply calculating energy value based on Atwater factors. In addition to\n      determining the energy value of walnuts, we will evaluate the effects of walnut-rich diets\n      on plasma phytonutrient levels and on gene expression changes to determine what protective\n      mechanisms are activated by walnut consumption."
