Moreover,\n      earlier vascular healing after drug-eluting stent implantation may reduce the incidence of\n      stent thrombosis at follow-up and potentially shorten dual antiplatelet therapy duration.\n      Therefore, we performed this randomized trial to investigate 12 months target lesion failure\n      between the BuMA and the EXCEL stent, both with same eluted drug sirolimus, however\n      different biodegradable polymer carriers."
