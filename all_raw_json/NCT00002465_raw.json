Evaluate the clinical effects of high-dose oral megestrol in improving\n      regression rate and prolonging survival in patients with breast or endometrial carcinoma or\n      mesothelioma. II. Evaluate the immune, endocrine, and clinical effects of this regimen, with\n      particular attention to effects on cachexia.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified by performance status, dominant\n      site of disease, and prior treatment with megestrol. Breast cancer patients are randomized\n      to one of 3 doses of oral megestrol (800, 1,280, or 1,600 mg/day, divided qid). Female\n      patients with other tumor types are nonrandomly assigned to receive oral megestrol at 1,600\n      mg/day. Male patients are nonrandomly assigned to a dose-finding study of megestrol. The\n      first patient cohort receives megestrol at 480 mg/day in 3 divided doses, with further\n      escalation for subsequent cohorts as tolerated. All patients continue therapy for at least 8\n      weeks, with treatment discontinued upon progression. Measurable lesions are evaluated every\n      2 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 9 evaluable breast cancer patients at each dose level will be entered; 14\n      patients will be required for each of the other disease categories. (As of 11/92, the study\n      is temporarily closed to patients with prostate cancer.)"
