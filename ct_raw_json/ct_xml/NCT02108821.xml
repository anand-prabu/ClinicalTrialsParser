  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A disturbance in the diversity of gut bacterial composition could be linked to several
      immune mediated diseases including inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). IBD can be classified
      into Crohn's Disease (CD) and Ulcerative Colitis (UC). Both these diseases occur from
      abnormal immune reaction to resident gut bacteria.The process of fecal microbiota
      transplantation (FMT) where fecal bacteria from a healthy individual is transferred into a
      recipient, has recently received attention as an alternative therapy for individuals
      affected with these life-altering diseases. In this study, the investigators will perform
      fecal transplantation on the subjects meeting inclusion criteria, to determine the efficacy
      and safety of this therapy in subjects with IBD (CD and UC) who  are not responding to first
      line therapy.

      50 subjects who are 2 to 22 years of age will be enrolled in the trial over 3 years. The
      fecal donors, preferably  a parent or sibling, will be extensively screened for infectious
      diseases prior to providing stool for the transplant.  Patients who are failing primary
      therapy and require restaging of their IBD by an endoscopy and colonoscopy will be
      approached for the study.  Standard of care endoscopy and colonoscopy will be performed on
      each subject and 2 additional biopsies will be taken for analysis.  Microbiota analysis will
      also be performed on both the donor and recipient stool sample prior to transplantation, and
      on the recipient sample at 1 week, 1 month, and 6 months post transplantation. The primary
      objective will be to study the safety of FMT in all enrolled subjects.  The study will also
      correlate efficacy and patient outcomes with the fecal microbiome prior to, and after FMT.
      The secondary objectives are to examine the efficacy of FMT in the treatment of children
      with IBD using the Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index (PUCAI) and the Pediatric
      Crohn Disease Activity Index (PCDAI) analysis. Correlate the patient outcomes with the fecal
      microbiome prior to, and after FMT.

    <description>Fecal Microbiome Transplantation will be done at the time of EGD and colonoscopy. A family member or a healthy relative will be tested for several infections like hepatitis, H. Pylori, HIV, syphilis, ova and parasites, culture and C.diff. They will fill out a donor screening form used for blood donors prior to the sample collection. After eligibility criteria and appropriate consent has been obtained the procedure will take place in the procedure center at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh. Fresh stool sample will be obtained from the donor. The fecal sample will be prepared for transplantation in a designated area in the procedure center. Frequency: once.  Duration: Approximately 1 hour</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Current  IBD patients who have:

          -  UC patients with a flare due to failure of current therapy and have to undergo
             esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and colonoscopy for restaging the disease and
             escalation of therapy.

          -  CD patients with oleo colonic or colonic disease who require an EGD and colonoscopy
             for disease assessment due to poor control or a flare.

        The ability to safely undergo colonoscopy (physical status classification used by the
        American Society of Anesthesiologists).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with Crohn's disease:  complications like an abscess, phlegmon, stricture,
             small bowel obstruction, perforation, internal or external fistulization or infection
             as causes for flare up before being deemed eligible for recruitment to the study.

          -  Severe immunosuppression: concomitant steroids (&gt;30 mg/day) and Tumor Necrosis Factor
             (TNF) antibodies.

        Central Line. Pressor or ventilatory support. On antibiotics. Patients with Crohn's
        disease found to have complications like an abscess, phlegmon, stricture, small bowel
        obstruction, perforation, internal or external fistulization or infection.

        Not willing to consent or follow guidelines throughout research trial. screening labs in
        either donor or recipient reveal problems with performing fecal microbiome transplantation
        because inclusion requirements are no longer met.

        Physician discretion. Participant request.
