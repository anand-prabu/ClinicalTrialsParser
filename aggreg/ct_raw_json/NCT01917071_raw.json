Another method is to distract\n      the joint.  We want to know if matching the limitation to the manipulation method will give\n      patients with neck pain better results.\n\n      The patient lays on their back.  The therapist places a hand on the inferior vertebrae of\n      the motion segment.  The patient relaxes and the therapist pushes in an anterior to\n      posterior direction either moving the vertebrae into flexion or entension."
