The use of celecoxib may be an effective way to prevent the further\n      development of precancerous lesions in the mouth.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to compare the effectiveness of different regimens of\n      celecoxib in treating patients who have precancerous lesions in the mouth."

Evaluate the safety\n      of chronic multiple dosing of celecoxib in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. Patients\n      are stratified according to premalignant risk (early vs advanced). Patients in each stratum\n      are randomized to 1 of 3 treatments arms. Arm I: Patients receive lower-dose oral celecoxib\n      twice daily. Arm II: Patients receive higher-dose oral celecoxib twice daily. Arm III:\n      Patients receive oral placebo twice daily. Treatment continues in all 3 arms for 12 weeks in\n      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed at 18,\n      24, and 26 weeks.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 84 patients (42 per stratum, 14 per arm) will be accrued for\n      this study within 6 months."
