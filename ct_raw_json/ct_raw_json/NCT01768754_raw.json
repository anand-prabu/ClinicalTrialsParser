It is possible to assess\n      their usual (routine) and fast walking speeds by getting them to walk in a flat hallway.\n\n      In individuals with chronic lung disease, we anticipate that their usual walk speed will be\n      helpful in exercise prescription and use in multidimensional scoring systems.  However, it\n      is important to first determine the measurement properties of these two walk speeds."
