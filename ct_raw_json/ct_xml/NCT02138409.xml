  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be selected from patients who have been scheduled at the site for
      treatment of chronic pain without sedation.  They will receive either fentanyl sublingual
      spray or a matching placebo sublingual spray that delivers no medication.

      Participants may take pain killers at any time after the procedure for pain relief. They
      will be given a diary card, which they will take home. They will record the name of the
      medication taken, the time, and dosage.

      The study coordinator will call participants about 24 hours after the procedure to collect
      information from the diary card and follow up information about pain and side effects
      (adverse events) after they left the site.

  <detailed_description>

      Participants will be separated into opioid-experienced and opioid-naïve groups.
      Participants in each group will be randomly allocated in a 3:1 ratio to receive fentanyl
      sublingual spray (FSS) or a matching placebo sublingual spray (PSS) 10 minutes before the
      scheduled procedure.  Based on FDA guidelines, opioid-experienced FSS participants will
      receive FSS 400 µg, and opioid-naïve FSS participants will be further randomized  in a 1:1
      ratio to receive either 100 µg or 200 µg.  All participants randomized to placebo receive
      the same matching PSS, regardless of opioid experience.  Pain and sedation will be recorded
      multiple times during the scheduled procedure.  If rescue medication is needed during the
      procedure, local anesthetic standard of care for the procedure will be administered and
      recorded in the study record.  Efficacy and safety/tolerability of fentanyl sublingual spray
      will be evaluated among and between the treatment groups.
