  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Follow-up of cancer patients accounts for a substantial part of outpatient activity, and
      alternative models of care are developing.  In some countries, low-risk follow-up is already
      done in primary care, mainly in breast, and colorectal cancer. In this study the
      investigators will explore gynecological cancer patients about their expectations regarding
      their future follow-up plan. Further, the investigators will ask about the experience and
      satisfaction among patients who have already attended a follow-up programme for 2-3 years.
      In addition, the investigators will especially focus on the cooperation aspect between
      primary and secondary care. The investigators hypothesize that follow-up of selected
      gynecological cancer patients can be done by general practitioners.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After gynaecological cancer patients have completed their treatment, they are followed up at
      a gynaecological outpatient clinic for a number of years. The aim of such follow-up is to
      detect recurrence, improve survival and reduce adverse effects of the treatment. The
      national guide for oncological gynaecology recommends follow-up by a specialist for five
      years at intervals depending on cancer type. Several review studies on follow-up of
      endometrial, cervical and ovarian cancer patients show large international variations in
      follow-up routines.  There are only retrospective studies available, and they indicate that
      most recurrences are discovered within the first three years after completed treatment, and,
      in most cases, by the women themselves. More intensive surveillance does not appear to
      affect the time for discovery of recurrence.

      A few randomised controlled studies and retrospective cohort studies have been published
      that focus on follow-up of colon cancer and breast cancer patients by general practitioners
      versus by hospital specialists. These studies have not shown any significant differences
      between the groups in terms of detection of recurrence, incidence of serious clinical events
      connected with recurrence or health-related quality of life.

      The investigators therefore plan to perform a study in which both gynaecological cancer
      patients and their regular general practitioners are asked about their views on patient
      follow-up after completed treatment. The investigators especially wish to focus on the
      collaboration aspect.
