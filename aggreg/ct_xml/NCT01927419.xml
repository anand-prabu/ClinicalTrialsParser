      The primary purpose of this study is to compare the objective response rate (ORR) as
      determined by investigators, of Nivolumab combined with Ipilimumab versus Ipilimumab
      monotherapy in subjects with unresectable or metastatic melanoma

        For more information regarding BMS clinical trial participation, please visit
        www.BMSStudyConnect.com

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) 0 or 1

          -  Histologically confirmed unresectable Stage III or Stage IV melanoma, as per AJCC
             staging system

          -  No prior systemic anticancer therapy for unresectable or metastatic melanoma. Note
             that prior adjuvant or neoadjuvant melanoma therapy is permitted if it was completed
             at least 6 weeks prior to date of first dose, and all related adverse events have
             either returned to baseline or stabilized

          -  Tumor tissue obtained in the metastatic setting or from an unresectable site must be
             provided for biomarker analyses. In order to be randomized, tumor tissue should be
             received by the central laboratory. Biopsy should be excisional, incisional punch or
             core needle. Fine needle aspirates or other cytology samples are insufficient

          -  Known BRAF V600 mutation status as determined by an FDA approval test. Subjects with
             either V600 wild-type or V600 mutation-positive melanoma are eligible

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Active brain metastases or leptomeningeal metastases. Subjects with brain metastases
             are eligible if these have been treated and there is no magnetic resonance imaging
             (MRI) evidence of progression for at least 8 weeks after treatment is complete and
             within 28 days prior to first dose of study drug administration. There must also be
             no requirement for high doses of systemic corticosteroids that could result in
             immunosuppression (&gt;10 mg/day prednisone equivalents) for at least 2 weeks prior to
             study drug administration

          -  Ocular melanoma

          -  Subjects with active, known or suspected autoimmune disease. Subjects with vitiligo,
             type I diabetes mellitus, residual hypothyroidism due to autoimmune condition only
             requiring hormone replacement, psoriasis not requiring systemic treatment, or
             conditions not expected to recur in the absence of an external trigger are permitted
             to enroll
