The watercress and water will be placed in a 1.5 L mechanical blender and blended at low speed for approximately 15 seconds, followed by blending at a high speed for one additional minute.  The resulting suspension will be filtered through two layers of cheese cloth.  Remaining liquids will be manually extracted from the cheese cloth into the same container.  Each serving will be measured to 200 ml.  The remaining 20 ml will be used for analysis of ITC content.  Each serving will be prepared and kept at 40 C until needed, no more than one hour prior to participant consumption by the subject."

            "textblock": "The aim of this clinical trial is to examine the effects of phenethyl isothiocyanate\n      (PEITC), a compound derived from cruciferous vegetables, on oral cells with mutant p53.  The\n      p53 protein's normal (wild-type) function within cells is to act as a tumor suppressor, or\n      anti-cancer protein.  When mutated, the p53 protein not only no longer executes the\n      functions of a tumor suppressor, and it can gain functions as a pro-cancer protein.22 The\n      proposed clinical trial will utilize oral cells collected from subjects who are heavy\n      smokers.  Since the subjects are regularly exposed to mutagenic chemicals it is the thought\n      that their oral cells will contain measurable levels of mutant p53.  The participants will\n      consume watercress juice, which is rich in PEITC (See Figure 1).  Previous studies in the\n      laboratory showed PEITC selectively depletes mutant p53, and not wild type p53, in cell\n      culture.  Our hypothesis is that the ITC in the watercress juice will lead to the depletion\n      of mutant p53 within the oral cells.  This depletion could lead to a possible clinical\n      application of this compound, such as chemopreventives or oncologic treatments of\n      individuals with oral cancers."
