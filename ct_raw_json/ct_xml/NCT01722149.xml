  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      MPM patients not eligible for surgical procedures like decortication or pleuro-pneumectomy
      have a median survival of 12 months with palliative chemotherapy. Therefore, new therapeutic
      approaches are of crucial need in this clinical situation. This is a phase I trial for
      patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma with pleural effusion testing the safety of a
      fixed single dose of 1x10e6 adoptively transferred FAP-specific re-directed T cells given
      directly in the pleural effusion. Lymphocytes will be taken 21 days before transfer from
      peripheral blood. CD8 positive T cells will be isolated and re-programmed by retroviral
      transfer of a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) recognizing FAP which serves as target
      structure in MPM.

    <textblock>
      This is a phase I trial for patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma. A fixed single
      dose of adoptively transferred FAP-specific CD8 positive re-directed T cells will be given
      in the pleural effusion.

      Three patients who are at the time point of screening not operable will be treated with
      re-directed T cells administered into the pleural effusion after completion of 3 cycles of
      palliative chemotherapy. In the case of one AE grade III/IV or one SAE - and the occurrence
      of DLT both judged to be treatment related by an independent safety monitoring board - the
      patient number will be expanded to 6 patients. The study will be stopped if one additional
      DLT occurs also judged to be treatment related.

      Patients will be treated with 1x10e6 re-directed FAP-specific T cells injected in the
      pleural effusion. The study ends 35 days after adoptive T cell transfer. Re-directed
      FAP-specific T cells will be administered at day 0 (day 14 of the third cycle of palliative
      chemotherapy). The study is designed to demonstrate safety of 1x10e6 re-directed
      FAP-specific T cells. The next patient will be enrolled earliest, when the previous patient
      completed day +14 and the safety monitoring board has not declared any DLTs. The palliative
      chemotherapy is not part of the study protocol.

        Inclusion criteria:

             mesothelioma with pleural effusion,

          -  Signed Informed Consent after being informed,
