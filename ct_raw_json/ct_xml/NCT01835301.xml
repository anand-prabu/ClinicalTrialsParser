  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to test the hypothesis that plaque composition differs within a stent
      between bare metal stents and drug eluting stents (DES). It is possible that a difference in
      plaque composition seen within a stent may be contributory to the late thrombotic events
      seen more frequently with DES.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject &gt; 18 years of age;

          -  Subject, male or female, who underwent DES or BMS implantation in a native coronary
             vessel more than 3 year ago;

          -  Subject is scheduled for a diagnostic coronary or interventional procedure;

          -  Subject is willing to sign the informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject requires emergency catheterization;

          -  Subject has an acute myocardial infarction defined as anginal symptoms with
             ST-elevation on the EKG or creatine kinase-MB elevation &gt;3times the upper limit of
             normal;

          -  Angiographic evidence of â‰¥ 70% stenosis within the target stent (visual estimate);

          -  Subject presented with cardiogenic shock;

          -  Subject has angiographically confirmed thrombus in the target coronary artery;

          -  Subject has a complex lesion not amenable to the IVUS/VH catheters and/or OCT
             catheters passing the stented segment;

          -  Subject has a contraindication to angiography/IVUS/OCT;

          -  Female subject is pregnant or lactating;

          -  Subject has life threatening comorbid conditions for which the investigator feels the
             subject should not be enrolled
