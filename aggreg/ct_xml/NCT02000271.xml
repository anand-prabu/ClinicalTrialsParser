  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vaginal packing is used routinely following vaginal reconstructive surgery.  Despite little
      data to support the practice, purported benefits include reduced pelvic fluid accumulation
      or blood loss.  Patients often complain of discomfort associated with the packing or its
      removal.

      This randomized controlled trial seeks to document differences in subjective impressions of
      pain in women undergoing vaginal repairs treated with and without packing.  The
      investigators also aim to assess differences in postoperative fluid collection in those with
      and without packing.
