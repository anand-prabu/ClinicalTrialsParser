  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity  is increasing at an alarming rate
      both nationally and worldwide. Accumulating evidence suggests that serum cholecalciferol
      levels may be inversely related to the prevalence of diabetes, insulin resistance and
      metabolic syndrome. However, to demonstrate a causal relation between vitamin D and glucose
      metabolism, evidence from randomized and adequately powered placebo-controlled intervention
      trials is needed.The trials available on the effect of Vitamin D supplementation are not
      conclusive. Hence, the purpose of this study was to conduct a double-blind randomized trial
      in Vitamin D deficient obese type 2 diabetic  Emirati population to clarify the effect of
      vitamin D supplementation on glycemic control and obesity parameters.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vitamin D insufficiency has been reported as a risk factor for the development of type 1 and
      type 2 diabetes mellitus. In contrast to the findings of the observational studies, the
      supplementation trials in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) do not report any definitive
      conclusions, but it does suggest that supplementation at an early stage in the development
      of diabetes may be of benefit in delaying progression to clinical T2DM by increasing the
      pancreatic insulin release and improved insulin resistance plus impaired glucose
      tolerance.There is also speculation on role of vitamin D in physiology of weight loss and
      body composition.However, there have been multiple inconsistencies within the reported trial
      i.e. sample size, dose of vitamin D, frequency of supplementation, and population studied.

      Hence the randomised clinical trial was undertaken  to study the effect of vitamin D
      (Cholecalciferol) supplementation on metabolic markers and obesity parameters in the vitamin
      D deficient obese type 2 diabetic subjects.
