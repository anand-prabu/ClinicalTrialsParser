  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study tests the hypothesis that use of the 3-D laparoscopic vision system (Viking
      Systems, La Jolla, CA) can significantly improve technical ability on a complex laparoscopic
      tasks in an experimental model.

      7 tasks on a 3-D laparoscopic instrument fitted to the trainer box and subjective criteria
      (4 point lickert scale) were evaluated for this study. Totally twenty-four participants (8
      experienced, 8 minimal experienced and 8 novices) were evaluated for different 10 tasks
      (touch the marked circle, pass the two circle with needle, pick-beads and place, grape the
      suture, move the needle from one instrument to another instrument, pick-and-place, cutting,
      three different suturing) in term of total task time and error number. Statistical Package
      Program was used to perform statistical analyses. The data were presented as arithmetic
      means and standard deviations were calculated in each group. A P value of &lt;0.05 was
      considered to be statistically significant.
