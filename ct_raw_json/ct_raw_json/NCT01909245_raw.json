            "textblock": "City of Hope National Medical Center, located in Duarte, CA, is hosting a clinical study on\n      islet cell transplantation, an experimental procedure being evaluated as a treatment for\n      patients with type 1 diabetes. Islet cell transplantation involves taking insulin-producing\n      cells from organ donors and transplanting them into the liver of a patient with diabetes.\n      Once transplanted, the islets produce insulin, which can improve blood sugar control and\n      eliminate the need to inject insulin or use an insulin pump.\n\n      Anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) is an anti-rejection medication that works by decreasing a\n      patient's T-cells. T-cells are special white blood cells that recognize and destroy unwanted\n      things like infections but can also attack transplanted cells and organs. Reducing the\n      number of T-cells at the time of transplant is expected to protect islets and improve\n      long-term transplant results. Transplant programs around the world have seen improved islet\n      transplant results using T-cell depleting medications. Approximately 5-6 out of every 10\n      patients remain off insulin five years after transplant. These results are similar to those\n      achieved with whole pancreas transplant without requiring major surgery, and therefore, may\n      be an option for patients who are not eligible for a whole pancreas transplant.\n\n      The purpose of this study is to determine if islet cell transplantation using ATG, along\n      with additional medications to prevent the body from rejecting the transplanted cells, is a\n      safe and effective treatment for type 1 diabetes. Study participants may receive up to three\n      islet transplants and will be followed for five years to monitor blood sugar control, islet\n      transplant function, and changes in quality of life."
