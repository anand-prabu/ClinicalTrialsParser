      The aim of the study is to prove

        -  that early discharge (within 72 hours) in selected group of patients with low risk of
           follow-up complications after myocardial infarction with elevations of ST-segment,
           treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention, is feasible and safe

        -  that early discharge is &quot;non-inferior&quot; in comparison with the group of patients,
           discharged in a standard way accordingly with present practice and physician´s decision
           (usually 4th-7th day), thus it is not associated with higher incidence of complications
           in 30th and 90th day after myocardial infarction
