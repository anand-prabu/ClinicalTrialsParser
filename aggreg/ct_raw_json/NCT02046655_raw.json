For this\n      reason, the use of corifollitropin alfa might be beneficial in poor responders in whom the\n      number of oocytes retrieved  is crucial for success.\n\n      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of corifollitropin alfa treatment\n      compared to daily recFSH in terms of the number of oocytes retrieved in a defined population\n      of poor responder patients undergoing intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) using\n      gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonists."
