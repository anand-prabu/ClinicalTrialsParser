In addition to the main\n      study, we will conduct a sub-study to determine the efficacy of AS/MQ (regime currently used\n      in Peru) After signing the informed consent/assent, blood samples will be taken to determine\n      parasite density, baseline biochemical tests, genotyping studies, analysis of molecular\n      markers and in vitro sensitivity, antibodies against malaria and cytokines. Artesunate will\n      be administered according to national guidelines in the first three days, 4 mg/kg/day.\n      However, mefloquine administration will be delayed for up to 72 hours to measure the rate of\n      clearance of parasitemia with artesunate alone in the first three days. Serial blood samples\n      for thick smears will be taken every 4 hours during the first 72 hours, during which time\n      the study participants will remain in a hospital ward. Monitoring will be undertaken until\n      day 42 with analysis of thick smears according to WHO guidelines. In case of parasitemia\n      recurrence, additional blood samples will be collected for genotyping tests, in vitro\n      sensitivity, and analysis of molecular markers of drug resistance and immunology assays. The\n      sub-study will be useful to assess the efficacy of the regimen currently in use by the\n      Ministry of Health of Peru, in this arm the patients will be given AS AS 4 mg/kg/day in Days\n      0, 1 and 2 and MQ 12.5mg/kg/day in Days 1 and 2. In this arm, the follow up will be done\n      using thick smears on Days 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35 and 42. Blood samples will be\n      collected on Days 0, 42 and the day of recurrence.\n\n      This study will allow the Ministry of Health to know the state of resistance/tolerance to\n      artesunate in Peru and take the necessary control measures to ensure that artesunate can be\n      used successfully for treatment of falciparum malaria. Importantly, the results of this\n      study will be compared to parallelly-designed studies in Kenya (US Army Medical Research\n      Unit Kenya-USAMRU K) and Thailand (Army Forces Medical Research Institute of Medical\n      Sciences-AFRIMS).\n\n      Relevance : Malaria is one of the main public health problems in Peru, early and eficacious\n      treatment  in the principal control strategy  the appearance of strains that are resistant\n      to the  regular treatment used in Peru  jeopardize  the strategies for malaria control in\n      South America. This study will allow us to know the current resistance status and to prepare\n      corresponding measures.\n\n      Budget: This study will be done as a joined effort between NAMRU-6 and the INS, this will\n      cost 201,934.93 Nuevos Soles afforded by Instituto Nacional de Salud and a total cost of\n      527,934.93 Nuevos Soles for both participating institutions"
