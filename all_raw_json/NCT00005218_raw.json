            "textblock": "BACKGROUND:\n\n      Angina pectoris is often considered a manifestation of coronary artery atherosclerosis that\n      is associated with an increased mortality risk.  Overall, coronary heart disease is the\n      leading cause of morbidity and mortality in United States Blacks.  In an attempt to\n      standardize the diagnosis of angina pectoris in epidemiologic studies, Rose developed a\n      questionnaire for cardiovascular field surveys which has primarily been used in United\n      States and other white populations.  However, in 1988, there were no valid epidemiological\n      tools for the assessment of angina pectoris in Blacks.  The development of a cardiovascular\n      survey instrument capable of assessing angina pectoris in Black populations was identified\n      by the Association of Black Cardiologists as an urgent epidemiologic need.  Also, such a\n      survey instrument could ultimately enhance knowledge and treatment of cardiovascular disease\n      among Blacks."
