  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of a novel positron
      emission tomography (PET) tracer [11C]BMT-136088 in healthy adult subjects for measurement
      of availability of Lysophosphatidic Acid (LPA1) receptors in the human lung and to use this
      tracer to assess LPA1 receptor occupancy using [11C]BMT-136088  in the human lung following
      oral administration of Bristol Myers Squibb (BMS)-986020.
