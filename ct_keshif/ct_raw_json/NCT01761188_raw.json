            "textblock": "what's is STABLE-SR approach? In our center, the LA substrate mapping was performed in\n      patients with paroxysmal AF and persistent AF during sinus rhythm, particularly 20 normal\n      subjects as control group as well. Our study showed that along with the duration of AF the\n      average voltage of LA deceased and the area of low voltage zone increased. The whole\n      activation time of entire LA would be longer. More complex fractionated electrograms was\n      found in LA. Importantly, we identified the low voltage zone (voltage range: 0.1-0.4mV) and\n      the transitional zone (voltage range: 0.4-1.3mV)  in which most of complex fractionated\n      electrograms located. Based on our findings a new novel ablation strategy has emerged, which\n      is modification of LA substrate during sinus rhythm (CPVI+STABLE-SR). Our sequential\n      protocol included 5 steps. First CPVI should be completed followed by CTI ablation to be\n      blocked. Then if AF rhythm maintained cardioversion would be taken. High density mapping of\n      LA substrate would be done during sinus rhythm to identify the low voltage zone and\n      transitional zone. Linear ablation or/and spot ablation should be designed according to the\n      mapping results. Finally bidirectional conduction block should be demonstrated for all the\n      linear lesion and all pulmonary veins would be checked for isolation."
