    <textblock>
      This is a two-period study of participants with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). In each
      period, participants will receive once daily injections of stable dose LY2605541 or insulin
      glargine for 28 to 35 days followed by procedures to look at how the body uses or stores
      fats and sugars. Participants will continue to use meal time insulin throughout the study.
      Healthy participants will also enroll in the study. They will not receive any study
      medication.
