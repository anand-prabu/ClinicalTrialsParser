This\n      pilot study will explore factors, namely microbial, genomic, and environmental (social and\n      physical), that may influence the onset and progression of leg ulcer formation and delayed\n      healing in individuals living with SCD. There is variation in the incidence and duration of\n      SCD leg ulcers. They are often very painful, resistant to treatment, and recurrent in\n      nature. The etiology of SCDassociated leg ulcers is unclear, and we hypothesize that\n      predisposition to developing leg ulcers is multifactorial. This pilot study is an\n      exploratory study of the microbiome and environment of individuals living with sickle cell\n      disease leg ulcers. The study   s objective is to identify triggers that may be integral in\n      leg ulcer onset and progression. The central goal of this study is to obtain an improved\n      understanding of the participants    leg ulcer microbiome and the psychosocial and\n      environmental factors that may increase one   s likelihood of developing this complication.\n      To achieve these goals, we will characterize the leg skin microbiome of SCD patients living\n      with and without leg ulcers within the United States.
