The threshold amperage that produces patellar motion in response to electrical stimulation will be recorded.  This threshold amperage will serve as a baseline value. Following the peripheral nerve block, transcutaneous stimulation will be repeated and, if still possible to elicit quadriceps contractions in response to electrical stimulation, the resulting new threshold amperage will be measured. The new threshold amperage will be expressed as a percentage of the baseline value and serve as a quantitative functional indication of the extent of quadriceps paresis resulting from the peripheral nerve block. The primary outcome will be quadriceps paralysis - yes/no.",
