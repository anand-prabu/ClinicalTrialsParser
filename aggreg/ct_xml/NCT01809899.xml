  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of the proposed study is to insure the protection and safety of human
      subjects who have been previously exposed to interpersonal traumatic events and who are
      participants in symptom provocation research. The investigators intend to examine trauma
      history, cognitive, interpersonal, and genetic predictors of participants' unfavorable
      reaction to participation in research involving trauma-related script-driven imagery (SDI).
      The design includes comparing participants in a consent as usual group to participants in an
      enhanced consent group to see which minimizes unfavorable effects of participating in a
      research provocation study. In addition, the two different consent groups will be assessed
      for their effects on psychobiological and neurobiological stress response. Furthermore, the
      investigators will examine the relationship between the psychobiological responses and
      neural mechanism during SDI, and unfavorable reactions to participation in symptom
      provocation research.
