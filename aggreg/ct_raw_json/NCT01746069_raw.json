The use of emerging technologies, such as mobile phone , may have a important role\n      in smoking cessation programs through sending reinforcement messages when patients quits\n      smoking.\n\n      Main objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of a combined 6 months smoking cessation\n      program including health advice provided by a doctor and sending support messages to mobile\n      phone of patients.\n\n      Methods: Study design: Randomized single blind clinical trial. Study population: Patients\n      over 18 who are willing to start a smoking cessation program, who have mobile phone, who are\n      able to receive and send messages, and who have a score greater than 5 or equal to 5 on the\n      Richmond scale.\n\n      Sample size: 160 patients per arm to detect a difference in the percentage of smoking\n      cessation than 10% (14.9% vs. 4.9%) between the two groups. Intervention: Experimental\n      group: Health advice and support messages to mobile phone patients.\n\n      Control group: Health advice. Assessment of the primary endpoint: At 6 months\n      (positive/negative coximetry test).\n\n      Statistical analysis: The analysis of the primary endpoint (positive / negative coximetry\n      test) will be performed using logistic regression."
