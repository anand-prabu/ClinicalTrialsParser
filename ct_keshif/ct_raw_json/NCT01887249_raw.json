The present investigators assumed\n      that doubling duration of second phase of sequential therapy might have more potent\n      bactericidal efficacy than previous 10-day sequential regimen. But 15-day regimen with\n      initial 5-day PPI with amoxicillin followed by remaining 10-day PPI, clarithromycin with\n      metronidazole was not ever tested before. Moreover, whether extending the sequential therapy\n      to 15-day might be more effective than 10-day sequential therapy is unknown especially in\n      Korea. From this background, the present investigators prepared clinical trials regarding\n      modified sequential therapy which was extending the treatment duration to 15 days compared\n      than previous 10-day sequential therapy regimen. In addition, pre-treatment antimicrobial\n      susceptibility testing was performed to find the possibility to overcome antimicrobial\n      resistance."
