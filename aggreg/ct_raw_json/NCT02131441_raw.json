Currently it is only carried out in a few large medical centers with\n      slow development. The related research studies were retrospective analysis, there were no\n      prospective randomized controlled multi-center study reported. Because of its relatively\n      simple anatomical advantages, left liver seems to be as the best platform to ensure maximum\n      safety and feasibility of prospective randomized study for laparoscopic hepatectomy .This\n      project intends to carry out a prospective randomized controlled multi-center study to look\n      for evidence of safety, efficacy and minimally invasive of laparoscopic left liver\n      resection, evaluate  the long-term efficacy including overall survival, disease-free\n      survival as well as time to disease recurrence for the left liver carcinoma."
