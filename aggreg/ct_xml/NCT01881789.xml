      Phase 1b:

        -  To establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of oprozomib and dexamethasone
           administered in combination with lenalidomide or oral cyclophosphamide

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of oprozomib and dexamethasone administered in
           combination with lenalidomide  or oral cyclophosphamide

      Phase 2:

        -  To estimate the overall response rate (ORR) and complete response rate (CRR)

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of oprozomib and dexamethasone administered in
           combination with lenalidomide  or oral cyclophosphamide

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To evaluate population pharmacokinetic (PK) parameter estimates of oprozomib and
           variability in these estimates when administered in combination with dexamethasone and
           lenalidomide or oral cyclophosphamide

        -  To estimate the duration of response (DOR)

        -  To estimate progression-free survival (PFS)

             dose

          -  Other malignancy within the past 3 years except those considered cured by surgical
