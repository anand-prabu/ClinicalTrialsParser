  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the PAS-01 study is to assess the safety of the intraocular as measured by
      the cumulative incidence of patients who within 5 years after implantation experience
      persistent vision-impairing corneal edema (corneal edema leading to persistent loss of best
      corrected distance visual acuity &gt;2 lines from pre-surgery baseline level).

      The study will test the null hypothesis that the percentage of patients who experience
      persistent vision-impairing cormeal edema is &gt;17% against the alternative that the
      percentage is &lt;17%.  The null hypothesis will be rejected if the upper bound of the
      two-sided 95% confidence interal for the observed percentage is &lt;17%.

      ECD sub-study.  At investigative sites participating in the ECD Sub-Group study, corneal
      endothelial cell densityh will be measured by non-contact specular microscopy in a subgroup
      of 150 patients enrolled in the IMT-PAS-01 in the eye schedule for and implanted with the
      intraocular telescope at study entry, 3 months, 12, months, 24 months, 36 months, 48 months
      and 60 months.
