            "textblock": "AutoHSCT is a standard treatment of patients with MM. According to soem clinical evidence\n      double autoHSCT provides survival advantage compared to a single procedure. Most frequently\n      used conditioning regimen consists pf high doses of melphalan (HD-MEL). In some studies it\n      was used in combination with total body irradiation (TBI), which, however was associated\n      with significant toxicity. In our center the standard procedure includes TBI as a single\n      treatment at 1st autoHSCT and HD-Mel at 2nd autoHSCT.\n\n      As in MM malignant plasma cells are localized almost exclusively in bone marrow there is\n      rationale to limit irradiation to bones. For this purpose in the current study we substitute\n      TBI with TMI. Additional boosts are provided for active sites of disease based on PET/CT\n      imaging. Our intention is to minimize toxicity while maintaining the treatment efficacy."
