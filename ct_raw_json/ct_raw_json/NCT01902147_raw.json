In this observational study, quality of recovery and patient satisfaction will be\n      measured using the Postoperative Quality Recovery Scale (PQRS). This tool includes six\n      domains of recovery: physiological, nociceptive (pain and nausea), emotive (anxiety and\n      depression), functional recovery (return of activities of daily living), self-assessed\n      recovery, and cognitive recovery."
