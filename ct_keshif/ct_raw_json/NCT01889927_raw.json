The exercise prescription\n      will include aerobic, anaerobic, strength, core conditioning and stretching components.\n\n      The main objectives of the study are:\n\n        1. Determine differences, if any, in lung function between the two groups;\n\n        2. Determine differences, if any, in exercise capacity between the two groups;\n\n        3. Evaluate cost of care of alternate model of care versus current model of care."
