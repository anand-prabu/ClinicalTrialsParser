    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that the proportion of treatment-naive
      non-cirrhotic subjects with Genotype (GT)-1b treated with Daclatasvir (DCV)/Asunaprevir
      (ASV)/BMS-791325 who achieve Sustained Virologic response (SVR12), defined as Hepatitis C
      virus (HCV) RNA &lt; LOQ target detected or target not detected (LOQ TD/TND) at follow-up Week
      12, is significantly higher than SVR12 of current Standard of Care (SOC).
