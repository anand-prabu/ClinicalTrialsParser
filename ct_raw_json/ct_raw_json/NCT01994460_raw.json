Linezolid showed considerable efficacy against\n      refractory multidrug-resistant TB. Considering the marked anti-TB effects of linezolid as\n      well as the possible adverse effects of its long-term use, it is rational to use linezolid\n      instead of ethambutol for the first 4 weeks of treatment for drug-susceptible pulmonary TB.\n      Through randomized controlled trial, the investigators will evaluate the hypothesis that the\n      use of linezolid instead of ethambutol will increase the sputum culture conversion rate by\n      15% after 2 months of treatment. Patients with TB without resistance to rifampicin will be\n      randomized to the following three arms at a 1:1:1 ratio: Arma 1 (control arm), Arm 2\n      (linezolid for 2 weeks instead of ethambutol), Arm 3 (linezolid for 4 weeks instead of\n      ethambutol)Primary outcome will be sputum culture conversion rate after 2 months of\n      treatment (liquid media)."
