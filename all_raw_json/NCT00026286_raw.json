Patients\n      are stratified according to prior hysterectomy (yes vs no), symptom complex (vasomotor vs\n      vaginal vs both), duration of hot flashes (less than 1 year or no hot flashes vs 1 year or\n      more), and average daily number of hot flashes (less than 10 or none vs 10 or more).\n      Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients who have not undergone prior hysterectomy receive oral\n           medroxyprogesterone once daily for 6 months. If, after 1 month, symptoms do not\n           resolve, patients receive oral conjugated estrogens once daily in addition to\n           medroxyprogesterone for 5 months. Patients who have undergone prior hysterectomy\n           receive oral conjugated estrogens once daily for 6 months.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo once daily for 6 months. Quality of life is\n           assessed at baseline and months 1, 2, 3, and 6.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then\n      annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 120 patients (60 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this\n      study within 12 months."
