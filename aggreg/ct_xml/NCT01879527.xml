  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Following acute inflammation of the optic nerve region, as commonly seen in multiple
      sclerosis patients, the optic nerve often undergoes atrophy, thus representing permanent
      damage. Data from animal studies suggest that amiloride may prevent this process. The aim of
      this study is to assess a potential neuroprotective effect of amiloride in acute autoimmune
      inflammation of the optic nerve region.
