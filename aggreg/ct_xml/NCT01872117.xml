  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The deep heat therapies are increasingly frequent in daily physical therapist for the
      treatment of musculoskeletal diseases. The use of such procedures is justified by their
      analgesic, anti-inflammatory, antiespasmolíticos and hiperemiantes. However, studies on the
      cardiovascular effects of these therapies are still incipient. Therefore, this study has as
      objectives: map the skin temperature changes in the lower limbs in different areas and
      positions after applying shortwave diathermy and microwave; assess hemodynamic and autonomic
      cardiovascular parameters, and investigate the occurrence of changes in conduction velocity
      superficial blood resulting from the application of these thermal features. The study will
      be conducted on 40 female volunteers between 18 and 30 years, university, healthy, that fit
      the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the study. The analysis by infrared thermography
      will be held in a room with temperature maintained at 23 ± 1°C and humidity average 50%. The
      volunteers will stay in prone position, with the legs bare, resting for 20 min to stabilize
      skin temperature with temperature of the room. After this period will be held applying
      diathermy of shortwave or microwave for 20 minutes at moderate heat on the lower limb
      regions of the hamstrings and triceps surae in extension and flexion to 180° to 90°. The
      records beat to beat blood pressure and heart rate to autonomic and cardiovascular
      hemodynamic evaluation will be performed by means of equipment Finometer (Finapress Medical
      Systems, Inc.) and electrocardiogram (ADInstruments, Inc.), respectively, before and after
      application of diathermy. On the other hand, the images will be processed using FLIR
      ThermoScan and blood flow data will be collected through the Doppler ultrasound. The results
      will be processed and analyzed using descriptive statistics, submitted to a linear
      regression model with mixed effects (random effects and fixed), with p≤0.05.

    <description>The skin temperature data will be acquired by a digital infrared thermographer at a distance of 1,5 m litter. 3 thermographic images will be collected over the application of diathermy at times 0, 10 and 20 min. For this, after the initial 10 min, the electrodes will be quickly removed from contact with the skin surface, so it can also be observed at room temperature under the electrode. Completed the 20 min of application will be also evaluated the temperature effect on residual time 10 and 20 min after application, where the individual remained at rest in the same position.</description>
