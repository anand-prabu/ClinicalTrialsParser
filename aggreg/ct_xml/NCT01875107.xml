  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our objective is to assess whether pre-treatment with a fixed dose of insulin, based on
      weight, given to pregnant patients with gestational or preexisting diabetes receiving
      betamethasone can provide adequate glycemic control.

      Our hypothesis is that pre-treatment with a weight-based calculated insulin dose will help
      maintain euglycemia for pregnant patients with gestational and preexisting diabetes after
      steroid administration, and possibly impact length of hospital admission.

    <description>Pregnant diabetic patients admitted to the hospital who receive steroids for fetal lung maturity will have their blood glucose levels checked before and after receiving steroids.  Blood glucose levels will be checked fasting and postprandial until the levels are consistently less than 160.  This will vary for patients, but will be on average 2 to 14 days.</description>
