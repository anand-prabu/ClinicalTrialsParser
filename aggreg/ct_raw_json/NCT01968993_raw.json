The investigator will perform a clinical evaluation and x-rays will be\n      performed if recent x-rays are not available.  Participants will undergo instrumented PLF\n      with an interbody fusion device (with autograft or allograft) using nanOss Bioactive in\n      combination with autograft bone and bone marrow aspirate in one posterolateral gutter and\n      autograft alone in the opposite posterolateral gutter.\n\n      Following surgery, operative and discharge information will be collected and a clinical\n      evaluation will be performed prior to discharge. Participants will be evaluated 6 and 12\n      months postoperatively.  One investigational site will participate in long-term followup of\n      24 months.  Each participant will complete x-rays and self assessment documents.  A CT scan\n      performed at the 12 month postoperative visit will be evaluated by an independent\n      radiologist to assess fusion results.
