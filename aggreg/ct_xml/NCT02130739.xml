    <textblock>
      This study prospectively evaluates the incidence of Horner's syndrome after thoracic
      epidural anesthesia following continuous thoracic epidural analgesia for mastectomy. The
      incidence was 1.36% and the mechanism of Horner's syndrome was cephalic spread of the local
      anesthetic.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Transient Horner's syndrome has been recognized rare complication of epidural anesthesia and
      the incidence is not exactly well-known in thoracic epidural anesthesia. Therefore, this
      study prospectively evaluates the incidence of Horner's syndrome after thoracic epidural
      anesthesia following continuous thoracic epidural analgesia for mastectomy.

      Six hundred thirty three Patients, who scheduled for mastectomy with/without breast
      reconstruction, were eligible for this prospective observational study from September 2010
      to December 2013. Thoracic epidural anesthesia performed using 0.375% or 0.5% ropivacaine
      15mL followed by sedation consisting of propofol without muscle relaxation. After the
      operation, thoracic epidural analgesia continued; supplemented by a continuous epidural
      infusion of ropivacaine 0.15%, 2 ml/h with fentanyl 8mcg/h. At 1 hour, 2hour, 1 day, 2 day
      and 3 day after the operation, postoperative surveillance consisted of the occurrence of
      symptoms of Horner's syndrome (miosis, ptosis, and hyperemia) were performed by
      anesthesiologists.
