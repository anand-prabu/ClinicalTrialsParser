Given the adaptive tendency of the maternal body to use alternative\n      energy sources such as ketones and free fatty acids rather than glucose and to shunt glucose\n      and amino acids to the fetus, the investigators hypothesize that the amino acid and fatty\n      acid profile will be reflective of this adaptive change and that maternal insulin resistance\n      will result in alterations in this pattern in both the plasma and CSF. Furthermore, the\n      investigators also hypothesize that maternal degrees of insulin resistance will also be\n      reflected in CSF hormonal changes."
