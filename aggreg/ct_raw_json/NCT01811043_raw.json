Both the guided meditation\n      and music interventions are administered through use of headphones during routine outpatient\n      imaging-guided core needle breast biopsies. Women in the guided meditation and music\n      conditions will be given a CD with instructions for home practice. Women complete follow-up\n      questionnaires in the 12 months after biopsy.  Receipt of recommended follow-up care is\n      examined for 60 months."
