      The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of exenatide on liver and heart
      (myocardial) fat and inflammation.

    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetics and insulin resistant individuals have an excess of fat in the liver which
      is not attributable to alcohol or other known causes of liver disease, a condition defined
      as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The fatty liver is insulin resistant.
      Individuals with a fatty liver are more likely to have excess intra-abdominal fat as well as
      a reduction in circulating plasma adiponectin levels. We have previously shown that type 2
      diabetes and its associated Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) is characterized by
      increased hepatic fat content, decreased circulating adiponectin levels, and hepatic and
      peripheral (muscle) insulin resistance.  Weight loss in humans with Non Alcoholic Fatty
      Liver Disease is associated with a decrease in hepatic fat content. Exenatide, an incretin
      based anti-diabetes therapy,  enhances glucose-dependent insulin secretion and
      glucose-dependent suppression of inappropriately high glucagon secretion, improves glycemic
      control in patients with type 2 diabetes and is associated with weight loss. In rodent
      studies, exenatide reduces hepatic and myocardial fat and reduces vascular inflammation
      independent of changes in weight.  Exenatide has also been shown to increase plasma
      adiponectin levels in humans and rodents.   Furthermore type 2 diabetics are characterized
      by an increase in both hepatic and myocardial fat and left ventricular dysfunction,
      particularly diastolic dysfunction.  However, the effect of exenatide therapy on liver and
      myocardial fat content, as well as left ventricular function in patients with type 2
      diabetes has not been previously studied.

    <description>Type 2 diabetic subjects will be randomized to receive either Exenatide 10 micrograms twice  daily injected subcutaneously or glipizide 5 mg twice daily orally for 6 months. All subjects will receive baseline measurements of fasting plasma glucose, free fatty acids, plasma adipocytokines, plasma lipids, and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) as well as measurement of liver and myocardial fat content and left ventricular function with magnetic resonance imaging/spectroscopy. All subjects will also undergo measurements of monocyte inflammatory proteins at baseline. All subjects will undergo repeat measurements of fasting plasma glucose, Free Fatty Acids, adipocytokines, HbA1c, monocyte inflammation, as well as hepatic/myocardial fat content determination and left ventricular function at the end of the 6 months.</description>
