  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary hypothesis of the study is single doses of MK-8351 will reduce the baseline
      early asthmatic response (EAR) as assessed by area under the curve from 0-3 hours (AUC0-3hr)
      of forced expiratory volume (FEV1) when compared to placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, 4-period study. Eligible patients will undergo a
      single-blind phase in Period 1, followed by 3 periods during which they will receive
      low-dose MK-8351, high-dose MK-8351, or matching placebo as a single dose in a random
      sequence crossover study design.
