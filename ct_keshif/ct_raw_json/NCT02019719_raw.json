OR Of\n             non-childbearing potential defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented tubal\n             ligation or hysterectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous\n             amenorrea [in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle\n             stimulating hormone 23.0 - 116.3 million international units (MIU)/millilitre (mL)\n             and estradiol <= 10 picograms (pg)/mL is confirmatory]. Females on hormone\n             replacement therapy (HRT) whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use\n             one of the approved contraception methods if they wish to continue their HRT during\n             the study.

For most forms of HRT, at least 2\n             weeks will elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval\n             depends on the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their\n             post-menopausal status, they can resume use of HRT during the study without use of a\n             contraceptive method.
