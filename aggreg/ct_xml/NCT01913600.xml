    <textblock>
      Prospective, multi-center, non-randomized, single-arm, open-label study to assess the safety
      and efficacy of the Resolute Integrity Stent for the treatment of de novo lesions in native
      coronary arteries with a reference vessel diameter (RVD) of 2.25 mm to 4.2 mm in patients
      who receive extended length stents (34 mm or 38 mm) referred to as the Extended Length
      Study.

      The purpose of this postapproval study is to conduct a prospective, multi-center evaluation
      of the procedural and clinical outcomes of subjects that are treated with the commercially
      available 34 mm and 38 mm Medtronic Resolute Integrity Zotarolimus-Eluting Coronary Stent
      System.

      Descriptive statistics and 95% confidence intervals will be calculated for clinically
      relevant variables as described in a separate statistical analysis plan.
