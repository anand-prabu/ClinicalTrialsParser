Some physicians believe that closure in a\n      straight line produces a scar that is more visible and slightly raised when compared to\n      closure in a zigzagging fashion. The researchers of this study believe that there is no\n      difference in the cosmetic appearance of one type of wound closure over the other. To\n      evaluate this, they will provide a survey with visual aids to volunteers to rate the\n      appearance of a straight line scar versus a zigzag scar."
