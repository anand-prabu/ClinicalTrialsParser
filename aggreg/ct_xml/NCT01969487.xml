  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgical residents and fellows acquire operative knowledge and skills by assisting attending
      surgeons in the operating room. Previous research has shown that practising technical skills
      prior to operating on patients can improve how skillfully laparoscopic surgery can be
      performed. Although an increasingly large number of patients are undergoing robotic
      hysterectomy and other robotic surgical procedures, little is known on how to ensure patient
      safety and treatment effectiveness when trainee surgeons participate in the operating room.
      Our study aims to determine the impact of immediate preoperative warm-up on a robotic
      surgery simulator by gynecologic surgical trainees on their intraoperative performance and
      on patient outcomes. The investigators are randomly assigning gynecologic surgical trainees
      at a major academic medical center to either warm-up immediately before surgery on a robotic
      surgery simulator or to not warm-up. The attending surgeon supervising the trainee in the
      operating room is unaware of whether the trainee was assigned to warm-up or no warm-up. The
      investigators will compare standard robotic surgical skills assessments of the trainees by
      the supervising attending surgeons and patient outcomes in the two groups.
