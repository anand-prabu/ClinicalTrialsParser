            "textblock": "Background: Recent observational studies have reported possible arrhythmogenic effects with\n      long-acting beta-agonists (LABA), while the long-acting anticholinergic tiotropium has been\n      associated with cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. Finally, pneumonia was the object\n      of a recent signal in trials of LABAs submitted for marketing approval.\n\n      Aim: To assess the potential cardio-pulmonary risk arising from the concurrent use of two\n      long-acting bronchodilators as well as from monotherapy use of each of the long-acting\n      bronchodilators.\n\n      Methods: A series of population-based cohort studies, using both cohort and nested\n      case-control analyses will be conducted using data from the United Kingdom's Clinical\n      Practice Research Datalink (CPRD). The base cohort will consist of new users of long-acting\n      bronchodilators from Jan 2002 until Aug 2012, age >= 55 with chronic obstructive pulmonary\n      disease (COPD) and at least two years of baseline medical history information. The\n      high-dimensional propensity score technique will be used to match new users of each\n      long-acting bronchodilator and new users of two bronchodilators with comparable subjects\n      from the base cohort, with one-year follow-up for outcomes of acute myocardial infarction,\n      stroke, heart failure, arrhythmia and community acquired pneumonia. Data will be analysed\n      using time-dependent Cox proportional hazard regression models and conditional logistic\n      regression models."
