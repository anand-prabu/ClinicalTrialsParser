  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phytosterols are plant sterols . Phytosterols have anti-inflammation effect. Investigators
      have a hypothesis: phytosterols reduce oxidative stress , enhance Insulin-like growth
      factor-1(IGF-1) and endothelial progenitor cells(EPCs). Therefore, phytosterols has novel
      role in cardiovascular protection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fatty liver is the hepatic feature of metabolic syndrome. Metabolic syndrome increase the
      risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. Adipose tissue secrete adipocytes
      accumulate in the liver result in fatty liver. Excess fat become low density
      lipoprotein-cholesterol(LDL-C) from liver. Oxidized- LDL-C adherence in the vessel result in
      atherosclerosis via inflammation and immune response.

      Phytosterols are present in the nuts, plant oil, broccoli and so on. The structure of
      phytosterols are similar with cholesterols. After the competition, the smaller absorption of
      cholesterols. Studies showed the average consumptions of phytosterols were 200mg daily but
      the enough amount for cardiovascular protection of phytosterols were 2000mg daily.

      Daily 2000mg phytosterols inhibit the absorption of intestine, reduce the LDL-C about 7-10%.
      Besides, phytosterols have the effect of anti-inflammation and anti-immune response. The
      anti-inflammation effect obvious inhibit the monocyte to transform to macrophage, inhibit
      the formation of foam cell.

      Clinical studies divided into two groups: 20/20 patients and 4 weeks follow up with
      cross-over test.First group: Phytosterols 1800mg/day for 4 weeks then placebo. Another
      group: placebo 4 weeks then phytosterols 4 weeks.Cross-over, double bland study.

      Investigators check the possible benefits of LDL-C, Total
      -cholesterol/HDL-cholesterol,anti-oxidant capacity,high sensitivity C reactive
      protein,IGF-1,EPCs and hemoblogubin-A1C; the possible side effect markers including liver
      function,muscle enzyme and ,hemolysis enzyme.

    <description>Phytosterols effect on reducing cholesterol and anti-inflammation. We check possible effect on reducing oxidative stress and increasing EPC function. So, phytosterols may be helpful on fatty liver disease with increased fat and possible chronic liver inflammation.</description>
