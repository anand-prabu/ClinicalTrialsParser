A questionnaires design including demographic variables , FRAX\n      variables, nutritional variables and osteoporosis and fall knowledge variables as well.The\n      pretest-posttest method was used to analyse the effect on education.\n\n      Expected outcomes : (1)Fall prevention educational programme will hold in northern region of\n      Taiwan at different communities in order to increasing osteoporosis awareness with fracture\n      risk assessment tool, establishing fall knowledges among elderly and some fall prevention\n      skills.(2)Elderly with 10-year probability of major osteoporotic fracture risk who more than\n      20% and 10-year probability of hip fracture risk who more than 3% will identify as high risk\n      of osteoporosis. (3) To estimate number of cases who identified as high risk will recommend\n      for BMD measurement."
