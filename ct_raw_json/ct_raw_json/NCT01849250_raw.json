To determine whether treatment with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) for 12 weeks (+ 2 weeks)\n      at 1000 mg twice daily as compared to placebo reduces normal breast tissue levels of tumor\n      necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in overweight and obese patients with a history of stage\n      I-III invasive breast cancer, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), Paget's disease, lobular\n      carcinoma in situ (LCIS), or proliferative benign breast disease.\n\n      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. To investigate the effect of DHA at 1000mg twice daily on tissue biomarkers\n\n        -  Change from the baseline in cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)/interleukin-1-beta\n           (IL-1beta)/aromatase measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction\n           (PCR).\n\n        -  Change from the baseline in crown-like structures of the breast (CLS-B) measured by\n           immunohistochemical techniques for cluster of differentiation (CD)68.\n\n        -  Change from baseline in CLS-B index determined as follows: ([number of slides with\n           evidence of at least one CLS-B]/[total number of slides examined]).\n\n      II. Evaluate age as a predictor of CLS-B and inflammatory biomarkers (tumor necrosis factor\n      (TNF)-alpha/COX-2/IL-1beta) at baseline and over the time of treatment.\n\n      III. Evaluate red blood cell (RBC) fatty acid level as a surrogate of compliance.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\n\n      ARM I: Patients receive docosahexaenoic acid orally (PO) twice daily (BID) for 12 weeks.\n\n      ARM II: Patients receive placebo PO BID for 12 weeks."
