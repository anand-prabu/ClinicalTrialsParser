Neoadjuvant Treatment (pre-operative chemo-radiotherapy regimen):\n\n           FOLFOX4* 2 cycles (WK1+WK3) - Tomotherapy** (WK5) - FOLFOX4* 2 cycles (WK7+WK9)\n\n           * Oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2 iv: day 1 Levofolinate 100 mg/m2 iv: day 1-2 5-fluorouracil 400\n           mg/m2 iv in bolus and 600 mg/m2 iv infusion over 22h: day 1-2 Every cycle will last 2\n           weeks (approximately 48 hours of treatment infusion and 12 days of rest).\n\n           ** 25 Gy in 5 consecutive fractions, one fraction per day in 5 days on CTV (Clinical\n           Target Volume) at the isodose of the 95% of the total dose. The treatment plan will be\n           elaborated at the work-station dedicated to the Helicoidal Tomotherapy. The treatment\n           could be planned also with linear accelerator with IGRT-IMRT technique or VMAT\n           technique.\n\n        2. Restaging (week 11)\n\n        3. Surgery (week 12-16) with Total Mesorectal Excision (TME)\n\n        4. End Of Treatment (week 16-32)\n\n        5. Adjuvant therapy (The maximum interval between surgery and start of adjuvant therapy\n           should be 8 weeks):\n\n        6. FOLFOX4* 8 cycles (every 2 weeks)\n\n      Study Duration: about 5 years. Enrollment period: 36 months. Treatment period: about 8\n      months. Follow-up: 1 year.\n\n      OBJECTIVES\n\n      Primary objectives:\n\n      Step A: to evaluate the feasibility and safety of the chemoradiotherapy regimen.\n\n      Step B: to evaluate the proportion of patients with pathological complete remission after\n      combined radio-chemotherapy.\n\n      Secondary objectives (of Step B):\n\n        -  To evaluate the safety of the neo-adjuvant treatment\n\n        -  To determine pathological down-staging\n\n        -  To evaluate the rate of R0 resection\n\n        -  To evaluate the sphincter saving resection rate\n\n        -  To evaluate median disease free survival and overall survival\n\n        -  To evaluate the correlation between biomarker, pathological response and outcome\n           (auxiliary\\subsidiary Biological Study)\n\n      NUMBER OF SUBJECT:\n\n      \u00b7 Step A: a maximum of 6 patients. 6 evaluable patients are needed to assess toxicity. If 1\n      toxicity resulting in discontinuation of treatment will be observed in 6 patients, the\n      treatment can be considered safe (with a confidence > 90%).\n\n      If 2 or more toxicity resulting in discontinuation of treatment on 6 patients, the study\n      will be stopped because not safe and another type of radiotherapy schedule must be designed.\n\n      \u00b7 Step B: a total of 50 patients is required to be recruited in 2 years (including patients\n      enrolled in Step A).\n\n      The goal is to achieve a proportion of at least 15% of patients with a complete pathological\n      response with the new radiochemotherapeutic treatment.\n\n      STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY:\n\n      The primary analysis will be performed on the ITT (Intention-To-Treat) population, while the\n      secondary analysis will be conducted on the PP (Per Protocol) population.\n\n      The number and percentage of treated patients undergoing grade 1 to 4 adverse events\n      (CTC-AE, version 4.0) will be tabulated in the ITT and PP population. No statistical\n      inference will be performed.\n\n      Step A: Patients, tumor characteristics and toxicity events observed will be described.\n\n      Step B: The proportion of patients with pathological Complete Response will be calculated.\n      Safety profile will be analyzed. OS (Overall Survival) and DFS (Disease Free Survival) will\n      be estimated with Kaplan-Meier method (Kaplan El, Meier P., J Am Stat Assoc 1958).\n\n      No interim analysis will be performed. The 95% confidence intervals should also be provided."
