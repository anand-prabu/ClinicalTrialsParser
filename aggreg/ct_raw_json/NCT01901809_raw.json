            "textblock": "Heart Failure with preserved Ejection Fraction (HFPEF) accounts for 40-50% of all heart\n      failure patients with a frequency of hospital admissions for acute decompensation and short\n      and long term mortality similar to patients with heart failure with reduced ejection\n      fraction (HFREF). Patients with HFPEF are often preload dependent and despite admission to\n      the hospital for acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF), are typically difficult to\n      diurese due to the development of acute kidney injury. No studies have been performed\n      evaluating treatment strategies for these patients.  We hypothesize that changing the method\n      of diuresis and/or the addition of low-dose dopamine for the treatment of ADHF in patients\n      with HFPEF will reduce renal injury, resulting in a shorter length of stay, and decrease\n      hospital readmissions over the ensuing year.  This trial will randomize patients to either\n      bolus or continuous infusion furosemide and then to either dopamine or no dopamine.  The\n      primary endpoint will be renal function at 72 hours as measured by change in GFR.  Secondary\n      endpoints for readmission, functional capacity, quality of life, and amount of diuresis will\n      also be collected."
