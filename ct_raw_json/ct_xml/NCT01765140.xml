  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a continuing project to provide 3,4 diaminopyridine (DAP) under a treatment-use IND
      to patients with Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) and congenital myasthenic syndrome
      (CMS).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The diagnosis of LEMS or CMS will have been made based on clinical and electromyographic
      findings, and all patients will have been referred to the PI for DAP treatment.  This study
      will enroll minors and adults.

      CMS patients under age 18 years will be included if their parent or guardian gives written
      permission.  Minors who turn 18 while in the program will be re-consented as adults.

      The dose of DAP will be determined individually for each patient.  Adults will start with a
      dose of 10 mg 3-4 times daily, increasing over several weeks to the dose that produces the
      maximum symptomatic response, not to exceed 100 mg daily.  Pyridostigmine bromide (PB) may
      be added at low doses, increasing to the dose that produces the best response, not to exceed
      360 mg daily.  In children, equivalent doses of these medications will be given calculated
      on a surface area basis.  The doses of DAP and PB will be periodically adjusted to assure
      that the smallest effective doses are used.

      Patients who achieve significant clinical benefit from DAP, as judged by the study PI and
      the patient, may continue taking DAP as long as the drug is available from the sponsor, and
      as long as they return for regular follow-up evaluations at the Duke MG Clinic.  Patients
      who are unable to return for regular follow-up will be required to have their local
      physician obtain DAP for them from the sponsor.
