  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The process of enhancing the functional capacity of an individual before an operation to
      enable him or her to withstand the stress of surgery has been termed prehabilitation.  It
      has been shown that poor baseline capacity for physical performance and poor nutritional
      status increase the risk of complications after major non cardiac surgery and prolong
      recovery. A controlled randomized study in patients undergoing radical cystectomy for cancer
      is therefore proposed to determine the impact of multimodal prehabilitation on functional
      exercise capacity and functional recovery. Patients who accept to be enrolled in the study
      will be randomized to either a group receiving a multimodal intervention which includes
      nutritional supplementation (Immunocal® whey protein) combined with a physical exercise
      program and stress reduction strategies before and after surgery, or a control group who
      will receive standard preoperative treatment as per our institution.

    <description>The 6MWT evaluates the ability of an individual to maintain a moderate level of physical activity over a time period reflective of the activities of daily living. Subjects are instructed to walk back and forth, in a 20 m stretch of hallway, for six minutes, at a pace that would make them tired by the end of the walk</description>

This group will receive general instructions, by the preoperative clinic nurse, on exercises (breathing, ankle rotation) to be done before and after surgery. They will also be seen by a nutritionist who will provide general counseling for healthy eating.</description>
