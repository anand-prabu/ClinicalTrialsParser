            "textblock": "This study is a non-randomized, controlled clinical trial with the following objectives:\n\n        -  To determine whether infants with congenital cataract have improved visual outcomes\n           following cataract extraction surgery using (1) the traditional capsulorhexis method or\n           (2) our new minimally invasive method.\n\n        -  To determine the occurrence of postoperative complications among infants with\n           congenital cataract following cataract extraction surgery using (1) the traditional\n           capsulorhexis method or (2) our new minimally invasive method.\n\n      The study is conducted for the following reasons:\n\n        -  Transplantation of pluripotent stem cells represents an appealing therapeutic strategy\n           in regenerative medicine, but its clinical applications have been hindered in part by\n           concerns about tumorigenicity and immune rejection. The use of endogenous stem cells\n           provides a possible solution to this problem.\n\n        -  Lens regeneration has been reported in lower vertebrate animals. Furthermore, residual\n           endogenous lens epithelial stem cells (LESCs) after lens removal in rabbits have been\n           shown to proliferate and generate lens fibers.\n\n        -  Cataract, or opacification of the lens, is a major cause of blindness worldwide.\n           Surgery for congenital cataract carries a significant risk of complications and often\n           requires additional surgical procedures to maintain the transparency of the visual\n           axis.\n\n        -  Implantation of intraocular lenses (IOLs) following cataract extraction is becoming\n           increasingly common in the pediatric population. However, their use is controversial in\n           children younger than two years old (especially not recommended in children younger\n           than 6 months old due to the high incidences of IOL-related complications), as the\n           refractive power of the eye continues to develop. In addition, IOLs have many\n           limitations, including dislocation, less than ideal biocompatibility, inadequate\n           accommodative properties, and suboptimal visual outcomes.\n\n        -  The trial will demonstrate whether a modified cataract surgical technique can\n           regenerate the lens from endogenous stem cells. It will also compare the incidence of\n           complications and characterize visual outcomes in pediatric patients treated with the\n           modified surgical technique versus the traditional surgical technique."
