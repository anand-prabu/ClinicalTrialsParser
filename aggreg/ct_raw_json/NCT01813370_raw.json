As a result, the\n      investigators do not yet know whether hormonal therapy alone, or in combination with\n      docetaxel, is better at preventing prostate cancer recurrence in patients who had a rising\n      PSA after prostatectomy. This study will continue following patients according to a schedule\n      that is similar to that found in the TAX 3503 (MSK IRB #07-101) study in order to answer\n      that question. This study is known as a registry study. The patients' will not receive any\n      treatment as part of this study. Instead, they will be asked to have a blood test performed\n      once every 12 weeks."
