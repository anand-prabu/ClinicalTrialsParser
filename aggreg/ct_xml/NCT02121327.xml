  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has been reported that stroke is the first cause of becoming bedridden, and its
      cumulative recurrence rate in 5 years is approximately 35%.  There is a high probability
      that patients reduce or discontinue medications by self-determination, leading to a high
      risk of stroke recurrence in these patients.  Comprehensive and long-term patient educations
      ameliorating their self-management are important making patients possible to be managed
      according to the guidelines for their risk factors.  Using disease management programs
      created for each of risk factors according to clinical practice guidelines, the influence of
      those programs were evaluated for the prevention of stroke recurrence in this Disease
      Management Program Stroke Trial.
