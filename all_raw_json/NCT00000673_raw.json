Changes made in neutrophils count from < 500 to < 750 cells/mm3.\n      Nonrandomized eyes will not be used for the primary efficacy evaluation.\n\n      ORIGINAL DESIGN: To determine the effectiveness and safety of ganciclovir (DHPG) therapy in\n      AIDS patients suffering from active cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection of the retina of the eye\n      (retinitis) when the drug is administered directly into the fluid-filled vitreous cavity of\n      the eye by injection.\n\n      CMV retinitis is the most frequently seen opportunistic infection of the eye in AIDS\n      patients, and left untreated can lead to severe visual loss and blindness. While systemic\n      administration of DHPG has been shown to be an effective treatment for CMV retinitis, the\n      chronic administration required may be complicated by decreased blood cell counts\n      (granulocytopenia) which may require discontinuation of treatment. While withholding\n      treatment may allow recovery from the granulocytopenia, interruption of therapy may result\n      in reactivation of the retinitis. Injection of DHPG into the vitreous cavity of the eye may\n      be of benefit to severely neutropenic patients with CMV retinitis."

Eyes with\n      sight-threatening lesions or eyes without functional vision are treated immediately and eyes\n      without sight-threatening lesions are randomly chosen for either immediate or deferred\n      therapy. DHPG is given by injection with a very fine needle twice a week for the first 3\n      weeks and once a week for the remaining 24 weeks."
