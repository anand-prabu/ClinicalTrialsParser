Therefore, there is an increased\n      interest in the use and prescription of estrogen derived from plants, known as\n      fitoestrog\u00eanios.\n\n      The development of a drug containing two standardized extracts was focused on two main\n      symptoms of menopause: hot flashes and anxiety. This product comes from a longing for the\n      doctors themselves can respond more promptly to patients who reach menopause and who already\n      has a framework for mild to moderate anxiety.\n\n      Thus, to meet the woman who develops menopausal symptoms and that these two are highly\n      prevalent during menopause, causing intense discomfort routine for this woman, was produced\n      in association with Soy Passiflora aiming to control anxiety and hot flushes"
