Recently, internal limiting membrane (ILM) peeling has\n      become used widely as an adjunctive procedure during MH surgery because the removal of ILM\n      is thought to reduce the tangential traction on the macula, a major factor in the\n      pathogenesis of idiopathic macular holes. However, the role of ILM peeling in macular hole\n      surgery is not yet well defined. To the best of our knowledge, there is no meta-analysis on\n      comparison of the efficacy of ILM peeling and suture for MH surgery. This study reviewed the\n      published literature comparing surgical results with and without ILM peeling and and\n      performed a meta-analysis to determine whether there is any benefit or detriment\n      anatomically and/or visually."
