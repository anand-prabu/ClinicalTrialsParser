    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, open-label, multicenter Phase 3 study evaluating the performance of
      the Albuterol Spiromax dose counter in patients with a diagnosis of asthma and/or COPD. The
      purpose of this study is to evaluate the functionality, reliability, and accuracy of the
      Albuterol Spiromax inhaler integrated dose counter in a clinical setting.

    <textblock>
      The study consists of a screening/run-in period where, after meeting study criteria,
      patients enter a run-in period lasting 7 to 14 ±2 days, during which diary and medication
      compliance, as well as inhaler technique, will be assessed. The run-in period will commence
      the day following the completion of all screening procedures and will continue through to
      and include the day prior to the first treatment visit (TV1) such that a minimum of 7 full
      days of diary data will be collected prior to TV1. The purpose of the run-in period is to
      assess compliance with a BID dosing regimen and with the completion of the diary entries
      over a minimum period of 7 days. Patients who demonstrate adequate inhaler technique and who
      are at least 90% compliant with dosing and completion of the diary on the last 7 consecutive
      days of run-in will qualify for enrollment into the open-label study. The study treatment
      period will comprise 6 treatment visits (TV1-TV6) for all enrolled patients except those in
      the 5-week treatment cohort who will have only 5 treatment visits (TV1-TV5). Patients may
      continue taking their current asthma or COPD medications throughout the Treatment Period.
      The patient will return to the clinic on Days 8 (±1), 15 (±1), 22 (±1), and 36 (±1), and
      then on Day 50 (-2) after approximately all 200 doses have been delivered, or until early
      withdrawal. The patient will be deemed to have completed the study if at least 90% of the
      recommended doses contained in Albuterol Spiromax with dose-counter were used. A
      representative sample (approximately 15%) of patients will participate in the trial for
      approximately 5 weeks with Day 36 (±1) being the final study visit.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Written informed consent/assent signed and dated by the patient and/or parent/legal
             guardian before conducting any study related procedure

          2. Male or female (non pregnant/non lactating) patients 4 years of age or older at the
             time of the screening visit (SV) who are able to understand English

          3. Females of childbearing potential (as judged by the investigator) currently using and
             will continue to use a medically reliable method of contraception for the entire

             active must agree to use a medically reliable method of contraception should they
             become active during the course of the study. Women of childbearing potential, or
             less than 1 year postmenopausal, will require a negative urine pregnancy test at the
             SV. Female patients will be considered to be of non-child-bearing potential and will
             not require a urine pregnancy test if at least one of the following apply:a. before
             menarche; b. more than one year post-menopausal; c. had a hysterectomy, bilateral
             oophorectomy, salpingectomy, or tubal ligation; d. has congenital sterility

          4. General good health, defined as free of any concomitant conditions or treatment that
             could interfere with study conduct, influence the interpretation of study
             observations/results, or put the patient at increased risk during the study

          5. Has a physician diagnosis of asthma or COPD with symptoms of bronchoconstriction
             requiring the use of short-acting β2-agonists

          6. Current Therapy: The patient's current asthma/COPD controller treatment regimen has
             remained stable for at least four weeks prior to the SV

          7. Capable of understanding the requirements, risks, and benefits of study
             participation, and, as judged by the investigator, capable of giving informed
             consent/assent and being compliant with all study requirements (visits, record
             keeping, etc)

          8. Able to demonstrate satisfactory Spiromax inhaler use and technique.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History of life-threatening asthma or COPD that is defined for this protocol as an
             asthma or COPD episode that required intubation and/or was associated with
             hypercapnea, respiratory arrest, or hypoxic seizures

          2. Culture-documented or suspected bacterial or viral infection of the upper or lower
             respiratory tract, sinus, or middle ear that is not resolved within 2 weeks of the
             SV; or that occurs between the SV and TV1

          3. Is being treated with a long-acting β2-agonist alone

          4. Any asthma exacerbation requiring oral corticosteroids within 2 months of SV and any
             COPD exacerbation requiring oral corticosteroids within 1 month of the SV. A patient
             must not have been hospitalized for asthma or COPD within 4 months prior to the SV.

          5. Historical or current evidence of a clinically significant disease including, but not
             limited to: cardiovascular (e.g., congestive heart failure, known aortic aneurysm,
             clinically significant cardiac arrhythmia or coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular
             accident), hepatic, renal, hematological, neuropsychological, endocrine (e.g.,
             uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, uncontrolled thyroid disorder, Addison's disease,
             Cushing's syndrome), and/or gastrointestinal (e.g., poorly-controlled peptic ulcer or
             gastroesophageal reflux disease [GERD]). Significant is defined as any disease that,
             in the opinion of the investigator, would put the safety of the patient at risk
             through participation, or which could affect the endpoint analysis if the
             disease/condition exacerbated during the study.

          6. Uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure [BP] ≥160 mmHg or diastolic BP
             &gt;100 mmHg)

          7. History of any adverse reaction, including immediate or delayed hypersensitivity to
             any β2-agonist, sympathomimetic drug, or any component of the Albuterol Spiromax DPI
             or rescue ProAir Hydrofluoroalkane (HFA) Metered-dose inhaler (MDI) formulation.

          8. Other exclusion criteria apply.
