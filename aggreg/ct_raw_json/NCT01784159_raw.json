            "textblock": "Platelet activation is an important factor in the pathogenesis of microvascular thrombosis\n      characteristic of infections. Microthrombosis may be related to the progression of\n      dysfunction during sepsis. Several drugs were tested in order to directly regulate blood\n      clotting. However, there is a lack of studies on aspirin use in sepsis. Observational\n      studies have demonstrated a decreased morbidity and mortality of sepsis with previous use of\n      aspirin. However, no prospective randomized studies regarding this intervention were done.\n      The objectives of this study are to evaluate the impact of the use of aspirin in reducing\n      organ dysfunction measured by SOFA score on the seventh day, and assess its effect on the\n      duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU and hospital stay, as well as platelet activity,\n      inflammatory and prothrombotic activity. Thus, adult patients with severe sepsis and / or\n      septic shock with less than 48 hours will be randomly allocated into two groups. Group 1\n      (ASA) will receive aspirin 200 mg and  Group 2, placebo either once daily for 14 days. The\n      inflammatory status and coagulation will be collected either in the D0 and D3, with\n      measurements of interleukin 6, interleukin 10 and interleukin-8. The coagulation profile\n      will be analyzed by measuring thrombin-antithrombin complex, thrombin time, d-dimer and\n      tissue factor. The platelet activity will be evaluated by testing platelet function (PFA)\n      and by measurement of urinary metabolites and thromboxane."
