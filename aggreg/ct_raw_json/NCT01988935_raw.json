            "textblock": "Research shows that people with PTSD are more likely to smoke than people without PTSD. It\n      also shows that people with PTSD have more difficulty at attempts to quit smoking.  This\n      study is part of a program aimed at finding out how best to help smokers quit who also have\n      PTSD.  One option is to give patients standard smoking cessation treatment including\n      nicotine replacement and cognitive behavioral therapy. Another option is to give patients\n      the standard smoking cessation treatment in addition to treatment for their PTSD symptoms\n      (called prolonged exposure). However, it is not known which method works better. In order to\n      answer this question, patients will be assigned by chance to one of two groups. One group\n      will be given standard smoking cessation treatment to help quit smoking. A second group will\n      be given the standard smoking cessation intervention to help quit smoking in addition to a\n      form of psychotherapy called Prolonged Exposure to reduce symptoms of PTSD. The patients\n      will be randomly assigned (by chance) to one of these groups.  If the patient is assigned to\n      the smoking cessation only condition and the patient still has PTSD symptoms after the last\n      study visit (week 30) the patient will be offered treatment for your PTSD symptoms\n      (Prolonged Exposure) at no cost. The patient's participation will help the investigators\n      determine if treating PTSD symptoms enhances the ability of standard smoking cessation to\n      help people quit smoking."
