      The purpose of this study is to evaluate 9 month angiographic and intravascular ultrasound
      (IVUS) data for the SYNERGY Everolimus-Eluting Platinum Chromium Coronary Stent System
      (SYNERGY Stent System) in the treatment of subjects with atherosclerotic lesion(s) ≤34 mm in
      length (by visual estimate) in native coronary arteries ≥2.25 mm to ≤4.0 mm in diameter (by
