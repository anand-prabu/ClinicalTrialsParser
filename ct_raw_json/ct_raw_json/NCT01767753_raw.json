SLT has been suggested to reduce IOP more consistently\n      during the nocturnal period than during the diurnal period in a group of medically-treated\n      patients with primary open angle glaucoma (POAG). At present, there is scarce data on SLT\n      effects on the 24-hour IOP pattern in patients with glaucoma and there is no data on the\n      24-hour effect of SLT in untreated glaucoma patients.\n\n      The purpose of this study is to assess the changes of IOP over a 24-hour period in patients\n      with glaucoma undergoing SLT."
