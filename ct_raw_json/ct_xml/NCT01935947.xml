  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well azacitidine and entinostat before
      chemotherapy in treating patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as azacitidine, irinotecan hydrochloride, gemcitabine hydrochloride,
      docetaxel, and pemetrexed disodium, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor
      cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Entinostat may stop
      the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving
      azacitidine and entinostat before chemotherapy may be an effective treatment for non-small
      cell lung cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Percentage of patients progression-free at 6 months from time of randomization.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Progression-free survival (PFS). II. Overall Survival (OS).

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms.

      ARM A: Patients receive azacitidine subcutaneously (SC) on days 1-6 and 8-10 and entinostat
      orally (PO) on days 3 and 10. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 2 courses in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with stable or progressive disease
      receive chemotherapy of the treating oncologist's choice comprising irinotecan hydrochloride
      intravenously (IV) on day 1, docetaxel IV on day 1, pemetrexed disodium IV on day 1, or
      gemcitabine hydrochloride IV on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM B: Patients receive azacitidine PO on days 1-21 and entinostat PO on days 3 and 10.
      Treatment repeats every 28 days for 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients with stable or progressive disease receive chemotherapy of
      the treating oncologist's choice as in Arm A.

      ARM C: Patients receive chemotherapy of the treating oncologist's choice as in Arm A.

      After completion of treatment, patients are followed up every 3-6 months for 24 months and
      then yearly thereafter.

    <description>The final analysis will be by Fisher's Exact test, with percentage of patients who have not progressed as the outcome variable. Using Fisher's Exact test for analysis with 55 patients per treatment group will provide 88% power to detect an increase from 40% (chemotherapy alone) to 65% (epigenetic therapy followed by chemotherapy) in the number of patients who are progression free at six months.</description>

             steroids as clinically indicated

          -  Patients with liver metastases that replace greater than 30% of the liver parenchyma

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to entinostat, azacitidine, mannitol, irinotecan, docetaxel, pemetrexed,
             or gemcitabine, or other agents used in the study

          -  Uncontrolled inter-current illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, New York Heart Association (NYHA) class 3-4 congestive heart failure,
             unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social
             situations that would limit compliance with study requirements

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study; breastfeeding should be discontinued if
             the mother is treated on this protocol
