To examine the efficacy of GET Living in addressing\n      pain-related fears the investigators propose to use a sequential replicated randomized\n      single-case experimental phase design with multiple measures. The specific aims are to 1)\n      evaluate the effectiveness and acceptability of individually tailored GET Living for\n      children with high pain-related fear and functional disability and 2) define anatomical and\n      resting state connectivity patterns in the brains of children and adolescents with complex\n      chronic pain prior to and after participation in GET Living."
