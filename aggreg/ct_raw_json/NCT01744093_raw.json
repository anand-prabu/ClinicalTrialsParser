            "textblock": "In the context of improved survival from HIV infection itself, chronic obstructive pulmonary\n      disease (COPD); a form of lung disease that includes emphysema, which makes breathing\n      difficult) is emerging as an important cause of morbidity and perhaps ultimately mortality\n      in this population. HIV-infected patients are at increased risk of chronic obstructive\n      pulmonary disease, likely due to multiple factors, including an increased presence of\n      smoking, chronic inflammation and progression of immunodeficiency, oxidant stress (excessive\n      levels of natural chemicals called oxidants and free radicals that can damage tissue), and\n      respiratory infections. While natural history data on COPD are limited in the era of potent\n      antiretroviral therapy, earlier data suggest that the course of emphysema may be accelerated\n      in this population. Our preliminary data suggest that several matrix metalloproteinases\n      (MMPs) derived from alveolar macrophages (a type of immune cell found in the lungs) have an\n      increased cellular response in HIV-infected smokers, which could contribute to accelerated\n      emphysema.  Matrix metalloproteinases are enzymes that break down the structural support of\n      tissues, including the airways in the lung.\n\n      Based on these observations, the investigators hypothesize that pharmacologic inhibition of\n      matrix metalloproteinases by doxycycline will favorably modify the natural history of\n      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in HIV-infected patients. To test this hypothesis, the\n      investigators propose conducting a proof of concept pilot study as a prelude to a possible\n      phase II randomized, placebo-controlled trial (testing safety and efficacy in a larger\n      population controlled with a \"sugar pill\") of doxycycline for COPD in HIV-infected patients\n      should the proof of concept be successful. Our research team, led by a\n      pulmonologist/researcher with expertise in HIV-associated COPD and an infectious diseases\n      specialist/clinical trials expert, is well positioned to propose such a trial to the\n      NIH-funded AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG)."

Our preliminary data suggest that several lung matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)\n      are upregulated in HIV-infected smokers, which could contribute to accelerated emphysema by\n      virtue of their ability to degrade extracellular matrix and basement membrane components.\n      Our aims are: (1) end, we first propose to conduct a pilot study to enable us to address the\n      following Specific aims: Aim 1. To determine the safety, tolerability, and biologic effects\n      of twice daily doxycycline for 6 months in HIV-infected subjects with COPD; and (2) to\n      prepare and submit an application for a phase II clinical trial of doxycycline for COPD in\n      HIV-infected subjects. To address the first aim, we will conduct a randomized, double-blind,\n      placebo-controlled pilot study of doxycycline 100 mg twice daily in 30 HIV-infected subjects\n      with COPD(2:1 doxy:placebo). The primary endpoint will be safety/tolerability and secondary\n      endpoints will include change in FEV1, reduction of MMP activity in epithelial lining fluid\n      and cells obtained by bronchoscopy and doxycycline levels in blood, ELF and bronchoalveolar\n      lavage (BAL) cell pellets. In addition to providing novel insights into the biologic effects\n      of doxycycline in the lung, the pilot study will inform selection of endpoints for a phase\n      II trial, which ultimately will address an unmet medical need for novel interventions for\n      COPD/emphysema in HIV-infected patients."
