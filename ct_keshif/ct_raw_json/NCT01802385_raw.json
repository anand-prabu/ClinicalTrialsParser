The\n      first subjects enrolled into the study will receive 100 mg/day of sertraline.  This dose\n      will be sequentially increased by 100 mg/day in groups of n=5 up to a maximum of 400mg\n      daily.  Total anticipated enrollment: 20 subjects.\n\n      Phase III Design: Subjects will be randomized to standard induction therapy with masked\n      placebo or sertraline at 200mg or 400mg/day.  We will use a permutated block randomization\n      in a 1:1:1 allocation (n=160 per arm). Total anticipated enrollment: 480 subjects."
