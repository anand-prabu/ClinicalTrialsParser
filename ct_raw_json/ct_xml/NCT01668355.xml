  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People with serious mental illness have difficulty making good use of primary care, and die,
      on average, years earlier than others in the population.  The greatest contributors to this
      premature mortality are medical illnesses, especially cardiovascular disease and cancer.
      The Patient Centered Medical Home is a model for reorganizing primary care practice so that
      healthcare is more effective, efficient, and user-friendly.  It is being implemented across
      VA as the, &quot;Patient Aligned Care Team&quot; (PACT).   It is unclear, however, how this PACT model
      applies to people whose predominant illness is treated by specialists.  This is the case for
      people with serious mental illness (SMI), many of whom require ongoing treatment at mental
      health clinics.  To achieve optimal health outcomes in the population with SMI, it may be
      necessary to adapt the PACT model so that it includes approaches that have proven to improve
      healthcare in this population.  This project implements an adapted &quot;SMI-PACT&quot; model at two
      VA healthcare centers, and evaluates its effect on veterans with SMI.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background/Rationale:

      People with serious mental illness (SMI) die, on average, many years prematurely, with rates
      of premature mortality 2 to 3 times greater than the general population.  Over 60% of
      premature deaths in this population are due to &quot;natural causes,&quot; especially poorly treated
      cardiovascular, respiratory, and infectious diseases.  Although the VA is a centrally
      organized, comprehensive healthcare system, veterans with SMI still have difficulty
      navigating the system, and are at substantially elevated risk for premature death.  Too
      often, they do not attend scheduled appointments or fail to engage in primary care
      treatment, and consequently do not get valuable preventive and primary care services.

      Primary care in VA has undergone significant transformation under the Patent Aligned Care
      Team (PACT) model, which is based on the Patient Centered Medical Home (PCMH) concept.  PACT
      has the goal of improving the quality, efficiency, and patient-centeredness of primary care.
       But it remains unclear how PACT will impact the large populations of veterans who get the
      majority of their care in specialty settings, such as people with SMI.  Research can inform
      efforts to apply the PACT model in specialty settings.  For example, while people with SMI
      do poorly with usual primary care arrangements, there is now substantial evidence that
      integrated care and medical care management approaches can improve medical treatment and
      outcomes, and reduce treatment costs, in people with SMI.

      Objective:

      Using available evidence, we propose to implement and evaluate a specialized PACT model that
      meets the needs of individuals with SMI (&quot;SMI-PACT&quot;).

      Methods:

      This project will partner with leadership at two medical centers to implement SMI-PACT, with
      the goal of improving healthcare and outcomes among people with SMI, while reducing
      unnecessary use of emergency and hospital services.  Evidence-based quality improvement
      strategies will be used to reorganize processes of care.  In a site-level controlled trial,
      this project will evaluate the effect, relative to usual care, of SMI-PACT implementation on
      (a) provision of appropriate preventive and medical treatments; (b) patient health-related
      quality of life and satisfaction with care; and (c) medical and mental health treatment
      utilization and costs.  The project includes a mixed methods formative evaluation of usual
      care and SMI-PACT implementation to strengthen the intervention, and assess barriers and
      facilitators to its implementation.  Mixed methods will also be used to investigate the
      relationships between organizational context, intervention factors, and patient and provider
      outcomes; and identify patient factors related to successful patient outcomes.

      Significance:

      This project's approach to SMI-PACT is consistent with the VA PACT model, and with efforts
      in VA to improve care for veterans with psychiatric disorders.  This will be one of the
      first projects to systematically implement and evaluate the PCMH and PACT concepts beyond
      primary care.  Should SMI-PACT be demonstrated to be feasible and effective, the model could
      be used more broadly to improve the quality and efficiency of care for veterans with serious
      mental illness.  Findings regarding PACT in specialty mental health may also inform efforts
      to improve care in other specialty healthcare settings.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patient subjects and all staff subjects will be currently enrolled in care at one
             of the 4 sites for this study (which are yet to be named).

          -  All patient subjects will be veterans.

        Patient subjects:

          -  We will enroll a random sample of 1000 patients who have diagnoses of schizophrenia

          -  schizoaffective disorder

          -  bipolar disorder

          -  or recurrent major depression with psychosis (500 intervention, 500 control).

        Staff subjects:

          -  We will enroll approximately 15 staff per site.

          -  At each site this will include:

               -  3 members of PACT

               -  4 members of SMI-PACT (intervention site) or mental health integration (control
                  site)

               -  4 providers from the mental health clinic

               -  2 administrators who oversee the mental health clinic (e.g., psychiatry,
                  psychology, nursing, social work, clerks)

               -  and 2 administrators who oversee primary care.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients will not be excluded based on comorbid mental or medical diagnoses.

          -  However, there is a subset of individuals at mental health clinics who are
             psychiatrically stable and advanced enough in their recovery that they do not require
             enhanced supports to make effective use of PC.

          -  This will be assessed at baseline by each patient's clinician, using the Milestones
             of Recovery Scale (MORS)69 scale.

          -  This scale rates an individual's ability to self-manage their care.

          -  Patients who rate at &quot;early recovery&quot; or &quot;advanced recovery&quot; on this scale will
             remain with standard PACT, and are not eligible for SMI-PACT.
