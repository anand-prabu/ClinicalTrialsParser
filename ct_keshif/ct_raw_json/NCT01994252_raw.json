            "textblock": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) and heart failure (HF) are two common heart conditions that are\n      encountered with an increase in death and suffering.  When both these two conditions occur\n      in a patient, the patient's prognosis is poor with a reduced quality of life. These patients\n      are frequently admitted to the hospital and have increased risk of death.  In these HF\n      patients who are in AF all of the time, who would otherwise be a suitable candidate for an\n      implantable defibrillator to prevent sudden cardiac death, whether adding pacing of both\n      ventricles will reduce death and suffering.  Other studies have shown that adding pacing to\n      both ventricles is of benefit in HF patients with mild to moderate symptoms and have a\n      regular heart rhythm. The Investigators now want to explore if this therapy will benefit\n      those patients with a permanent irregular heart rhythm (AF). The Investigators will also be\n      assessing the cost effectiveness of this treatment strategy and the life quality for these\n      patients. This study may have a dramatic impact on the way the Investigators manage these\n      patients with atrial fibrillation and heart failure and may improve the outlook and well\n      being of these patients."

            "textblock": "Heart failure (HF) is increasing in prevalence and incidence, and is the most common reason\n      for hospital admissions of patients over the age of 65. Therapy for HF has evolved over the\n      last two decades. Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is a therapy that attempts to\n      resynchronize the sequence of ventricular contraction in heart failure (HF) patients with\n      left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction and ventricular dyssynchrony.  CRT is achieved by\n      stimulating both RV and LV together, synchronized to right atrial excitation to achieve\n      atrio-ventricular synchrony. Clinical trials have demonstrated that CRT improved survival\n      and reduced HF hospitalization in mild to advanced HF patients. In addition, CRT reversed\n      the remodeling process such that it was associated with a reduction of LV size, and an\n      increase of LV ejection fraction (EF). This knowledge translated to a change in practice\n      guidelines and the adoption of CRT into clinical practice benefitting many HF patients CRT\n      is now an important state-of-the-art therapy for HF patients with LV systolic dysfunction,\n      low LVEF, and prolonged QRS duration in sinus rhythm, since the vast majority of the CRT\n      clinical research was performed in patients in sinus rhythm. However, in the ~25% of HF\n      patients with permanent atrial fibrillation (AF), the effectiveness of CRT is not clear. It\n      is therefore timely to address the question of whether the addition of CRT to optimal HF\n      treatment, rate control and an ICD is beneficial to reduce all-cause mortality or HF\n      hospitalization in HF patients in permanent AF with LV systolic dysfunction and prolonged\n      QRS duration\n\n      Objectives: to determine whether cardiac resynchronization therapy will reduce all-cause\n      mortality or hospitalization for heart failure in patients with permanent atrial\n      fibrillation, mild to moderate heart failure, left ventricular systolic dysfunction, and\n      prolonged QRS duration, when compared to implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD)\n      therapy alone\n\n      Methods: This is a multi-centre randomized controlled trial of two treatment groups. The\n      patients, primary physicians and the heart failure caregivers will be blinded to the\n      treatment allocation. The device follow-up caregivers will not be blinded. Patients with\n      NYHA Class II and III HF symptoms, LVEF HF <35%, permanent AF, on optimal medical therapy\n      and QRS durations \u2265 130 ms when the QRS morphology is LBBB, or QRS durations \u2265 150 ms when\n      the QRS morphology is non-LBBB will be included in the trial. Patients should be suitable\n      candidates for either of the 2 treatment strategies. There will be 950 patients randomized\n      in 1:1 ratio to two groups: 1) ICD-CRT, 2) ICD only. All patients will undergo baseline\n      clinical evaluation, quality of life assessment, medication assessment, blood chemistry\n      including liver, renal, thyroid, and NT-proBNP. The patients will be followed at 1 month, 3\n      months, 6 months and then every 6 months. A history and physical examination will be\n      performed at baseline and at follow-up visits. Blood work, quality of life assessment, and\n      6-minute walk distance will also be performed at baseline and at follow-up visits. The\n      Investigators anticipate that this study will have a major impact on how HF patients in\n      permanent AF with LV systolic dysfunction and prolonged QRS duration will be treated in the\n      future."
