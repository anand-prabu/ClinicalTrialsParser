            "textblock": "This study has two goals.  One of these goals is to see if a new genetic test can determine\n      if participants are at risk of developing Mild Cognitive Impairment due to Alzheimer's\n      Disease (MCI-AD) within the next five years. The other goal is to evaluate the study drug\n      called pioglitazone. Pioglitazone is being tested to delay the onset of MCI-AD. This study\n      will look at the effectiveness of pioglitazone in delaying the onset of  MCI-AD in\n      cognitively-normal people who are at high-risk of developing MCI-AD, as idenfitied by the\n      biomarker in the non-Hispanic/Latino Caucasian participants. In addition, approximately 300\n      cognitively normal elderly participants will participate in an Amyloid-Related Imaging\n      Abnormalities (ARIA) substudy at selected sites. In the ARIA substudy, high-risk\n      participants will be randomized (5:4) to receive either pioglitazone or placebo.\n\n      This multi-centre trial will be conducted worldwide. The study will enroll approximately\n      5800 subjects. Participants will be assigned to high or low risk groups for developing\n      MCI-AD within the next five years, based on the results of the biomarker risk algorithm.\n      Participants in the high risk group will be randomly assigned   to one of the two treatment\n      groups\u2014which will remain unknown to the participant and study doctor during the study\n      (unless there is an urgent medical need):\n\n        -  Pioglitazone tablet\n\n        -  Placebo (dummy inactive pill) - this is a tablet that looks like the study drug but has\n           no active ingredient.\n\n      Participants in the low risk group will be assigned to placebo. The assignment of each\n      participant to the high or low risk group, as well as the participant's treatment\n      assignment,  will remain undisclosed to the participants and study doctor during the study\n      (unless there is an urgent medical need).\n\n      All participants will be asked to take one tablet at the same time each day throughout the\n      study.\n\n      The overall time to participate in this study is approximately 5 years. Participants will\n      make up to 14 visits to the clinic, and will be contacted by telephone 3 months after each\n      treatment visit for a follow-up assessment, and 2 weeks after the final visit."
