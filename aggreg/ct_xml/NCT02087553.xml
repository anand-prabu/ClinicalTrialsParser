    <textblock>
      Studies suggest that red blood cell transfusion per se increases the risk of morbidity and
      mortality in hospitalized patients. Red blood cells can be refrigerator stored for up to 42
      days by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations. Furthermore, it is known that red
      blood cells stored for longer durations are damaged upon storage resulting in poor red cell
      survival upon transfusion. The investigators' hypothesis is that the storage-damaged red
      cells are responsible for some of the adverse effects of transfusion. In this observational
      study, the investigators will measure various laboratory parameters both before and after
      transfusion in a pediatric intensive care unit to determine at what duration of storage is
      there laboratory evidence of refrigerator storage-damage.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Transfusions of red blood cells (RBCs) stored for longer durations are associated with
      adverse effects in hospitalized patients. During storage, RBCs undergo cumulative changes
      that reduce their survival in vivo, and have been associated with impairment in oxygen
      transport and adverse outcomes. Transfusion of older RBCs results in increased
      non-transferrin-bound iron (NTBI) levels in healthy adults, and elevated NTBI levels have
      been associated with increased morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients. Transfusion
      of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) has also been associated with up-regulation of inﬂammatory
      cytokines. Pediatric patients are exposed to PRBC transfusions; however, this patient
      population has not been previously studied for these outcomes. According to current practice
      guidelines, PRBCs are stored in the Blood Bank up to 42 days prior to transfusion. In this
      study, consenting pediatric ICU patients will have a blood sample collected prior to every
      PRBC transfusion and again 2-6 hours post-transfusion to determine iron parameters,
      inﬂammatory marker concentrations, and growth of microbial pathogens in vitro. We
      hypothesize that increasing storage time of PRBCs transfused will be associated with
      increasing NTBI, pro-inﬂammatory cytokine concentrations, and enhanced microbial growth in
      vitro in pediatric patients.

    <description>Children who might receive packed red blood cell (PRBC) transfusion will be enrolled after obtaining consent from their parents/legal guardians and assent from the patient, if possible. PRBCs will be transfused according to the standard of care. All transfusion decisions will be at the discretion of the critical care team. Patient families will be approached prior to or when consent for transfusion is obtained. A member of the clinical team that is not a study member will approach the family and ascertain whether the family is amenable to learning about study participation from a study member. Study subjects that are enrolled but don't actually receive a transfusion, therefore not qualifying for the study, are still considered enrolled in the study but counted as screen failures.</description>
