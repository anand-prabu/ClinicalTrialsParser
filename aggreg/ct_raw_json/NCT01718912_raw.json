These patients have considerable periodontal\n      disease.  There is a concern that these pathogens may have a detrimental effect on wound\n      healing in other areas of the body.\n\n      Hypothesis: Patients attending the dental department at TRI that are treated with the\n      antibiotic-antifungal rinse containing metronidazole and nystatin will show substantial\n      decrease in periodontal disease as measured by bleeding points and pocket depth when\n      compared to the group that continues to use their regular oral hygiene methods (control\n      group)."
