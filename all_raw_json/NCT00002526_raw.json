Filgrastim (G-CSF) is administered subcutaneously daily beginning 24 hours after\n      completion of ifosfamide infusion and continuing through day 16 (or until day 20 if blood\n      counts have not recovered by day 16). Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease\n      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed at treatment failure and then\n      annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 16-46 patients will be accrued for this study."
