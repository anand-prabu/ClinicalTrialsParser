      This is an analysis of de-identified data collected from 240 Saudi Arabian women, 120 with
      breast cancer and 120 control women, to evalyate if vitamin D status is associated with
      breast cancer risk.

      Background: The role of vitamin D in breast cancer prevention is equivocal. Saudi Arabian
      women are thought to be at greater risk for vitamin D deficiency due to darker skin type and
      greater likelihood for reduced UVB radiation exposure. However, there is a lack of data
      regarding the vitamin D status of Saudi Arabian women and how this may relate to breast
      cancer risk.

      Objective: The purpose of this research was to evaluate the association between circulating
      concentrations of 25(OH)D and breast cancer risk in Saudi Arabian women.

      Design: A case-control study was conducted among 120 breast cancer cases and 120 controls.
      The study population was drawn from patients admitted to King Fahd Hospital in Jeddah, Saudi
      Arabia from June to August 2009. Participants completed questionnaires on diet and medical
      history and serum samples were collected from all women to measure circulating 25(OH)D
      concentrations.
