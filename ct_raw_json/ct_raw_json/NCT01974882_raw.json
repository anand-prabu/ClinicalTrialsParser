Although\n      cryotherapy, the application of ice to a surgical wound site, has been shown to be effective\n      in reducing postoperative pain in orthopedic, gynecologic, and hernia operations, it has not\n      been assessed in patients who undergo major open abdominal operations.  We hypothesized that\n      patients who receive cryotherapy would report lower pain scores as a primary outcome\n      measure.  This would result in less narcotic analgesia usage, and shorter hospital stays as\n      secondary outcome measures."

End-points for the study will be patient use of narcotics and pain level,\n      regularly measured by nursing staff.\n\n      Patient Selection:\n\n      This study will accept all consecutive consenting patients who visit the Grady Hospital and\n      Emory University urology clinics who require abdominal surgery.The study will require 55\n      patients, based on prior power calculations.\n\n      Registration/Randomization:\n\n      Because this study will enroll all consenting patients, no registration is required.\n      Patients will be enrolled by their urologist during a standard visit. With consent, the\n      urologist will direct the patient to the researcher. Patients will be randomized to either\n      cryotherapy or no adjunctive therapy following abdominal surgery.\n\n      Therapy:\n\n      Patients in the cryotherapy study group will have ice packs placed on their abdominal wound\n      for 24 hours following surgery.After 24 hours, patients had the option of using ice packs\n      for as long as they wished.\n\n      Patient Assessment:\n\n      Patients will be assessed by the nursing staff as they would otherwise be assessed\n      postsurgically.\n\n      Data Collection:\n\n      During recovery time in the hospital, nurses will monitor both groups of patients as they do\n      all patients. As with all patients, nurses will ask about pain levels and check the amount\n      of narcotics you require for pain control. This study will not require any additional effort\n      on patients' part. Once they are discharged, patient participation in the study will be\n      complete."
