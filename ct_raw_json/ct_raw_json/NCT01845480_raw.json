            "textblock": "Obesity is associated with increased chronic disease risk, and therefore poses a major\n      public health problem (Lobstein et al., 2004). In 2011, the Centers for Disease Control and\n      Prevention estimated that obesity affects about 12.5 million children and teens, or 17% of\n      the US population. This is a marked increase from the ~5% rate of obesity found in this\n      population in the late 1960s. Barlow (2007) points out that the complexity of obesity\n      prevention lies less in the identification of target health behaviors, and much more in a\n      process of influencing families to change behaviors when habits, culture, and environment\n      promote less physical activity and more energy intake.\n\n      Obesity prevention interventions may not be effective or sustainable without impacting home\n      environments (Rosenkranz & Dzewaltowski, 2008). Conwell et al. (2010) suggest that\n      home-based programs may offer significant advantages over center-based programs by offering\n      better accessibility and convenience. Wellness coaching has shown promise for improving\n      health behaviors related to chronic disease (Lawn & Schoo, 2010), but no published study has\n      used a wellness coaching childhood obesity prevention model in the home environment.\n\n      The primary aim of this trial is to determine whether the home-based wellness coaching\n      delivery model is feasible as an obesity prevention intervention strategy in the community\n      setting. The secondary objective is to determine the comparative effectiveness of the two\n      wellness coaching interventions.\n\n      Female children (aged 8-13 years) will be recruited through posted flyers, newspaper ads,\n      and word of mouth in the Manhattan, KS area. After laboratory assessment, recruited\n      participants will be randomly assigned to either healthful eating and physical activity\n      skills coaching or general health education coaching intervention conditions. For both\n      conditions, research assistants will serve as wellness coaches and deliver 12 intervention\n      sessions in the home of each participating child.  Assessments will be completed at\n      baseline, intervention end (3 months), and follow-up (6 months), comprising biomedical and\n      psychosocial measures.\n\n      We hypothesize that the research project will be successful in recruiting and retaining\n      participating families, training research assistants to deliver the intervention components,\n      and that both of the coaching conditions will be well received and appreciated by\n      participating families.

We expect that\n      both intervention conditions will show improvements to pediatric quality of life measures,\n      but that the healthful eating and physical activity skills coaching intervention will be\n      more effective than general health education coaching condition in increasing physical\n      activity, physical activity enjoyment and self efficacy, fruit and vegetable consumption,\n      and fruit and vegetable enjoyment and self-efficacy."
