            "textblock": "The risk of HBV reactivation is associated with the intensity of immunosuppression.\n      Biological therapies block the action of biological products involved in immune-inflammatory\n      pathogenesis of many diseases. However, these biologic agents induce a profound\n      immunosuppression, and their use has been reported to be associated with HBV reactivation.\n      Currently, the actual incidence of HBV reactivation in rheumatic patients who underwent\n      biologic treatments (TNF-a blockades) is unclear, especially in rheumatoid arthritis (RA)\n      patients with past hepatitis B infection. In this study, we plan to enroll RA patients who\n      are inactive HBV carriers (HBsAg-positive/undetectable HBV viral loads; subgroup 1), or have\n      past HBV infection (HBsAg-negative/anti-HBc-positive/undetectable HBV viral loads; subgroup\n      2); and first line biologic treatment (Humira or Enbrel) is indicated due to active\n      rheumatoid arthritis according to Disease Activity Score of 28 joints (DAS28). Patients will\n      be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either prophylactic or therapeutic (pre-emptive)\n      entecavir treatment for each subgroup. In the prophylactic group, participants will initiate\n      entecavir 0.5 mg/day orally one week before biologic treatment. Entecavir treatment will be\n      continued normally for 12 months. In the therapeutic (pre-emptive) group, patients will\n      start entecavir therapy, 0.5 mg/day orally, when reactivation of HBV (pre-emptive\n      treatment). HBV reactivation is defined as detectable HBV viral loads for 2 consecutive\n      visits of one month apart. The main goal of the study is to delineate the incidence of HBV\n      reactivation during and after biologic treatment in RA patients who are inactive HBV\n      carriers or have past HBV infection, and tries to define the optimal HBV monitoring and\n      antiviral prophylactic strategy in RA patients."
