    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Europe. The aim of the trial is to compare the pharmacokinetic
      properties (the exposure of the trial drug in the body) of faster-acting insulin aspart
      (FIAsp) after different injection regions and routes of administration in healthy subjects.
