YKL-40, a novel surrogate marker of acute and\n      chronic inflammatory states has been implicated to have a putative role in both pathways.\n      Given the shared pathway of insulin resistance and atherosclerosis, it is conceivable that\n      anti-diabetes medications are able to modify coronary artery disease risk via direct and\n      indirect amelioration of YKL-40 concentrations. The present clinical trial was therefore\n      launched to examine the comparative effects of metformin and pioglitazone, two commonly\n      prescribed anti-diabetes medications on YKL-40 concentrations in medication-na\u00efve,\n      newly-diagnosed type 2 diabetes patients."
