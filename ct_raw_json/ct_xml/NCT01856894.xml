  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study the investigators aimed to investigate whether there is a relation between
      body weight and serum anti mullerian hormone levels in adults with polycystic ovary
      syndrome. For this purpose the investigators designed a prospective study including three
      groups. The group   I is defined as adults with polycystic ovary syndrome and body mass
      index is greater than 25. The group II is defined as adults with polycystic ovary syndrome
      and body mass index is less than 25. The group III is defined as adults with non-polycystic
      ovary syndrome and body mass index is less than 25. The all three groups are compared
      considering their serum AMH levels,lipid profiles, sex steroids and glycemic analyses.

      In this study the investigators aimed to investigate whether there is a relation between
      body weight and serum anti mullerian hormone levels in adults with polycystic ovary
      syndrome. For this purpose the investigators  designed a prospective study including three
      groups. The diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome was made in the presence of ;oligo-
      and/or anovulation,clinical and/or biochemical signs of hyperandrogenism and polycystic
      ovaries. Clinical hyperandrogenism was defined by the presence of hirsutism , acne, or the
      presence of androgenic alopecia , biochemical hyperandrogenemia was defined as a serum level
      of total testosterone higher than 2.60 nmol/L, body mass index (BMI) was calculated as
      weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters. The patients were classified
      as obese with BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2 , adolescent patients were diagnosed 2 years after menarche in
      order to avoid the misdiagnosis of transitory functional hyperandrogenism and menstrual
      disorders during puberty. The all three groups are compared considering their serum AMH
      levels,lipid profiles, sex steroids and glycemic analyses.
