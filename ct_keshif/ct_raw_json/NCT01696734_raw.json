You may be asked to take the tablets\n      before bed.\n\n      During the study, the doctor may increase the amount of study drug you are taking.\n\n      You will need to record when you take the study drug in a study drug diary.  This diary will\n      be reviewed at clinic visits.\n\n      Study Procedures:\n\n      About 2 and 4 weeks after your first dose, the doctor will call you to ask you about\n      symptoms you may be having.\n\n      About 8 weeks after your first dose, at Month 6, and then every 6 months after that:\n\n        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs.\n\n        -  Your medical history will be recorded.\n\n        -  You will have an EKG.\n\n        -  You will be asked about any drugs you may be taking and side effects you may be having.\n\n        -  You will  complete the 2 questionnaires about your GI symptoms.\n\n        -  Blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.\n\n      Length of Study:\n\n      You may continue to take the study drug for as long as you are benefitting.  You will no\n      longer be able to take the study drug if intolerable side effects occur or if you are unable\n      to follow study directions.\n\n      Follow-Up:\n\n      About 30 days after your last dose of study drug:\n\n        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs.\n\n        -  Your medical history will be recorded.\n\n        -  You will have an EKG.\n\n        -  You will be asked about any drugs you may be taking and side effects you may be having.\n\n        -  Blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.\n\n      If you are taken off study due to results of an EKG, you will be referred to the cardiology\n      department for tests.\n\n      This is an investigational study.  Domperidone is not FDA approved or commercially\n      available.  It is currently being used for research purposes only.\n\n      Up to 200 patients will be enrolled in this study.  All will take part at MD Anderson."
