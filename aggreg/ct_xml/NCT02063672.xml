        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or non-pregnant female ≥18 years of age

          2. Rutherford Clinical Category 2-4

          3. Significant (≥ 50%) restenosis of a previous bare (not covered and not drug-eluting)
             nitinol stent(s) in the femoropopliteal artery

          4. Lesion measures between 4 and 18 cm

          5. Target vessel diameter between ≥4 and ≤6 mm and able to be treated with available
             device size matrix

          6. A patent inflow artery free from significant lesion (≥50% stenosis) as confirmed by
             angiography

          7. Successful crossing and predilatation of the target lesion with a guidewire

          8. At least one patent native outflow artery to the ankle, free from significant (≥50%)
             stenosis as confirmed by angiography that has not previously been (nor planned to be)
             revascularized

          9. No other prior vascular or surgical interventions within 2 weeks before and/or
             planned 30 days after the protocol treatment

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Life expectancy of &lt;1 year

          2. Patient is currently participating in an investigational drug or other device study
             or previously enrolled in this study NOTE: Enrollment in another drug or device
             clinical trial during the follow up period is not allowed

          3. History of stroke within 3 months

          4. History of MI, thrombolysis or angina within 2 weeks of enrollment

          5. Prior vascular surgery of the index limb, with the exception of remote common femoral
             patch angioplasty separated by at least 2 cm from the target lesion

          6. Target lesion involves a previously placed covered stent or drug-eluting stent

          7. Grade 4 or 5 stent fracture (mal-aligned components or trans-axial spiral
             configuration) in the restenotic stent

          8. Inability to take required study medications or allergy to contrast that cannot be
             adequately managed with pre- and post-procedure medication

          9. Known inadequate distal outflow (&gt;50 % stenosis of distal popliteal and/or all three
             tibial vessels), or planned future treatment of vascular disease distal to the target
             lesion

         10. Intended use of adjunctive treatment modalities (i.e. laser, atherectomy, cryoplasty,
             scoring/cutting balloon, stents, etc.)
