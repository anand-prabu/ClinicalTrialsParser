  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label, multi-center, three-period, one sequence study will investigate the effect
      of ketoconazole on the pharmacokinetics of vemurafenib in patients with unresectable
      BRAFV600-mutation positive metastatic melanoma or other malignant tumor type that harbors a
      V600-activating mutation of BRAF without acceptable standard treatment options. Patients
      will receive a single dose of vemurafenib in Periods A and C and multiple doses of
      ketoconazole in Periods B and C. Eligible patients will have the option to continue
      treatment with vemurafenib as part of an extension study (NCT01739764). The anticipated time
      on study treatment is approximately 19 days.
