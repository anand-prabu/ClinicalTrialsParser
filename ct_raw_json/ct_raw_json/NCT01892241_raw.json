Their serum alanine aminotransferase level was greater than 2 but less than\n        or equal to 30 times the upper limit of the normal range, their peak value of total\n        bililubin ranged from 2mg/ml to 20mg/ml and the prothrombin time activity was greater than\n        60%.\n\n        ALL of these patients were hospitalized and pretreated with anti-inflammation and liver\n        protection agents such as Stronger Neo-Minophagen C, Polyunsaturated phosphatidylcholine\n        (Essentiale), Ursodeoxycholic Acid and L-Glutathione reduced, without any nuclutide of\n        nucleoside. Their ALT\u3001TBIL and PTA were monitor weekly and HBVDNA level were measured\n        every two weeks. Patients were eligible if their HBVDNA declined spontaneously by 2\n        log(10) IU/mL while their ALT falled below 10 ULN and TBIL falled below 2mg/ml within 8\n        weeks of pretreatment.\n\n        Patients with advanced fibrosis, cirrhosis and hepatoma were excluded. Other cause of\n        chronic liver disease should be systematically checked to exclude co-infection with HDV,\n        HCV and HIV, comorbidities with alcoholism, autoimmune and metabolic liver disease.\n        Serious medical or psychiatric illnesses that had usage of corticosteroid or\n        immunosup-pressive agents at the time of study were excluded. All patients in this study\n        lived in Guangdong, a province of 100,000,000 populations, with same demographics. Owing\n        to patients fear or refusal of liver biopsy, no patients had the liver biopsy and the rest\n        relied on other clinical methods to obtain equivalent information of patient conditions.\n        In our cases, ultrasonorgraphy helped to filter out patients with advanced fibrosis.The\n        liver sonar examination was performed by two experi-enced hepatologists at least three\n        times on each patient."
