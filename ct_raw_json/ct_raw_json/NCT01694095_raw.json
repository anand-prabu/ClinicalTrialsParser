Little is known about the risk factors that drive the\n      progression of geographic atrophy, and yet they are crucial to understand the mechanisms of\n      the disease. Therefore, the identification of risk factors associated with a faster spread\n      of atrophy may help contribute to identify the causes of the disease and, ultimately, to\n      develop new therapeutic strategies to manage the disorder.\n\n      The current prospective, observational, natural history study has the following objectives:\n\n        -  Describe the natural history of geographic atrophy in anatomic and visual terms\n\n        -  Identify risk factors associated with a faster enlargement of atrophy\n\n      The main hypothesis is that lipofuscin accumulation at the borders of atrophy as seen with\n      fundus autofluorescence imaging is associated with a faster progression of the disease."
