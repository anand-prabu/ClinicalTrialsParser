      1. Patients with AP will admitted to our institution between  August 2013 and March 2014
           are considered for inclusion in this study. Finally, N patients with AP will be
           enrolled in this study.

        2. AP is graded as mild (0-3 points), moderate (4-6 points) or severe (7-10 points),
           according to the MRSI .

        3. The severity of acute pancreatitis was graded by both MRSI and APACHEⅡ scoring system.

        4. The correlations between the MRSI and the APACHEⅡ scoring system were analyzed.

        5. We have use the sequence of GRE T2*WI study the patients with AP,and compared with
           normal volunteers.
