  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the effect of intra-articular corticosteroid injection (IACI) of depot
      preparation of betamethasone on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, in patients
      with osteoarthritis of the knee
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Consecutive patients attending the rheumatology or orthopedic clinic with osteoarthritic
      knee pain, not responding satisfactorily to medical or physical therapy were allocated to
      group-1 after consent and given IACI of 6 mg of betamethasone acetate/betamethasone sodium
      phosphate. Following completion of this part, consecutive age- and sex-matched patients were
      allocated to group-2 and given intra-articular injection of 60 mg of sodium hyaluronate.
      Just prior to the knee injection and 1, 2, 3, 4 and 8 weeks later, patients had 1 Âµg
      adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH) stimulation test. Secondary adrenal insufficiency (SAI)
      was defined as levels of less than 18 ng/ml or a rise of &lt; than 7 ng/ml of serum cortisol,
      30 minutes following the ACTH stimulation test.
