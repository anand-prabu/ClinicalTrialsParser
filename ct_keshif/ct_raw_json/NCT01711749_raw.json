Sixty-four healthy volunteers, of both genders, with age ranging from 18 and 50\n      years old, will receive test or reference formulation under fasting conditions, according to\n      the randomization list. In each period, after administration of medication, blood samples\n      are collected at the following times: 0:00 (prior to administration), 0:30, 1:00, 1:30,\n      2:00, 2:20, 2:40: 3:00, 3:20, 3:40, 4:00, 4:20, 4:40, 5:00, 5:30, 6:00, 7:00, 8:00, 10:00,\n      12:00, 24:00, 36:00, 48:00 and 72:00 hours. The comparative bioavailability of formulations\n      is evaluated based on relevant pharmacokinetic parameters for statistical comparison. Such\n      parameters are obtained directly from the determination of the drug active principle\n      plasmatic concentration, based on the application of a non-compartmental pattern for the\n      evaluation of these concentrations after the drug oral administration."
