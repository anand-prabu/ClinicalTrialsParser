    <textblock>
      This study is designed to characterize subjects in terms of their sputum phenotype. The
      purpose of this study is to learn more about the impact of having abnormally elastic sputum
      on asthma severity by comparing subjects with severe as well as mild/moderate asthma to
      healthy controls. The characterization will include medical history, pulmonary function
      testing, imaging of the lungs and biospecimen collection.

        A diverse sample of subjects with asthma is needed to gain better understanding of asthma
        and its endotypes. CAESAR will therefore enroll subjects between 18 and 65 years with a
        physician diagnosis of asthma as well as a group of healthy subjects. The target
        recruitment goal for UCSF is 50 adults with asthma and 25 healthy controls (age 18 and
        older). Within the asthma group, an attempt will be made to enroll 60% of subjects with
        severe with the rest of the subjects mild to moderate asthma.Within the cohort, an attempt
        will be made to enroll at least 50% females and 10% minorities.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  FEV1 bronchodilator reversibility ≥12% or airway hyperresponsiveness reflected by a
             methacholine PC20 ≤16 mg/mL

          -  An exception will be made for enrollees whose FEV1 is &lt; 50% predicted (&lt;70% in
             children aged 6 to 17 years), precluding methacholine challenge testing. If
             bronchodilator reversibility is &lt;12% in these participants, a diagnosis of asthma
             acceptable to the investigator is sufficient for inclusion in CAESAR.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnancy,

          -  Current smoking,

          -  Smoking history &gt; 10 pack years if ≥30 years of age, or smoking history &gt; 5 pack
             years if &lt;30 years of age,

          -  Other chronic pulmonary disorders associated with asthma-like symptoms, including
             (but not limited to) cystic fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic
             bronchitis, vocal cord dysfunction (that is the sole cause of respiratory symptoms
             and at the PI's discretion), severe scoliosis or chest wall deformities that affect
             lung function, or congenital disorders of the lungs or airways,

          -  History of premature birth before 35 weeks gestation,

          -  Planning to relocate from the clinical center area before study completion,

          -  Any other criteria that place the subject at unnecessary risk according to the
             judgment of the Principal Investigator and/or attending physician(s) of record, or

          -  Currently participating in an investigational drug trial.

        Healthy Controls:

        Inclusion criteria: Healthy subjects between the age of 18y and 65y. At least 3 of the 7
        subjects per center should be aged 35y or older.

        Exclusion criteria

          -  History of chronic diseases that affect the lungs.

          -  A history suggestive of allergic rhinitis, eczema or chronic sinusitis.

          -  An improvement in FEV1 of more than 12% following 4 puffs of albuterol.

          -  Smoking history &gt; 10 pack years if ≥30 years of age, or smoking history &gt; 5 pack
             years if &lt;30 years of age, or any smoking within the past year.

          -  Respiratory tract infection within the past 4 weeks.

          -  Pregnancy.

          -  History of premature birth (&lt;35 weeks).
