To assess candidate genetic variants for their correlation with changes in fasting\n      glucose and/or triglycerides.\n\n      II. To assess tumor response by the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST,\n      version 1.1) and explore whether there is any correlation between response and changes in\n      fasting glucose and/or triglycerides.\n\n      III. To assess toxicity by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE,\n      version 4.0) and explore whether there is any correlation between toxicities and changes in\n      fasting glucose and/or triglycerides.\n\n      IV. To quantify and determine the functional status of circulating regulatory T cells\n      (Tregs) before and during treatment.\n\n      OUTLINE:\n\n      Patients receive sirolimus orally (PO) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the\n      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity."
