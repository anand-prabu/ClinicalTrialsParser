Individuals participating\n      in this research study will be tested using a battery of clinical strength and balance\n      assessments twice before a 4 week training period and once after the training period.  The 4\n      week training period will consist of 12 sessions walking on a treadmill.  The experimental\n      group will see real time visual feedback regarding their body movements, and the control\n      group will not receive this visual feedback.  Following the 4 week training each participant\n      will again be tested using the battery of clinical strength and balance assessments."
