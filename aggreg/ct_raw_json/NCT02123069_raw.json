If the patients have\n      not had a recent ultrasound or MRI of the uterus, a physician can provide one.\n\n      Individuals cannot participate if they have high blood pressure, diabetes, or disease in the\n      kidneys, lungs, or blood vessels. Also, individuals who smoke, have high cholesterol, or are\n      obese (BMI is higher than 30) cannot participate.  Certain medications, including high blood\n      pressure medications, beta-blockers and anti-depressants, will also limit potential patient\n      participation.  The investigators would be happy to review medications for potential\n      participants.\n\n      Screen Day:\n\n      One of the members of the research team will review the study and the informed consent\n      document with the patient.  The patient will have their height, weight, blood pressure,\n      pulse and respirations measured.  The patient will also complete three questionnaires. If\n      the patient has not had an ultrasound of the uterus in the last 12 months, a physician will\n      complete one for her.\n\n      Study Day:\n\n      The patient will need to fast overnight (no eating or drinking). The investigators will draw\n      a blood sample and then do a series of tests on the participant's blood vessels. For some of\n      the tests, medication will be given through an IV. The investigators will also test nerve\n      activity in the nerve on the outer aspect of the leg."
