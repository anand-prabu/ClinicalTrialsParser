Treatment continues for\n      at least 3 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients\n      achieving complete response (CR) continue treatment for an additional 8 months after\n      reaching CR.\n\n      Patients are followed at least every 2 months for 1 year, every 3 months for the second\n      year, every 3-4 months for the third and fourth years, every 4-6 months for the fifth year,\n      and then annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study."
