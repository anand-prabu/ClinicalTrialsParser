ABI-007 alone and in combination is being evaluated in a number of cancers,\n      including metastatic melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, and other\n      solid tumors. Conditions which are responsive to paclitaxel such as non-hematological solid\n      tumor malignancies are good clinical candidates for treatment with ABI-007."
