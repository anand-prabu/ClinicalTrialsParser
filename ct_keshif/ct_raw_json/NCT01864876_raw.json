The second focus will be to detail the global immune response\n      by measuring systemic cytokines, chemokines, and global gene regulation. The third focus\n      will be to investigate the effects of GLA on the peripheral blood immune cells including\n      monocytes and dendritic cells. The results of this trial will generate supportive human data\n      to use GLA as an adjuvant in a dendritic cell-targeted vaccine strategy."

Receipt of a live attenuated vaccine within 30 days or other vaccine within 14 days\n             prior to study drug;\n\n         10. Prior receipt of GLA in another research study;\n\n         11. Participation in another clinical study of an investigational product currently or\n             within past 16 weeks, or expected participation during this study;\n\n         12. In the opinion of the investigator, unlikely to comply with protocol due to medical,\n             social or psychiatric reasons;\n\n         13. Allergy to eggs\n\n         14. A glomerular filtration rate that is less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 as calculated by\n             study team based on laboratory creatinine values."
