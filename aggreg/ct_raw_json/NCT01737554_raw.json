These events can lead to\n      interruption of therapy and may require device removal and replacement. Attempts to clear\n      occlusion can cause device fracture.\n\n      There is a clear link between catheter occlusion and other serious complications including\n      bloodstream infection and intravascular thrombosis.\n\n      There is evidence that catheter occlusion or dysfunction may be preceded by subclinical\n      catheter narrowing, which could be detected by accurate measurement of catheter resistance.\n\n      This study aims to describe the feasibility and results of catheter resistance monitoring\n      (CRM) over time with the aim of prospectively identifying patients at high risk of catheter\n      occlusion.\n\n      If CRM is feasible and proves to be sensitive and specific, it could provide an opportunity\n      for preemptive therapy to prevent occlusion, which might also prevent bloodstream infection\n      or thrombosis."
