Age \u226518 years at the time of informed consent.\n\n          3. Morphologically documented primary Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) or AML secondary to\n             Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS), as defined by World Health Organization (WHO)\n             criteria, as determined by pathology review at the study site.\n\n          4. Refractory, or relapsed within six months AML after first-line therapy, with or\n             without Haematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant (HSCT).
