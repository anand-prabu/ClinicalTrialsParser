            "textblock": "Background: Illness and hospitalisation, even of short duration, pose separate risks for\n      permanently reduced functional performance in elderly medical patients. Functional\n      assessment in the acute pathway will ensure early detection of declining performance and\n      form the basis for mobilisation during hospitalisation and subsequent rehabilitation. For\n      optimal results rehabilitation should begin immediately after discharge.\n\n      The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of a systematic functional assessment in\n      the emergency departments (ED) of elderly medical patients with reduced functional\n      performance when combined with immediate post-discharge rehabilitation.\n\n      Method/design: The study is a two-way factorial randomised clinical trial. Participants will\n      be recruited among patients admitted to the ED who are above 65 years of age with reduced\n      functional performance. Patients will be randomly assigned to one of four groups: 1)\n      functional assessment and immediate rehabilitation; 2) functional assessment and usual\n      rehabilitation; 3) usual assessment and immediate rehabilitation; 4) usual assessment and\n      usual rehabilitation.\n\n      Primary outcome: 30-second chair-stand test administered at admission and two weeks after\n      discharge.\n\n      We hypothesise that such assessment in the ED or/and immediate rehabilitation will result in\n      sustained or improved performance in comparison to regimen in which neither of these\n      interventions are offered."
