The\n      present study is a controlled clinical trial, a multicenter-study involving three health\n      regions, as well as the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). Its primary\n      research goal will be to evaluate the effects of computer-based cognitive training in\n      children with CP. In addition, this study will be the first to conduct a comprehensive\n      neuropsychological examination to improve our understanding of cognitive impairments as well\n      as cognitive resources in CP children in Norway to aid in intervention planning."
