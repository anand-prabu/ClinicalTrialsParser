Thirty to 40% of them experienced mucositis World Health Organization\n      (WHO) grade 3 from cisplatin/flurouracil (FU) in neoadjuvant chemotherapy setting. This was\n      higher than the 8-11% reported in the Western populations and was related to oral submucous\n      fibrosis from betel quid chewing.Severer toxicities, esp. mucositis, could be anticipated in\n      patients of betel quid chewing treated by concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) with\n      cisplatin/FU.PG2 Injection is proved to be safe for clinical use and is effective in\n      stimulating the recovery of hematopoiesis and immunity from chemotherapy-induced\n      myelosuppression. It also improved the Quality of Life, especially in fatigue, among\n      advanced cancer patients. This study will be investigated the effect of PG2 Injection in\n      relieving the adverse events of concurrent chemoradiotherapy, such as fatigue,\n      myelosuppression, mucositis, body weight loss, and even the compliance of radiotherapy and\n      chemotherapy in treatment of patients with advanced pharyngeal or laryngeal SCCHN."
