Patients will be treated with Ristova and glucocorticoids. Ristova\n      will be administered by intravenous (IV) infusion at a dose of 375 mg/m2 body surface area\n      once weekly during Weeks 1 to 4. Patients will also receive one or three pulses of\n      methylprednisolone (1000 mg each), followed by a tapering dose of oral prednisolone (start\n      dose of 1 mg per kilogram per day). The dose of oral prednisone will be reduced as per\n      evaluation by the investigator till the patient is completely off the drug. The patients\n      will be followed up for duration of 6 months from the date of starting Ristova therapy with\n      three follow-up visits at Days 52, 112 and 172. All adverse events occurring during this\n      period will be captured."
