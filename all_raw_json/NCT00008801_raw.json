More specifically, the objectives of these\n      studies is to conduct an open-labeled, one-year follow-up Phase I/II study in patients with\n      surgical and type 1 diabetes to determine the safety, tolerability, immune activity, and\n      pharmacokinetics of hOKT3gamma1 (Ala-ala) administration for the prevention of autoimmune\n      destruction and rejection of allogeneic islet transplants."
