  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study was designed to assess the effect of jaundice on the ability of G17DT to generate
      antibodies before and after treatment of biliary obstruction due to advances pancreatic
      cancer.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Jaundiced patients with advanced pancreatic cancer (either locally, advanced or metastatic)
      were treated with G17DT either immediately (Group A), or following biliary stenting when
      jaundice had resolved (Group B). Patients not jaundiced at time of presentation were to
      enter Group B. Patients received 3 Intramuscular injections of G17DT at weeks 0, 1, and 3. A
      booster injection was offered to patients who had measurable anit-G17Dt antibodies but had
      anti-G17DT antibodies that fell below a pre-specified threshold after week 23. Patients were
      evaluated until study closure ort until patient death.
