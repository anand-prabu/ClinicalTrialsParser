  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare Tegaderm CHG clear dressing to standard clear
      Tegaderm IV dressing with regards to contact skin irritation in pediatric patients between
      the ages of 2 months to 18 years with central venous access. Reducing the risk of central
      line associated blood stream infections will also be assessed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this prospective, randomized, cohort study, we plan on enrolling all patients 2 months to
      18 years of age admitted with a central venous catheter expected to be in place for &gt; 48
      hours. Patients will be randomized to either receive 1) Tegaderm CHG clear dressing or 2)
      standard clear Tegaderm IV dressing. All central line care will remain uniform between the
      two groups as dictated by the central line maintenance bundle currently directing central
      line care in our children's hospital. Study completion will occur at the time of central
      line removal or discharge from the hospital, whichever comes first.

    <description>Skin irritation will be assessed using the Scoring of patch tests according to the International Contact Dermatitis Research Group. Scores of 0 are defined as no irritation, 1/2-1+ as minor irritation whereas scores greater than or equal to 2+ will be classified as severe and will require dressing removal.
The clinical team will photograph each central line insertion site with every dressing change and save the most severe skin irritation photo for analysis. These pictures will be sequentially numbered and a master list will link them to each patient.</description>

    <description>Blood stream infections will be tallied and reported per 1,000 central line days. Infection is attributed to the line if a culture becomes positive when the line is in up to 48 hours after removal.</description>
