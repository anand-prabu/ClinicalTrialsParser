All patients\n      will participate in cognitive remediation therapy (CRT). After initial consent form has been\n      signed, all participants will undergo Matrics Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB) testing,\n      Wechsler IQ (Intelligence Quotient) testing, and UPSA evaluation. Participants will then\n      complete 3 CRT sessions per week, each lasting one hour, for a total of 12 weeks. The CRT\n      will use a commercially available CRT software system such as Cogpack marker software as\n      used by Haut et al, Lumosity or the PositScience software package. Each CRT session involves\n      an in-session assessment of skill acquisition, as collected by commercially available CRT\n      software. At the completion of each hour long CRT session, participants will also complete\n      an n-back assessment. N-back testing will be run using software package E Prime (Psychology\n      Software Tools).\n\n      Patients will be randomized into two arms: active tDCS vs. sham tDCS. The tDCS will be\n      applied at a current of 1-2mA via two saline soaked electrode sponges (3 cm x 4.5 cm) each\n      CRT session. The anode will be placed over left DLPFC (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) at\n      F3, according to the 10-20 international system for EEG electrode placement. The cathode\n      will be placed over the contralateral supraorbital area. This placement is consistent with\n      previous protocols targeting working memory. Both active and sham conditions will have\n      identical electrode placement.\n\n      After electrodes have been placed, the participants will be instructed to log into CRT\n      software using a unique patient identifier. Once logged in to CRT software they will be\n      instructed to begin the session.\n\n      The tDCS will be applied at a current of 1-2mA via two saline soaked electrode sponges (3 cm\n      x 4.5 cm) for the first 15 minutes of each CRT session in the active condition. In the sham\n      condition, tDCS will be ramped up to 1-2 mA via two saline soaked electrode sponges (3 cm x\n      4.5 cm) over the first 30 seconds of each CRT session and then turned off.\n\n      Participants will complete the hour long CRT session. The software program instruct patient\n      when the end of the session has been reached. At the end of each CRT session, the patient\n      will then be instructed to complete an N-back assessment, run by E Prime software.\n\n      At the completion of the 12 weeks of CRT and active vs sham tDCS patients will repeat the\n      UPSA and MCCB. Patients will also be asked to return for MCCB and UPSA testing at 3, 6 and\n      12 month follow up.\n\n      The time commitment of each generally CRT + n-back testing session will be approximately 90\n      minute. Additionally MCCB and UPSA testing will comprise a total of 6.5 hours. IQ testing\n      will comprise approximately 1 hour of testing time. The total time commitment will consist\n      of approximately 61.5 hours."
