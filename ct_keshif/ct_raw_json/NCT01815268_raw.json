            "textblock": "SUMMARY: This study includes estimated 6782 Medicare-certified nursing homes (NHs)\n      co-located within 50 miles of the 122 cities reporting to Center for Disease Control and\n      Prevention (CDC) weekly influenza surveillance. In total, 1000 facilities will be enrolled\n      for random assignment to either 1) the licensed high dose (HD) trivalent influenza vaccine\n      (Fluzone HD [HD vaccine]),or 2) the standard dose (SD) trivalent influenza vaccine (Fluzone\n      [SD vaccine]) for their residents and free SD vaccine vs. usual care (no free vaccine) for\n      staff.\n\n      BACKGROUND: Lower respiratory tract infection (LRI), which includes pneumonia, bronchitis,\n      and tracheobronchitis, is the leading cause of mortality and hospitalization in older\n      adults, and NH residents. Often, the signs and symptoms of pneumonia, in particular, are not\n      apparent in elderly patients, making diagnosis more complicated. In addition, clinician\n      visits to these residents are few and sporadic and radiological facilities are not readily\n      available. LRI may or may not directly lead to hospitalization, but LRIs are associated with\n      considerable other morbidity than can result in hospitalization. Hospitalization rates for\n      NH residents vary considerably between facilities, but the majority of hospitalizations\n      occur during the 12 weeks in which influenza peaks each year.\n\n      Influenza is the most common viral infection of older adults. Influenza and pneumonia\n      account for the majority of infectious morbidity and mortality in late life, and possibly\n      for at least some of temporally associated\u2014and vaccine preventable\u2014vascular mortality such\n      as heart attacks and strokes.  Influenza can cause more than just viral pneumonia because it\n      results in a systemic inflammatory response that is thrombogenic. Some experts believe that\n      influenza vaccine can prevent thrombotic outcomes, such as strokes and heart attacks,\n      mechanistically by reducing the overall inflammatory response through targeted priming of\n      the immune system.\n\n      Influenza vaccination has been associated with reduced hospitalization, strokes, heart\n      attacks and death in non-institutional older adult populations, but the benefit of influenza\n      vaccine for the oldest population has been questioned. Also, influenza vaccination rates\n      vary substantially between NHs.\n\n      OBJECTIVES: The primary objective is to estimate the differences in all-cause\n      hospitalization rates during flu season experienced by long stay nursing home residents in\n      facilities using the HD vaccine vs. usual care vaccination nursing homes. The secondary\n      objective is to estimate the differences in the likelihood of Activities of Daily Living\n      (ADL) functional decline experienced during the influenza season by long stay nursing home\n      residents of facilities using the HD vaccine vs. the level of functional decline experienced\n      by residents of usual care nursing homes."
