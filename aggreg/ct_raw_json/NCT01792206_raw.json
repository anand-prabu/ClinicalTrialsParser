Blood pressure doses may be changed but new therapy with ACE inhibitors will\n             not be allowed.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          1. Severe co morbid conditions - e.g. Cancer, etc.\n\n          2. Congestive heart failure.\n\n          3. Inability to give informed consent or attend study related visits.\n\n          4. Have a history of abnormally high vitamin D or calcium levels in the bloodstream.\n\n          5. Unwilling or unable to complete screening or data collection procedures.\n\n          6.
