We expect to provide\n      evidence for the safety and feasibility of IGF-1 in ameliorating social withdrawal in\n      children with Autistic Disorder. Further, we expect to demonstrate that IGF-1 is associated\n      with improvement on secondary outcomes of social impairment, language delay, and repetitive\n      behavior, as well as on functional outcomes of global severity."
