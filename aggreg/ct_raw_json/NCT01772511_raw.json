They will be given the option to complete the questionnaire on site after being given the document or have the ability to mail the completed questionnaire into the research office once completed. If the questionnaire is not returned within 2-weeks, the participant will be approached again during their normal clinical visit and asked if they still wish to participate in this study."

The development of the informed\n      consent has been necessitated out of abuses committed in the name of medicine.\n\n      Informed consents have become increasing lengthy and complex. It is not unusual for an\n      Oncology Clinical Research informed consent to be greater than 20 pages.  Investigators will\n      utilize the QuIC-A survey to evaluate patient understanding of the basic elements of\n      informed consent required by federal regulations. The QuIC-A survey has been condensed from\n      20 questions to 14 questions by eliminating the 6 phase specific questions.  The remaining\n      14 questions are designed irrespective of phase and address the basic elements of informed\n      consent.\n\n      Investigators hypothesize that as informed consents have become more lengthy and\n      complicated, in part due to required regulatory language and legal clauses inserted to\n      protect the institution performing research, patient comprehension of the basic elements of\n      informed consent has been hindered."
