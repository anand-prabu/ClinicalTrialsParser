Combining more than one drug may kill more cancer cells.\n      Chemoprotective drugs such as amifostine may protect normal cells from the side effects of\n      chemotherapy.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining topotecan and cytarabine\n      given with amifostine in treating patients who have myelodysplastic syndrome."

Patients receive amifostine IV over 15 minutes every other day for a\n      maximum of 60 days. Patients may receive a second course of the same regimen 8 weeks after\n      the first.\n\n      Patients are followed at least monthly for 2 years, then every 3-6 months until death.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 25 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 to 1.5\n      years."
