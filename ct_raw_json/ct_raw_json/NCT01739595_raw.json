The study requires\n      10 to 12 clinic visits (2 for eye exams), and is approximately 4 to 5\u00bd months in duration.\n      Subjects will be treated for 12-18 weeks.  At Visit 3 (Week 6) subjects who do not achieve\n      morning T values \u2265300 ng/dL will be up-titrated to 25 mg.  Placebo subjects may be sham\n      titrated.  Up-titrated subjects will receive an additional 6 weeks of treatment (18 weeks\n      total).  A schedule of procedures and assessments is displayed in Section 4.  The study will\n      enroll up to 152 male subjects, up to 114 randomized to treatment with Androxal and up to 38\n      randomized to placebo, in a 3:1 ratio.  Subjects must not have used any prior testosterone\n      treatments within the last 6 months.\n\n      Eligible subjects must have 2 consecutive assessments of morning T below 300 ng/dL and LH\n      below 9.4 mIU/mL.  They will provide 2 sperm samples at baseline, at least 2 days apart,\n      another 2 after 12 weeks of treatment, and up-titrated subjects will provide an additional 2\n      samples at the end of treatment.  After 12 weeks of treatment (V5) all subjects will undergo\n      serial T assessment for determination of the Cavg.  Safety assessments will include\n      collection of adverse events, eye examinations, physical examinations and clinical\n      laboratory assessments."
