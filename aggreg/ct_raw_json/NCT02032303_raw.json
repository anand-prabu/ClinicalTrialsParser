Patients with acute coronary syndrome undergoing Percutaneous\n      Coronary Intervention will be enrolled in the study and will be randomized, in a 1:1 ratio,\n      to receive a loading dose of Ticagrelor (180 mg) or Prasugrel (60 mg). In patients with\n      non-ST elevation myocardial infarction these drugs will be administered only when the\n      coronary anatomy will be  known, to avoid bleeding due to prasugrel, in patients suitable\n      for coronary artery bypass grafting as recommended by European Society of Cardiology\n      guidelines (Class IB) (10). In patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction, instead,\n      prasugrel and ticagrelor will be administrated before the procedure, according to the\n      European Society of Cardiology guidelines (Class IB) (11). Coronary Flow Reserve will be\n      recorded by intracoronary Doppler Flow Wire before the stent implantation  and  after the\n      procedure at baseline and 2-minute later adenosine intravenous  administration at\n      incremental doses of 50, 80, 110 and 140 ug/Kg/min with 2 minutes interval between\n      infusions.\n\n      Coronary Flow Reserve is the ability of  the myocardium to increase blood flow in response\n      to maximal exercise. Doppler Flow Wire allows to measure this increase expressing it as a\n      ratio between maximal vasodilation and flow at rest. Coronary Flow Reserve is routinely\n      measured in patients with acute coronary syndrome, without an increased risk of adverse\n      events for patients neither adjunctive costs for the National Health System.\n\n      Furthermore, Plasma concentrations of Ticagrelor and its main metabolite (AR-C124910XX) will\n      be measured in venous blood collected at the end of the procedure. . In patients requiring a\n      second Percutaneous Coronary Intervention, for example for multivessel disease,  all these\n      measures will be repeated in the same manner."
