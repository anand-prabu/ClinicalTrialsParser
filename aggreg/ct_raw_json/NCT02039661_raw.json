The second group consisted of patients who receive placebo spray.\n      Patients will be asked to rate their pain level on a standard continuous 100-mm VAS to\n      quantify the pain. Pain scoring will be performed at 3 different time points: immediately\n      before to the procedure, during the procedure(immediately following the removal of the\n      speculum from the vagina at the end of the endometrial sampling, the patients will be asked\n      to score their pain level experienced during the procedure), and 15 minutes after the\n      procedure.\n\n      We will document the patients' demographics and medical information. All procedures will be\n      performed by a single operator and the same team to avoid possible operator-dependent pain\n      factors (counseling, patient preparation, attitude and operative steps during operation,\n      moral and psychological support)."
