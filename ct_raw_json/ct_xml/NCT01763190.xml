      Primary Objective:

      To study the effect of mild, moderate and severe renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of
      SAR302503.

      Secondary Objective:

      To assess the tolerability of SAR302503 given as a single 300 mg dose in subjects with mild,
      moderate and severe renal impairment and in matched subjects with normal renal function.
