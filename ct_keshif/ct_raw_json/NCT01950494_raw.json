            "textblock": "Hand dermatitis, (a rash, or eczema, on the hands) is a common skin condition that affects\n      approximately 10% of the population. It can be caused by a wide variety of things, such as\n      allergens or irritants. For some, it can be painful and disfiguring. In moderate to severe\n      cases, hand dermatitis can interfere greatly in the quality of life of the affected person,\n      interfering with work and social functions. This can have a negative psychological effect as\n      well.\n\n      FiteBac Skin Care Gel is a new over-the-counter hand sanitizer that has been used for\n      hospital and dental hand infection control. This product contains a germicide, to prevent\n      infection. It also contains a silicone polymer. This makes the hand gel more durable,\n      causing it to remain on the skin longer. Despite this durability, the hand gel still allows\n      the skin to naturally perspire (sweat).\n\n      As people in the health-care industry have used this new product with the goal of reducing\n      hand infections, it has been noted that FiteBac Skin Care Gel also seems to have reduced\n      hand dermatitis and improved personal skin condition. The purpose of this study is to\n      scientifically measure skin improvement in a population of study subjects with hand\n      dermatitis."
