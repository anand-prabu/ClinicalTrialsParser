    <textblock>
      Treatment with cochlear implantation is now offered to proximately 95 % of children with
      deafness in Norway. More than 500 children have been operated at Oslo University Hospital.
      The study is a cross-sectional study aimed to investigate speech perception, language
      skills, quality of life in all childhood cochlear implant (CI) recipients in Norway from
      1988-2012. Factors such as child characteristics, characteristics with the family, the
      cochlear implant, the rehabilitation situation, choice of communication mode, school and
      work situation are surveyed to see if these factors can be associated with variations in
      outcome. The study will include pre and post lingual deaf children and children with
      multiple disabilities. Participants are recruited and examined in conjunction with their
      annual CI control at the hospital. It will be conducted a series of tests determining
      listening, speech and language development, non-verbal IQ. Questionnaires are used to
      collect background information and quality of life experience. The questionnaires include
      self-report forms for different age groups, and a parent report form. The patient will be
      tested for the most common genetic causes of deafness. Additional data will be collected
      from patient records and from local health register at Oslo University Hospital.
