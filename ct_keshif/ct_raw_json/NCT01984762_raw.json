Weight loss is a major\n      objective, although difficult to achieve with medical treatments. Many recent studies\n      demonstrated that bariatric surgery has the potency to achieve marked and sustained weight\n      loss, and is also associated with a significant improvement in control of type 2 diabetes.\n      The principal aim of this study is to compare two types of bariatric procedures, the\n      Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGBP) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG). The study hypothesis is that\n      these procedures have equal efficacy with regard to resolution of type 2 diabetes."
