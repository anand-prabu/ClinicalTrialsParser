            "textblock": "Older Latinos comprised 7% of the older adult population in 2002, but are expected to\n      constitute 20% by 2050. Physical activity (PA) can influence potential declines in the\n      health outcomes of physical and cognitive function that lead to functional limitations\n      (self-reported restrictions in performance) and disability (functional limitations placed in\n      a social context). Unfortunately, Latinos aged 65-74 are 46% less likely to engage in\n      leisure time PA than older non-Latino whites and little is known about PA maintenance among\n      ethnic minorities compared to non-Latino whites. In part as a result of low levels of PA,\n      the physical and cognitive function of older Latinos is poor relative to older non-Latino\n      whites.\n\n      Participation in PA has substantial potential to help older Latinos maintain both physical\n      and cognitive function as they age. Walking and dancing are the two most commonly reported\n      forms of PA among older Latinos. However, urban older Latinos cite unsafe neighborhoods and\n      extreme weather conditions as significant barriers to walking. Dance is a widely popular\n      form of PA among Latinos of all ages, and holds considerable promise as a culturally\n      appropriate form of PA that challenges individuals both physically and cognitively. To date,\n      PA programs designed for older Latinos are lacking. BAILAMOS\u00a9 is an innovative dance program\n      that has been developed by Dr. Marquez (PI) based on focus group input from older\n      community-dwelling Latinos and in collaboration with an accomplished Latin dance instructor.\n\n      Investigators propose a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to test the efficacy of the\n      revised 4-month BAILAMOS\u00a9 program for improving lifestyle PA and health outcomes (physical\n      and cognitive function, self-reported functional limitations, disability) in sedentary older\n      Latinos at risk for disability relative to an attention control group. Investigators will\n      also test whether lifestyle PA and health outcomes can be maintained over an additional\n      4-months through BAILAMOS\u00a9 maintenance activities, which include using indigenous dance\n      leaders. This study will use an RCT (N=166 Treatment, 166 Control) with a health education\n      control group that will allow investigators to examine the adoption of PA and its impact on\n      health outcomes (first 4 months), and the short-term maintenance of PA and its impact on\n      health outcomes (8 months) among older Latinos."
