To estimate safety of KPT-330 (selinexor) in patients with melanoma at the maximum\n      tolerated dose (MTD) defined by the phase 1 study.\n\n      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. To determine the clinical benefit rate (CBR) (complete response, partial response, and\n      stable disease) of patients with unresectable melanoma.\n\n      II. To assess the efficacy at the MTD as measured by progression free survival (PFS) in\n      patients with melanoma.\n\n      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. To validate nuclear transport inhibition resulting from treatment. II. To assess if v-raf\n      murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 (BRAF), neuroblastoma RAS viral (v-ras) oncogene\n      homolog (NRAS), or platelet-derived growth factor receptor, beta polypeptide (PDGFRB)\n      mutational status impacts response.\n\n      III. To assess alteration in signaling pathways as a result of therapy with KPT-330.\n\n      IV. To assess immunologic changes resulting from treatment with KPT-330.\n\n      OUTLINE:\n\n      Patients receive selinexor orally (PO) twice weekly (BIW). Courses repeat every 4 weeks in\n      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 1 year"
