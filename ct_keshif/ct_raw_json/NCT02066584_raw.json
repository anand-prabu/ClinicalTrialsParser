Although it has been reported that glucose is essential for fertilization\n      process and biosynthesis of membrane lipid and nucleic acids, comparatively high levels of\n      glucose in culture media may cause developmental arrest of cleavage stage embryos. The aim\n      of this retrospective study is to examine whether exposure of sibling oocytes to different\n      concentrations of glucose in culture media has any further effect  on IVF outcome."
