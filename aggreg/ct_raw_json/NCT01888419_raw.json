            "textblock": "Background\n\n      In Denmark, breast cancer is the most common fatal cancer in women with more than 4700 new\n      cases annually. All patients are treated according to national guidelines developed by the\n      Danish Breast Cancer Cooperative Group (DBCG). Treatment primarily consists of surgical\n      removal of all or parts of the breast and simultaneous removal of one-or lymph nodes in the\n      ipsilateral axilla. Subsequently, there may be a need for additional treatment with\n      chemotherapy, radiation and / or anti-hormonal therapy, in order to reduce the risk of\n      recurrence.\n\n      Up to 60% of women who are treated surgically for breast cancer, will experience chronic\n      pain as a consequence of the treatment. This condition was previously referred to as \"Post\n      Mastectomy Pain Syndrome\", but because the condition is also seen after less extensive forms\n      of breast cancer surgery, the condition is now termed \"Post Therapy Breast Pain Syndrome\"\n      (PBTPS). PBTPS is defined as a neuropathic pain condition with pain localized to the axilla,\n      the medial part of the upper arm, chest and or chest wall of the side of surgery, lasting\n      more than three months after surgery and / or the end of treatment.\n\n      In 2011 Caviggioli et al. published a study where lipotransplantation to the mastectomy area\n      was found to have a significant analgesic effect. The aforementioned study is to date the\n      only published study in the field. However, it is not a randomized study. In order to obtain\n      further evidence of the apparent beneficial effect of lipotransplantation on pain, the\n      present study has been initiated.\n\n      Lipotransplantation is a fast and relatively non-invasive technique which is described in\n      detail by Coleman et al.. Additionally, in a study from 2008, Klinger et al. found that\n      lipotransplantation to burn scars in the face resulted in a significant improvement in the\n      patient's skin and scar quality and also reduced pain in the treated areas. The theoretical\n      basis for the scar and skin modifying effects of lipotransplantation has not yet been\n      finally understood. To the best of our knowledge, no studies have systematically\n      investigated and analysed the effects of lipotransplantation on the irradiated mastectomy\n      area on a histological level.\n\n      The purpose of the study\n\n      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether lipotransplantation to the pain affected\n      mastectomy area, could have an analgesic effect in women affected by Post Breast Therapy\n      Pain Syndrome. Secondary, we wish to investigate the scar and skin modulating effects of\n      lipotransplantation to the same area.\n\n      By carrying out immunohistochemical staining and subsequent stereoscopic microscopy of free\n      nerve endings in the skin biopsies taken before and after lipotransplantationen we wish to\n      determine whether changes in the number and type of free nerve endings is part of the\n      mechanism of pain reduction.\n\n      By histologically comparing the amount of elastin and the distribution of the different\n      types of collagen before and after lipotransplantation we also strive to illuminate the scar\n      tissue modelling effects of lipotransplantation.\n\n      Hypotheses\n\n        -  Lipotransplantation to the area under the scar tissue and the area under the\n           pain-afflicted area reduces the pain in women with PBTPS.\n\n        -  The neuropathic pain in PBTPS is correlated to the number of free nerve endings\n           crossing the border between the dermis and the epidermis\n\n        -  Lipotransplantation have a beneficial effect on the scar tissue structure and improves\n           the skin quality.\n\n      Patients\n\n      Women who have undergone unilateral mastectomy for breast cancer at Aarhus University\n      Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark and has finished their adjuvant postoperative radiation therapy at\n      least 6 months ago. Patients must have had pain localized to the area of the missing breast\n      for at least three months after adjuvant radiation therapy ended. A total of 60 patients\n      with PBTPS will be included.\n\n      Furthermore, a control group of 30 patients without PBTPS is to be included. The control\n      group will serve as a baseline group in regards to the nerve fibre properties of the skin in\n      the mastectomy area for patients who have undergone the same treatment but haven't developed\n      PBTPS.\n\n      Methods\n\n      Patients with Post Breast Therapy Pain Syndrome (PBTPS)\n\n      Patients with PBTPS are randomly assigned to receive either lipotransplantation or no active\n      treatment.\n\n      Regardless of randomization, the patient will be invited to three follow-up visits,\n      respectively 3, 6 and 12 months after inclusion/surgery. At each of the outpatient visits\n      the participant will be asked to complete the DoloTest \u00ae and the Patient Scar Assessment\n      Scale. The clinician will complete the Observer Scar Assessment Scale and record the\n      consumption of pain medication. DoloTest \u00ae is a validated, visual analogue questionnaire\n      designed to assess the patients experienced pain and impact on the patients daily life. Two\n      3-mm punch biopsies will be taken at inclusion and at the follow-up visits visits 3 and 12\n      months after inclusion, regardless of which group the patient was randomized to. One of the\n      3-mm skin punch biopsy is taken directly from the scar. The second 3-mm skin biopsy is taken\n      in the area of the missing breast the patient has designated as the most pain afflicted. If\n      the patient's pain trigger area is located directly in the scar, the second skin punch\n      biopsy will be taken at a distance of 1 cm from the scar.\n\n      Patients without PBTPS\n\n      The second control group, consisting of 30 women who have not developed PBTPS, will be\n      subjected to a 3-mm skin punch biopsy from the skin above their mastectomy scar. The group\n      will consist of patients who have opted for a secondary breast reconstruction, and the\n      biopsy will be taken during the reconstructive procedure to ensure minimal added risk and\n      discomfort.\n\n      Histological examination\n\n      The skin punch biopsies from the pain afflicted area will be fixed in 4% phosphate buffered\n      paraformaldehyde. After freezing, the tissue samples are cut into 50-micron thick sections.\n      Systematically sampled sections immunostained with rabbit anti-human Protein Gene Product\n      9.5 (a neuron-specific protein), and DAB-marked goat anti-rabbit as the secondary antibody.\n      The sections are then microscoped in an Olympus BX51 light microscope with an Olympus DP71\n      digital camera and Prior motorized board connected to a computer with Newcast stereology\n      software. Two goals can then be calculated: 1) the number of free nerve endings, which\n      crosses the border between dermis and epidermis per mm 2) the average nerve fibre length\n      density in the epidermis and / or dermis.\n\n      The skin punch biopsies from the mastectomy scar are fixed in formaldehyde for embedding in\n      paraffin. The tissue samples are cut into 1-2 micron thick sections and stained with\n      Picrosirius red (PR) colour. By using polarized light microscopy, the various subtypes of\n      collagen fibres may be visualized and differentiated. The thicker collagen fibres (type I)\n      are red-orange-yellow and the thinner collagen fibres (type III) are green. Furthermore, the\n      sections will be stained for elastin. Quantitatively, by means of the above-mentioned\n      method, changes in the volume fraction of collagen type I and III, and elastin may be\n      measured.\n\n      Statistical analyzes\n\n      The minimal clinically relevant difference the study is looking for, is a Visual Analog Pain\n      score difference of 3. The common standard deviation was estimated from a similar study by\n      Caviggioli et al. in 2011, and set to be 2.96 on the Visual Analog Pain scale. We assume\n      that our standard deviation (SD) will be the same. Using the following formula: N = (Za +\n      Zb)2 x SD2 / dif2 where Za and Zb are the standardized normal deviations corresponding to\n      the selected levels of significance, SD is Standard Deviation and dif is the minimal\n      clinically relevant difference the study is looking for. The result is 16 patients in each\n      arm, totalling 32 patients, when the significance level is set at 5% and the power of the\n      study is set to 80%. We plan to include 30 patients in each group, which will increase the\n      power of the study to 97.5%. Statistical analyzes will be performed in collaboration with a\n      biostatistician from the Health Sciences Institution, Aarhus University, Denmark.\n\n      Economic Conditions\n\n      The project is supported by: Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Aarhus with three\n      full time equivalents, which is used to pay for full-time academic staff. Other project\n      expenses are to be covered by independent foundations and endowments that do not have an\n      influence on the study. None of the personnel in the project have a financial interest in\n      the project.\n\n      Compensation to the participating patients\n\n      The participating patients in the study will not receive any financial compensation.\n      However, documented travel expenses will be reimbursed.\n\n      Recruitment of participants\n\n      The patients will always be offered at least 24 hours of consideration before deciding to\n      give written consent to participate in the study. With the signing of the consent form, the\n      patient accepts the terms and conditions in the study. The patient may at any time and\n      without justification withdraw her consent to participate, without her decision affecting\n      her present or future treatment or any other rights the patient may have.\n\n      Patients with PBTPS are recruited during their routine visits at the department of oncology.\n\n      Patients without PBTPS are recruited at their standard visit before the breast\n      reconstructive procedure that they have opted for.\n\n      Publication of results\n\n      Negative, inconclusive and positive results from the study will be published in\n      internationally recognized, peer-reviewed, English-language journals with an interest in the\n      field.\n\n      Ethical statement, side effects and risks\n\n      In the present project, data will be treated confidentially in accordance with the Danish\n      Act on Processing of Personal Data. Participants shall be informed both in writing and\n      orally prior to deciding to participate in the study. The participants are thus fully aware\n      of the projects purpose, background and methods, as well as what is expected from the\n      patient's role as a participant.\n\n      The participating patients are in the lipotransplantation group, offered an active\n      treatment, which if the current study program can confirm the foreign study, hopefully\n      reduces their daily pain and discomfort and thereby also their consumption of analgesia. If\n      the project provides positive results, the control group will, after the study has ended, be\n      offered the same active treatment.\n\n      The patients, which only after informed consent, is part of the project will, in connection\n      with:\n\n        1. Lipotransplantation in general anaesthesia; only be exposed to the risk associated with\n           general anaesthesia. The patients in the present study have in relation to their\n           previous surgery for breast cancer been exposed to one or more interventions in general\n           anaesthesia.\n\n        2. Risks related to the actual lipotransplantation. At the donor site, there is a risk for\n           short-term tenderness and temporary discolouration. In the long term, a slightly rough\n           surface of the skin may arise. The advantage of the harvest of the fat graft is that\n           the patient achieves a visible improvement of the contour at the donor site.\n\n        3. The risk related to the skin punch biopsies: apart from a small scar 1-3 mm\n           corresponding to the place where the biopsy is collected, there is not assessed to any\n           risk of permanent injury or damage.\n\n      All interventions are carried out by experienced specialists in plastic surgery with several\n      years experience with lipotransplantation. The general anaesthesia is performed by\n      specialists in anaesthesiology, which are all part of the permanent team at the plastic\n      surgery department and therefore familiar with providing anaesthesia during the described\n      procedures."
