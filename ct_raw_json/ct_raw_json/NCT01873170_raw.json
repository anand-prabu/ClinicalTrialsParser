Immune cells are important because they help prevent infections from starting\n      and help fight infections that have started. Immune cells are also the type of cells that\n      HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) infects so understanding more about them will help to\n      better understand how to prevent the spread of HIV.\n\n      Immune cells will be studied from the reproductive tract of women who want to start using\n      one of the following contraceptives: an oral contraceptive pill (COC), Depo-Provera (DMPA),\n      the levonorgestrel IUD (Mirena\u00ae), the copper IUD (ParaGard\u00ae), or the etonogestrel subdermal\n      implant (Nexplanon\u00ae).Immune cells will also be studied from the reproductive tract of women\n      who are not using birth control and who are not at risk of pregnancy for comparison."
