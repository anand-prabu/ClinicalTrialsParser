  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this randomized study is to compare the effect of two controlled chest tube
      protocols on the duration of air leak and fluid drainage following pulmonary lobectomy or
      segmentectomy by using an electronic regulated chest drainage system (Thopaz). Previous
      studies have suggested that the amount of negative pressure used at the level of the chest
      drainage device may affect the duration of air leak, but the results have been inconsistent,
      however as revealed in more recent studies understanding of the physics of chest drainage
      devices may have been confounded by lack of regulation of the pleural pressure.

      In addition, experimental studies have shown that fluid drainage may be affected by the
      degree of negative pleural pressure applied.

    <description>On the morning of each postoperative day (starting with POD#1) patients of group 1 are switched for 4 hours to -8 cm H2O  After this period of 4 hours both groups are switched back to their original pressure levels, with the effect on air leak and fluid leak measured. Pts are then left on their original pressure level until the next day, when the switch to -8 or - 20 cm H2O is again made.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Able and willing to read, understand, and provide written Informed Consent;

          -  Age range of 18-90 years;

          -  Patients submitted to lobectomy, segmentectomy and bilobectomy  due to lung cancer or
             other intrathoracic lesions. Both open and minimally invasive (thoracoscopic)
             resections are acceptable.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  if patients are submitted to lung resection associated with chest wall resection or
             diaphragm resection the patient will be excluded from analysis

          -  If during the postoperative hospital course there is a need for postoperative
             mechanical ventilation or hemodynamic instability the patient will be excluded from
             analysis.

          -  If the subject meets all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion
             criteria, he/she is eligible to participate in the study.
