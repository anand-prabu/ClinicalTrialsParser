    <textblock>
      This randomized phase I/II trial studies the side effects of vaccine therapy and trastuzumab
      with or without polysaccharide-K and to see how well it works in treating patients with
      stage IV human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) positive breast cancer. Vaccines
      made from HER2 intracellular domain (ICD) peptide may help the body build an effective
      immune response to kill tumor cells that express HER2. Monoclonal antibodies, such as
      trastuzumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumors to
      grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing
      substances to them. Polysaccharide-K may stimulate the immune system in different ways and
      stop tumor cells from growing. It is not yet known whether vaccine therapy and trastuzumab
      is more effective when given with or without polysaccharide-K in treating breast cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety of polysaccharide-K (PSK) when given with a HER2 ICD peptide-based
      vaccine and trastuzumab.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the effect of PSK on natural killer (NK) cell functional activity when given
      with a HER2 ICD peptide-based vaccine and trastuzumab.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To investigate the effect of PSK when given with a HER2 ICD peptide-based vaccine and
      trastuzumab on: serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokine and/or chemokines; intermolecular
      epitope spreading; serum transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta levels; progression free
      survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive HER2 ICD peptide-based vaccine intradermally (ID) once monthly for 3
      months, trastuzumab per standard of care, and placebo orally (PO) twice daily (BID) for 4
      months.

      ARM II: Patients receive HER2 ICD peptide-based vaccine ID and trastuzumab as in Arm I and
      polysaccharide-K PO BID for 4 months.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 8 months, and then twice
      annually for 3 years.
