  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an assisted exercise trial involving exercise on a stationary bike, brain imaging
      and DNA(genetics)sampling. The purpose of this study is to find out if performing a
      progressive, supervised assisted exercise program on a stationary bike improves quality of
      life, increases motivation to continue to exercise, improves dietary behavior and leads to
      sustained weight loss in women who have had early-stage endometrial cancer. Questionnaires
      will be used to assess exercise motivation and dietary behavior. Brain's responses to
      different visual images will also be assessed.

      Primary Objective:

      To evaluate changes in body weight, fitness, bi-manual dexterity, exercise motivation and
      self-reported eating behavior (via questionnaires) before and after a 16-week exercise
      intervention (EOT)and 4 weeks post-EOT in obese EC patients who will be randomized to
      perform 'assisted', voluntary or no exercise (healthy living educational information only).

      Secondary Objective:

      To objectively examine food behavior as determined by neuronal response to high- versus
      low-calorie visual stimuli under fasted (hunger) and fed (satiated) states in brain regions
      of interest (reward and motivation circuitry) using blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD)
      functional MRI before and after a 16-week exercise intervention (EOT) and 4 weeks
      post-intervention (EOT+4) in obese EC patients performing 'assisted', voluntary or no
      exercise (healthy living educational information only).

      Patients will be randomized to receive either the assisted exercise (n=10), voluntary
      exercise (n=10) or no exercise (n=6) group. Subjects in the voluntary group will exercise on
      a stationary recumbent exercise cycle and pedal at their preferred rate. Subjects in the
      assisted exercise group will cycle on the same stationary exercise bike; however, a motor
      will provide assistance to the patient in order to maintain a pedaling rate 35% greater than
      their voluntary rate. Subjects in the exercise groups will complete 45 minute to 1-hour
      sessions, three times per week for eight weeks. The control group will be asked to complete
      all exercise, body composition and fMRI testing similar to the exercise groups. Patients in
      the No Exercise/Educational Information Only control group will complete the same set of
      questionnaires as the patients in the exercise groups.

    <description>The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - General (FACT-G) is a 27-item core questionnaire evaluating various domains of QoL including, physical, functional, family-social, and emotional well-being. The FACT-En is a 16-item subscale specific for endometrial cancer (EC) and assesses hormone withdrawal, pelvic symptoms, and possible adjuvant therapy side effects. Short-form Medical Outcomes (SF-36) consists of 36 questions scored on a Likert scale, producing overall physical and mental component summary measures.</description>

    <description>The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) is a 21-item, Likert-scaled instrument of depressive symptoms that is well-validated and frequently used in lifestyle research studies. Each item is rated on a 4- point scale ranging from 0 to 3 (higher scores are associated with greater symptoms).</description>

    <description>Barriers to adhering to the exercise protocol will be assessed prospectively using an elicitation procedure similar to that suggested in the theory of planned behavior, whereby an open-ended question is asked to solicit the barrier without any preconceived notion of what the barrier might be. Specifically, participants in the exercise groups will be asked to book their weekly supervised exercise sessions with the Exercise Specialist/Physiologist. Participants cancelling an exercise session or requesting to be removed from the study will be asked why they are no longer interested in completed the program.</description>
