ICG spreads through the lymphatic system, and will be\n      visualized using near-infrared (NIR) imagers.  Upon visualization of the path of the ICG,\n      sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs), the first nodes to receive drainage from the primary tumor,\n      will be identified.  SLNs will be surgically removed and provided to Pathology for\n      evaluation.  Non-sentinel nodes will also be surgically removed, as is consistent with\n      routine medical care for these patients, and given to Pathology for evaluation. A positive\n      SLN may be the most accurate identifier of the extra-uterine spread of disease, and will\n      provide information about the extent of surgical node removal necessary."
