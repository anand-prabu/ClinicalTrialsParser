The\n      necessary duration of inclusion will be 36 months\n\n      The comparison of the two treatments will be carried out on the composite principal\n      criterion according to : proportion of pregnancies with unfavourable exit (symptomatic\n      children at birth or medical interruptions of pregnancy practised for which has appeared\n      cerebral echographic anomalies in connection with the f\u0153tal infection with CMV).\n\n      The secondary criteria of judgement will be : the viral load in the blood of the cord of the\n      newborns infected in utero by CMV, the compliance and the criteria of tolerance."
