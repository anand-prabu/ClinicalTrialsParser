The study population will be enriched for subjects that\n      would benefit most from rapid onset, those with recent active suicidal ideation, but not a\n      risk to themselves or others and are deemed appropriate for an out-patient study with\n      careful safety surveillance.  This will allow the study to focus on the antidepressant\n      effects of CERC-301 but also explore effects on suicidal ideation.  To explore rapid onset,\n      the primary endpoint will be at 7 days, but effects over the 28 days of treatment will be\n      examined as a secondary endpoint."
