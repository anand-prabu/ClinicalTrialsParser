  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study involves participants who have acute lymphoblastic or acute myelogenous
      leukemia that has relapsed or has become resistant (or refractory) to standard therapies.
      This research study is evaluating a drug called KPT-330.  Laboratory and other studies
      suggest that the study drug, KPT-330, may prevent leukemia cells from growing and may lead
      to the destruction of leukemia cells.  It is thought that KPT-330 activates cellular
      processes that increase the death of leukemia cells.  The main goal of this study is to
      evaluate the side effects of KPT-330 when it is administered to children and adolescents
      with relapsed or refractory leukemia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are trying to determine a safe dose of KPT-330 and will be giving
      participants different dose levels of the study drug.  Three to six participants will
      receive the starting dose of the drug.  If the side effects are not too severe, the next
      group of participants will take the study drug at a higher dose level.  Up to 3 dose levels
      of the study drug will be tested, but once each participant has been assigned a dose level,
      the participant will always receive the same dose.  The highest dose that people can be
      given safely is called the maximum tolerated dose (MTD).  Once the MTD is determined, up to
      10 additional participants will receive that dose to further study the drug.

      Participants between the age of ≥18 months (540 days) and ≤ 21 years with relapsed (second
      or subsequent relapse) or refractory ALL or AML will be eligible to enroll. KPT-330 will be
      administered twice a week on Days 1 and 3 for four weeks (a cycle is 4 weeks).  All
      participants will receive intrathecal chemotherapy on Day 1 of each cycle. Participants with
      CNS-2 disease will receive additional doses of IT chemo. Pharmacokinetic (PK) samples will
      be collected during Cycle 1 on Days 1-3 and 15. PK samples will be collected during Cycle 2
      on Day 15.  Pharmacodynamic  (PD) samples will be collected during Cycle 1 on Days 1-3.  PD
      samples will be collected during Cycle 2 on Day 15.  Additional optional correlative biology
      sample will be collected. Participants are monitored closely for adverse events.
      Participants will have physical exams and blood work more than once a week during all
      cycles.

               -  Biologic (anti-neoplastic agent): At least 7 days after the last dose of a
                  biologic agent. For agents that have known adverse events occurring beyond 7
                  days after administration, this period must be extended beyond the time during
                  which adverse events are known to occur. The duration of this interval must be
                  discussed with the study chair.

               -  Immunotherapy: At least 6 weeks after the completion of any type of
                  immunotherapy, e.g. tumor vaccines.

                  of a monoclonal antibody. (See table on DVL homepage listing monoclonal antibody
                  half-lives: https://members.childrensoncologygroup.

          -  Performance status:

             -- Lansky  ≥ 50 for individuals 18 months-  ≤ 16 years old; Karnofsky &gt; 50% for
             individuals 17-21 years old (See Appendix I).

          -  Adequate organ function defined as the following:

               -  Direct bilirubin ≤1.5 X institutional upper limit of normal (ULN)

               -  AST (SGOT)/ALT (SGPT) ≤ 3X institutional ULN

               -  Creatinine within normal institutional limits or creatinine clearance ≥ 60
                  mL/min/1.73 m2 for subjects with creatinine levels above institutional normal

               -  Echocardiogram must have a shortening fraction or an ejection fraction greater
                  than institutional lower limit of normal for age and gender.

          -  Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative urine or serum
             pregnancy test confirmed prior to enrollment.

          -  Female patients with infants must agree not to breastfeed their infants while on this
             study.

          -  The effects of KPT-330 on the developing human fetus are unknown.  For this reason
             and because many chemotherapeutic agents are known to be teratogenic, women of
             childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or
             barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the
             duration of study participation.  Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is
             pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician
             immediately.

          -  Ability of participant (or parent/guardian for participants who are minors) to
             understand and the willingness to sign the written informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:Participants who exhibit any of the following conditions at screening
        will not be eligible for admission into the study.

          -  Inability to take or tolerate enteral medications.

          -  Individuals with a known t(9;22)/BCR-ABL fusion based on testing at either initial
             diagnosis or at relapse.

             immunoglobulin by flow cytometry and/or known t(8;14), t(2;8), or t(8;22).

          -  Absence of surface immunoglobulin by flow cytometry at time of relapse is sufficient
             to rule out mature B-cell leukemia; karyotype or FISH results documenting absence of
             t(8;14), t(2;8), or t(8;22) is not necessary prior to enrollment if absence of
             surface of immunoglobulin is documented by flow cytometry.

          -  Individuals with CNS 3 leukemia

          -  Individuals with Down syndrome

          -  Patients with prior hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) are eligible, with the
             exception of the following:

               -  Autologous HSCT within 60 days of study entry

               -  Allogeneic HSCT within 90 days of study entry

               -  Evidence of graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD)

               -  Treatment with immunosuppressive medications within 14 days

          -  Treatment with hematopoietic growth factors (G-CSF):

               -  Long-acting (e.g., Neulasta) within 14 days prior to study entry

               -  Short-acting (e.g., Neupogen) within 7 days prior to study entry

          -  Treatment with an investigational agent within 28 days of study entry, or 3
             half-lives, whichever is longer.

          -  Patients will be excluded if there is a plan to administer non-protocol chemotherapy,
             radiation therapy, or immunotherapy during the study period.

          -  Any ECG abnormality that in the opinion of the principal investigator would preclude
             safe participation in the study

          -  Patients refractory to red blood cell or platelet transfusions.

          -  Patients receiving anti-coagulation therapy are eligible as long as anti-coagulation
             regimen has been stable for &gt; 1 month.

          -  Patients with systemic fungal, bacterial, viral or other infection that is exhibiting
             ongoing signs/symptoms related to the infection without improvement despite
             appropriate antibiotics or other treatment.

          -  For dose-escalation cohort only, known positivity for human immunodeficiency virus
             (HIV); baseline testing for HIV is not required.  HIV positive patients will be
             eligible for the dose-expansion cohort.

          -  Known active hepatitis A, B, or C infection; or known to be positive for HCV RNA or
             HBsAg (HBV surface antigen); baseline testing for viral hepatitis is not required.

          -  Impairment of gastrointestinal function or gastrointestinal disease that may
             significantly alter the absorption of KPT-330 (e.g. ulcerative colitis, uncontrolled
             nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, malabsorption or history of small bowel resection)

          -  Individuals with significant concurrent disease, illness, psychiatric disorder or
             social issue that would compromise patient safety or compliance, interfere with
             consent, study participation, follow up, or interpretation of study results.

          -  Individuals with a history of a different malignancy (other than ALL/AML) are
             ineligible except for the following circumstances:

          -  Individuals are eligible if they have been disease-free for at least 5 years and are
             deemed by the investigator to be at low risk for recurrence of that malignancy.

          -  Individuals with the following cancers are eligible if diagnosed and treated within
             the past 5 years: cervical cancer in situ, and basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma
             of the skin.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because KPT-330 is a chemotherapeutic
             agent with unknown teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown
             but potential risk of adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the
             mother with study agents, breastfeeding is not allowed during study treatment.
