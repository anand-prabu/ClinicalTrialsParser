            "textblock": "Bioresorbable scaffolds are transient implants. They act like drug-eluting metallic stents\n      (DES) during the first 3 months by supporting the vessel wall thereby keeping the artery\n      patent. Subsequently, resorption of the scaffold begins and its structure loosens. As a\n      result of everolimus release, neointimal growth is inhibited similar to DES. Finally the\n      implant is reabsorbed completely in about 2-3 years. BVS in terms of late stent thrombosis\n      may be safer than DES. Transiently scaffolded vessels may regain their natural curvature and\n      angulation as well as response to nitroglycerine and endothelial function."
