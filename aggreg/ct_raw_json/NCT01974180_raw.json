The earliest changes\n      associated with the development of smoking-induced lung diseases, such as chronic\n      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung cancer, occur in the airway epithelium,\n      including BC hyperplasia, squamous metaplasia, mucous cell hyperplasia and metaplasia,\n      impaired ciliated cell structure and function, loss of Clara cells, and increased epithelial\n      permeability due to impaired junctional barrier. The focus of this study is to look at how\n      smoking-induced EGF alters the ability of BC to form normally differentiated airway\n      epithelium."
