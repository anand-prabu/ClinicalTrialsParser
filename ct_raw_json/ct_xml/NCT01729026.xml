  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to provide preliminary data on the feasibility and impact of
      adopting a dog from an animal shelter as a supplement to usual care in Veterans with
      Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) who desire to get such a pet.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Posttraumatic Stress Disorder, a common mental disorder among Veterans, is marked by painful
      re-experiencing of a traumatic event, often together with depression, fearfulness, and
      social isolation. Despite major advances in rehabilitation, many Veterans continue to be
      disabled by PTSD. One possible new approach involves the use of shelter dogs, which might
      relieve symptoms and aid reintegration into society by providing emotional support and a
      greater sense of security. In this randomized controlled trial of 48 Veterans with chronic
      PTSD, we will evaluate whether the half who adopt a dog from the San Antonio Humane Society
      show greater improvement in their PTSD symptoms over the first three months than the half
      who are assigned to a waiting list.
