In addition, the study will assess serum cystatin C as a surrogate test for\n      glomerular filtration rate which could indicate worsening kidney function at an earlier\n      stage than serum creatinine.\n\n      The proposed research is significant because it is expected to identify at-risk patients for\n      future renal impairment and to prospectively monitor the persistence of proteinuria and its\n      effect on kidney function in the short term."

This has been related to low\n      nephron mass due to inadequate or early termination of glomerulogenesis in utero and during\n      the perinatal period. Risks for subsequent development of hypertension and kidney disease\n      include excessive weight gain during early life with insulin resistance and supplemental\n      high calorie feedings.\n\n      Specific Aims The long-term goal is for early diagnosis of those infants who are at risk for\n      future development of hypertension and kidney disease so that investigators might intervene\n      to potentially avert progression to adult disease. The objective of this clinical trial is\n      to acquire data on the natural history of neonatal kidney function and size in infants born\n      preterm during the first year of life. This will be done through the use of standard serum\n      and urine markers as well as non-invasive ultrasound technology. The central hypothesis of\n      this clinical trial is that a subgroup of patients born preterm will demonstrate early\n      markers of kidney injury including elevated serum cystatin C, proteinuria and hypertension.\n      This hypothesis has been formulated on the basis of preliminary data from the group studying\n      this question retrospectively in older children born prematurely who have developed overt\n      kidney disease. The rationale for the proposed research is to develop early serum and\n      demographic markers of pre-clinical kidney disease so that early intervention may occur.\n\n      The investigators expect to test the central hypothesis and to achieve the objectives of\n      this application by pursuing the following 3 specific aims:\n\n        1. Identify risk factors associated with proteinuria, microalbuminuria, hypertension and\n           kidney function in preterm infants.\n\n             1. Intra-uterine and perinatal factors: Based on preliminary data, the working\n                hypothesis is that infants born preterm have a nephron deficit that predisposes\n                them to hypertension and subclinial and clinical kidney disease during their\n                lifetimes that may have origins in the perinatal period.\n\n             2. Acquired factors: The investigators postulate that early perinatal stressors and\n                exposures such as nephrotoxic antibiotics and vasoactive medications as well as\n                high calorie nutritional supplements may pre-dispose to renal disease in this\n                vulnerable population.\n\n             3. Ethnic differences among Caucasians, African Americans, Caribbean Blacks and\n                Hispanics. Based on preliminary data, the working hypothesis is that there will be\n                a statistically significant difference among the ethnic groups.\n\n        2. Observe the natural history of proteinuria, microalbuminuria, hypertension and kidney\n           function in preterm infants during the first year of life. Based on preliminary data in\n           older infants and children, the working hypothesis is that the degree of proteinuria\n           and microalbuminuria is a reflection of kidney injury and dysfunction that correlates\n           with ongoing disease progression. The investigators postulate that a subset of patients\n           will have persistent manifestations of kidney disease after the perinatal period,\n           especially those with nephrotoxic exposures and high calorie nutritional supplements.\n\n        3. Establish serum cystatin C as a sensitive test to measure kidney function in preterm\n           infants. The investigators hypothesize that cord blood and early serum cystatin C will\n           be more predictive of kidney function than serum creatinine in preterm infants.\n\n      Study Design. This is a single-center case-controlled prospective observational study with\n      the rationale of evaluating parameters of renal function including proteinuria,\n      microalbuminuria and cystatin C in preterm infants and associating this with kidney size and\n      blood pressure during the first year of life. Demographics including race, gender and growth\n      will provide important perspectives relative to formula and/or breast feeding with/without\n      high calorie supplements during the first year."
