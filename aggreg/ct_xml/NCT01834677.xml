  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the psychometric properties and utility of new,
      computerized, neurocognitive measures in humans with depression, and humans with depression
      undergoing electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). The benefits of the study outweigh the risk as
      there is the possibility of developing better computerized neurocognitive measures, and the
      risks are limited to no more than minimal test related fatigue and psychological stress.

      Depressed humans, and depressed human participants undergoing ECT (age 18-70) will be
      invited to participate in this study. After providing informed consent participants will
      undergo a clinical psychiatric evaluation to confirm the inclusion/exclusion criteria. After
      the clinical psychiatric evaluation, participants will complete common and new
      neurocognitive measures. There will be a total of two testing visits (baseline, 1-month
      follow-up). The anticipated duration of the participants involvement is no more than 2 study
      visits that can take place over a 4-day period (i.e., the clinical evaluation can occur on
      day 1 and the neuropsychological measures can be administered on day 2 of each study visit)
      equating to approximately 6-hours (3-hours each day) per study visit.
