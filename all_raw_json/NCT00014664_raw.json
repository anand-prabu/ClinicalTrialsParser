Patients are randomized to 1 of 3\n      treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive monoclonal antibody (MOAB) Hu1D10 IV over approximately 2 hours\n           on days 1, 8, 15, and 22.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive MOAB Hu1D10 as in arm I at a higher dose.\n\n        -  Arm III:Patients receive MOAB Hu1D10 IV on days 1, 3, 5, 8, 10, 12, 15, 17, 19, 22, 24,\n           and 26.\n\n      Treatment in all arms continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable\n      toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed at weeks 1, 4, and 12 and then at months 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients will be accrued for this study."
