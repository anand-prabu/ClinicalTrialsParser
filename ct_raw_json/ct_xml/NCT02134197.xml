  <brief_title>Dose-escalation Study of BAY1129980</brief_title>
  <official_title>An Open-label Phase I Dose-escalation Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, Maximum Tolerated Dose, Pharmacokinetics, and Pharmacodynamics of the Anti-C4.4a Antibody Drug Conjugate BAY1129980 in Subjects With Advanced Solid Tumors Known to Express C4.4a</official_title>

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate:

        -  The side effects of BAY1129980 when given every 21 days different dose levels.

        -  Determine the dose level of BAY1129980 that should be tested in future clinical
           research studies.

        -  Measure how much BAY1129980 is in the blood at specific times after administration.

        -  If treatment with BAY1129980 shows any effect on reducing the tumor growth.

        -  If there are specific biomarkers that might be able to explain why some patients
           respond to treatment and others do not.

        -  If treatment with BAY1129980 causes an immune response from the body against the drug
           (immunogenicity).

      The relatively restricted C4.4a expression pattern provides a target for the selective
      delivery of a cytotoxic drug to C4.4.a-expressing tumor cells by means of a suitable
      antibody-drug conjugate. The subject population eligible for the current study will be those
      subjects with advanced malignancies known to express C4.4a, which are refractory to standard
      therapy or those without standard therapy or actively refusing any treatment, which would be
      regarded as standard and in whom, in the opinion of the investigator, experimental therapy
      with BAY1129980 may be beneficial.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All subjects must be â‰¥ 18 years at the first screening examination / visit

          -  All subjects must provide a tumor tissue sample  from [Formalin Fixed Paraffin
             Embedded (FFPE) slides] archival tissue or fresh biopsy collected before Cycle 1, Day
             1

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0 to 1

          -  Life expectancy of at least 12 weeks

          -  Radiographically or clinically evaluable tumor. In the expansion phase, disease must
             be measurable according to RECIST 1.1.

          -  Adequate bone marrow, liver, and renal function

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed solid tumors known to express C4.4a (eg,
             carcinomas of the lung, head &amp; neck SCC, esophagus SCC (squamous cell
             carcinoma),colon, ovary, prostate, and breast) that are refractory to any standard

             that is still clinically present and considered as acute or chronic.

          -  Subjects with psoriasis or other severe skin disease (eg, autoimmune skin disease,
             active erythematous skin lesions, etc.)

          -  Serious, non-healing wound, skin ulcer (of any grade), or bone fracture

          -  Prior local radiotherapy is allowed if it is completed at least 4 weeks prior to the
             first dose of study drug and the subject has evaluable lesions not previously
             irradiated

          -  Significant liver dysfunction determined as Child-Pugh score B or C

          -  History of symptomatic metastatic brain or meningeal tumors unless the subject is &gt;3
             months from the end of definitive therapy before the first dose of study drug and has
