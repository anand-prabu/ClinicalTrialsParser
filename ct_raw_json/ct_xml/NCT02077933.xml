      Dose escalation part: to determine the highest dose of BYL719 administered on a daily basis
      when given in combination with daily Everolimus or in combination with daily Everolimus and
      Exemestane.

      Dose expansion part: To describe safety and tolerability of the BYL719 and Everolimus or
      BYL719, Everolimus and Exemestane combinations. To explore preliminary signs of efficacy of
      BYL719 and everolimus, and of the triplet combination (BYL719, everolimus, and exemestane)
