      The purpose of this study is to characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of LY03003 following
      multiple escalating intramuscular injections, as compared to Neupro patch. and to evaluate
      the safety and tolerability and preliminary efficacy  of multiple ascending dose (MAD) of
      LY03003 following intramuscular injections.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject has Idiopathic Parkinson's Disease defined by the cardinal sign,
             Bradykinesia, plus the presence of at least 1 of the following: resting tremor,
             rigidity, or impairment of postural reflexes, and without any other known or
             suspected cause of Parkinsonism

          2. Subject is Hoehn &amp; Yahr stage ≤3

          3. Subject is male or female aged ≥18 years at Screening

          4. Subject has a Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score of ≥25

          5. Subject has a Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) motor score (Part III)
             of ≥10 but  ≤30 at Screening

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject has atypical Parkinson's syndrome(s) due to drugs (e.g., Metoclopramide,
             Flunarizine), metabolic neurogenetic disorders (e.g., Wilson's Disease),
             Encephalitis, Cerebrovascular Disease, or Degenerative Disease (e.g., progressive
             Supranuclear Palsy)

          2. Subject has a history of Pallidotomy, Thalamotomy, deep brain stimulation, or fetal
             tissue transplant

          3. Subject has dementia, active psychosis or hallucinations, or clinically significant
             depression

          4. Subject has a lifetime history of suicide attempt (including an active attempt,
             interrupted attempt, or aborted attempt), or has suicidal ideation in the past 6
             months as indicated by a positive response (&quot;Yes&quot;) to either Question 4 or Question 5
             of the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (CSSRS) at Screening

          5. Subject has a history of symptomatic  orthostatic hypotension with a decrease of  ≥20
             mmHg in systolic blood pressure (SBP) or ≥10 mmHg in diastolic blood pressure when
             changing from supine to standing position after having been at supine position for at
             least 5 minutes within 28 days prior to the Screening Visit, or SBP less than 105
             mmHg at study entry, or reports clinical signs of clinically significant orthostatic
             hypotension within 28 days prior to the Screening Visit.

          6. Subject is receiving therapy with a dopamine agonist (DA) either concurrently or has
             done so within 28 days prior to the Screening

          7. Subject is receiving therapy with 1 of the following drugs either concurrently or
             within 28 days prior to screening: MAO-B inhibitors, DA releasing agents, DA
             modulating agent, DA antagonists, neuroleptics, or other medications that may
             interact with DA function.

          8. Subject is currently receiving central nervous system active therapy (e.g.,
             sedatives, hypnotics, antidepressants, anxiolytics), unless the dose has been stable
             for at least 28 days prior to Screening Visit and is likely to remain stable for the
             duration of the study. Patients should not take those medications within 8 hours
             prior to clinical visits

          9. Subject has a current diagnosis of epilepsy, has a history of seizures as an adult,
             has a history of stroke, or has had a transient ischemic attack within 1 year prior
             to Screening

         10. Subject has a history of known intolerance/hypersensitivity to non-dopaminergic
             antiemetics, such as domperidone, ondansetron, tropisetron, and glycopyrrolate

         11. Subject has any other clinically relevant hepatic, renal and cardiac dysfunction, or
             other medical condition or laboratory abnormality including abnormal plasma magnesium
             level, which would in the judgment of the investigator, interfere with the subject's
             ability to participate in the study

         12. Subject has a history of significant skin hypersensitivity to adhesive or other
             transdermal preparations or recent unresolved contact Dermatitis (this item is
             specific for patients to be enrolled to part 2 of this study)

         13. Subjects with C-reactive protein levels of 2x of upper limit of normal range

         14. Female subjects who are pregnant or are breastfeeding or are of childbearing
             potential without adequate contraception.

         15. Patients with a positive finding in drug screening test or alcohol test
