            "textblock": "Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication (NSAID) therapy is a mainstay treatment for joint\n      pain and painful musculoskeletal disorders. Though this form of systemic therapy is highly\n      effective, it causes substantial side effects including gastritis and gastric ulcer disease,\n      renal impairment, hypertension, and thrombotic events. These types of oral medications are\n      utilized by millions of Americans on a fairly regular basis in both over-the-counter\n      preparations and prescription compounds. In recent years, topical preparations of NSAIDs\n      have been used for localized pain as an alternate to oral administration with reported good\n      analgesic efficacy. For example, they are often used for knee pain. There is little systemic\n      absorption of NSAIDs with topical administration, and consequently less likelihood of\n      systemic side effects.\n\n      Though much less studied than oral NSAIDs, topical NSAID preparations are currently\n      prescribed for a variety of arthritic and musculoskeletal types of pain. The best-studied\n      commercially available products are diclofenac 1% compounds. Higher concentrations\n      presumably provide higher tissue concentration leading to better and longer pain relief,\n      along with a more prominent anti-inflammatory effect.\n\n      The investigators will therefore compare the efficacy of available topical diclofenac 1% gel\n      to that of diclofenac 8% cream. Specifically, the investigators propose to test the\n      hypothesis that efficacy of topical diclofenac 8% exceeds that of diclofenac 1%, without any\n      increase in systemic toxicity.\n\n      One hundred six patients presenting to the Cleveland Clinic Pain Management Department for\n      the treatment of knee pain will be randomly assigned to topical diclofenac cream 8% or\n      diclofenac gel 1%, with the designated medication applied the symptomatic area of the knee\n      over 6 weeks. Investigators will be blinded to treatment, and will evaluate pain relief and\n      functional/disability status."
