Colony-stimulating factors such as filgrastim may increase the\n      number of immune cells found in bone marrow or peripheral blood and may help a person's\n      immune system recover from the side effects of chemotherapy.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy with\n      gemcitabine and docetaxel plus filgrastim in treating patients who have locally recurrent or\n      advanced urothelium cancer."

Determine the efficacy of gemcitabine, docetaxel, and filgrastim (G-CSF) in\n      patients with locally recurrent or advanced transitional cell carcinoma of the urothelial\n      tract. II. Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients. III. Determine the\n      disease-free and overall survival of this patient population treated with this regimen.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to prior\n      chemotherapy (yes vs no). Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8\n      and docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 8. Patients also receive filgrastim (G-CSF)\n      subcutaneously daily beginning on day 9 and continuing until blood counts recover. Treatment\n      continues every 3 weeks for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable\n      toxicity. Patients who respond to treatment may undergo surgery and 6-8 weeks later receive\n      2 more courses of chemotherapy. Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 23-40 patients who have not received prior chemotherapy and 23\n      patients who have received prior chemotherapy will be accrued for this study within 2 years."
