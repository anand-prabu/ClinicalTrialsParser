The safety\n      and tolerability of the two drugs, given together, will also be evaluated.  The study will\n      also look at blood cholesterol levels and levels of a hormone called cortisol before and\n      after taking rifampin.  Information about any side effects that may occur will also be\n      collected.\n\n      For each participant, this study will include 2 periods in fixed order. The study will last\n      approximately 29 days."
