Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor\n      cells. Giving chemotherapy drugs and radiation therapy before surgery may shrink the tumor\n      so that it can be removed during surgery.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy plus\n      radiation therapy given before surgery in treating patients who have stage I, stage II, or\n      stage III esophageal cancer."

Determine the total response rate in patients with stage I, II, or III\n      esophageal cancer treated with paclitaxel, carboplatin, and fluorouracil with concurrent\n      radiotherapy followed by surgical resection. II. Determine the overall survival of these\n      patients treated with this regimen. II. Determine the toxicity of this regimen in this\n      patient population.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour followed by carboplatin IV over 30\n      minutes on days 1 and 22, and fluorouracil IV continuously on days 1-42. Patients undergo\n      radiotherapy concurrently with chemotherapy daily 5 days a week for 5 weeks. Patients then\n      undergo surgical resection within 3-5 weeks following completion of therapy. Patients are\n      followed every 3 months for 6 months, every 6 months for 1 year, and then annually\n      thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 47 patients will be accrued for this study."
