We propose to recruit and consent SLE patients who will be\n      randomized to either receive the study drug, an over the counter fish oil supplement, or a\n      placebo that contains olive oil. They will have a baseline metabolomic profile (blood test),\n      nutritional assessment, fatigue severity scale, quality of life assessment, and\n      SELENA-SLEDAI lupus disease activity assessments completed at the time of study medication\n      distribution. Once 6 months of either the study drug or placebo is completed, then pill\n      counts, assessments of experience/adherence (including side-effects, adverse effects,\n      complaints, and un-blinding), and repeat nutritional assessment, fatigue severity scale,\n      SELENA-SLEDAI, and metabolomic profile will be assessed. The study duration for each patient\n      will be 6 months from initiation of the study drug.  It is hypothesized that patients\n      receiving the fish oil supplement will have improvement in their metabolomic profile.\n      Additionally it is hypothesized that patients receiving the fish oil supplement will have\n      improvement in disease activity, fatigue, and quality of life assessments."
