Experimental recombinant adenovirus-transfected DC, which engineered to express\n      MUC1 and Survivin are used for DC-based immunotherapy. Based on the results of our\n      previously performed preclinical study with DC vaccine combined with CIK cells, the\n      investigators plan to perform the clinical trial."
