  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed to determine the effect of Strain Counterstrain (SCS) on dynamic balance
      and subjective sense of instability in individuals with chronic ankle instability (CAI).
      Although many studies have been published on CAI, the cause for this common clinical
      dysfunction remains inconclusive.  No studies have assessed the effectiveness of SCS on CAI.
       Baseline information on all participants includes a demographic questionnaire, the Star
      Excursion Balance Test (SEBT), and the Foot and Ankle Ability Measure (FAAM).  Participants
      were randomized into the SCS intervention group or the sham SCS control group.  All
      participants received an intervention (as assigned) once a week for four weeks in addition
      to performing a prescribed home exercise program.  At week four all participants repeated
      the outcome measures and completed a Global Rating of Change (GROC) form.  The primary aim
      was examined with a 2-way analysis of variance (ANOVA).
