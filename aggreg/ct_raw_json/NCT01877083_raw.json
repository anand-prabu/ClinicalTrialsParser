At\n      least 20 subjects with KIF5B-RET will be treated and will receive lenvatinib at a starting\n      dose of 24 mg orally, once per day. Additional subjects with other RET translocations will\n      be treated with lenvatinib at a starting dose of 24 mg orally, once per day. The study will\n      consist of 3 phases: The Pretreatment Phase, The Treatment Phase and the Extension Phase.\n      The Pretreatment Phase will include screening procedures and eligibility assessments. The\n      Pretreatment Phase consists of a Screen 1, Screen 2 and Baseline Period. The Treatment Phase\n      will begin when the subject has met all eligibility criteria on Day 1 of the first Treatment\n      Cycle. The Treatment Phase contains the Treatment and Follow-up Periods. The Extension Phase\n      will begin for subjects who received treatment in the study (either in the Treatment Period\n      or Follow-up Period) at the time of database cutoff."

Subjects may have received up to three prior systemic anticancer treatment regimens\n             for adenocarcinoma of the lung (including adjuvant therapies and tyrosine-kinase\n             inhibitors [TKI]), unless discussed with the sponsor.\n\n          4. Subjects must have a clinically indicated need for systemic chemotherapy for\n             adenocarcinoma of the lung based on the investigator's assessment\n\n          5. Presence of measurable disease meeting the following criteria:\n\n               1. At least one lesion of at least 1.0 cm in the long-axis diameter for a non-lymph\n                  node or at least 1.5 cm in the short-axis diameter for a lymph node which is\n                  serially measurable according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors\n                  1.1 (RECIST 1.1) using either computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance\n                  imaging (MRI). If there is only one target lesion and it is a non-lymph node, it\n                  should have a longest diameter of at least 1.5 cm.\n\n               2. Lesions previously treated with radiotherapy or locoregional therapy must show\n                  radiographic evidence of disease progression to be deemed a target lesion.\n\n          6. Subjects with known brain metastases who have completed whole brain radiotherapy,\n             stereotactic radiosurgery, or complete surgical resection will be eligible if they\n             have remained clinically stable, asymptomatic and off of steroids for 28 days.\n\n          7. Adequate bone marrow function, defined as:\n\n               1.

Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alkaline\n                  phosphatase (ALP) less than or equal 3 x ULN (less than or equal 5 x ULN if\n                  subject has liver metastases). If alkaline phosphatase is greater than 3 x ULN\n                  (in absence of liver metastases) or greater than 5 x ULN (in presence of liver\n                  metastases) AND the subject also is known to have bone metastases, the\n                  liver-specific alkaline phosphatase must be separated from the total and used to\n                  assess the liver function instead of total alkaline phosphatase.\n\n          9. Adequate renal function, defined as calculated creatinine clearance greater than 40\n             mL/min per the Cockcroft and Gault formula.\n\n         10.

A separate baseline\n             assessment is required if a negative Screening pregnancy test was obtained more than\n             72 hours before the first dose of study drug.\n\n         15. All females will be considered to be of childbearing potential unless they are\n             postmenopausal (amenorrheic for at least 12 consecutive months, in the appropriate\n             age group and without other known or suspected cause) or have been sterilized\n             surgically (i.e., bilateral tubal ligation, total hysterectomy or bilateral\n             oophorectomy, all with surgery at least one month before dosing).\n\n         16. Females of childbearing potential must not have had unprotected sexual intercourse\n             within 30 days before study entry and must agree to use a highly effective method of\n             contraception (e.g., total abstinence, an intrauterine device, a double-barrier\n             method [such as condom plus diaphragm with spermicide], a contraceptive implant, an\n             oral contraceptive, or have a vasectomized partner with confirmed azoospermia)\n             throughout the entire study period and for 30 days after study drug discontinuation.\n             If currently abstinent, the subject must agree to use a double barrier method as\n             described above if she becomes sexually active during the study period or for 30 days\n             after study drug discontinuation. Females who are using hormonal contraceptives must\n             have been on a stable dose of the same hormonal contraceptive product for at least 4\n             weeks before dosing and must continue to use the same contraceptive during the study\n             and for 30 days after study drug discontinuation.\n\n         17. Male subjects must have had a successful vasectomy (confirmed azoospermia) or they\n             and their female partners must meet the criteria above (i.e., not of childbearing\n             potential or practicing highly effective contraception throughout the study period\n             and for 30 days after study drug discontinuation).

In Japan, only subjects who have archived tumor sample will be eligible for the\n             study. A fresh biopsy to obtain tumor sample for genetic screening is not permitted\n             for Japanese subjects.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          1. Subjects who have received any anticancer therapy (including surgery, locoregional,\n             biological, immunotherapy, hormonal, or radiotherapy) within 21 days before the first\n             dose of study drug (28 days for investigational therapies).\n\n          2. Leptomeningeal metastases or brain metastases except as for Inclusion Criterion #6.\n\n          3.

Active hemoptysis (bright red blood of at least 0.5 teaspoon) within 3 weeks before\n             the first dose of study drug.\n\n         10. Active infection (any infection requiring treatment).\n\n         11. Symptomatic central nervous system (CNS) disease.\n\n         12. Subjects having greater than 1+ proteinuria on urine dipstick testing will undergo\n             24-hour urine collection for quantitative assessment of proteinuria. Subjects with\n             urine protein greater than or equal to 1 g/24-hour will be ineligible.\n\n         13. Any medical or other condition that in the opinion of the investigator(s) would\n             preclude the subject?s participation in a clinical study or would preclude them from\n             completing the study.\n\n         14. Scheduled for surgery during the study."
