  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study has two purposes.  One is to determine if daily sulindac decreases breast
      density; a risk factor for breast cancer development.  The second is to determine whether
      sulindac reduces pain and stiffness associated with regular use of aromatase inhibitors
      given for the treatment of breast cancer.

      To accomplish our study aims, we will conduct a non-randomized phase II trial of AI alone as
      anastrozole in combination with sulindac in postmenopausal women with early stage ER+ breast
      cancer who are receiving an anastrozole as their adjuvant hormonal therapy. Recruitment will
      be limited to women on anastrozole to reduce heterogeneity introduced by other AIs.
      Anastrozole is selected as it is the only AI available in generic form and currently
      comprises almost 100% of our patient population.  Approximately 100 breast cancer patients,
      stable on AI therapy (minimum of 3 months) for the treatment of their breast cancer will
      receive sulindac 150 mg bid for 12 months.  Breast imaging will be conducted at baseline, 3,
      9 and 15 months.  A one-month run-in period followed by a 3-month observation, no agent
      period will be used to identify subjects likely not to adhere to the study regimen and to
      determine the extent of variability in breast density over time.

      The primary endpoint of the study will be change in the appearance of the contralateral,
      uninvolved breast as measured by quantitative Fat Water Ratio (FWR-MRI) mapping at 12 months
      in response to either control (anastrozole alone) or experimental (anastrozole + sulindac)
      therapy.  As changes in breast density in the contralateral, uninvolved breast will be the
      primary endpoint of the study, patients with bilateral breast cancer or those patients
      undergoing bilateral mastectomies or reconstruction surgery will be ineligible. Secondary
      endpoints of the trial include 12 month change between arms in diffusion weighted MRI
      (median ADC value) and general pain and joint specific stiffness and pain as assessed by the
      BPI-SF.  A number of exploratory endpoints are planned and include comparison of MRI
      measures of the breast, tissue biomarkers, and pain at 6 months as early indicators of 12
      month responses.  For the tissue biomarkers, core needle biopsies will be obtained in a
      subset of women who consent to the procedure from the uninvolved contralateral breast at
      baseline and at 6 months. This is anticipated to be ~75% at baseline (n=100) (provides
      tissue sample for cross sectional comparative analyses with MRI features at baseline) and
      ~25% at 6 month follow-up visit (n=37) (provides tissue to conduct analyses of biomarker
      response to intervention). Tissue studies will include characterization of tissue histology
      (graded by cellularity and stromal elements) and molecular measures of proliferation and
      apoptosis.
