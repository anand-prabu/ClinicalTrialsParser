On a\n      weekly basis, each participant was contacted by email or telephone and asked to submit their\n      computer gaming data to a trained vestibular physical therapist.  Following review of this\n      data, the physical therapist would contact the participant and progress their computer\n      gaming program appropriately.  At the completion of twelve weeks of home treatment, the\n      participants returned for re-assessment and it was determined that the computer gaming\n      program was an effective treatment for those with PVD.  It was also determined that a\n      monitored telerehabilitation program was an efficient and effective delivery method for this\n      treatment."

            "textblock": "A pre to post intervention case series study was carried out on ten participants diagnosed\n      with peripheral vestibular disorders (PVD).  Inclusion criteria consisted of: a) 20 to 70\n      year old, b) confirmed diagnosis of PVD on neuro-opthalmic, neuro-orthoptic,\n      electronystagmography and caloric testing; and use of a  home computer.  Exclusion criteria\n      consisted of those with migraine, central nervous system disorders (for example cerebral\n      vascular accident or Multiple Sclerosis), recent fractures of the spine or lower\n      extremities, inability to stand for 20 minutes continuously, or presence of dementia. It was\n      hypothesized that a home-based computer gaming treatment delivered in a monitored\n      telerehabilitation platform would be an effective treatment for those with PVD in that\n      increased gaze stability and improved balance would be observed post-treatment.  It was also\n      hypothesized that decreased dizziness would be reported post-treatment.  After initial\n      assessment (pre-treatment), three in-clinic sessions were given to each participant to\n      develop their specific home treatment computer program and ensure ability to use the program\n      effectively.  They were then started on their home program and monitored by a trained\n      vestibular physical therapist for a 12-week telerehabilitation program.  After the\n      completion of the 12-weeks, the participants returned for a post-treatment assessment."
