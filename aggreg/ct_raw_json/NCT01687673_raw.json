A randomized trial would be required to formally\n      compare the efficacy of this combination to sorafenib alone and will be indicated if this\n      phase II study achieves a median TTP of at least 6 months.  An interim safety analysis will\n      employ stopping rules after 30% of planned patients have been treated with at least one dose\n      of protocol therapy to ensure the combination does not confer excessive toxicity.\n\n      A key aspect of this study will be the requirement of histologic confirmation along with\n      adequate archival tissue for correlative tissue analyses to explore new biomarkers of\n      response to mTOR inhibition.  Circulating biomarker data including enumeration of\n      circulating tumor cells (CTC) and measurement of the tumor marker AFP will be performed at\n      specific timepoints to evaluate for predictive value.  Specimen banking of tissue, serum,\n      and peripheral blood mononuclear cells will be undertaken to enable future novel biomarker\n      studies.  Modified RECIST will be performed in addition to standard RECIST 1.1 to explore\n      for improved imaging predictors of response."

Informed consent may be\n             obtained with the assistance of a medical translator according to institutional\n             policies.\n\n         18. The effects of temsirolimus on the developing human fetus are unknown.  For this\n             reason and because sorafenib - also being used in this trial - is known to be\n             teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test\n             within 14 days of study enrollment.\n\n             Also, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use two methods adequate\n             contraception (hormonal plus barrier or two forms of barrier) or abstinence prior to\n             study entry and for the duration of study participation.  Should a woman become\n             pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this\n             study, she needs to inform her treating physician immediately.  Men treated or\n             enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the\n             study, or be surgically sterile, for the duration of study participation, and for 3\n             months after completion of study drug administration.\n\n         19. Eligibility of patients receiving any medications or substances known to affect or\n             with potential to affect the activity or pharmacokinetics of temsirolimus and/or\n             sorafenib will be determined following review of the case by the Study Chair.\n             Efforts should be made to switch patients who are taking enzyme-inducing\n             anti-convulsant agents to other medications.\n\n        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:\n\n          1. Mixed tumor histology or fibrolamellar variant tumors are excluded.\n\n          2. Prior systemic or antiangiogenic therapy for HCC (including thalidomide, sorafenib,\n             sunitinib, or bevacizumab).  Prior systemic therapy for other diagnoses is permitted\n             if greater than 6 months have elapsed since last dose, any prior toxicity has\n             recovered to \u2264 grade 1 by CTCAE v4.0, and treatment was not discontinued for\n             toxicity.\n\n          3. Prior treatment with mTOR inhibitor or other molecularly targeted therapy.\n\n          4. Prior systemic cytotoxic therapies for HCC (chemoembolization is permitted if\n             inclusion criteria are met).\n\n          5. Treatment with other investigational agents.\n\n          6. Immunosuppressive medications including systemic corticosteroids unless used for\n             adrenal replacement, appetite stimulation, acute therapy for asthma or bronchitis\n             exacerbation (\u2264 2 weeks), or antiemesis\n\n          7. Patients with known HIV infection are ineligible due to risk of pharmacokinetic\n             interactions between anti-retroviral therapy and the study drugs, as well as\n             potential for significant immunosuppression and serious infections with mTOR\n             inhibition.\n\n          8. Patients who have undergone liver transplantation are excluded.\n\n          9. Uncontrolled hypertension (> 150/90 mmHg).\n\n         10. Uncontrolled hyperlipidemia (total cholesterol > 350 or triglycerides > 300).\n\n         11. Symptomatic brain or bone metastases; prior radiation and/or steroid therapy for\n             brain or bone metastases (if applicable) must be completed \u2265 2 weeks prior to study\n             enrollment.\n\n         12. History of seizure disorder requiring antiepileptic medication or brain metastases\n             with seizures.\n\n         13. Serious non-healing wound, ulcer, bone fracture, or abscess.\n\n         14. Major surgical procedure less than 4 weeks from start of protocol treatment.\n\n         15. Patients requiring chronic anticoagulation with warfarin are excluded. Patients\n             treated with low molecular weight heparin or unfractionated heparin are eligible if\n             on a stable dose without evidence of clinically significant bleeding for at least 2\n             weeks prior to enrollment.\n\n         16. Active second malignancy other than non-melanoma skin cancer or cervical carcinoma in\n             situ.  (Patients with history of malignancy are not considered to have a \"currently\n             active\" malignancy if they have completed therapy and are now considered by their\n             physician to be at less than 30% risk for relapse.)\n\n         17. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to: Ongoing or active\n             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris,\n             uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia, uncontrolled peripheral vascular disease, myocardial\n             infarction within preceding 12 months, cerebrovascular accident within preceding 12\n             months, pulmonary disease impairing functional status or requiring oxygen, impairment\n             in gastrointestinal function that may affect or alter absorption of oral medications\n             (such as malabsorption or history of gastrectomy or bowel resection).\n\n         18. Patients will be excluded if there is any history of allergic reaction(s) attributed\n             to compounds of similar composition to temsirolimus, sorafenib, their metabolites, or\n             any component of their formulation (including excipients and polysorbate 80).  This\n             includes hypersensitivity to macrolide antibiotics due to potential for\n             cross-reactivity with temsirolimus.\n\n         19. Pregnant or lactating women are excluded from this study because temsirolimus and\n             sorafenib are drugs with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects.\n             Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants\n             secondary to treatment of the mother with temsirolimus or sorafenib, breastfeeding\n             should be discontinued if the mother is receiving temsirolimus/sorafenib treatment.\n\n         20. Patients who require prohibited medications with potential for serious interactions\n             with protocol therapy, and who cannot have therapeutic substitution are excluded.\n             Patients receiving any medications or substances that are inhibitors or inducers of\n             CYP450 enzyme(s) are ineligible.  Lists of prohibited medications and substances\n             known, or with the potential to interact with the specified CYP450 enzyme(s)\n             isoenzymes are provided in Appendices 6-9 Prohibited Medications\n\n         21. Psychiatric illness, other significant medical illness, or social situation which, in\n             the investigator's opinion, would limit compliance or ability to comply with study\n             requirements."
