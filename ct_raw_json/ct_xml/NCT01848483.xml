  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this project is to implement and test the efficacy of an enhanced
      comprehensive multidisciplinary early palliative care package that includes four
      motivational interviewing sessions (EPC) for persons newly diagnosed with AIDS. We posit
      that the innovative EPC will improve quality of life, clinical and psychosocial outcomes and
      advance care planning in a cost effective manner and could promote engagement and retention
      in HIV care. If successful, it could serve as a model of early palliative care for persons
      with AIDS in the US.

      The overall goal of this project is to improve the health and quality of life of persons
      living with HIV/AIDS (PLWH). To this end, we will implement an innovative model of enhanced
      early integrative palliative care services (EPC) for persons newly diagnosed with AIDS.
      Patients will be recruited from either the inpatient service or outpatient infectious
      disease program (IDP) at the Grady Health System (GHS) in Atlanta, Georgia. The AIDS EPC
      Package includes use of motivational interviewing (MI) to facilitate adjustment to disease
      and advance care planning decision making. The project has three specific aims:

      AIM 1. Conduct a research clinical trial (RCT) to examine the efficacy of the AIDS EPC
      Package intervention vs. standard HIV care (SOC) and compare outcomes at 12 months post
      baseline. Our hypothesis is that those in the AIDS EPC group will have:

      i. Better clinical outcomes: a lower one year mortality, higher proportion who initiate
      antiretroviral therapy (ART), higher proportion with virologic suppression, higher CD4 gain,
      fewer opportunistic infections (OI), fewer hospitalizations, lower depression scores, and
      better symptom management (including cognitive dysfunction).

      ii. Better psychosocial outcomes:  Better coping skills, higher perceived social support,
      higher spirituality, higher levels of self-advocacy, lower proportion who report substance
      use.

      iii. Better Quality of Life (QOL) and a higher proportion who report advance care planning
      activities: named a surrogate; set personal goals regarding life saving measures; and
      discussed these goals with a surrogate.

      SECONDARY OUTCOMES:

      AIM 2. Evaluate the cost effectiveness and cost utility of the AIDS EPC Package compared to
      SOC where the   outcomes are valued as survival and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs)
      respectively.

      AIM 3.  Promote engagement and retention in HIV care as evidenced by attending a greater
      proportion of scheduled appointments and reporting higher satisfaction with care compared to
      SOC.

    <description>Change in clinical indicators: a lower one year mortality, higher proportion who initiate antiretroviral therapy (ART), higher proportion with virologic suppression, higher CD4 gain, fewer opportunistic infections (OI), fewer hospitalizations, all as measured by medical record review. Lower depression scores will be assessed using Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). Symptom management will be assessed using the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS). Cognitive dysfunction will be measured using Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS).</description>

    <description>Change in engagement and retention in HIV care will be measured by recording appointments for HIV care and study appointment and whether these were kept, cancelled, rescheduled, or not kept. These data are available from the electronic medical record and study tracking records. The Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire (PSQ-18) will be used to document satisfaction with health care.</description>

    <description>In the first MI session, the nurse will set the agenda and ask the participant to discuss any adjustments to the AIDS diagnosis. The next three sessions, the participant will be asked to set the agenda related to current concerns. In the third and fourth sessions, the nurse will also introduce advance care planning. The standardized AIDS EPC Package consultation will last approximately 30 minutes in the following order: 1) Chaplain: introduces the concept of EPC clinic and conducts a spiritual evaluation/intervention as needed. 2) Social worker: conducts an evaluation/intervention as needed. 3) Psychologist: conducts an evaluation and intervention as needed. 4) Palliative Care Physician: conducts symptom management, medication reconciliation and coordination of care.</description>

    <description>The routine standard of care provider visit occurs in the following order. The vital signs are taken and the participant sees the nurse to review medications. The provider visits are scheduled for approximately 30 minutes, except for a new patient or patient with complex medical needs. The provider conducts a history to elicit symptoms, health problems, concerns, and a physical exam, then orders labs or immunizations; and referrals to subspecialty clinics. Medications are prescribed or renewed. The patient then receives a follow-up appointment, typically every 3 months for a stable patient. If the patient starts ART, an appointment to the nurse educator is required. Typically, the patient will have 1- 2 visits to the nurse educator to begin medications and follow-up for side-effects.</description>
