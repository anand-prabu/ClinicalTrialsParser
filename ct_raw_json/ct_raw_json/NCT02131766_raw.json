The subject will be permitted to leave the research house if blood glucose value is between 80-249 mg/dL.

This protocol will test\n      the feasibility of \"bedside\" closed-loop control - an approach comprised of standard\n      sensor-augmented pump therapy during the day using off-the-shelf devices and overnight\n      closed-loop control using experimental devices in an outpatient setting. The rationale for\n      this study is as follows: we anticipate that closed-loop control may ultimately be adopted\n      by patients with T1DM in a selective manner. Patient may choose to start using these systems\n      for overnight control only, e.g. to alleviate the well documented fear of hypoglycemia while\n      asleep. To test this paradigm of \"bedside\" closed-loop control, subjects will be studied\n      with continuous glucose monitoring (CGM)-augmented usual pump therapy during the day\n      followed by overnight use of USS Virginia Closed Loop Control."
