The first secondary\n      aim is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the chemotherapy of FOLFOXIRI plus\n      Cetuximab targeted therapy regimen in this patient population.\n\n      Secondary aims include determination of objective response rate, progression free survival,\n      quality of life and time to recurrence for patients undergoing complete resection and/or\n      ablation of liver."
