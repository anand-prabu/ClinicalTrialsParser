            "textblock": "In Sierra Leone, a dangerous gap remains between long-term psychosocial needs and adequate\n      services. As youth affected by the war begin to enter adulthood, they face new challenges\n      including unemployment, interrupted education, the need to support families, marginalization\n      and stigma, as well as the remaining psychological effects of exposure to war. Healthy\n      social integration is critical to the long-term wellbeing of this generation, but the\n      evidence base on effective interventions to improve skills and self-efficacy is severely\n      limited. Despite the high burden of mental health problems among war-affected youth in\n      Sub-Saharan Africa, few empirically-supported behavioral treatments (ESBTs) or\n      evidence-based interventions have been implemented in this region. This study stands to make\n      an important contribution to knowledge on effective and culturally-sensitive mental health\n      services that can be implemented in settings fraught by multiple hardships, including war,\n      poverty, low educational attainment, and other hardships.\n\n      This randomized study of 416 school-intending youth age 15-24 will use a parallel design to\n      examine the potential benefits of enrolling in a psychosocial intervention--the YRI--prior\n      to enrolling in an educational program. Assessments will be performed pre-/post-intervention\n      and at 6-month and 12-month follow-ups. These long-term evaluations will examine whether\n      benefits are sustained, accrue, or depreciate over time. Data will improve understanding of\n      how a psychosocial-education intervention translates to economic outcomes like employment,\n      as compared to an education-only intervention.\n\n      The YRI is an evidence-based group intervention developed in 2010 to address key emotional,\n      behavioral, and functioning difficulties identified by the PI's prior longitudinal study of\n      war-affected youth. It is designed to reduce symptoms of internalizing, externalizing,\n      trauma-related symptoms, and improve prosocial skills and functioning among war-affected\n      15-24 year olds. The YRI has three overarching goals: (1) To improve interpersonal and\n      community relationships through work with youth and community members; (2) To help\n      vulnerable youth develop skills in emotional regulation, problem-solving, and interpersonal\n      interactions necessary to be successful members of their communities; (3) To promote the\n      healthy integration of difficult memories for youth who experience difficulties due to\n      traumatic exposure. Primary mental health outcomes include decreased anxiety, hostility, and\n      depression, and increased pro-social attitudes, as measured by the Oxford Refugee Studies\n      Psychosocial Adjustment Scale and the African Youth Psychosocial Assessment.\n\n      EducAid is a charitable trust established in 1994. Devoted to promoting education among\n      underprivileged and war-affected young people in Sierra Leone through holistic and academic\n      learning, EducAid provides free year-round education to over 1,500 youth, along with food,\n      medicine, and shelter when needed. EducAid has a keen interest in exploring how psychosocial\n      interventions can promote academic, social, and emotional well-being in students. EducAid's\n      education model aims to improve academic knowledge, self-efficacy, and attitudes toward\n      school. Additionally, it aims to nurture hope for the future and a sense of normalcy through\n      interactions with teachers, mentors, and peers. Following participation in the education\n      component, participants' employment and economic activity will be assessed using\n      standardized instruments for cross-cultural work, including the World Bank Living Standards\n      Surveys."
