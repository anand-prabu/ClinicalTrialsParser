            "textblock": "PSMA expression has been demonstrated in the tumor neovasculature of Glioblastoma Multiforme\n      (GBM) by immunohistochemical staining.  Strong reactivity to the antibody component of PSMA\n      ADC was observed in the endothelial cells of new tumor blood vessels in GBM. Since the\n      endothelial cells are located on the luminal surface of blood vessels, PSMA ADC does not\n      need to cross the blood brain barrier to reach its target.  Following binding and\n      internalization of PSMA ADC, the cytotoxic component of PSMA ADC will be released and\n      destroy the neovasculature that supports tumor growth.  Therefore, PSMA ADC may be an active\n      treatment for GBM.\n\n      Bevacizumab, an inhibitor of angiogenesis, has been shown to be effective in improving\n      progression-free survival as a single agent.  Thus PSMA ADC, which targets tumor\n      angiogenesis by a mechanism different from that of bevacizumab, may be a novel therapeutic\n      modality for GBM.\n\n      A phase 2 study of PSMA ADC is proposed for patients with GBM that have progressed after\n      standard treatment that includes radiation, temozolomide and bevacizumab. A phase 1 study of\n      PSMA ADC in prostate cancer is ongoing and a phase 2 dose level of 2.5 mg/kg IV every 3\n      weeks has been defined. Treatment after bevacizumab failure for patients with GBM is a major\n      unmet medical need. If activity were demonstrated in this trial, a definitive randomized\n      study would be proposed."
