Since January 2012, the Neurology Department of CHU Rennes is the\n      first clinical service in France equipped with such a system.\n\n      Applied to HR-EEG recordings, brain connectivity methods are likely to provide essential\n      information (in the form of \"connectivity graphs\") on cortical networks, either\n      dysfunctional or not, involved in the generation of interictal paroxysms (like spikes or\n      spike-waves) and during seizures.\n\n      So far, many methods have been proposed (see for a review: Wendling et al., 2009; Wendling\n      et al., 2010). However, since each method is highly sensitive to the type of model that is\n      assumed for the underlying relationship between distinct brain regions (Ansari-Asl et al.,\n      2006), none of them has yet demonstrated its effectiveness."
