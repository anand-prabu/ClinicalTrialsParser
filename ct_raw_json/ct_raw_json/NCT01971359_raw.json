Potential subjects will be identified by the study team which will include\n      all investigators and study coordinators. For those patients who have had the Mi Space\n      procedure, the study team will obtain the patients or patient's surrogate consent for\n      clinical data of hospitalization and follow ups. A secured, de-identified log will be kept\n      of all patients screened, and reasons for exclusion will be documented. Around 65% of\n      unselected patients with ICH (not stratified by baseline predicted risk) have a documented\n      30 day composite outcome of death or dependency under medical management. Reviews of other\n      types of minimally-invasive ICH surgeries provides data that significantly improved outcomes\n      (meta-analysis odds ratio 0.54(0.39, 0.76)). An odds ratio of 0.54 shows a reduction in risk\n      from 65% to about 50% (15% absolute reduction). Assuming the new procedure is at least as\n      effective than current conventional management, 50 patients provides 66% surety that a 95%\n      1-sided confidence interval will exclude the chance that the new procedure is worse than\n      medical management. Alternatively, a method of framing this, based on an exact one-sided\n      binomial test of a one-sample proportion and an alpha level of 5%, is that a sample size of\n      50 patients provides approximately 66% surety/power that the new procedure is superior to\n      medical management (i.e., lower than 65% suffering from death or poor functional outcomes).\n      The critical computed value for this particular test, to provide some initial evidence of\n      superiority, are observing no more than 26 patients (out of 50) suffering from death or\n      dependency under the surgical procedure."
