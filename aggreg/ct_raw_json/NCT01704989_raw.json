            "textblock": "A number of large clinical trials have found pseudoexfoliation (PXF) to be a major risk\n      factor for glaucoma progression and risk of blindness. It is estimated that PXF accounts for\n      approximately a quarter of cases of open angle glaucoma in Nova Scotia, Canada, making this\n      region an ideal setting for studying patients with this condition. Despite associated high\n      morbidity, the treatment of pseudoexfoliative glaucoma remains suboptimal and a challenge\n      for the clinician. Topical medical therapy is less effective than for primary open angle\n      glaucoma and patients often require early surgical therapy, with associated risks. Selective\n      laser trabeculoplasty (SLT) may be a safe and effective treatment for pseudoexfoliative\n      glaucoma, although the evidence for this is presently lacking. The aim of the current study\n      is to provide the first controlled-trial evidence for the effectiveness of SLT, compared to\n      topical therapy, in the management of pseudoexfoliative glaucoma."

            "textblock": "Objectives:\n\n      The primary aim of this study is to compare the effectiveness, in terms of intraocular\n      pressure (IOP) control, of SLT and topical medical therapy in the primary treatment of\n      patients with high IOP secondary to PXF. The secondary aims of the study are:\n\n        1. To examine the relationship between the degree of angle pigmentation and reduction of\n           IOP\n\n        2. To examine adverse effects from SLT treatment in patients with PXF\n\n        3. To compare IOP-lowering effects of SLT in patients with PXF to patients with POAG (in\n           the LiGHT study, see structure below).\n\n      Study Population: All new patients with PXF who are na\u00efve to treatment (and willing to\n      participate) will be recruited after their first hospital consultation. Both eyes will be\n      treated but only one eye per patient included in the analysis (eye with the higher\n      presenting IOP).\n\n      Structure: The study design mirrors that of National Institute of Health (NIHR-) funded, the\n      laser in glaucoma and ocular hypertension trial (LiGHT) in the UK and is a collaborative\n      study between a Canadian Institute and Moorfields Eye Hospital in London. This is a\n      single-study randomised (unmasked) control trial of a proposed treatment intervention (SLT)\n      versus a standard treatment (topical therapy).\n\n      Summary of study design Patients will be randomised to one of 2 trial arms: 'laser-pathway'\n      or 'medicine- pathway'. Following initial treatment, SLT patients will be followed up 1-2\n      weeks after treatment to check IOP and for potential side effects. The interval of\n      subsequent follow-up visits (between 4 and 12 months) will be governed by the level of IOP\n      in relation to the target IOP and the severity of glaucoma. Visual field testing (SITA\n      standard, 24-2 test pattern) and imaging with the Hedidelberg Retina Tomograph (HRT III)\n      will be performed at each visit. Target IOP will be set using the Canadian Glaucoma Society\n      guidelines depending on the severity of glaucoma and the level of IOP. At subsequent visits,\n      treatment will be escalated if the target IOP is not met or if there is evidence of\n      progression.\n\n      Duration of study The study will last 3 years. One year will be allowed for recruitment of\n      all study participants, so that a minimum follow-up of 2 years will be available.\n\n      All patients will have a medical history, gonioscopy, central corneal thickness (CCT)\n      measurement, IOP measurement with Goldmann applanation tonometry and dilated fundoscopy at\n      the baseline visit."
