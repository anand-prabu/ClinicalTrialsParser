            "textblock": "Patient-Centered Trauma Treatment, i.e., treatment delivered by peers with lived-experience,\n      has the potential to increase access to trauma treatment in underserved communities. This\n      could positively impact the lives of millions of people as 70% of adults in the U.S have\n      experienced a traumatic event and the consequences of trauma are devastating and far\n      reaching, including chronic and comorbid physical and mental health problems. The most known\n      consequences of trauma include post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and substance use\n      disorders (SUDs). Seeking Safety (SS) is the most effective evidenced-based treatment for\n      co-occurring trauma, PTSD and SUDs. While no specific degree or experience level is required\n      to conduct SS, all the evidence comes from studies using trained clinicians to implement the\n      treatment, including social workers, psychologists, and psychiatrists. However, these\n      research findings do not generalize to underserved communities that lack mental health\n      professionals.  Innovative approaches to treatment, such as peer-delivered services, are\n      required to meet the demand for care in underserved areas. While the benefits of\n      peer-delivered services have been well-documented in many areas, the value of peers in the\n      provision of trauma-treatment is unknown. A theoretical basis supports the potential for\n      peer-delivered trauma-treatment to be effective in addition to the strong therapist-patient\n      bond, (i.e. therapeutic alliance (TA), which is an important predictor of treatment outcome\n      and a typical result of peer-patient relationships.\n\n      Our research question is whether there is a difference between peer-led SS (PL-SS) groups\n      and clinician-led SS (CL-SS) groups in improving the lives of people with trauma, PTSD and\n      SUDs?\n\n      The investigators have three specific aims:\n\n        1. Determine the effectiveness of PL-SS groups compared to CL-SS groups in decreasing\n           substance use and PTSD symptoms and improving coping skills, overall mental health and\n           physical health. Hypothesis:  PL-SS compared to CL-SS groups will be as effective in\n           improving outcomes.\n\n        2. Compare levels of TA among PL-SS and CL-SS groups and examine the impact of TA on\n           outcomes.Hypotheses:  Levels of TA will be higher and will play more of a role in\n           impacting outcomes in the PL-SS compared to CL-SS groups.\n\n        3. Determine if the standard Seeking Safety Instructor Training (SS-IT) is adequate for\n           peers. Hypothesis: Peers will identify topics that will enhance the SS-IT."
