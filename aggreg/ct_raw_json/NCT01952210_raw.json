These treatments frequently cause\n      or exacerbate poor nutritional status. Recent literature has proved that malnutrition is\n      associated with longer hospital stays, reduced responses to and increased complications from\n      therapies, increased costs, worse quality of life and lower survival rate. The aim of this\n      study was to investigate the effectiveness of an intensive nutritional consultation and\n      exercise program on nutritional status and outcomes in patients undergoing chemoradiation\n      for esophageal cancer."
