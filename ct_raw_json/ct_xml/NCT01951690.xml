  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, open-label, multicenter, multi cohort, study of VS-6063 (defactinib), a
      focal adhesion kinase inhibitor, in patients with KRAS mutant non-small cell lung cancer
      (NSCLC).  NSCLC with a KRAS mutation is required for study entry and subjects will be
      enrolled into 1 of 4 cohorts based on the status of their INK4a/Arf and p53 mutations. The
      purpose of this study is to demonstrate if VS-6063 (defactinib) improves PFS within each
      cohort.  The safety and tolerability of VS-6063, tumor response rate, progression free
      survival and overall survival will also be assessed.  The pharmacodynamic effects of VS-6063
      (defactinib) will be examined in a tumor biopsy and a blood sample.

      Eleven subjects will be enrolled into one of four cohorts: Cohort A (KRAS mutation, wild
      type INK4a/ARF and wildtype p53), Cohort B (KRAS mutation, INK4s/ARF mutation and wild type
      p53), Cohort C (KRAS mutation, wild type INK4a/ARF and p53 mutation), and Cohort D (KRAS
      mutation, INK4a/ARF mutation and p53 mutation).  If &gt;/= 4 patients demonstrate PFS at 12
      weeks in each cohort, an additional 23 subjects will be enrolled.

    <description>Adverse events (AEs) include the incidences of all treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) and all Serious Adverse Events (SAEs); by severity, relationship to study drug, and discontinuation of patients from study therapy due to AEs and due to deaths.

             bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN.

          -  Leptomeningeal metastasis.

          -  Symptomatic or untreated brain metastases or spinal cord compression or any of these
             conditions requiring chronic steroids to control symptoms.

          -  History or evidence of cardiac risk

          -  Known history of malignant hypertension (severe hypertension &gt;180/120 mmHg with end
