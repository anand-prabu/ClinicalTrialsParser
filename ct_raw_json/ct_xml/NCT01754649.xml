  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess the usefulnes sof misoprostol versus placebo (in a double-blind placebo controlled
      randomized clinical trial)to facilitate the insertion of copper-IUD and the
      levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) in cases of failure due to cervical
      stenosis in either nulligravidas and parous women. Additionally to evaluate the side-effects
      of the misoprostol. The hypothesis is that misoprostol may be better than placebo.

      Women attended at the Family Planning clinic of the University of Campinas who requested the
      insertion of a copper-IUD or an LNG-IUS and who failed in the attempt due to cervical
      stenosis will be randomized in two groups (1:1). The study group will receive two doses of
      misoprostol (200mcg each tablet) vaginal 12 and 4 hours prior insertion and the control
      group will receive placebo in the same schedule. The sample will be 50 women in each group.
      After 24 hours of the insertion failure the women will return to the clinic and a new
      attempt of insertion will be done. At this time we will evaluate if the insertion was able
      to do or not. The data will be analyzing with Ï‡2 test for independent samples. After that a
      multiple logistic analysis will be perform to evaluate the associated variables with the
      result (failure or successful) insertion. The level of significance will be established at
      P&lt;.005.
