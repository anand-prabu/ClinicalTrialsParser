There seems to be\n      no reduction in the complications of the CAG or PCI by maintaining the bed rest for more\n      than 2 hours after the procedure.

There is less discomfort associated with early compared with late mobilization.\n      Protamine reverse heparin's effect without the side effects of that regime.\n\n      There lacks a larger randomized study of the safety of mobilizing patients immediately after\n      CAG and after PCI."
