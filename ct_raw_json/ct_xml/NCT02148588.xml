  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prospective, open-label study in 10 patients with Central Post Stroke Pain (CPSP). The study
      will evaluate the effects of peripheral nerve blockade on spontaneous pain and evoked
      thermal and mechanical responses in CPSP, and assesses the associated local anesthetic
      pharmacokinetics.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Each subject must meet all of the following criteria:

          -  Age ≥18;

          -  CPSP affecting an upper or a lower limb, in a distribution that may be completely
             covered by a peripheral nerve block;

          -  Patient fulfills all mandatory criteria for CPSP, fulfills at least one supportive
             criteria, and has definite CPSP by probability grading.

          -  Pain duration at least 3 months;

          -  Spontaneous pain intensity (average pain in past week) of ≥ 4 on 0-10 Numerical
             Rating Scale (NRS).

        Exclusion Criteria

        Subjects will not be enrolled if any of the following criteria exist:

          -  Not giving consent to participate in the study;

          -  Significant psychiatric or cognitive impairment;

          -  Moderate to severe renal or liver failure;

          -  Concomitant treatment with warfarin or other anticoagulants;

          -  Pregnancy or lactation.
