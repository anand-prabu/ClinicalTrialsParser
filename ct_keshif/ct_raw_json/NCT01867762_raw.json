The\n      study consists of 3 phases: screening (3 weeks), double-blind treatment (12 weeks), and\n      follow up (4 weeks). Safety evaluations will include assessment of adverse events, vital\n      signs, physical examination, electrocardiograms, and clinical laboratory tests which will be\n      monitored throughout the study.
