Treatment repeats every 21 days for\n      up to 18 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients\n      achieving a complete response (CR) receive up to 4 additional courses of treatment beyond\n      CR.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 19-55 patients will be accrued for this study within 6 months."
