      The proposed study is to validate a new non-invasive imaging technique for evaluation of
      cardiac microciculation in coronary artery disease with a comparison with validated
      technique invasive, which is measure of index of myocardial resistance.

    <textblock>
      Coronary microvascular dysfunction is closely associated with coronary artery disease, it is
      an independent risk factor and predicts future coronary events or clinically manifest
      disease up to 10 years later.

      Index of microcirculatory resistance (IMR) is a validated method to Assessment of the
      Coronary Microcirculation but this is an invasive technique.

      In this study, we use a new mathematic technique from homogeneity analysis to provide
      precise, objective, automated quantification of perfusion heterogeneity at stress with new
      camera CZT SPECT.  We compare the results with those of the measurement of IMR.

    <description>IMR was measured with commercially available software (St Jude Medical Systems) and thermodilution technique on a non-ischemic artery SPECT. Injections of 3 mL of room-temperature saline were made down the coronary artery, and the resting mean transit time (Tmn) was measured. CFR was calculated as resting Tmn divided by hyperemic Tmn. FFR was calculated by the ratio of Pd/Pa at maximal hyperemia.IMR was defined as distal coronary pressure multiplied by the hyperemic mean transit time (mm Hg • seconds, or units [U]). Myocardial Heterogeneity Index (Hi) was measured by an automated analysis developed in our research unit. Hi was finally calculated from images SPECT using a Markovian analysis. For this study Hi is given by the equation: Hi = Σm [1/(1+m)2]Pd(m).</description>

    <description>An FFR value of 0.80 or less identifies ischemia-causing coronary stenoses. The global summed stress score (SSS) was calculated by adding the scores of the 17 segments in the stress and rest images, respectively. Scans were considered as normal when SSS was &lt; 4.</description>
