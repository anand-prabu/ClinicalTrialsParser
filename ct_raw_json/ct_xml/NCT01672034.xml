    <textblock>
      The purpose with this study is to investigate whether gastric bypass surgery and the
      following weight reduction impact the tone in esophageal sphincters and the esophageal
      function.

      In a previous study our group used high resolution solid-state manometry to investigate the
      pressure in the esophagus and esophageal sphincters in obese patients going through
      laparoscopic bariatric surgery. These studies showed that the barrier pressure between the
      stomach and esophagus is significantly lower in obese compared to lean patients. In this
      study the investigators will examine these patients once more, now after weight reduction to
      see whether the barrier pressure is back to normal compared to lean patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of obesity has increased dramatically in recent decades. The gastrointestinal
      changes associated with obesity have clinical significance for the anesthesiologist in the
      perioperative period. The upper and lower esophageal sphincters (UES and LES) play a central
      role in preventing regurgitation and aspiration. The barrier pressure, defined as the
      difference between the LES pressure and the Intragastric pressure is known to be lower in
      obese patients compared to lean patients. This might result in a higher risk of
      regurgitation and aspiration of stomach contents in during induction of anesthesia.

      Some studies are made on patients before and after bariatric surgery but results are sparse.
      In this study the investigators will examine 30 patients before and after bariatric surgery.
      Our group have performed the measurements on patients before surgery and presented the
      results in another article. Those patients will be asked to take part of another measurement
      now 12-18 months after surgery.

      30 patients will be consecutively asked and enrolled in this study. Measurements will be
      performed using high-resolution-solid state manometry.
