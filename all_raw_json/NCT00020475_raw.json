Determine the clinical benefit of interleukin-2 in combination with this vaccine in\n      these patients.\n\n      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Patients receive vaccine subcutaneously once weekly.  Treatment repeats\n      every 4 weeks for a total of 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable\n      toxicity.\n\n      Patients with progressive disease may receive vaccine SC on day 1 followed by interleukin-2\n      IV over 15 minutes every 8 hours for a maximum of 12 doses. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks\n      for at least 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL:\n\n      A total of 15-25 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year."
