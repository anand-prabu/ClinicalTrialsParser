Subjects: Chronic HIV infected patients.\n      Sample size: 44 cases. They\u00b4ll be divided in 2 groups: (1) Patients with CD4 +> 400 cells /\n      ml and undetectable viral load for more than two years (22 cases) and (2) Patients with\n      immunodiscordancy, defined as patients with CD4 + T cells lower than 350 cells / ml despite\n      4-7 years of effective antiretroviral therapy. (22 cases). Intervention: Patients were\n      randomized in 2 subgroups: (A) they\u00b4ll receive daily oral supplementation with S. boulardii\n      for 3 months and (B) they \u00b4ll receive placebo. Variables: bacterial lipopolisaccharide\n      levels measured by the Lipid-Binding protein (LBP), parameters of immune activation in\n      plasma (soluble CD14, IFN-\u03a5, TNF-Alpha, IL (interleukine)-2, IL-5, IL-6, IL-12)and gut\n      microbiota composition prior to the use of probiotics (baseline), at 3 and 6 months.\n      Immunological and clinical data. Outcome measures: quantification of bacterial translocation\n      levels, markers of activity and immune recovery. Analysis: Comparison of variables before\n      and after the intervention. The analysis will be performed by biological and immunological\n      effectiveness."
