The study will also\n      investigate the mean rate of change in the ALSFRS-R total score as an exploratory endpoint\n      to help design future studies.\n\n      This study will enroll up to 40 patients and include an optional 28-week open-label\n      extension period plus a 3-week treatment taper and 1-week follow up period.  After\n      completion of Week 8, patients enrolled in a treatment group that is considered safe and\n      tolerable at that time have the option to continue into the open-label extension period.  A\n      3-week treatment taper and a follow-up visit are planned for all patients enrolled in the\n      study, beginning either at Week 8 or at Week 36 if a patient continues into the optional\n      open-label extension period."
