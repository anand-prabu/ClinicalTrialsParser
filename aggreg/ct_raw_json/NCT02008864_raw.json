It affect up to 90 percent of patients with end stage\n      renal disease. Several hypotheses have been postulated for the possible underlying etiology,\n      but none is conclusive. Aside from kidney transplantation, which is only definitive\n      treatment, therapeutic approaches have largely been empirical, and no firm evident\u2010base\n      treatments are available. The main goal of therapy remains to minimize severity of pruritus.\n      In Iranian traditional medicine Cassia senna L. is used for healing uremic pruritus . In\n      this study investigators considered to evaluate effect of Cassia senna L. in uremic pruritus\n      by a double blind placebo control clinical trial. It is hypothesized that oral Cassia senna\n      L. may attenuate uremic pruritus by decreasing serum IL\u20102, IFN-\u03b3 and TNF\u2010\u03b1."
