A Study of Population. In the first part of this project the aim is to evaluate the\n           occurrence of asthmatic and  allergic diseases among women with respectively normal\n           fertility and infertility. This is done through data already collected in The Danish\n           twin Study from 1998- 2002 concerning questions about asthma, hay fever, atopic eczema\n           and number of children.\n\n        2. A Prospective Study In the second part of this project the aim is to examine\n           clinically, whether female asthmatics in general have more difficulties becoming\n           pregnant then non- asthmatic females. Furthermore we aim to evaluate whether it is\n           allergic or non allergic asthma that affects the fertility the most.\n\n        3. Casual study In the third part of this project we only include 40 of the unexplained\n           infertile  females collected earlier- 10 females with asthma, 10 females with allergy,\n           10 females with both asthma and allergy, 10 without any atopic disease.These women\n           have, in addition to the initial asthma and allergy diagnosis, made a suction of the\n           mucus in the uterus, when they are ovulating. This in order to determine whether the\n           environment in the uterus is different in terms of inflammation in atopics. The aim of\n           this study is to find an explanation for a possible decreased pregnancy rate and a\n           longer time to pregnancy in atopics.\n\n      Material :\n\n      396 unexplained infertile females are included, when starting treatment at a fertility\n      clinic. Among these are 197 healthy unexplained infertile females and 197 are females with\n      the combination asthma and unexplained infertility. They are all included due to specific\n      inclusion and exclusion criteria.\n\n      Methods:\n\n      All subjects are by inclusion tested for asthma with bronchial provocation tests. The\n      pulmonary function is measured and the severity of their possible asthma is examined by NO\n      in the expired air.  Blood samples (RAS test) and prick test are performed to evaluate their\n      possible allergy status. All subjects are to fill out questionnaires concerning asthma,\n      allergy and their infertility. Due to the test mentioned above the subjects are divided in\n      to groups, asthmatic , allergics, atopics and  non- atopics.\n\n      The female asthmatics are treated due to the international guidelines. All groups are\n      followed till achieved pregnancy; where after time to pregnancy can be compared.\u00a8\n\n      In the third part of the study a suction of the mucus in the uterus is made at time of\n      ovulation, to determinate the level of inflammation in atopics versus non atopics at time of\n      fertilization.The mucus is examined fore inflammatory markers related to atopy such as TNF\n      alpha, IL4,5,6,8and 33."
