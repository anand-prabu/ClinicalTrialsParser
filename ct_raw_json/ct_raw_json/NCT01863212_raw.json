From those 500 screened 40\n      subjects, 20 homozygous for the risk allele and 20 homozygous for a non risk allele will be\n      selected for the second step in the study. This part involves the fMRI technique to\n      visualize the brain response, focus on reward system activation, when food images are\n      visually presented in the scanner. Factors regarding eating behavior, sleep, physical\n      exercise and relation to food are investigated in the first part of the study as well as\n      clinical parameters such as BMI."
