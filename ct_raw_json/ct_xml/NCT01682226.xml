    <description>The day of neutrophil recovery is defined as the first of 3 consecutive days in which the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is &gt; 0.5. The cumulative incidence of neutrophil recovery will be reported at day 45 post-transplant. Sustained neutrophil engraftment is neutrophil engraftment without secondary graft failure. This will be analyzed at 1 and 2 years post-transplant.</description>

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Note: protocol eligible patients according to the criteria outlined below will then be
        divided according to age, diagnosis, performance status, organ function, prior
        transplantation, hematopoietic cell transplant comorbidity index (HCT-CI)23, and CB TNC
        dose into those who are at standard risk (Arm A) or high risk (Arm B) for early
        post-transplant death for the purposes of applying stopping rules and outcome analysis.

        Age:

        o 2 - 70 years.

        Diagnosis of high risk hematological malignancy:

        Any acute leukemia in first complete remission (CR) considered at high risk for relapse,
        or second or third CR, or relapse/refractory less than 25% blasts in bone marrow, or
        aplasia post-therapy. This includes de novo acute leukemia or acute leukemia that is
        therapy related or arising from an antecedent hematologic disorder including
        myelodysplasia (MDS), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) or other myeloproliferative disorder.

          -  Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) in CR, or relapse with less than 25% bone
             marrow blasts.

          -  CML with tyrosine kinase inhibitor failure in chronic or accelerated phase or evolved
             to acute leukemia.

          -  MDS with life-threatening cytopenia(s), and/or red blood cell or platelet transfusion
             dependence, or patients with aplasia, or patients with excess blasts less than 25%
             blasts in the bone marrow at work-up.

          -  Aggressive lymphoma: patients in CR1 with disease at high risk of relapse or CR2-3 or
             PR1-3.

             any transformed component is in CR.

          -  Hodgkin's lymphoma that is primary refractory or relapsed not suitable for other
             therapy.

        Performance status:

        unit CB grafts. This will be the CB graft for the majority of patients.

        In select pediatric patients with access to CB units that have high TNC (&gt; 5.0 x 10^7/kg),
        good HLA-match (5/6 or 6/6) and are from good quality CB banks a single unit could be
        considered with a back-up CB unit on standby.

          -  In select patients who have a very poor search and only have one suitable CB unit
             available, this unit could be given as a single unit. This unit must have a TNC &gt; 2.5
             x 10^7 TNC/kilogram.

             dose vs reduced intensity) will be based on patient disease status, age, extent of
             prior therapy, organ function and presence of significant comorbidities as outlined
             in Section 9.2.

        For the purposes of analysis, patients will be assigned to Arms A and B as summarized

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Active CNS leukemia.

               -  Any acute leukemia (including prior myelodysplasia or CML blast crisis) with
                  morphologic relapse or persistent disease &gt; 25% blasts in the BM, or doubling of
                  the blasts in the blood in the 2 weeks preceding admission, or need for
                  hydroxyurea in the 2 weeks prior to admission, or uncontrolled extra-medullary
                  disease.

               -  Two prior stem cell transplants.

               -  One prior stem cell transplant within the preceding 6 months.

               -  Prior radiation therapy rendering patient ineligible for TBI.

               -  Uncontrolled viral, bacteria or fungal infection at time of study enrollment.

               -  Sero-positive or NAT positive for HIV.

               -  Patient or guardian unable to give informed consent or unable to comply with the
                  treatment protocol including appropriate supportive care, follow-up, and
                  research tests

        Cord Blood Grafts:

        Units will be selected based on the HLA-match to the patient and individual cell doses of
        the units according to current MSKCC unit selection criteria. HLA-testing will be done
        using molecular techniques. The standard cord blood graft for this protocol will consist
        of 2 units as a double unit graft. Each unit will be at least 4 of 6 HLA-A, -B antigen and
        -DRB1 allele matched with the recipient. Each unit will have a cryopreserved dose of at
        least 1.5 x 10^7 TNC/recipient body weight (TNC/kg). In the occasional pediatric patient
        with a large well matched good quality single unit or the rare patient with only one unit
        of suitable match and dose characteristics the cord blood graft can consist of a single
        unit.

        Haploidentical Donor Inclusion Criteria:

        A HLA-haploidentical related donor will be selected as available, and if possible using an
        algorithm designed to maximize NK cell alloreactivity with prioritization according to
        KIR/HLA genotypes.

          -  Donor CMV status will also be taken into account.

          -  The donor must meet criteria outlined in the FACT-approved SOP for &quot;DONOR EVALUATION
             AND SELECTION FOR ALLOGENEIC TRANSPLANTATION&quot; in the Blood and Marrow Transplant
             Program Manual, document E-1 (see attached, or link to URL:
             http://mskweb5.mskcc.org/intranet/html/80312.cfm.).

          -  The donor must have adequate peripheral venous catheter access for leukapheresis or
             must agree to placement of a central catheter.

          -  The donor must be &gt;25 kg in weight.

        Haploidentical Donor Exclusion Criteria:

        Evidence of active infection (including active urinary tract infection, or upper
        respiratory tract infection) or evidence of viral hepatitis exposure on screening unless
        only HbsAb+ and HBV DNA negative.

          -  Medical or physical reason which makes the donor unlikely to tolerate or cooperate
             with growth factor therapy and leukapheresis.

          -  Factors which place the donor at increased risk for complications from leukapheresis
             or G-CSF therapy (e.g., active autoimmune disease, sickle cell trait, symptomatic
             coronary artery disease requiring therapy).

          -  Pregnancy (positive serum or urine β-HCG) or breastfeeding. Women of childbearing age
             must avoid becoming pregnant while on the study.
