    <description>Psychological wellbeing is measured using the Acceptance and Action Questionnaire (AAQ-2), which is a 10-item Likert-type questionnaire that assesses people's ability to take a non-elaborative, non-judgmental approach to their internal events, so that they can focus on the present moment and act in a way that is congruent with their values and goals, rather than with their internal events (e.g., fears, urges, prejudices).</description>

    <description>The KIMS is a 39-item self-report inventory used to assess mindfulness skills. The questionnaire contains four different specific subscales or skills: 1) observing, 2) describing, 3) acting with awareness, and 4) accepting without judgment. Participants rated each item on a 5-point Likert type scale ranging from 1 (never or very rarely true) to 5 (almost always or always true). Items reflects either direct descriptions of the mindfulness skills or the absence of that skill, and are reverse scored.</description>

    <description>The participants will get written feedback about their physical activity level after the baseline, and after 3, 6, 9 and 15 months of baseline compared to the current physical activity recommendations. Feedback will be created to illustrate participants´ activity level during the measurement week combining also the information from the diary. Feedback will be posted home and don´t include face to face interaction.  As an incentive for participation, participants will also have opportunity to attend a body composition analyze and get short interpretation (15 min) of their own results in the research center.</description>
