            "textblock": "A PPI triple regimen combining a proton pump inhibitor(PPI) with two antibiotics\n      (amoxicillin and clarithromycin) is currently considered the gold standard therapy for\n      eradication of H. pylori. However, recently the eradication rate with first-line treatment\n      has a tendency to decrease because of increasing antibiotics resistance. In addition, PPI is\n      mainly metabolized by cytochrome p450 2C19 (CYP2C19) in the liver and several reports have\n      suggested that differences in th CYP2C19 genotype are associated with H. pylori eradication\n      failure. Thus, the first aim of this study is to investigate the trend of eradication rates\n      of first-line triple therapy in recent ten years. And the second aim is to analyze the\n      antibiotics resistance rate for H. pylori by using culture minimal inhibitory\n      concentrations(MICs) result and to analyze the association between CYP2C19 genotype and\n      eradication rate of H.pylori. And also investigate the other clinical factors (age, gender,\n      underlying disease, cigarette smoking and alcohol use) that affect the eradication rate."
