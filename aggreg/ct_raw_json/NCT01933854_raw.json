The main goals are: to\n      describe the clinical features of the women in the study, assess probable risk factors\n      concerning the urinary incontinence, make physical gynecological exam as well as urodynamic\n      studies in the patients who have urinary complaints and use a life quality questionnaire\n      with those patients (Kings Health Questionnaire).\n\n      Cross and prevalence Study, followed by case series. Cohort study between the two\n      populations. The riverside group with 120 interviews and the urban group with 260\n      interviews, where the sample calculation was based on the population of each region and the\n      incidence of urinary incontinence checked through a pilot study.\n\n      After reading and signing an informed consent, interviews with women aged 20 years or over\n      and non-pregnant are hold so as to identify those who have complaints about urinary\n      incontinence, socio-economic data and risk factors. In patients who complain about urinary\n      incontinence, gynecological exams are performed in order to assess genital prolapse and\n      urodynamic studies are made as to confirm urinary incontinence and life quality\n      questionnaire. All the data will be encoded in the database and analyzed through statistics\n      programs and a comparison between the two groups (urban and riverside) will be made."
