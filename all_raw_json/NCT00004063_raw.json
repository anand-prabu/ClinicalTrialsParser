Interferon alfa may interfere with the growth of cancer cells.\n      Hyperthermia therapy kills tumor cells by heating them to several degrees above body\n      temperature. Combining hyperthermia with chemotherapy and interferon alfa may kill more\n      tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects of cisplatin, gemcitabine,\n      interferon alfa, and whole-body hyperthermia and how well they work in treating patients\n      with metastatic, recurrent, or refractory cancer."

Patients undergo long-duration, low temperature\n           whole body hyperthermia over 6 hours plus gemcitabine over 30 minutes on day 17.\n           Courses repeat every 5 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable\n           toxicity.\n\n        -  Phase I: Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of cisplatin until the\n           maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding\n           that at which at least 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicity. The\n           MTD of cisplatin is used for phase II study.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study."
