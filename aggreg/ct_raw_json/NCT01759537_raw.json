Subjects must have indication to receive two implants in a bilateral maxillary or\n             mandibular edentulous areas (for at least 4 months post extraction) in areas of\n             pre-molars (first or second) and molars (firstor second) ;\n\n          5. Sufficient width and height of bone to place at least 8mm length and any compatible\n             in diameter Ankylos implant;\n\n          6. Sufficient vertical clearance to place a single tooth crown replacement;\n\n          7. No apical disorder/inflammation at the area of the implant site.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          1. Subjects participating in other clinical studies within 1 month prior to screening\n             and/or involving therapeutic intervention (either medical or dental) that could\n             affect bone or soft tissue healing;\n\n          2. Female subjects who are pregnant or lactating, or who intend to become pregnant\n             during the study period following entrance into the study;\n\n          3. Subjects with parafunctional habits;\n\n          4. Subjects who have failed to maintain good plaque control;\n\n          5. Subjects with any systemic condition like uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, cancer,\n             HIV, disorders that compromise wound healing, chronic high dose steroid therapy, bone\n             metabolic diseases, radiation or other immuno-suppressive therapy which would\n             preclude periodontal surgery;\n\n          6. Absence of occlusal stability in centric occlusion;\n\n          7. Subjects with the presence of acute infectious lesions in the areas intended for\n             surgery;\n\n          8. History within the last 3 months of weekly or more frequent use of smokeless chewing\n             tobacco, pipe or cigar smoking and cigarette smoking (greater than 10 cigarettes per\n             day)\n\n          9. Present alcohol or drug abuse;\n\n         10. Angulation requirements of the restoration exceeding approximately 15 degrees;\n\n         11. Systemic corticosteroids or any other medication that would compromise post-operative\n             healing and/or osseointegration (e.g. calcium channel blocker, dilantin)."
