Patients who achieve a reduction in worst\n      pain of at least 2 points within 4-8 weeks but experience recurring pain at the RFA site or\n      are diagnosed with a new painful lesion within 4-24 weeks receive 1 additional treatment to\n      the recurring or new site.\n\n      Pain (using the Brief Pain Inventory scale of 0-10), analgesic use, and quality of life are\n      assessed at baseline, on day 1, weekly for 4 weeks, and then every 2 weeks for 20 weeks.\n\n      Patients are followed for 6 months beyond the last RFA treatment.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 50 patients will be accrued for this study."
