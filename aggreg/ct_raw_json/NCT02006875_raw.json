Previous studies seemed to support its effects on facilitating motor\n      recovery after stroke. This study focuses on the motor recovery of lower extremities.\n      Investigators conducted the study to evaluate the treatment effect of rTMS on the functional\n      performance of lower extremities in terms of postural control, balance, and mobility in\n      stroke patients. Investigators hypothesized that these performances could be improved\n      through the better motor control of lower extremities caused by rTMS."

Screening for eligibility was done by the 2 physiatrists from\n           rehabilitation department of SHH.\n\n        4. Study design:  controlled trial with stratified randomization\n\n        5. Blinding\n\n             1. The patients were blinded by the real or sham coil of rTMS\n\n             2. The assessors who performed the outcome measurements were blinded to the\n                assignment of treatment.\n\n        6. Measurements.\n\n             1. Baseline demographic records. The stroke severity was measured by National\n                Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), Modified Rankin Scale (MRS), Brunnstrum\n                stage, and Manual muscle test (MMT) before intervention.\n\n             2. Clinical assessments.\n\n                  -  Postural control was assessed by Postural Assessment Scale for Stroke\n                     Patients (PASS)\n\n                  -  The motor recovery of lower extremities was assessed by the lower extremity\n                     subscale of Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA-LE)\n\n                  -  The balance and gait subscales of Tinetti Performance Oriented Mobility\n                     Assessment (POMA-b and POMA-g)\n\n                  -  Timed Up and Go (TUG) test was used to assess the gross mobility.\n\n                  -  Barthel Index (BI) for the ADL independence\n\n                  -  modified Rankin Scale (MRS) for disability classification were also\n                     collected.\n\n             3. Corticomotor excitability assessments. e. Timing of measurements: pretest (1 day\n                before the intervention), the and post-test (immediately after the 15-day\n                interventions are completed), and 3 months after the interventions are completed.\n\n             4. These measurements (including the clinical and corticomotor excitability\n                assessments) are performed by one researcher who are responsible for the\n                measurements.\n\n        7. Compliance and side effect. The compliance of interventions were investigated. The\n           attendance of treatments (including rTMS sessions and physical therapy sessions) and\n           possible side effect/discomfort were recorded during the interventions by a researcher.\n           He also tries to understand the reason of drop-out from the study."
