  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Selective laser trabeculoplasty (SLT) is an increasingly popular treatment modality in
      early-to-moderate glaucoma patients. SLT has been suggested to reduce IOP more consistently
      during the nocturnal period than during the diurnal period in a group of medically-treated
      patients with primary open angle glaucoma (POAG). At present, there is scarce data on SLT
      effects on the 24-hour IOP pattern in patients with glaucoma and there is no data on the
      24-hour effect of SLT in untreated glaucoma patients.

      The purpose of this study is to assess the changes of IOP over a 24-hour period in patients
      with glaucoma undergoing SLT.
