      This phase II trial studies how well peginterferon alfa-2b works in treating younger
      patients with craniopharyngioma that is recurrent or cannot be removed by surgery.
      Peginterferon alfa-2b may interfere with the growth of tumor cells and slow the growth of
      craniopharyngioma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the 1-year disease stabilization rate associated with the use of PegIntron
      (peginterferon alfa-2b) in patients with progressive unresectable or recurrent
      craniopharyngiomas following surgery alone who have not received radiation therapy.

      II. To estimate the sustained objective response rate (partial response [PR] + complete
      response [CR]) to PegIntron in patients with craniopharyngiomas which progress or recur
      following radiation therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the response rate in patients with progressive unresectable or recurrent
      craniopharyngioma treated with PegIntron by study stratum.

      II. To estimate the progression-free survival distribution for patients with unresectable or
      recurrent craniopharyngiomas treated with PegIntron by study stratum.

      III. To evaluate the toxicity profile of PegIntron in children with unresectable or
      recurrent craniopharyngiomas.

      IV. To compare the protocol specific disease assessment criteria to MacDonald criteria
      during the first year of treatment in stratum I and at the time of objective response and
      progressive disease in both strata.

      V. To characterize evidence of wingless-related integration site (WNT) pathway activation in
      resected tumor tissue in patients with craniopharyngiomas by immunohistochemistry and
      correlate these results with outcome and response data.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive peginterferon alfa-2b subcutaneously (SC) weekly for 6 weeks. Treatment may
      repeat every 6 weeks for up to 18 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.
