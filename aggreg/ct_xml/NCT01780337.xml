    <textblock>
      In this pilot study the investigators will perform a double-blind randomized trial of
      intranasal oxytocin on measures of cardiac refractoriness, among individuals who are
      undergoing clinically indicated catheter ablation procedures for paroxysmal atrial
      fibrillation. The investigators seek to enroll 20 patients for this study, for the purpose
      of estimating effect sizes for a larger future study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite widespread advances in the treatment of coronary artery disease and the growing use
      of automated external defibrillators and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) to
      treat ventricular arrhythmias, sudden cardiac death (SCD) due to ventricular arrhythmia
      remains a major public health problem. National estimates of SCD or out-of- hospital cardiac
      arrest range from 400,000 to 450,000 events annually. Although cardiac mortality rates have
      declined over time, the proportion of cardiac deaths that are sudden has increased during a
      time when major advances in device therapy for the prevention and treatment of SCD have
      taken place. This unfavorable trend is a consequence of the inability to accurately identify
      those who will die suddenly from a lethal ventricular arrhythmia and to disseminate
      effective preventive strategies for populations at risk.

      Observational evidence has indicated that depression is associated with risk of SCD, both in
      patients with coronary artery disease as well as in individuals without heart disease. In
      patients with ICDs, depressive symptoms are associated with increased risk of shocks for
      ventricular arrhythmia, suggesting that ventricular arrhythmia is more common in depressed
      individuals.  A leading candidate mechanism that may account for the association between
      depression and ventricular arrhythmia involves cardiac autonomic dysfunction; for instance,
      multiple studies have shown that depressed individuals have abnormal heart rate variability.

      Recent evidence has emerged about the potential importance of oxytocin in the cardiovascular
      response to stress and depression. Oxytocin is a 9-amino acid peptide that is produced in
      the hypothalamus and released into the central nervous system and the bloodstream. Oxytocin
      has both hormone and neurotransmitter function, and affects targets including the
      hypothalamus, amygdala, hippocampus, brainstem, heart, uterus, and regions of the spinal
      cord that regulate the autonomic nervous system. Polymorphisms of the oxytocin receptor have
      been associated with improved cardiovascular responses to laboratory stress in humans.

      Exogenous administration of intravenous oxytocin in a prairie vole model of isolation has
      been shown to protect against the heart rate response to social isolation and to improve
      heart rate variability. In addition, intranasal oxytocin administered to humans augments
      both sympathetic and parasympathetic modulation of the heart rate.  Initial studies of
      intravenous oxytocin demonstrated direct effects on cardiac arrhythmias in animal models,
      even including termination of ventricular fibrillation, suggestive of a quinidine-like
      action on myocardial excitability.  However, administration of intravenous oxytocin in women
      after delivery has been associated with abnormalities in cardiac repolarization and even
      with induced ventricular arrhythmia. Therefore, although there is reason to believe that
      administration of exogenous oxytocin may affect the probability of arrhythmia, the direction
      of this impact is unclear.
