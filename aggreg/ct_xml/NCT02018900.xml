  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the present pilot study, the investigators will study the effects of a novel synbiotic,
      which is a mix of probiotics (Ecologic 825) in the presence of a prebiotic (short chain
      fructo-oligosaccharide (scFOS)), on mucosal integrity, overall microbiota changes along the
      gastrointestinal-tract and the mucosal immune response. The investigators hypothesize that
      the synbiotic Ecologic 825/scFOS will significantly affect the intestinal permeability and
      modulate the immune system in humans.
