            "textblock": "Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) of the newborn, also  called  as hyaline  membrane\n      disease,  is  the  most common cause of respiratory distress in premature infants,\n      correlating with structural and functional lung immaturity. The pathophysiology of RDS is\n      complex. Immature  type II alveolar cells produce less surfactant that causes an increase in\n      alveolar surface tension and a decrease in compliance. This resultant  atelectasis  lead to\n      pulmonary  vascular constriction, hypoperfusion, and lung tissue ischemia. RDS and prolonged\n      ventilation and associated systemic/lung injury may also contribute to long term oxygen\n      dependency and may result in bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD).  Vitamin D is a fat-soluble\n      steroid hormone that primarily contributes to the maintenance of normal calcium homeostasis\n      and skeletal mineralization. In addition to its classical role in bone metabolism, vitamin D\n      deficiency has been associated with impaired pulmonary function, increased incidence of\n      viral and bacterial infections and inflammatory lung diseases.  Although exact mechanisms\n      are not fully understood, vitamin D appears to impact on a variety of inflammatory and\n      structural cells within the lung including macrophages, lymphocytes and epithelial cells. To\n      our best of knowledge,  no study has evaluated the effect of vitamin D levels on the\n      severity and presence of RDS in preterm infants. Therefore, the aim of this study is to\n      evaluate the possible role of maternal/neonatal vitamin D levels on RDS development in\n      preterm infants. We also aim to determine the possible association between maternal/neonatal\n      vitamin D levels and the incidence of BPD and other neonatal morbidities."

The infants will be evaluated for RDS and surfactant requirement. If they have\n      RDS and need of mechanical ventilation, they will be intubated and given surfactant, if\n      necessary. The maternal and neonatal demographics of infants will be recorded. Infants will\n      also be followed up in terms of other morbidities including patent ductus arteriosus,\n      necrotizing enterocolitis, retinopathy of prematurity, and especially BPD. Then infants will\n      be divided into three groups according to maternal/neonatal vitamin D levels (mild, moderate\n      and severe vitamin D deficiency) and group comparisons will be performed Plasmas after\n      separated and stored at -80 C. Levels of 25-OHD will be determined using Shimadzu LC-20AT\n      model High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system. Data will be analyzed using SPSS\n      software and appropriate statistical analyses will be performed."
