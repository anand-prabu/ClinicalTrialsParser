      Though the diagnostic properties of Corus® CAD have been evaluated in previous observational
      studies, there are limited data regarding how primary care clinicians are using the results
      of the test in the care and management of patients with angina.  This registry is designed
      to examine the relationship between the Corus CAD score and patterns of care regarding
      diagnostic testing in real world clinical care settings.

      Atherosclerotic coronary artery disease (CAD) is the most common cause of morbidity and
      mortality worldwide.  CAD affects 16.5 million persons in the US.  Diagnosing CAD is not
      straightforward and poses an enormous burden on the health care system.  The most common
      symptom of CAD is chest pain (angina), however, only 10%-30% of chest pain and related
      symptoms are due to CAD.  Though there are several diagnostic tests for CAD (e.g., coronary
      angiography, stress testing, nuclear myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI)), each has its
      limitations, including invasiveness, safety risks (e.g., bleeding, radiation exposure),
      expense, lack of accuracy, subjectivity in evaluation and interpretation of findings, and
      lack of availability in all geographic regions.

      Recent scientific findings demonstrate that multiple genes are activated in circulating
      blood cells in patients with CAD.  A gene expression test that detects activated and/or
      deactivated genes could therefore serve as a tool in aiding the diagnosis of CAD.  The
      Corus® CAD test (henceforth, &quot;Corus CAD&quot;) is a validated quantitative in vitro diagnostic
      test, performed in a single Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA ) laboratory at
      CardioDx, Inc., using the gene expression level of 23 genes from peripheral blood specimens
      to assess the likelihood of a subject having at least a 50% coronary artery stenosis.  Corus
      CAD incorporates the expression levels of these genes, using a validated algorithm with
      weighted functions, to generate a quantitative score and is indicated for use in stable
      patients with typical or atypical symptoms suggestive of CAD (e.g., chest pain, shortness of
      breath, heartburn, fatigue on exertion).  The test is non-invasive (involving simple
      venipuncture), and as the results are evaluated at one laboratory, there is minimal
      potential variability in the analysis of findings.
