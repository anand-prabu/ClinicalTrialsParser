Researchers in this\n      application developed a biomarker to identify nonadherence, calculating the standard\n      deviation (SD) of consecutive immunosuppressant blood levels for each patient to capture the\n      degree of variability between individual levels (higher SD = less consistent levels).  By\n      applying a threshold, this marker identifies nonadherent patients.  A consortium of\n      transplant centers is currently testing this marker through the MALT (Medication Adherence\n      in children who had a Liver Transplant) study.  MALT investigators now propose to take\n      advantage of this existing collaboration to pilot-test an intervention to improve adherence\n      in patients who are identified by this marker."

This will be verified by asking both guardian and child to repeat\n             the study procedures.\n\n          -  The patient is only seen for consultation - most or all of the child's routine care\n             is provided at another center (or in a community clinic).\n\n          -  Either the patient or the guardian is actively psychotic or severely disoriented due\n             to any cause, including hepatic encephalopathy (temporary exclusion) or severely\n             mentally retarded as defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental\n             Disorders, 4th edition (DSM-IV).\n\n          -  The patient is not medically stable or is hospitalized."
