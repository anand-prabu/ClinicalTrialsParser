This intervention stresses a personalized program emphasizing activities that are meaningful to and are tailored to individual participants; provides consistent contact between the participants and research staff; and allows monitoring of activity levels using questionnaires, actigraphy, monitoring of heart rate, direct and telephone contact. Participants dietary and physical activity goals as assessed by the dietician and trainer will be discussed at face-to face meetings to re-establish these goals. These programs will be tailored to meet the realistic goals of the individual participant. The program stresses aerobic exercise, rather than other types of exercise interventions, as aerobic exercise appears to correlate best with improved autonomic function."

            "textblock": "Type 2 diabetes (DM2) affects nearly 20 million people in the United States while impaired\n      glucose regulation (IGR), which includes impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), impaired fasting\n      glucose (IFG), and early diabetes affects a considerably larger but unknown population\n      group. At the current time there is no effective therapy to completely prevent, or reverse\n      neuropathy associated with IGR and this represents a considerable challenge in\n      rehabilitation. There is a particularly strong incentive to prevent IGT and related\n      complications from advancing to DM2. IGR is a growing problem among all older adults and its\n      strong association with many functional limitations, particularly mobility limitations, is\n      not always recognized, even though diabetes-related disability occurs in up to 2/3 of older\n      adults with diabetes and is associated with dependency, poor quality of life, and increased\n      acute and long-term care utilization.\n\n      Autonomic dysfunction is a significant problem in subjects with IGT. Our Preliminary Data\n      shows that over 90% of subjects with IGT have an abnormal score on questionnaires about\n      autonomic symptoms such as lightheadedness, dry mouth or dry eyes, pale or blue feet, feet\n      that are colder than the rest of the body, decreased sweating in the feet or increased\n      sweating in the hands, nausea or bloating after eating, persistent diarrhea or constipation,\n      or leaking of urine. In addition, patients with IGR have impaired balance control. These\n      factors can increase the risk of falls in affected subjects. A non-randomized and\n      non-controlled study showed that a diet and exercise intervention in patients with diabetes\n      led to an overall improvement in autonomic function. Furthermore, it was shown that standing\n      balance can be improved with a balance intervention program.\n\n      However, there are no published studies that assess the effect of an intense physical\n      activity intervention on autonomic function in IGR related neuropathy. This study will test\n      an aerobic exercise and balance intervention in participants with IGR. We will examine if an\n      individually tailored, carefully monitored, Diet, Physical Activity, and Balance Enhancement\n      Program (DPAEP) can improve autonomic function and balance control when compared to patients\n      who receive standard care. Improving balance control and autonomic function can decrease the\n      risk of falls and have a significant effect on the health of participants.\n\n      The research is also significant because it will test subjects either before they become\n      diabetic, or at an early stage in their diabetes, thus enhancing the chance of reversing the\n      autonomic neuropathy or balance impairment. Furthermore, the study is designed to test\n      whether improvement in autonomic function and balance is associated with improvement in\n      clinical outcomes, quality of life, and the metabolic state of participants. Thus, the\n      proposed interventions are likely to have a real life impact on participants and their\n      health."
