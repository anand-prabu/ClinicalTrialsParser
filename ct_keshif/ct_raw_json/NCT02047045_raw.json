Random sequences will be generated by the clinical evaluating center of China\n      Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences. Subjects are patients who have severe chronic\n      constipation.\n\n      Sample size evaluation: Sample size will be based on the proportion of patients having mean\n      complete spontaneous bowel movements (CSBMs) no less than 3 times per week. The proportion\n      is 31.67% in our phase I clinical trial by using electro-acupuncture, and 30.9% in another\n      trial by using prucalopride.The total sample size is 560.\n\n      Periods and primary outcome: participants will be assessed at baseline for 2 weeks, treated\n      for 8 weeks, and followed up for 24 weeks. Primary outcome is the proportion of patients\n      having mean CSBMs/week no less than 3 times over the latter 6-week treatment.\n\n      Quality control: the study is a randomized controlled trial; participants were included\n      strictly; evaluators and statisticians are blinded; quality control officers of 3 different\n      levels will supervise this trial.\n\n      Data management: this trial will use the Remote Dara Capture (RDC) system for data entering\n      and Data Verification Plan (DVP) for data examining.\n\n      Statistical analysis: Intention-To-Treat (ITT) analysis will be used in this study.\n      One-sided test (non-inferiority) will be used for testing the primary outcomes; meanwhile,\n      two-sided test will be used for evaluating other outcomes. A P value equal to or less than\n      0.05 is considered to indicate statistical significance."
