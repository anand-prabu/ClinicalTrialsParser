The purpose of this\n      multi-center definitive study is to assess the safety and efficacy of the EarLens System for\n      subjects with bilateral mild to severe sensorineural hearing impairments wearing the fully\n      activated system in their daily lives for a 4 month period of time. This study is designed\n      to support US and International marketing applications to commercialize the EarLens System.\n      The main efficacy hypothesis is that the EarLens System will be shown to improve hearing in\n      frequencies up to 10,000 Hz for the study population."

The BTE is designed to be able to be removed, reprogrammed, and have the battery recharged as needed, similar to a BTE for an air conduction hearing aid. The removable TM Transducer is custom made for each patient, is placed and removed by a physician in an office visit procedure, and is designed to reside in the ear in a safe and stable manner for long periods of time.",
