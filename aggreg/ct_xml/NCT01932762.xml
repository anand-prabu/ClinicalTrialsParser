    <textblock>
      This is a multi-site, open-label trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of 100 mg of
      MK-5172 (a second-generation protease inhibitor) used in combination with/or without 50 mg
      of MK-8742 (an NS54A inhibitor) and/or ribavirin (RBV) in treating non-cirrhotic
      treatment-naïve (TN) participants with chronic genotype (GT) 2, 4, 5, and 6 hepatitis C
      infection.
