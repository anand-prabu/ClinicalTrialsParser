    <textblock>
      Transition from tacrolimus based triple therapy with Mycophenolate Mofetil (MMF) and
      steroids in stable renal transplant patients to low intensity tacrolimus, everolimus and
      prednisone will be associated with improvement in Glomular Filtration Rate (GFR) and
      allograft fibrosis.
