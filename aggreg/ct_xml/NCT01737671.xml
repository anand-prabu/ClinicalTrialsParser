      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if methotrexate infused into the fourth
      ventricle of the brain can help to control brain tumors.  The safety of this drug will also
      be studied.

      Methotrexate is designed to block cancer cells from dividing, which may slow or stop their
      growth and spread throughout the body.  This may cause the cancer cells to die.

      Catheter Placement:

      If you are eligible to take part in this study, you will have surgery to place a catheter
      into the ommaya reservoir.  The ommaya reservoir is a catheter system that allows drugs to
      be administered directly to parts of the brain.  In this study, the catheter will be used to
      collect about 1 teaspoon of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF - the fluid surrounding the brain and
      spinal cord) to check the status of the disease and for the infusion of methotrexate
      directly into the 4th ventricle of the brain, which is 1 of the 4 connected fluid-filled
      cavities in the brain.

      If the study doctor thinks it is necessary, based on the location of the tumor, the tumor
      may also be removed while you are already under anesthesia just before the catheter is
      placed.

      Study Drug Administration:

      Each cycle is 4 days long and will consist of 4 daily infusions of methotrexate.  You will
      have at least a 2 week rest period between each cycle.

      Methotrexate will be infused through the ommaya reservoir catheter directly into the 4th
      ventricle of the brain starting 2-4 weeks after the catheter placement surgery.  The
      infusion should last about 3 minutes each time.

      You may also be given leucovorin, a drug used to help prevent or treat the side effects of
      methotrexate, by intravenous (IV) infusion through a catheter or port you have already had
      placed in your arm.  If the study doctor thinks it is needed, this infusion will be given
      after each cycle to help with the possible side effects you may experience from
      methotrexate.  The infusion should last about 5 minutes each time.

      Study Visits:

      Within 72 hours after catheter placement surgery:

        -  Any updates to your health will be recorded.

        -  You will have a neurological exam.

        -  Blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  You will have an MRI scan of the brain and spine to check the status of the disease and
           the flow of brain fluid.

      Ten (10) days after catheter placement surgery:

        -  Any updates to your health will be recorded.

        -  You will have a spinal tap (also called a lumbar puncture).  A lumbar puncture is a
           procedure where fluid surrounding the spinal cord is removed by inserting a needle into
           the lower back. The affected area is numbed with local anesthetic during the procedure.

        -  You will have a neuropsychological evaluation.

      Within 1 week before the first dose of methotrexate at each cycle, blood (about 1 teaspoon)
      will be drawn for routine tests.

      Daily during each methotrexate infusion for Cycles 1-3:

        -  You will have a neurological exam.

        -  You will have an Ommaya reservoir tap (a catheter is placed into the Ommaya reservoir
           to give the methotrexate infusion).

        -  CSF (about 1 teaspoon) will be collected for routine tests.

      Within 1 week after the dose of methotrexate, a spinal tap may be performed if the prior one
      was positive.  If it was negative after the first cycle, then it will be repeated only after
      the third cycle.  You will also have an MRI scan of the brain to check the status of the
      disease.  If the study doctor thinks it is needed, you will also have an MRI of the spine.

      Within 1 month after the dose at Cycle 3, you will have a neuropsychological exam.

      If the study doctor thinks it is in your best interest, you will continue with additional
      cycles of methotrexate therapy. Your doctor may recommend additional surgery.

      Also, if the study doctor thinks it is in your best interest, methotrexate may be given
      together with other chemotherapy after completion of Cycle 3.  If you will be receiving
      other chemotherapy, the study doctor will speak with you in more detail about what drugs you
      will receive and how you will receive them.

      Length of Study:

      You will receive up to 3 cycles of the methotrexate, or as long as the doctor thinks it is
      your best interest.  You will no longer be able to receive the study drug if the disease
      gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study
      directions.

      Your participation on the study will be over after you complete the follow-up visits.

      Follow-Up Visit:

      3 months after the final dose of study drug:

        -  Any updates to your health will be recorded.

        -  You will have a neurological exam.

        -  You will have an MRI scan of the brain and spine to check the status of the disease.

      This is an investigational study.  Methotrexate is FDA approved and commercially available
      for infusion directly into brain tumors.  The infusion of methotrexate into the 4th
      ventricle of the brain is investigational.

      Up to 10 patients will be enrolled in this study.  All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

             such as somnolence, which is attributed to hydrocephalus and/or mass effect from the
             brain tumor by the treating physicians. However, after tumor resection and placement
             of the catheter into the fourth ventricle, the protocol will only be continued if the
             patient has adequate central nervous system function, defined as: Patient is not
             severely somnolent or comatose

          6. Prior to receiving intraventricular methotrexate, patients must have adequate bone
             marrow function, defined as: Peripheral absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;/= 1000/µL,
             Platelet count = 30,000/µL (transfusion independent), Hemoglobin = 9.0 gm/dL (may

             experimental treatment protocol or if receiving any other chemotherapy (either
             systemic or intrathecal).

          2. Pregnant or lactating female patients are ineligible

          3. Patients will be excluded from this study if they have received another
             investigational or chemotherapy agent within 14 days prior to study drug
             administration (i.e., after study entry/enrollment, patients would not be projected
             to receive the study agent until they are at least 2 weeks post-operative).

          4. Patients will be excluded from this study if they have any evidence of infection in
