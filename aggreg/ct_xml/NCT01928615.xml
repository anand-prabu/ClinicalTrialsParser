    <textblock>
      This open-label, randomized study will evaluate the quality of life, efficacy and safety
      with subcutaneous Herceptin (trastuzumab) injected either into the thigh or the upper arm in
      patients with early HER2-positive breast cancer. Patients will receive Herceptin
      intravenously (8 mg/kg initial dose, followed by 6 mg/kg every 3 weeks) for 6 cycles and a
      maximum of 6 cycles chemotherapy (neo-adjuvant or adjuvant). Patients will then be
      randomized to receive in a cross-over design for Cycles 7-10 and 11-14 Herceptin 600 mg
      subcutaneously every 3 weeks either into the thigh or into the upper arm. For Cycles 15-18
      patients may choose the injection site for Herceptin. Anticipated time on study treatment is
      1 year.

             treatment, including hormonal therapy, bisphosphonate therapy and immunotherapy,
             within 28 days prior to the first dose of study treatment

          -  Known hypersensitivity to trastuzumab, murine proteins, to any of the excipients of
             Herceptin including hyaluronidase, or a history of severe allergic or immunological
             reactions, e.g. difficult to control asthma

          -  Inadequate bone marrow, hepatic or renal function
