      The TIVUS II is a prospective, multicenter, non-randomized, open-label clinical study of the
      safety and performance of the TIVUS™ System consisting of three (3) concurrent cohorts:

        -  TIVUS™ Severe Resistant HTN Cohort

        -  TIVUS™ Moderate Resistant HTN Cohort

        -  TIVUS™ Failed RF Therapy Cohort
