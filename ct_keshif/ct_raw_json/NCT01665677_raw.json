The stem cells can be obtained from the\n      hollow part of the hip bone or from blood.\n\n      A serious problem with this treatment is Graft Versus Host Disease (GVHD).  This happens\n      when stem cells from the donor attack normal cells of the recipient.  Currently, there is no\n      universal standard of care in the United STates to prevent GVHD.\n\n      This study is being done to see if a medicine that is used to lower cholesterol can also\n      help in reducing GVHD.\n\n      Patients will receive atorvastatin daily by mouth starting 14 days before stem cell\n      transplant.  They will continue to take atorvastatin until 180 days after transplant.  This\n      medicine may be stopped earlier if there is a bad side effect or a severe GVHD.  Patients\n      will also receive standard treatment to prevent GVHD.  Patients will undergo many tests that\n      are standard for their treatment at West Virginia University (WVU), including blood tests to\n      check blood counts, kidney function and HIV status; blood test to check for pregnancy; Multi\n      Gated Acquisition Scan (MUGA scan)or echocardiogram to test heart function; lung function\n      testing; and bone marrow aspirate or biopsy.  Patients will also have the option to provide\n      blood samples for optional research related to the study."
