Blood samples for PK\n      analysis will be obtained over 32 hours post-dose on Day 1, Day 8, and Day 22. The last dose\n      of dabrafenib will be taken in the morning of Day 23 and the last blood sample in the\n      evening of Day 23. Subjects will be considered to have completed the study once the 32 hour\n      PK sample has been collected on Day 23. Once they have completed the study, eligible\n      subjects may have the option to enter study BRF114144, an open-label roll-over study of\n      dabrafenib (no follow-up visit required) and continue receiving dabrafenib."
