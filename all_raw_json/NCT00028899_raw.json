Monoclonal antibodies such as gemtuzumab ozogamicin\n      can locate cancer cells and either kill them or deliver cancer-killing substances to them\n      without harming normal cells. Combining monoclonal antibody therapy with combination\n      chemotherapy may kill more cancer cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combining gemtuzumab ozogamicin with\n      combination chemotherapy in treating children who have relapsed or refractory acute myeloid\n      leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome."

Patients are\n      assigned by cohort to 1 of 2 treatment regimens.\n\n        -  Regimen A: Patients receive cytarabine IV over 2 hours every 12 hours on days 1-4,\n           mitoxantrone IV over 1 hour on days 3-6, and gemtuzumab ozogamicin IV over 2 hours on\n           day 7.\n\n        -  Regimen B: Patients receive cytarabine IV over 3 hours every 12 hours on days 1, 2, 8,\n           and 9, asparaginase intramuscularly on days 2 and 9, and gemtuzumab ozogamicin IV over\n           2 hours on day 3.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive de-escalating doses of gemtuzumab ozogamicin until the\n      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose below that at\n      which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed monthly for 6 months, every 2 months for 6 months, every 6 months for\n      2 years, and then annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 52 patients will be accrued for this study within 1.5 years."
