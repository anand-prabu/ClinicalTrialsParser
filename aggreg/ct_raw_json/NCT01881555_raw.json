The patients who give their informed consent will be randomly assigned to a\n      therapeutic strategy based upon coronary angiography or angiography with FFR testing. In the\n      FFR group, a significant coronary stenosis will be defined by a FFR \u2264 0.8. Based upon this\n      multivessel evaluation (angiography or FFR), the investigator will choose the best\n      therapeutic strategy to his discretion (medical optimal treatment, coronary stenting,\n      coronary artery bypass graft surgery). The aim of revascularization procedures will be to\n      obtain complete revascularization. In the FFR group, only stenosis with FFR\u22640.8 will be\n      treated.\n\n      The primary end point of the trial is a composite of major cardiovascular events including\n      death from any cause, myocardial infarction, any hospitalization for coronary\n      revascularization performed in addition to initial treatment and stroke at 1 year of\n      follow-up.\n\n      Secondary end points will include adverse events, individual major cardiovascular events,\n      stent thrombosis, bleeding events, occlusion of coronary artery bypass graft, patient's\n      quality of life and cost-effectiveness and 30-day, 6 month, 2-year and 5-year outcomes."
