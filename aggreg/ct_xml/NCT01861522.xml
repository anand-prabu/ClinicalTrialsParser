      The objectives of this study are: to confirm the superiority of TAU-284 over placebo after
      two weeks of administration to pediatric patients with perennial allergic rhinitis and to
      investigate safety of TAU-284.

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-arm parallel-group comparative
      study to confirm the superiority of TAU-284 over placebo after two weeks of administration
      of TAU-284 (20 mg/day) or placebo to pediatric patients with perennial allergic rhinitis,
      with &quot;the change from baseline in total nasal symptom score (total score for the three major
      nasal symptoms [sneezing, rhinorrhea, and nasal congestion])&quot; as the primary endpoint; and
      to investigate safety of TAU-284.
