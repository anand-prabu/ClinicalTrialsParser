      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of MK-5172 100 mg in
      combination with MK-8742 50 mg in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype
      1 (GT1), GT4, GT5 or GT6 infection in treatment-naïve participants who are on opiate
      substitution therapy (OST). The primary hypothesis is that the percentage of participants
      who receive MK-5172+MK-8742 and achieve a Sustained Virologic Response 12 weeks after the
      end of all study therapy (SVR12) will be superior to 67%.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Documented chronic HCV genotype 1 (GT1), GT4, GT5, or GT6 infection with no evidence
             of GT2 or GT3 or non-typeable genotypes

          -  On opiate substitution therapy (OST; methadone, levamethadone, buprenorphine,
             naloxone, naltrexone) for at least 3 months prior to screening

          -  Treatment naïve to all HCV therapies

          -  If HIV-infected, must be currently naïve to treatment with any antiretroviral therapy
             (ART) OR on a stable HIV ART for at least 8 weeks prior to study entry using a dual
             nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) backbone of tenofovir or abacavir
             and either emtricitabine or lamivudine PLUS raltegravir (or dolutegravir or
             rilpivirine)

          -  If HIV-infected, cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4+) T-cell count &gt;200 cells/mm^3 if
             on stable ART or &gt;500 cell/mm^3 if ART treatment naïve

          -  If HIV-infected, documented undetectable plasma HIV-1 ribonucleic acid (RNA) at least
             8 weeks prior to screening if on stable ART or &lt;50,000 copies/mL if ART treatment
             naïve

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence of decompensated liver disease

          -  For participants with cirrhosis, participants who are Child-Pugh Class B or C or who
             have a Pugh-Turcotte (CPT) score &gt;6

          -  Co-infected with hepatitis B virus

          -  Has cirrhosis and liver imaging with 6 months of Day 1 showing evidence of
             hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or is under evaluation for HCC

          -  Currently using or intends to use barbiturates during the treatment period of this
             study

          -  Any medical condition requiring or likely to require chronic systemic administration
             of corticosteroids during the course of the trial

          -  Evidence or history of chronic hepatitis not caused by HCV
