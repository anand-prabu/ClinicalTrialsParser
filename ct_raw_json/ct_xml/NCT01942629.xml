  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The p63 gene is a recently discovered member of the p53 family located at chromosome
      3q27Many studies have reported that overexpression of p63 can mimic p53 activities by
      binding DNA, activating transcription, and inducing apoptosis.

      Various studies proved p63 as a marker of basal cells in normal salivary glands, breast,
      prostate, respiratory and squamous epithelia, and of tumor cells from various malignancies.
      Still, p63 has been the subject of relatively few studies in lung adenocarcinoma, and breast
      carcinoma, and no study has described the correlation of p63 with pancreatic ductal
      adenocarcinoma.

      In the current study, we aim to evaluate the prognostic value of the expression of p63 in
      the lung adenocarcinoma, breast adenocarcinoma, and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. We
      will achieve this aim by collecting clinical data retrospectively from the patients' medical
      records as well as assessing the histological sections and performing immunohistochemical
      staining for p63.
