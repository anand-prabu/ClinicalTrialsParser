            "textblock": "Insulin replacement therapy is absolutely required for patients with Type 1 diabetes. The\n      insulin pump provides for continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII), which can\n      approximate the insulin release patterns of the normal pancreas. Timely and accurate\n      knowledge of ambient glucose levels is important for insulin dose adjustments. Typically,\n      glucose values are measured volitionally, several times a day, using capillary \"fingerstick\"\n      samples. In addition, glucose in the interstitial fluid can be measured automatically and\n      continuously using implantable glucose oxidase-based sensors. Recent study showed that this\n      continuous measurement of glucose levels allows for a fully automated \"closed-loop\" insulin\n      replacement therapy which requires an algorithm that receives glucose data, calculates an\n      appropriate insulin dose, and directs the pump to deliver the insulin dose.The need for\n      development of a closed-loop insulin replacement system that integrates insulin delivery,\n      glucose measurement, and control subsystems will present several challenges to biomedical\n      engineers."
