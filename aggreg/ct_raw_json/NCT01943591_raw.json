            "textblock": "Endovascular treatment with platinum coils is safe and effective in preventing rebleeding of\n      intracranial aneurysms.  Unfortunately, endovascular treatment of aneurysms with coils has\n      been associated with incomplete occlusion at initial treatment (remnant) or at follow-up\n      (recurrence).  This in some studies has been as high as 20%.   While many such aneurysm\n      remnants or recurrences exhibit benign behavior, many require retreatment to prevent future\n      hemorrhage.\n\n      A recent randomized controlled trial of aneurysm coiling revealed that aneurysms between 2\n      and 9.9 mm diameter were more likely to have an improved angiographic and composite clinical\n      outcome when treated with hydrogel-coated coils, an improvement inferred to result from\n      higher packing density afforded by hydrogel expansion(1).  The use of hydrogel coils is\n      associated with technical difficulties related to expansion and limited time for deployment.\n      The investigators theorize that similar results could be achieved by using more voluminous\n      bare platinum coils, leading to improved packing density compared to smaller caliber coils,\n      and thus result in lower incidence of remnants or residuals.  The relationship between\n      packing densities and composite clinical endpoints having never been shown in a robust\n      fashion, the investigators therefore propose a randomized clinical trial opposing coiling\n      with soft 15-caliber coils to 10-caliber bare platinum coils in aneurysms varying in size\n      from 3 to 9.9 mm.\n\n      To test the hypothesis that 15-caliber coiling systems are superior to standard 10-caliber\n      coils in achieving better composite outcomes, the investigators propose the DELTA trial:\n      Does Embolization with Larger coils lead to better Treatment of Aneurysms trial, a\n      randomized controlled blinded trial with 2 subgroups of 282 patients each, 564 total:\n\n      Subgroup 1: Coiled with a maximum proportion of 15-caliber coils as conditions allow\n      Subgroup 2: Coiled with 10-caliber coils."
