All consecutive\n      patients undergone PTCA in our institution in the period between July 2013 and December 2013\n      will be eligible to be enrolled.\n\n      Patients will be offered to participate to the trial at time of 1-month post-angioplasty\n      follow-up visit.patients receiving dual antiplatelet therapy (prasugrel 10 mg or brilique 90\n      mg x 2 plus aspirin 100 mg) after percutaneous coronary intervention. Patients were randomly\n      assigned to rosuvastatin (20 mg day) or atorvastatin (40 mg day) for 30 days. After 1-week\n      wash-out period to avoid any carryover effect, cross-over was performed, and patients were\n      switched to the other drug which was continued for 30 days.\n\n      Platelet function will be evaluated using a validated method: the VerifyNow System\n      (Accumetrics Inc., San Diego, CA), which is a point-of-care turbidimetry-based optical\n      detection system that measures platelet-induced aggregation. Platelet function will be\n      measured with the VerifyNow P2Y12 test at baseline and after 30 days from rosuvastatin or\n      atorvastatin administration.\n\n      Platelet reactivity will be expressed in P2Y12 reaction  units (PRU). PRU values >208 are\n      suggestive of high platelet reactivity."
