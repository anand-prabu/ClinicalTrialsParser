  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine the safety and effectiveness of non-invasive Reza
      Band UES Assist Device for the treatment of esophagopharyngeal reflux with extra-esophageal
      symptoms (chronic cough, choking, aspiration, chronic post nasal drip, globus, sore throat,
      throat clearing).

    <measure>Reflux Symptom Index (RSI)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 Weeks</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The RSI is a validated nine-item patient-administered outcome questionnaire designed to document symptoms and severity. Patients are asked to rate how nine problems have affected them on a scale of 0 (no problem) to 5 (severe problem), with a maximum total score of 45). For the purposes of this study Question 9 (relating to heartburn, etc.) will not be included in the total score for RSI. Therefore, for this study, the maximum total score will be 40. However, the data for Question 9 will be collected.</description>

    <measure>Short Form (36) Health Survey (SF-36)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 Weeks</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The SF-36 is a multidimensional health-related Quality of Life questionnaire, which measures 8 health related parameters (physical function, social function, physical role, emotional role, mental health, energy, pain, general health perceptions). Each parameter is scored from 0 to 100. The SF-36 also includes a list of 18 self-reported chronic conditions.</description>
