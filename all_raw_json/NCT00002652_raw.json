Determine the effects of this\n      regimen on cytokine-mediated symptoms in patients with Castleman's disease. III. Determine\n      the overall and progression-free survival in patients with multiple myeloma or Castelman's\n      disease treated with this regimen. IV. Determine the qualitative, quantitative, and\n      cumulative toxic effects of this regimen in these patients. V. Determine the effect of this\n      regimen on the levels of serum interleukin-6 (IL-6), soluble IL-6 receptor, and soluble\n      gp130 in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients receive suramin on days 1-5, 8, 11, 15, 19, 22, and 29. During course 1,\n      patients also receive suramin on days 36, 43, 50, 57, 64, 71, and 78. Suramin is\n      administered IV over 2 hours on day 1 of course 1 and over 1 hour on all subsequent infusion\n      days. Patients undergo rest for at least 12 weeks between each course. Patients with\n      responding disease after completion of course 2 may receive additional courses in the\n      absence of unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed weekly for 1 month, every 2 weeks\n      for 1 month, at 3 months, and then monthly thereafter if indicated.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-40 patients with multiple myeloma will be accrued for this\n      study within 10-20 months. A total of 20-40 patients with Castleman's disease will be\n      accrued for this study within 2.9-8 years."
