Also, Zolpidem (Ambien) will not be\n      permitted in the 24 hours pre-infusion. If a person chooses to participate, their dose of\n      benzodiazepine may need to be reduced so that they can do without it during the 24 hours\n      pre-infusion.\n\n      Depressed participants are randomly assigned to receive a single dose of Ketamine(0.5 mg/kg)\n      or Midazolam (0.02 mg/kg), which is given slowly, in a vein, over about 40 minutes. The\n      study is \"double-blind,\" meaning patients and study staff will not know which medication is\n      in the infusion.\n\n      If a patient does not respond to the first infusion, and s/he received Midazolam, then s/he\n      will be offered the option of a second infusion, this time with Ketamine (0.5 mg/kg). S/he\n      will then start treatment with a standard antidepressant, unless s/he is not already taking\n      one.\n\n      After the infusion(s), participants will have weekly research interviews for 6 weeks to\n      monitor response.\n\n      If a patient does have a sufficient infusion response, and s/he is not already taking an\n      antidepressant, then s/he will receive 6-weeks antidepressant research treatment with\n      Sertraline, Fluoxetine, Paroxetine, or Escitalopram, followed by open clinical treatment.\n      However, if s/he is already taking an antidepressant, then s/he will receive open treatment.\n      If s/he does not have a sufficient infusion response, then s/he will receive open treatment.\n\n      Participation in this study requires a brief inpatient stay, at no cost, at the New York\n      State Psychiatric Institute (NYSPI).\n\n      Eligible participants enrolled in this study will be offered medication management visits at\n      no cost for a total of up to 6 months from the date of enrollment combining inpatient and\n      outpatient treatment. Study medications (Sertraline, Fluoxetine, Paroxetine, Escitalopram,\n      Lorazepam, Zolpidem) will be at no cost during the 6 months. The study will not provide\n      other medications at no cost."
