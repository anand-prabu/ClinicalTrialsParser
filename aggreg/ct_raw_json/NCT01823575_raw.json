            "textblock": "Malignant ureteral obstruction often necessitates chronic urinary diversion and is\n      associated with high rates of failure with traditional double-J ureteral stents. To overcome\n      drawbacks of the double-J stent, recently, metallic stents have been used to manage for\n      palliative treatment in patients with ureteral obstruction associated with end stage\n      malignant disease. The success rates of metallic stents have been reported to be high and\n      the method proved to be useful in patients with malignant ureteral obstruction. In addition,\n      covered metallic stents have many advantages compared with bare metallic stents, such as\n      lower rate of tissue invasion and higher patency rate. However, there is little\n      investigation about comparison of clinical efficacy between covered-metallic stents and\n      double-J stents in malignant ureteral obstruction.\n\n      Therefore, investigators plan to perform a prospective randomized study to compare clinical\n      efficacy of silicone-covered metallic ureteral stent and double-J ureteral stent in patients\n      with malignant ureteral obstruction."
