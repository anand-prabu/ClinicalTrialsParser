Cohort 1 will comprise of 14 healthy elderly participants (greater\n      than or equal to [>=] 65 years) with at least 3 participants above >=75 years of age and\n      Cohort 2 will comprise of 20 healthy adult participants (18 to 55 years of age, inclusive).\n      The study comprises of 3 phases: a Screening phase, an open-label Treatment phase\n      (consisting of 1 treatment period for Cohort 1 and 2 treatment periods for Cohort 2), and a\n      Safety follow-up phase. The duration of Screening phase is of 3 weeks; duration of treatment\n      period for cohort 1 is of 3 days and for cohort 2 is 3 - 5 days (In Treatment period 1: 5\n      days for the first 7 participants who will complete the additional urine and fecal\n      collection up to 72 hours post dose and 3 days for the last 13 participants who will be\n      discharged after 24 hours; in Treatment period 2: 3 days for all participants). A washout\n      period of 5 to 10 days will separate each intranasal esketamine treatment regimen for Cohort\n      2. All participants in Cohort 1 will receive Treatment A (that is, esketamine 14 milligram\n      [mg] will be self-administered as intranasal spray into each nostril under the direct\n      supervision of the investigator or designee), whereas, all participants in Cohort 2 will\n      receive Treatment A followed by Treatment B (that is, esketamine 14 mg will be\n      self-administered as intranasal spray followed by self-administration of placebo solution\n      after 5 and 10 minutes of esketamine administration into each nostril, under the direct\n      supervision of the investigator or designee) in a fixed sequence. The total esketamine dose\n      will be 28 mg for each regimen. Blood samples will be collected for evaluation of\n      pharmacokinetic parameters pre-dose and until 24 hours post-dose for evaluation of\n      pharmacokinetic parameters. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study."
