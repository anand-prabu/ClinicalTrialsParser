            "textblock": "This trial is a continuation of the Multimodal Treatment Study of Children with Attention\n      Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (MTA Study). Continuation Aim 1 is to track the persistence\n      of intervention-related effects as the MTA sample matures into mid-adolescence, including\n      subsequent mental-health and school-related service utilization patterns as a function of\n      MTA treatment experience (treatment assignment) and outcome (degree of treatment success at\n      14 mo.).  Aim 2 is to test specific hypotheses about predictors, mediators, and moderators\n      of long-term outcome among children with ADHD (e.g., comorbidity; family functioning;\n      cognitive skills; peer relations) that may influence adolescent functioning (either\n      independent of or through initial treatment assignment and/or 14-month treatment outcomes);\n      and to compare how these predictors, mediators, and moderators are similar or dissimilar\n      within the normal comparison group.  Aim 3 is to track the patterns of risk and protective\n      factors  (including their mediation or moderation by initial treatment assignment and/or\n      outcome) involved in early and subsequent stages of developing substance-related disorders\n      and antisocial behavior.  Aim 4 is to examine the effect of initial treatment assignment and\n      degree of treatment success on later academic performance, achievement, school conduct,\n      tendency to drop out, and other adverse school outcomes.\n\n      In the original MTA design, patients were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatment conditions:\n      (1) medication only; (2) psychosocial only; (3) combined (medication and psychosocial); or\n      (4) Assessment-and-Referral condition. All but the latter were treated intensively for 14\n      months, with assessments for all subjects at baseline, 3, 9, 14, and 24 months.  The\n      original MTA design thus provides short-term (10 months post-treatment) follow-up at 24\n      months. This continuation extends the follow-up to assessments at 36, 60, and 84 months\n      after treatment.\n\n      A child may be eligible for this study if he/she:\n\n      Is 7 - 9 years old, and has Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)."
