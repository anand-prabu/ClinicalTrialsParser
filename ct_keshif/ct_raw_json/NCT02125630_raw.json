The early results of our\n      ongoing trial MF07-01 trial (a phase III randomized controlled trial of breast cancer women\n      with distant metastases at presentation who receive loco-regional treatment for intact\n      primary tumor compared with those who do not receive such treatment) showed that patients\n      with bone metastasis only have a trend toward improved survival with initial surgery."
