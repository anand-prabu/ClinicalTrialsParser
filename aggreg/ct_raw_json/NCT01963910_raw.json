Following this,   the capsaicin cream will be\n      wiped off  and 30% mannitol in vehicle cream ( isopropyl palmitate, caprylic capric\n      triglyceride, propylene glycol, ceteareth 20, cetearyl alcohol, glyceryl stearate,\n      polyethylene glycol 100 stearate, dimethicone, octyldodecanol, lecithin, ethylhexyl\n      glycerin and phenoxy ethanol)  will be applied to one half of the upper lip, and vehicle\n      cream  alone will be applied to the other half.   Cream assignment will be randomized and\n      neither the subject nor the person applying the cream will know which half upper lip has\n      which cream.  Every minute for 10 minutes,  the heat sensation  felt in each half upper lip\n      will be measured,  using a  visual scale from 0 to 10.  A repeated measures analysis of\n      variance will compare the NRS (Visual Analog Scale) scores from the 30% mannitol cream, to\n      the NRS (Visual Analog Scale)scores from the vehicle cream. Significance will be accepted if\n      P less than .05."
