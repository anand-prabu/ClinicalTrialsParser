Clinical\n      signs and symptoms of AD include cognitive impairments, especially memory and emotional\n      disturbances.  In order to accomplish this goal of prevention, a population at risk must be\n      identified.  Evidence suggests that both TBI and PTSD increase risk for cognitive decline,\n      AD, and dementia.\n\n      TBI and PTSD are common problems resulting from military service.  Thus far, there have been\n      no prospective studies using imaging and biomarkers, which directly measure changes in the\n      brain and AD pathology to study the effects of TBI and PTSD.  This proposed study will\n      provide novel data to test these hypotheses.  The results will have major implications for\n      identifying, subjects at increased risk for AD, a possible need for early detection of AD in\n      military Veterans with histories of TBI and PTSD, and a possible need to employ prevention\n      and treatment measures to avoid accelerated development of AD in US military Veterans.  This\n      study is a first step toward a larger, more comprehensive study of dementia risk factors in\n      Veterans.  The results will lead to a design and statistical powering of a prevention trial.\n       Therefore, this project could be the first step toward the prevention of AD in Veterans,\n      and in the general population."
