Assess the impact of this\n      regimen on the slope of the PSA rise in these patients. III. Determine the qualitative and\n      quantitative toxic effects of this regimen in these patients. IV. Assess the impact of this\n      regimen on the quality of life of these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: All patients remain on a reduced calcium diet for the duration of the study. Twelve\n      hours prior to treatment, patients begin drinking 4-6 glasses of extra fluid for 3 days.\n      Patients receive oral calcitriol over 4 hours weekly. Treatment continues in the absence of\n      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Quality of life is assessed at baseline, every\n      4 weeks during treatment, and at the end of the study. Patients are followed for at least 1\n      month.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-25 patients will be accrued for this study."
