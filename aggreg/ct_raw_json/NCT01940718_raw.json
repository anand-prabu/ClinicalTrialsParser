This clinical trial will investigate the potential benefit of precise\n      testosterone replacement for ameliorating priapism and improving psychological well-being in\n      hypogonadal men with SCD (sickle cell disease).\n\n      This clinical trial will satisfy Specific Aim #3 in the translational research proposal: To\n      evaluate the efficacy of testosterone replacement therapy on the frequency of recurrent\n      priapism in patients with SCD.  We will test the sub-hypothesis that T replacement to\n      achieve serum T concentrations at a target range reduces recurrent priapism.  This aim will\n      involve subjective and objective assessments of priapism occurrences and erectile ability\n      including priapism inventory instruments, standardized questionnaires of erectile function\n      and quality of life, and Rigiscan\u2122 erection monitoring in a 3-month \"pilot\" investigation."
