      This is a research study to compare the efficacy of aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) and
      pneumatic compression devices versus enoxaparin (also known as Lovenox) and pneumatic
      compression devices in preventing deep vein thrombosis in patients with pelvic and lower
      extremity malignant tumors and undergoing surgery. Pneumatic compression devices are also
      known as sequential compression devices and are inflatable compression sleeves that are
      placed around patient's legs to reduce the risk of clot formation deep vein thrombosis.
      Pneumatic compression devices are made of a soft material that wraps around the lower leg
      and periodically squeeze the calf. A deep vein thrombosis is a blood clot. Most hospitalized
      patients wear these as a preventive measure. Pneumatic compression devices alone are not
      sufficient to prevent deep vein thrombosis formation. Therefore, medicines, such as aspirin
      and enoxaparin are utilized. Both drugs are used for prevention, but there are no studies in
      patients with musculoskeletal tumors which have determined whether one drug is better than
      another. The knowledge gained from this study will determine whether aspirin and pneumatic
      compression devices is the same or better than enoxaparin and pneumatic compression devices
      in preventing deep vein thrombosis in this patient population and may result in fewer wound
      and bleeding complications

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To perform a randomized prospective study to determine efficacy of acetylsalicylic acid
      (ASA)+pneumatic compression device (PCD) prophylaxis compared to low-molecular weight
      heparin (LMWH)+PCD in patients undergoing orthopaedic procedures for musculoskeletal
      neoplasms (MSN) of the pelvis and lower extremity.

      II. To prove that ASA+PCD is clinically equivalent to or better than LMWH+PCD in providing
      deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis in this patient population and results in fewer major
      bleeding complications.

      III. To measure rates of postoperative DVT and pulmonary embolism (PE) as primary outcomes.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To measure secondary outcomes including rates of readmission, reoperation, bleeding
      complications (including hematoma formation and prolonged wound drainage), and death.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive acetylsalicylic acid orally (PO) twice daily (BID) and wear PCD on
      days 1-28 after surgery.

      ARM II: Patients receive enoxaparin subcutaneously (SC) once daily (QD) and wear PCD on days
      1-28 after surgery.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, and 3
      months.

    <description>This study will test if the ASA+PCD treatment group has a DVT rate (P1) not more than the DVT rate of the LMWH+PCD treatment group (P0) using a one sided test for these two proportions. Statistical significance will be defined as p &lt; 0.05.</description>
