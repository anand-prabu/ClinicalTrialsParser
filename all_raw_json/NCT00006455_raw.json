Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. It is\n      not yet known which combination chemotherapy regimen is more effective for treating\n      anaplastic large cell lymphoma.\n\n      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying several different regimens of\n      combination chemotherapy to compare how well they work in treating children with anaplastic\n      large cell lymphoma."
