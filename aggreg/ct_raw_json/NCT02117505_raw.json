The duration of study will be approximately of 5 weeks\n      per participant. The study consists of 3 parts: Screening (that is, 21 days before study\n      commences on Day 1); Open-label Treatment (consists of 2 single-dose treatments, either\n      JNJ-54781532 formulation 1 [reference] or JNJ-54781532 formulation 2 [test]), in subsequent\n      2-treatment periods, each separated with washout period of 7 days); and End-of-Study (done\n      upon completion of the 72-hour pharmacokinetic sampling on Day 4 of Period 2, or at the time\n      of early withdrawal). All the eligible participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of the 2\n      treatment sequences to ensure that they receive both of the following treatments, one in\n      each period. Followed by an overnight fast of at least 10 hours participants will be\n      administered with study treatment 30 minutes after high-fat, high-calorie breakfast.\n      Participants will not be allowed to have food until 4 hours of drug administration. Blood\n      samples will be collected for evaluation of pharmacokinetics at pre-dose and post-dose of\n      study treatment. Relative bioavailability of two formulations of JNJ-54781532 (test and\n      reference) will be evaluated primarily. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout\n      the study."
