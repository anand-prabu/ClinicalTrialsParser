Therefore, the investigators need to establish\n      guidelines in order to treat these pathologies. Standard treatments such as surgery or\n      interventional radiology are of limited efficacy and related to a high level of recurrences\n      as well as complications. Recent preclinical studies have shown the important role of the\n      PI3Kinase/AKT/mTor pathway on the development and the lymphatic-vascular organisations\n      suggesting an appealing therapeutic target to treat patients with complex vascular\n      malformations.\n\n      The aim of this clinical study is to prospectively evaluate the efficacy and the safety of\n      the Rapamycin, an mTOR inhibitor, to treat children and adults with microcystic lymphatic\n      malformations, general lymphatics abnormalities (GLA) or complex vascular malformations for\n      which conventional therapies as surgery or sclerotherapy are ineffective or associated with\n      high risk of important complications."
