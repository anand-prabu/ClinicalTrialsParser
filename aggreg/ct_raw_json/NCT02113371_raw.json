The\n      intervention is a 12-month team-based, peer-led scripted curriculum that integrates health\n      promotion and protection topics, as well as proven elements of social support groups for\n      caregivers. The investigators hypothesize that this intervention will increase measures of\n      experienced community of practice, well-being, and diet, exercise, and safety behaviors, as\n      compared to a usual practices control condition."

            "textblock": "Home care workers have an injury rate that is nearly four times higher than the US average\n      and are at elevated risk for mental and physical health problems. These low income workers,\n      who are predominantly female and older than 40, assist the elderly and disabled with\n      self-care and mobility in private homes. Although interventions developed for other\n      caregiver populations improve well being and knowledge, they have largely failed to address\n      illness and injury prevention behaviors. No prior study has addressed the lack of\n      occupational social support structures for home care workers. The long term goal of this\n      project is to create a model work structure for promoting and protecting home care worker\n      health that can be disseminated to other states. The objective of this study is to develop\n      and evaluate a new team-based intervention for self-employed home care workers enrolled in\n      Oregon public programs. Workers will be organized into neighborhood based Total Worker\n      Health teams that meet regularly for education and social support. The proposed curriculum\n      will integrate health promotion and protection topics, and will use established team-based\n      education methods as well as proven elements of social support groups for caregivers.\n\n      The primary hypotheses are that organizing home care workers into Total Worker Health teams\n      will increase (1) Experienced community of practice, (2) Well-being, and (3) Prevention\n      behaviors in the domains of diet, exercise, and safety.\n\n      To test these hypotheses the investigators will conduct a cluster randomized controlled\n      trial of the intervention.\n\n      The project will take place over three years and accomplish three specific aims:\n\n        1. Develop and Pilot Test a Total Worker Health Team Curriculum for Home Care Workers\n           During the first year of the project the investigators will develop and pilot test a\n           Total Worker Health team curriculum with a single group of home care workers identified\n           as leaders by the Service Employees International Union (SEIU Local 503). Pilot test\n           participants will later serve as team leaders in the randomized controlled trial in Aim\n           2. Curriculum materials will include educational workbooks, active home work\n           assignments, and scripted meeting facilitation guides for team leaders. The curriculum\n           will be designed to establish functioning Total Worker Health teams in 6 months using a\n           half-day team building orientation followed by structured monthly educational and\n           supportive team meetings. Study methods will be evaluated and revised based on pilot\n           participants' feedback about the acceptability of the goals, procedures, and outcomes\n           of intervention activities.\n\n        2. Determine the Effectiveness of Total Worker Health Teams with a Randomized Controlled\n           Trial The investigators will recruit a sample home care workers from the Portland and\n           Eugene metro areas. This sample will then be organized into neighborhood clusters and\n           randomly assigned to intervention and control conditions. Evaluation measures will be\n           collected from all participants at pre-intervention (month 0), post-intervention (month\n           6), and follow-up (month 12) time points. Intervention participants will complete the\n           Total Worker Health curriculum while control participants receive usual treatment.\n           Intervention effectiveness will be established at the 6-month time point through\n           between group comparisons on changes in experienced community of practice, well-being,\n           and prevention behaviors (diet, exercise, and safety). The investigators will also\n           measure body composition and fitness, metabolic and heart disease biomarkers, job\n           stress, social support, musculoskeletal symptoms, and illness/injuries.\n\n        3. Measure the Integrity of Sustained Total Worker Health Team Meetings and Maintenance at\n           Follow-Up. After each Total Worker Health team completes the intervention curriculum,\n           they will be provided with funding and a structured guide to sustain regular team\n           meetings for an additional 6 months. Researchers will observe and monitor team meetings\n           during this follow-up period to measure participation level and adherence to the\n           prescribed team meeting structure. The integrity scores for Total Worker Health team\n           meetings and potential maintenance of between group intervention effects will be\n           evaluated at the 12-month (follow up) time point."
