Artificial neural networks\n      have opened new horizons in learning about the natural history of diseases and predicting\n      cardiac disease.\n\n      Methods: A total of 935 cardiac patients with chest pain and nondiagnostic electrocardiogram\n      (ECG) were enrolled and followed for 2 weeks in two groups based on the appearance of\n      myocardial infarction. Two types of data were used for all patients: nominal (clinical data)\n      and quantitative (ECG findings). Two different artificial neural networks - radial basis\n      function (RBF) and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) - were used."
