Determine the safety of total body irradiation and fludarabine followed by\n      allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell or bone marrow transplantation in combination with\n      cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil for establishing mixed chimerism in patients with\n      inherited disorders.\n\n      II. Determine whether this regimen can establish mixed chimerism in these patients.\n\n      III. Determine whether mixed chimerism is sufficient to reverse disease symptoms in these\n      patients.\n\n      IV. Determine the safety of donor lymphocyte infusions to eliminate persistent disease in\n      these patients with mixed chimerism."
