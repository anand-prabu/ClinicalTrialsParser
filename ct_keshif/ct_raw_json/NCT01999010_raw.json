One potential advantage of mental health telemetry (MHT), which use cell phones to\n      collect mood journal data, is that electronic journal data can easily be converted into\n      graphical records, allowing people living with MDD to readily spot trends, correlations, or\n      patterns in ways that would be quite challenging using paper diaries. This information\n      should make it easier to recognize and evaluate changes in mental health status -- the first\n      two steps in the process of self-management. The investigators will develop and deploy a\n      visualization module for patients with which to explore their own MHT data sets on the same\n      cell phones which they record their journals, and test the investigators hypotheses that\n      their enhanced MHT system will (i) improve patients' ability to self-manage MDD and (ii)\n      enhance their quality-of-life.\n\n      The study is a non-randomized, un-blinded, A-B-A' (modified single-subject withdrawal\n      design, with user choice of treatment or withdrawal in the A' stage) study, to explore the\n      utility of MHT as a tool for enhancing self-management and QoL for persons living with MDD.\n      The aims of this study are to explore the impact of MHT on subjects' self-management and\n      QoL, and to gauge participants' perceptions of MHT's utility."
