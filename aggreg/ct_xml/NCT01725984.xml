    <textblock>
      A single-center retrospective chart review of AdVance and AdVance XP subject data, combined
      with prospective follow-up of the same subjects to confirm continence, adverse event, and
      quality of life status. This study includes patients previously implanted with an AdVance or
      AdVance XP male sling.

          3. Treatment with a urethral sling system, an AMS Sphincter 800®, or any implanted
             device for the treatment of urinary incontinence (not including bulking agents) prior
             to sling placement

          4. TURP procedure prior to sling placement

          5. Urge predominant incontinence prior to sling placement
