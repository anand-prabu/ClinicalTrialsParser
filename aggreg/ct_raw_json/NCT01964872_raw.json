If all optional cohorts are included, up to 144 participants may be\n      enrolled. This study will consist of up to four parts. Part 1 contains up to 3 subparts:\n      Part 1a is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, single ascending dose design (SAD) with a\n      liquid formulation (Formulation A); Part 1b is an open-label (identity of assigned study\n      drug will be known), single dose evaluation of a capsule formulation (Formulation B); and\n      Part 1c is an optional open-label, single dose evaluation of a capsule formulation\n      (Formulation C). Part 2 is the completion of the double-blind, placebo-controlled SAD after\n      a formulation has been selected based on Parts 1a, 1b, and 1c (if applicable). Part 3 is a\n      double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple ascending dose design (MAD). Doses for Part 3\n      will be determined based on the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (study of what\n      the body does to a drug) in Parts 1 and 2. Part 4 is an optional double-blind,\n      placebo-controlled, single dose evaluation in older healthy male participants. Serial\n      pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics (study of what a drug does to the body) samples will be\n      collected and safety will be monitored throughout the study."
