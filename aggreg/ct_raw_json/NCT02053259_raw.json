All\n      four groups will receive the intervention via a semi-automated text message system developed\n      by the investigators study team.\n\n      The primary aim of this study will be to:\n\n        1. Evaluate whether the adaptive interventions result in greater change in physical\n           activity (pedometer-measured steps/day) compared to the static Intervention groups.\n           HYPOTHESES: Participants in the adaptive interventions will increase their steps/day\n           more than participants in the Static Intervention groups.  The Adaptive Goals and\n           Reinforcement Group will outperform the other 3 groups.\n\n           The secondary aims of this study will be to:\n\n        2. Evaluate the effectiveness of the adaptive and static goal interventions in improving\n           anthropometric, cardiovascular fitness, and cardiometabolic risk factors.  HYPOTHESES:\n           Participants in the adaptive interventions will show greater improvements in fitness,\n           lean and fat body mass, and serum biomarkers than participants in the Static\n           Intervention groups.  The Adaptive Goals and Reinforcement Group will outperform the\n           other 3 groups.\n\n        3. to assess participants' satisfaction with the overall program."
