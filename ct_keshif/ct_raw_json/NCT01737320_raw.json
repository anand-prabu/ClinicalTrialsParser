We will permit the inclusion of patients with retained CVCs in whom\n                  the source of the bacteremia is not the CVC.\n\n          2. Polymicrobial growth in blood cultures involving gram-positive or anaerobes in\n             addition to gram-negatives (defined as either growth of two or more different species\n             of microorganisms in the same blood culture, or growth of different species in two or\n             more separate blood cultures within the same episode (< 48 h) and with clinical or\n             microbiological evidence of the same source).\n\n          3.

Clinical instability during the 48 hours before randomization, defined as mean blood\n             pressure<60 mmHg despite adequate fluid resuscitation or vasopressors support.\n\n          6. Repeated positive blood cultures for the same organism beyond initial blood cultures.\n\n          7. Uncontrolled focus of infection: e.g. an abscess that was not drained sufficiently;\n             non-drained moderate to severe hydronephrosis in a patient with bacteremia of urinary\n             source; deep seated intra-abdominal infections that were not drained properly.\n\n          8. Fever > 38.0C measured at least twice in the 48 h prior to recruitment; or > 38.5C\n             once during the 48 h; or hypothermia <35.5C measured once during the 48 h.\n\n          9.
