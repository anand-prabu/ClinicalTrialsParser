            "textblock": "BACKGROUND:\n\n      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is the only one of the top four or five leading causes\n      of death in the U.S. with worsening epidemiological trends. Cigarette smoking accounts for\n      approximately 85 percent-90 percent of cases, but the other 10 percent-15 percent of the\n      attributable risk still represents a substantial fraction of this disease that remains\n      unexplained. Recently, several studies, in various countries, have addressed whether certain\n      occupational exposures (primarily those relating to dusts, vapors, gases, and/or fumes) are\n      potential risk factors for COPD. Most of these studies have shown elevated odds ratios or\n      relative risks, although not always to a statistically significant level.\n\n      DESIGN NARRATIVE:\n\n      A population sample of the continental United States of those aged 55-75, supplemented by an\n      enriched sample in geographic \"hot spots\" identified by the National Institute for\n      Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) through respiratory diseases mapping. Structured\n      telephone interviews assessed demographics, health status, smoking exposures, and\n      occupational histories. High risk jobs were coded using a job matrix system independent of\n      subject report of specific exposures. Two hundred thirty-four of those with COPD, with\n      over-sampling of those with greater severity, were followed at 12-14 months to assess health\n      status and health services utilization, as well as decrements in quality of life."
