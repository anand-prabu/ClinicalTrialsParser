      Research Hypothesis: icotinib administered  in combination with gemcitabine has an
      acceptable safety profile in subjects with locally advanced, unresectable or metastatic
      pancreatic adenocarcinoma.The primary objective is to determine the safety profile of
      icotinib in combination with gemcitabine in subjects with locally advanced, unresectable or
      metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

    <description>Three dose of icotinib are designed to be evaluated, 125 mg three times per day, 250 mg three times per day, and 375 mg three times per day. Dose escalations are based on predefined dose escalation decision rules. The Maximum Administered Dose (MAD) was reached at the dose level when at least 30% patients developed a dose limited toxicity.
Gemcitabine: 1000 mg/m2 on Days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28 day cycle by IV administration every 4 weeks.</description>
