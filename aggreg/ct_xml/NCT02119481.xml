  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to examine the effects of a mindfulness-based stress
      reduction training program, delivered in individual web-based sessions, among breast cancer
      patients. The objectives are to study and answer questions regarding effects of the such
      training in a randomized controlled trial including the following outcome measures: physical
      and mental health status, perceived stress, post-traumatic stress symptoms, psychological
      well-being, and sleep quality. In addition to the primary aim, the investigators plan to
      explore potential mechanisms through which mindfulness training lead to improvement in
      perceived stress, well-being and sleep-quality. This will be studied by mediational
      analyses.
