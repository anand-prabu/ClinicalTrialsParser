Applying topical imiquimod before abnormal cervical cells are removed\n      may be effective in preventing cervical cancer.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to study the effectiveness of applying topical imiquimod\n      before abnormal cervical cells are removed in preventing cervical cancer in patients who\n      have recurrent or persistent cervical neoplasia."

Patients are stratified according to\n      participating center, disease (primary vs recurrent or persistent), severity of dysplasia\n      (grade I vs grade II vs grade III), current tobacco use (yes vs no), planned surgical\n      procedure (excisional vs laser vs cryotherapy vs other), and time since first abnormal Pap\n      smear, including pathology of ascus favor dysplasia (less than 1 year vs 1-3 years vs more\n      than 3 years). Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients undergo ablative or excisional therapy.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients have topical imiquimod applied to the cervix for 6-10 hours twice\n           weekly for a total of 5 doses. Within 3-4 weeks after the final application, patients\n           undergo ablative or excisional therapy.\n\n      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, after last dose of study drug (arm II only), 3-5\n      days after ablation or excisional therapy, at 3 months, and then annually thereafter.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3-4 months until 2 consecutive normal Pap smears or colposcopic\n      exams, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually until 5 years after completion of study\n      therapy.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 66-152 (33-76 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this\n      study within 18 months."
