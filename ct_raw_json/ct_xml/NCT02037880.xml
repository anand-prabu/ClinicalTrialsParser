    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess rates of decline in motor and cognitive functional
      measures, and to assess potential biomarkers, in order to identify potential outcome measure
      appropriate for use in therapeutic clinical trials.

    <textblock>
      Mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) type III (Sanfilippo syndrome) is a group of four devastating
      genetic diseases that result in the abnormal accumulation of glycosaminoglycans in body
      tissues.  In MPSIII the predominant symptoms occur due to accumulation within the central
      nervous system (CNS), including the brain and spinal cord, resulting in cognitive decline,
      motor dysfunction, and eventual death.

      In anticipation for future therapeutic studies for MPSIIIA and MPSIIIB, we are performing a
      natural history study with the following goals:

        1. To identify individual rates of decline in motor and cognitive function in a cohort of
           potential clinical trial patients.

        2. To study the natural history of outcome measures in order to assess their
           appropriateness as outcomes in an eventual trial.

        3. To establish baseline functional data in patients who will be potential candidates for
           an eventual trial.

        4. To identify biomarkers of disease progression over a 12-month interval, including
           changes in brain MRI and in cerebrospinal fluid.

      This study will last a year. Patients in this study will need to come to Nationwide
      Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio three times: at enrollment (visit 1), at 6 months
      (visit 2), and at 12 months (visit 3). During visits 1 and 3, an MRI and a lumbar puncture
      will be performed.
