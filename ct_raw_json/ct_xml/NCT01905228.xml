  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to determine the maximally tolerated dose and
      recommended Phase 2 dose of CBL0137 when administered intravenously (IV) to patients with
      metastatic or unresectable advanced solid malignancies or refractory lymphomas.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients must have documented recurrent or refractory solid tumors, or refractory lymphomas;
      patients enrolled in the dose-expansion part of the trial must have least one lesion that
      may qualify as a target lesion based on the RECIST 1.1 criteria.  Following the provision of
      signed informed consent, patients will be screened for entry into the study.  Screening
      numbers will be assigned by the site.  Patients who do not meet entry criteria will not have
      their screening data entered into the database.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have histological or cytological evidence of a solid neoplasm or
             lymphoma

          -  Patients enrolled in the expansion cohort must have at least one measureable lesion
             as defined by the RECIST 1.1 criteria

          -  Patients must:

               -  have metastatic or unresectable advanced solid tumors or refractory lymphomas
                  that have recurred or progressed following standard therapy or

               -  no longer be candidates for standard therapy or

               -  have tumors for which there is no standard therapy

          -  Patients must be ambulatory and have an ECOG Performance Score of 0 or 1;

          -  Patients or their legal representative must be able to provide written informed
             consent;

          -  Patients must have adequate bone marrow reserve as evidenced by:

               -  White Blood Cell Count (WBC) &gt; 3,000/µL

               -  Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) &gt; 1,500/µL

               -  Platelet count (PLT) &gt; 100,000/µL

               -  Hemoglobin (HGB) &gt; 9.0 gm/dL (patients may be transfused to achieve this HGB
                  level);

          -  Patients must have adequate hepatic function as evidenced by:

               -  Serum AST/ALT &lt; 3X the upper limit of normal (ULN) for the reference lab (&lt; 5X
                  the ULN for patients with known hepatic metastases)

               -  Serum bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x the ULN for the reference lab;

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with active infection or with a fever &gt; 38.50 C within 3 days of the first
             scheduled day of dosing;

          -  Patients with primary CNS tumors or symptomatic CNS metastases who have not undergone
             surgery and/or radiotherapy and/or who are not neurologically stable;

          -  Patients with known hypersensitivity to any of the components of CBL0137;

          -  Patients who are receiving concurrent investigational therapy; for patients who have
             recently received investigational therapy, 5 half-lives must have elapsed between the
             last dose of investigational drug and the first dose of CBL0137.  If the half-live is
             unknown, 4 weeks must have elapsed between the last dose of investigational drug and
             the first dose of CBL0137 (investigational therapy is defined as treatment for which
             there is currently no regulatory authority approved indication in the United States);

          -  Males with mean QTcF values of &gt; 450 msec and females with QTcF values of &gt; 470 msec
             following 3 ECGs conducted 5 minutes apart from each other; patients who are known to
             have congenital prolonged QT syndromes; or patients who are on medications known to
             cause prolonged QT intervals on ECG;

        Please speak with the PI for the complete Inclusion/Exclusion listing.
