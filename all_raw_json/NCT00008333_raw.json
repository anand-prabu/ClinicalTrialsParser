Determine the time to\n      progression in patients treated with this drug. III. Determine the toxicity of this drug in\n      these patients. IV. Determine whether there is a perceived preference for this oral\n      administration in these patients. V. Determine the quality of life of these patients when\n      treated with this drug. VI. Assess individual variation in responses, pharmacokinetic\n      parameters, and/or biological correlates in patients treated with this drug.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral vinorelbine on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Treatment repeats every\n      28 days for 4-6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n      Quality of life is assessed at baseline and after 8 weeks of therapy. Patients are followed\n      every 3 months for 5 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 60 patients will be accrued for this study within 1.3 years."
