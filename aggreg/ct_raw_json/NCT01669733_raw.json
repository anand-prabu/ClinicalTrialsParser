Through the facilitation of live and/or recorded music listening, we will\n      examine the perception of patient anxiety, the total amount of propofol required to obtain a\n      BIS reading of 70, and recovery time in the PACU.  We will also collect data and evaluate\n      the effect of live and/or recorded music on patient satisfaction. It is hypothesized that:\n\n        1. Patients in the live and recorded music groups will experience less anxiety than the\n           non-music (standard care) group.\n\n        2. Patients in the live and recorded music groups will experience a reduction in the\n           amount of anesthesia needed to reach a state of moderate sedation compared to the\n           non-music (standard care) group."

If the patient is\n      randomly selected for the recorded music group, she will be given an iPod and headphones and\n      will listen to a recorded version of her preferred song. If the patient is randomly selected\n      for the control group, she will receive standard care and no music. Pre/posttests will be\n      given using a Global Anxiety Visual Analog Scale (GA-VAS).\n\n      Music therapy's effect on propofol requirements intraoperatively:\n\n      Subjects in the live music group and subjects in the recorded music group will listen to\n      recorded music intraoperatively.  All subjects will receive equal amounts of fentanyl and\n      versed. Subjects will receive fentanyl in the amount of 1 microgram per kilogram and versed\n      (midazolam) in the amount of 0.02 milligrams per kilogram from the nurse anesthetist.  An\n      ipod with headphones will be given to the subject when she is being prepared to move to the\n      operating room.  The board certified music therapist will initiate recorded music (harp\n      selections).  Recorded music will be relaxing harp selections. The board certified music\n      therapist will accompany the subject to the operating room and assure volume levels and\n      electronic equipment function properly.\n\n      Anesthesia personnel will apply BIS monitor before propofol administration. Anesthesia\n      personnel will titrate propofol to obtain BIS reading of 70 or lower and record the propofol\n      in micrograms per kilogram per minute, infusing at that point.  Signal Quality Index (SQI)\n      will be recorded when the BIS reaches 70 to give credibility to the BIS monitor. SQI is a\n      measure of the signal quality for the EEG channel source and is calculated based on\n      impedance data, artifact, and other variables.  The total amount of propofol for the case\n      will be recorded as total milligrams received. Anesthesia personnel will record Observer's\n      Assessment of the Alertness/Sedation (OAA/S) when BIS monitor reaches 70 or below as\n      incidental data point.  A score of 3 on OAA/S indicates that the patient responds only after\n      mild prodding and shaking. OAA/S will be compared to BIS reading.\n\n      Time in PACU and Patient Satisfaction:\n\n      Recorded music will continue playing until the subject has met discharge criteria according\n      to University Hospital's policy and procedure. The amount of time between when the patient\n      leaves the operating room and meets discharge criteria (determined by nurse) will be\n      recorded. Patient satisfaction will be recorded using a Likert scale: 7= highly satisfied;\n      1=not at all satisfied after the subject has met her discharge criteria.\n\n      Controls: The control group subjects will receive standard anesthesia, nursing and surgical\n      care. All rating procedures will be the same. Controls will wear noise reducing headphones.\n      The music therapist will not accompany control patients following surgery. When the trial is\n      complete, the music therapist will offer the control subject a CD of the recorded music once\n      she has met discharge criteria and all data is recorded. This will occur for the sake of\n      ethics."
