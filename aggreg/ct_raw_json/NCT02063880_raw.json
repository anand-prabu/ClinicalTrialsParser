Children\n      will be randomized to randomized to urgent (<48 hours) versus early antiretroviral therapy\n      (7-14 days).  This trial will be unblinded.\n\n      Population: Hospitalized HIV-1 infected children who are antiretroviral therapy (ART) na\u00efve\n      \u2264 12 years of age.\n\n      Sample size: 360 children will be randomized (180 per arm).\n\n      Treatment: All infants will be treated with ART according to World Health Organization (WHO)\n      and Kenyan national guidelines.\n\n      Study duration: Enrollment into the study will occur over the course of 36-48 months and\n      each infant will be routinely followed for a maximum of 6 months.\n\n      Study site: Kenyan hospitals.\n\n      Primary hypothesis:\n\n      HIV-1 infected children hospitalized with severe co-infection either may be unsalvageable\n      due to too far advanced immunosuppression/co-infection or may benefit from urgent ART.\n\n      Secondary hypotheses:\n\n      Urgent ART during an acute infection could potentially result in increased risk of immune\n      reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) or drug toxicities/interactions.\n\n      Specific aims:\n\n        1. To compare the 6 month all-cause mortality rate, incidence of immune reconstitution\n           inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), and incidence of drug toxicity in HIV-1 infected children\n           (\u2264 12 years old) presenting to hospital with a serious infection randomized to urgent\n           (<48 hours) versus early ART (7-14 days).\n\n        2. To determine co-factors for mortality, IRIS, and drug toxicity.  Potential cofactors\n           will include: baseline weight-for-age, height-for-age, weight-for-height (Z-scores),\n           CD4, HIV-1 RNA, type of co-infection, age, rate of viral load and CD4 change following\n           ART, immune activation markers, pathogen and HIV-1 specific immune responses.\n\n      Secondary aim: To determine etiologies of IRIS and to compare immune reconstitution to HIV,\n      TB, EBV and CMV following ART overall and in each trial arm."
