Drugs used in\n      chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cell from dividing so they stop growing or\n      die. Combining chemotherapy with monoclonal antibody therapy may kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of cetuximab plus gemcitabine in treating\n      patients who have locally advanced, metastatic, or recurrent cancer of the pancreas."

Determine objective response, time to progression, survival, clinical benefit\n      response, and quality of life of patients with locally advanced, metastatic, or recurrent\n      adenocarcinoma of the pancreas when treated with cetuximab and gemcitabine. II. Determine\n      the safety and toxicity profile of this regimen in this patient population.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive a test dose of cetuximab IV over 10\n      minutes followed by a 30 minute observation period. Following observation, patients receive\n      a loading dose of cetuximab IV over 1-2 hours followed 1 hour later by gemcitabine IV over\n      30 minutes weekly for 7 weeks. Following 1 week of rest, patients with stable or responding\n      disease continue treatment for a maximum of 6 months. During subsequent courses, patients\n      receive maintenance doses of cetuximab IV over 1 hour weekly for 8 weeks. Gemcitabine IV is\n      administered over 30 minutes weekly for 3 weeks, followed by 1 week of rest, and then\n      repeated for a total treatment course of 8 weeks. Treatment continues in the absence of\n      unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Quality of life is assessed at baseline, after\n      each course of therapy, and at 3 months after therapy. Patients are followed every 3 months\n      until evidence of disease progression.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A minimum of 40 patients will be accrued for this study within 8 months."
