      Primary:

        -  Demonstrate the utility of an electronic data capture (EDC) system (CareExchange™)
           using infusion nurse and patient measured physical, quality of life (QOL), respiratory,
           laboratory, and disability assessments in patients with Primary Immunodeficiency
           Disease (PIDD).

      Secondary:

        -  Change in Intravenous/Subcutaneous Immunoglobulin (IVIg/SCIg) dose effects measured
           outcomes.

        -  Change in IVIg/SCIg dose timing effects measured outcomes.

        -  Change in patient status is reflected in measured outcomes.

        -  Assess the value to physicians from collected outcomes data.

        -  Identify types of patients by response to IVIg/SCIg therapies (well maintained,
           problematic, etc.).

        -  Change in response rate as measured by outcomes to IVIg/SCIg therapies by disease
           state, co-morbidities, and demographics.

      This is a prospective, observational evaluation of immunoglobulin (Ig) therapy in consenting
      PIDD adult and assenting pediatric subjects who receive infusion services from AxelaCare
      Health Solutions, LLC.  Subjects meeting all inclusion criteria who have provided informed
      consent/assent for trial participation will have validated, physician-prescribed,
      standard-of-care outcome measures, and Ig administration information recorded during normal
      home infusion visits.  There will also be standard-of-care questions captured within some
      outcome measures recorded during normal home infusion visits that may be at a frequency
      and/or combination which may not be considered routine clinical care by some physicians who
      treat for this medical condition.  Collected data will be de-identified and aggregated into
      cohorts of like diagnosis for trend analysis.
