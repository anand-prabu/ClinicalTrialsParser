    <textblock>
      This is a 12 month non-interventional study with solifenacin succinate, evaluating the
      effect of solifenacin on quality of life (QoL) of patients previously treated with
      antimuscarinics (Males and Females with Overactive Bladder (OAB) symptoms withdrawing their
      treatment with antimuscarinics because of safety and/or efficacy reasons) - measured by
      Perception of Treatment Satisfaction (TS-VAS) and to evaluate the effect of solifenacin on
      quality of life measured by Over Active Bladder-q Short Form (OAB-q SF), EuroQol Group
      scoring system (EQ-5D-5L).
