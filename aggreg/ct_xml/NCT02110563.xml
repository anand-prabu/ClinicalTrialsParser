  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of the investigational
      anticancer drug DCR-MYC.  DCR-MYC is a novel synthetic double-stranded RNA in a stable lipid
      particle suspension that targets the oncogene MYC.  MYC oncogene activation is important to
      the growth of many hematologic and solid tumor malignancies.  In this study the Sponsor
      proposes to study DCR-MYC and its ability to inhibit MYC and thereby inhibit cancer cell
      growth.

      In this first-in human study, DCR-MYC will be administered by 1 hour intravenous (IV)
      infusion, once weekly for 3 weeks followed by a rest week (4 weeks = 1 cycle), to patients
      with either solid tumor malignancies, multiple myeloma, or non-Hodgkins lymphoma that have
      not responded to previous treatment.  The highest safe dose of DCR-MYC that can be
      administered will be identified.  In addition, the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile, potential
      pharmacodynamic (PD) effects, as well as the antitumor activity of DCR-MYC will be
      evaluated.
