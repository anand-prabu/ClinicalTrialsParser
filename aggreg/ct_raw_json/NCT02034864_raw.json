Manipulative treatments represent en emerging therapy in\n      this area, although studies assessing their effectiveness are limited and often biased. The\n      purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of two manual therapies administered by\n      osteopaths on improving functional recovery in sub-acute and chronic low back pain less than\n      1 year. A standardised osteopathic manipulative treatment is compare to a placebo of\n      osteopathic manipulative treatment."
