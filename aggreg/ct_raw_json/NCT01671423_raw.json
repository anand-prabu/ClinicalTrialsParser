This group of symptoms is called inflammation, and is\n      caused by the body's immune system responding to the infection. Standard care for cellulitis\n      is using antibiotics to destroy the infection, but the inflammation can persist and cause a\n      great deal of pain. The hypothesis of this study is that adding a single dose of an oral\n      steroid (prednisone), which tempers the immune response, will reduce inflammation, reduce\n      pain, and speed recovery. This hypothesis will be examined by recruiting a group of patients\n      with cellulitis, and randomizing them to two sub-groups: one group will receive a dose of\n      prednisone, while the other group will receive a placebo. Neither group will know what they\n      received unless there is a problem. These subjects will be followed up at the 48 hour mark\n      and the 7 day mark, and will have their results compared."
