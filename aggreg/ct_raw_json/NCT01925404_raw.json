            "textblock": "Encouraging greater levels of physical activity is critical to improving health among\n      Americans, who are largely sedentary. Neighborhood parks are resources for physical activity\n      that are available to most Americans within a couple miles of their homes, yet many\n      residents are unaware of the programs and facilities available.  Previous research indicates\n      that park use is related to park programming and outreach.  Because funding for parks is\n      limited, low-cost interventions are needed to attract more people to parks to engage in\n      moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. While many community-based organizations would like\n      to invest in efforts that increase physical activity, few low-cost park programs are\n      documented to be both scalable and cost-effective. Effective programs that can be replicated\n      to make population-level impacts are needed. The goal of this study is to develop and test\n      an enhanced marketing approach to attract people to parks and 2 low-cost community-level\n      approaches to promoting physical activity, singly and in combination, in 48 park settings in\n      Los Angeles. Using a full factorial design we will compare the efficacy of: (a) organized\n      programs promoting walking and fitness activities and (b) an incentive approach adopting the\n      \"frequent user\" strategy now popular in commercial settings. We will test these approaches\n      with and without an enhanced marketing/outreach component using special events to attract\n      people to the park so they are aware of the programs and facilities there. We will also\n      quantify the cost effectiveness of each intervention; identify which age, gender and\n      racial/ethnic groups benefit the most from these interventions; and develop and disseminate\n      materials describing procedures and lessons learned so they can be applied by parks\n      throughout the country."
