            "textblock": "Stroke remains a major cause of death and disability globally, accounting for 46.6 million\n      disability adjusted life-years (DALYs) worldwide. More than 85% of all stroke-related deaths\n      occur in low- and middle-income (LMI) countries. In a study from our center in Pakistan, the\n      all-cause mortality due to stroke was 12.9% in the first year. Vascular causes in general\n      and recurrent stroke in particular accounted for the bulk of the mortality cases. Recurrence\n      of a stroke in Pakistan is documented to be as high as 53% in the first year, as opposed to\n      international rates of approximately 30% in the first month. Evidence based guidelines\n      recommend risk factor control with antiplatelet agents, anti-hypertensive medications, lipid\n      lowering drugs and appropriate anti-diabetic therapy to reduce the risk of stroke\n      recurrence. When taken together, the combination of an antihypertensive, statin and\n      antiplatelet agent can reduce total stroke risk by 80%.\n\n      However, the impact of drugs used for secondary stroke prevention relies heavily upon\n      patient adherence. Adherence is defined as \"the extent to which a person's behavior - taking\n      medication, following a diet, and/or executing lifestyle changes, corresponds with agreed\n      recommendations from a health care provider.\" It is said that optimal adherence to\n      medications may reduce the risk of a poor outcome by 26%.\n\n      The purpose of this study which is a non-pharmacologic behavioral study is to encourage\n      adherence to medications in stroke survivors by tailored and specific SMS (Short Text\n      Messages) reminders.
