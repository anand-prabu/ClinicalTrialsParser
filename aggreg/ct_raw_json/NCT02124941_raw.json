We will\n      also explicitly explore potential relationships between VCYC and neurocognitive tests of PFC\n      function and clinical outcomes (i.e., measures of relapse at 90-days outpatient follow-up).\n      In addition to assessing resting-state glucose uptake in the PFC, we will explore whether\n      open-label administration of either of three different pharmacological treatments (N-acetyl\n      cysteine, riluzole, or pentoxifylline) increases VCYC, in cocaine users (CU) in comparison\n      to their abstinence baseline."
