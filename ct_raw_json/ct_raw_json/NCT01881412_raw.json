A lot of children\n      with uncontrolled asthma use emergency departments for asthma care, and so this is an ideal\n      place for an intervention for these children.  One intervention is prescribing inhaled\n      steroids to children with uncontrolled asthma, but currently this is rarely done in the\n      emergency department.  Inhaled steroids have been shown to be good at making children better\n      long-term when they have uncontrolled asthma.\n\n      This study identifies children in the emergency department with uncontrolled asthma using a\n      tool called the Pediatric Asthma Control and Communication Instrument (PACCI). If children\n      meet criteria for uncontrolled asthma they will be randomly assigned to either: 1) routine\n      asthma care which includes close follow up with their doctor or 2) prescribing of an inhaled\n      corticosteroid from the emergency department. The investigators hypothesize that children\n      who are prescribed inhaled steroids for uncontrolled asthma from the emergency department\n      will have better 6 month asthma control than children who receive routine asthma care."
