      INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT:

      TLC388 (Lipotecan*) *Lipotecan is a drug product of TLC388 HCl.

      PHASE OF DEVELOPMENT:

      Phase II

      No. OF PATIENTS:

      Approximately 40 (Stage I: 15 evaluable patients, Stage II: 25 evaluable patients)

      STUDY OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

      • To evaluate non-progression disease (non-PD) rate at the end of cycle 6

      Secondary

        -  To evaluate progression free survival (PFS)

        -  To evaluate overall survival (OS)

        -  To evaluate the duration of non-PD

        -  To evaluate objective response rate (ORR; where ORR= CR+PR) and duration

        -  To evaluate the safety profile of TLC388

        -  To evaluate change in health-related quality of life (HRQOL) at the end of cycle 6

      STUDY DESIGN:

      This is a Phase II, open-label, single-arm, multi-centre study to evaluate TLC388
      monotherapy in patients with locally advanced and/or metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult patients defined by age ≥ 18 years

          -  Histologically confirmed Renal cell carcinoma (RCC)

          -  Locally advanced or metastatic RCC. Locally advanced RCC: defined as a stage . .
             T3/T4 disease, not amenable to curative surgery or radiation therapy, with
             involvement of renal vein/vena cava/peripelvic and perirenal fat/adrenal gland, or
             invasion beyond Gerota's fascia (Moch et al., 2009). Metastatic RCC: equivalent to
             Stage IV RCC, according to American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging

          -  Eastern Collaborative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of ≤ 2. An ECOG of ≤ 1
             for the patient with failure of &gt;= 2 prior target therapies is acceptable

          -  Documented RCC disease with measurable or non-measurable lesion on imaging by RECIST
             v1.1 (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) criteria

          -  History of human immunodeficiency virus infection

          -  Presence of active, uncontrolled infection
