A higher score indicates a worse rating for symptoms related to mania. At every visit throughout the study, investigators administered the YMRS.  The results of the primary analysis of efficacy were calculated using Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF). Primary variable is presented  through ANCOVA results for absolute change in YMRS total score from baseline (V2) to end of treatment (V7). A responder has at least 50% improvement (reduction) in the YMRS total score or has a total score of less than 12 points at the end of treatment period.",

A higher score indicates a worse rating for symptoms related to mania. At every visit throughout the study, investigators administered the YMRS.

A higher score indicates a worse rating for symptoms related to mania. At every visit throughout the study, investigators administered the YMRS.  The results of the primary analysis of efficacy were calculated using Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF). Primary variable is presented  through ANCOVA results for absolute change in YMRS total score from baseline (V2) to end of treatment (V7).
