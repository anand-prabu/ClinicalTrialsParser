  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current pharmacotherapies for alcohol use disorders (AUDs) have limited efficacy. Thus, the
      development of effective treatments for AUDs represents an important public health
      objective.  Repositioning, i.e. using existing approved drugs for other indications,
      represents a fast and economically feasible approach for drug development. Ivermectin (IVM)
      is an FDA-approved antiparasitic medication that can significantly reduce alcohol intake in
      mice, suggesting that it may be useful in the treatment of AUDs in humans. The goal of this
      project is to provide key clinical evidence that IVM can be repositioned as a novel
      therapeutic agent to treat AUDs.

      Current pharmacotherapies for alcohol use disorders (AUDs) have limited efficacy. Thus, the
      development of effective treatments for AUDs represents an important public health
      objective.  Repositioning, i.e. using existing approved drugs for other indications,
      represents a fast and economically feasible approach for drug development. Ivermectin (IVM)
      is an FDA-approved antiparasitic medication that can significantly reduce alcohol intake in
      mice, suggesting that it may be useful in the treatment of AUDs in humans. The goal of this
      project is to provide key clinical evidence that IVM can be repositioned as a novel
      therapeutic agent to treat AUDs. We will enroll 10 alcohol dependent individuals in a
      placebo-controlled randomized pilot safety trial of IVM (30 mg orally once) over a 2-day
      (1-night) inpatient stay at the UCLA CTRC and employ a well-characterized battery of
      behavioral paradigms (i.e., alcohol administration and cue exposure). The goals of the study
      are to test: (a) the safety of combining IVM, at a dose currently shown to be safe in humans
      (30 mg), with moderate doses of alcohol (0.08 g/dl); and (b) whether IVM reduces the
      reinforcing effects of alcohol during alcohol administration and whether it reduces alcohol
      craving during cue exposure, as compared to placebo.
