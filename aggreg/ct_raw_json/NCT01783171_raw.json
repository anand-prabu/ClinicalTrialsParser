Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), safety, and toxicity of the combination of\n      MK-2206 (Akt inhibitor MK2206) and dinaciclib in patients with advanced pancreatic\n      adenocarcinoma.\n\n      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. Assess the preliminary efficacy of the combination of MK-2206 and dinaciclib in\n      metastatic pancreatic cancer patients as determined by disease control rate in an expansion\n      cohort of patients at the MTD.\n\n      II. Characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of the combination of MK-2206 and\n      dinaciclib.\n\n      III. Analyze pre-treatment tumor specimens for activation of retrovirus-associated\n      deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequence (RAS) downstream pathway signaling as potential\n      predictors of treatment benefit.\n\n      IV. Correlate post-treatment pharmacodynamic (PD) changes in phosphorylated extracellular\n      signal-regulated kinase (p-ERK), phosphorylated-v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog\n      1 (p-AKT), p-ribosomal protein S6 kinase (S6), phosphorylated DNA-directed ribonucleic acid\n      (RNA) polymerase II subunit RPB1 (pPOLR2), phosphorylated retinoblastoma protein (pRB),\n      proliferation-related Ki-67 antigen (Ki-67), and cleaved caspase-3 in tumor biopsies and\n      peripheral blood mononuclear cells with MK-2206 and dinaciclib exposure and treatment\n      response to demonstrate proof-of-concept and assess for post-treatment predictive\n      biomarkers.\n\n      V. To assess the effect of polymorphic variations in candidate genes (cytochrome P450 3A4/5\n      [CYP3A4/5], ATP-binding cassette, sub-family B [MDR/TAP], member 1 [ABCB1]) and other\n      genetic alterations that may be discovered during the conduct of the study, on MK-2206 and\n      dinaciclib disposition, toxicity, and efficacy.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\n      ARM A: Patients receive dinaciclib intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on day 1 of course 1.\n\n      ARM B: Patients receive Akt inhibitor MK2206 orally (PO) on day 1 of course 1.\n\n      After day 1, all patients receive Akt inhibitor MK2206 PO on days 1, 8, and 15 and\n      dinaciclib IV over 2 hours on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence\n      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically."
