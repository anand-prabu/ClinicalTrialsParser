Determine the most sensitive outcome measures (functional or morphological)\n      of a progressive renal injury in patients with IgA nephropathy.\n\n      II.  Determine which of these patients are destined to progress to further injury in order\n      to target them for therapy.\n\n      III.  Elucidate the determinants of progression in those patients who exhibit evidence of\n      either increasing impairment of ultrafiltration capacity or ongoing destruction of nephrons."
