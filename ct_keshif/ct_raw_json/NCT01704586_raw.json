If there is no uptake outside of thyroid bed, no ablation will follow in stage I disease according to AJCC with the possibility of lymph node involvement but no distant metastasis and no microscopical residual disease (Patient age <45y: any T, any N, M0; Patient age 45y or older: T1, N0, M0). Periodic follow-up may include I-124 PET/CT when indicated to determine whether or not another I-131 therapy has to follow. Thyroglobuline increase also constitutes I-124 PET/CT imaging."

            "textblock": "Thyroid nodules are a common clinical problem. Epidemiologic studies have shown the\n      prevalence of palpable thyroid nodules to be approximately 5% in women and 1% in men living\n      in iodine-sufficient parts of the world and up to 30% in iodine deficient regions, such as\n      Germany. The clinical importance of thyroid nodules rests with the need to exclude thyroid\n      cancer which occurs in 5-15%. Differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC), which includes papillary\n      and follicular cancer, comprises the vast majority (90%) of all thyroid cancers. In Germany,\n      approximately 7,000 new cases will be diagnosed in 2011. The yearly incidence has increased\n      from 3.6 per 100,000 in 1973 to 8.7 per 100,000 in 2002, and this trend appears to be\n      continuing. Recurrence-free survival is generally excellent and depends on the risk group.\n\n      The role of postoperative remnant radioiodine ablation (RRIA) as the most serious question\n      regarding the initial management of DTC still needs to be resolved even after decades of\n      radioiodine use. American Thyroid Association directions for future research addressing\n      these questions include:\n\n        -  Better understanding of the long-term risks of radioiodine use;\n\n        -  Improved risk stratification;\n\n      Randomized controlled trials are still missing in which RRIA has proven its worth as a safe\n      and very effective treatment that results in an improved life expectancy and a reduced\n      recurrence rate. Many observational studies lack sufficiently high evidence. Evidence grade\n      is rated mainly on \"expert level\", based on non-randomized retrospective observation\n      studies. Although RRIA in Europe is established as adjuvant standard treatment for all\n      patients with DTC, except those with stage T1a, it remains to be shown throughout if it is\n      beneficial for low risk and medium risk patients without metastases (M0), also known as\n      stage I patients according to UICC/AJCC classification, accounting for 40-90% of all\n      patients.\n\n      Blood doses due to cumulative radioiodine therapy may well exceed 2 Gy, and RRIA induces an\n      average blood dose of 0.28 Gy to the entire body. Risks as estimated from that dose are not\n      insignificant. The question is whether or not the condition after remnant ablation justifies\n      such an increased risk of a secondary malignancy. The probability of causation for a\n      pharyngeal or breast tumour can well exceed the margin of a 50% after being exposed to RRIA\n      or consecutive I-131 diagnostic imaging to explore measureable Tg levels. Even though\n      radioiodine therapy can benefit some patients with advanced thyroid carcinoma, it is still\n      unknown whether the risks of RRIA outweigh any discernable benefit. Undoubtedly, quality of\n      life may be affected by adjuvant use of I-131.\n\n      Study Hypothesis:\n\n      The I-124 study arm may have considerable benefits for the patient included in the study.\n      These include\n\n        -  enhanced tumour and risk stratification,\n\n        -  avoidance of unnecessary I-131 exposure in 30-89 percent of patients who were\n           classified with \"low risk\" tumour (MACIS or AMES scoring) or \"stage I disease\"\n           (UICC-AJCC TNM staging system), and,\n\n        -  improved quality of life at the same or better morbidity and mortality rates in the\n           I-124 arm.\n\n      Environmental and hospital staff related benefits include prevention or saving of I-131\n      exposure.\n\n      This study is designed to compare effectiveness of treatments  following and evaluating\n      guideline recommendations in two assignment arms."
