All patients will receive systemic chemotherapy with the mFOLFOX regimen and regorafenib. The specific version of the FOLFOX regimen used at MSKCC is mFOLFOX6. mFOLFOX6 will be given on Day 1 of each cycle. Patients will receive Oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2 IV (over 120 minutes), leucovorin 400 mg/m2 IV (over 120 minutes), 5-FU 400 mg/m2 IVP, and 5-FU 1200 mg/m2/day CIVI x 2 days, every two weeks. Treatment will be performed on the scheduled day \u00b1 7 days. In case of discontinuation of FOLFOX due to cumulative toxicity and administration as a single agent during the study, regorafenib for patient convenience will be administered 160 mg daily for 3 weeks on/1 week off. The 3 weeks on/1 week off schedule is supported by the single agent regorafenib data in colon cancer and GIST."
