  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done to determine if we can change skin from one type to another.
      Specifically, we are interested in making normal skin into the thicker skin found on our
      palms and soles.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To change the skin identity we propose to take skin cells from a person's own sole or palm
      (these are called &quot;autologous skin fibroblasts&quot;), multiply them in the lab, inject the cells
      (now called a &quot;graft&quot;) back into the same person but at a different site of skin like the
      buttock, and then eventually remove the injected cells to see if they caused the skin to
      change.

      We hope that information from this study will help with problems like skin break-down in
      patients with amputations and prosthetics.  The skin at their stump was not meant to
      withstand the pressure and friction of prosthetics and this study is the first step in
      trying to convert stump skin to palm/sole-like skin.
