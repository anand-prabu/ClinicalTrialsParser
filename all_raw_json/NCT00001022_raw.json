To compare the mortality rates in the three regimens. To compare the effects of\n      antiretroviral regimens on CD4+ cell levels.\n\n      Studies have indicated that maintenance therapy with AZT over extended periods may be\n      limited by dose-dependent toxicity, primarily myelosuppression, and by the emergence of\n      drug-resistant HIV strains. It is anticipated that the combination of AZT with either ddI or\n      ddC may promote higher antiviral efficacy, with acceptable toxicity and less likelihood of\n      development of drug-resistant strains, than AZT alone."
