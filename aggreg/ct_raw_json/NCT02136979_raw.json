Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) can induce inflammatory reaction\n      during cardiac surgery, and induce immunosuppression. In recent previous studies, CD39 and\n      CD73 was known to have important role in cancer patients for inducing immunosuppressive\n      reaction and consequently induce cancer cell proliferation. However, the immunosuppressive\n      effect of CD39 and CD73 during CPB time was not evaluated in previous studies.\n\n      The authors hypothesized that CD39 and CD73 would have important role in CPB induced\n      immunosuppression. Therefore, the present study determined the effect of CD39 and CD73\n      during CPB."

Also, 6ml of blood and 6ml of urine sample was obtained for total 8\n      times in consecutive order.\n\n        1. Before operation (pre-CPB1)\n\n        2. Immediate after anesthesia induction (pre-CPB2)\n\n        3. After surgeon achieved arterial and venous cannulation for CPB start (pre-CPB3)\n\n        4. 15 minute after successful CPB weaning (post-CPB1)\n\n        5. 3 hrs after CPB weaning (post-CPB2)\n\n        6. 24 hrs after CPB weaning (post-CPB3)\n\n        7. 48 hrs after CPB weaning (post-CPB4)\n\n        8. 72 hrs after CPB weaning (post-CPB5)\n\n      The following intraoperative exclusion criteria are applied:\n\n        1. Emergency operation that could not obtain pre-CPB1 sample\n\n        2. Patients who have infectious factor before operation\n\n        3. Patients who have immunosuppressive agent for underlying disease before operation\n\n        4. Patients who have history of cancer previously\n\n        5. Patients who are younger than 19 years old\n\n      Using blood and urine sample, authors examined as follows\n\n        1. Flow cytometry for Th 17 and Th 1 cell.\n\n        2. Immunocytochemistry for CD39, CD73.\n\n        3. Assay for IL 1,4,6,8,10, TNF-\u03b1\n\n        4.

CD39 and\n      CD73 are analysed used a Repeated Measures Analysis of Variance and their pairwise multiple\n      comparisons are performed via the tukey method. The comparisons of the other continuous\n      variables are performed by paired t or Wilcoxon Signed Rank tests. The linear regression\n      analysis is used to determine possible correlation between CD39,CD73 and laboratory routine\n      lab. Data are expressed as mean \u00b1 SD (95% confidence interval. CI) or median (25%-75%), and\n      number of the patients. A p value less than 0.05 is considered statistically significant."
