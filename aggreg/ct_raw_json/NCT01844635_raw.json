The primary endpoint is the response rate (complete response\n      (CR) + partial response (PR)) at day 180 after the start of IST. Secondary endpoints include\n      evaluation of the presence and frequency of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-reactivation and\n      EBV-associated lymphoproliferative disorder (EBV-LPD), Cytomegalovirus(CMV)-reactivation and\n      CMV associated diseases, the response rate (CR+PR) on Day 360 after the start of IST,\n      relapse rate and overall survival."
