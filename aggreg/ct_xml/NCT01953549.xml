  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate whether a 4-week physical fitness training (target
      intervention) in stroke patients (subacute stage) increase the walking speed and activities
      of daily living compared with a control intervention (relaxation exercises). The target or
      control intervention is performed in addition to standard rehabilitation treatment.
