            "textblock": "Myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) is one of the key proteins known to inhibit neuronal\n      regeneration when released from oligodendrocytes in conditions of neuronal injury, such as\n      stroke. GSK249320 is a humanised monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds with high specificity\n      to MAG and antagonises or neutralises MAG-mediated inhibition and has been shown to improve\n      functional recovery after stroke in pre-clinical models, possibly by promoting\n      neuroregeneration and plasticity. The present study (MAG104615) is designed to establish\n      Proof of Concept (PoC) for GSK249320 in ischemic stroke patients. MAG104615 will be a\n      placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter, randomized, repeat dose, Bayesian design\n      study. PoC will be achieved by demonstrating a clinically meaningful improvement in lower\n      limb motor recovery, specifically by evaluating changes in gait velocity from baseline to\n      Day 90/Month 3. Subjects will also be followed out to Day 180/Month 6 to further evaluate\n      longer term motor recovery and safety. Additional secondary efficacy measures of motor\n      recovery will be evaluated to further demonstrate and characterize the extent and duration\n      of overall motor recovery after treatment with GSK249320. Changes in disability and\n      neurological impairment will be characterized after treatment with GSK249320 and explored\n      for how they relate to motor recovery. This PoC study will also further characterize the\n      safety, PK, and immunogenicity of GSK249320 will explore pharmacodynamic (PD) markers, and\n      will explore use of actigraphy to measure motor recovery. Subjects will be stratified by\n      gait velocity at baseline for randomization (1:1 allocation) into one of two treatment\n      groups: 15mg/kg GSK249320, or placebo. Each subject will receive 2 repeat IV doses of\n      GSK249320 or placebo."

Time of stroke onset is defined at the time at which the\n             patient/relative is first aware of the stroke deficit. For patients who awake with\n             deficits, or who are found unconscious, the time of onset is defined as the time at\n             which they were last known to be symptom free.\n\n          -  Have a stroke that is radiologically confirmed to be ischemic and supratentorial.
