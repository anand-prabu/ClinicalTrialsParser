      Background:

      - People with alcoholism have differences in their brains compared with healthy people.
      People who are dependent on alcohol also perform differently on behavioral tasks.
      Researchers want to find out more about these differences. They also want to see if these
      differences are related to DNA.

      Objective:

      - To see if differences in brain structure relate to personality and behavior differences in
      people with and without alcohol dependence.

      Eligibility:

      - Adults age 18 and older.

      Design:

        -  Participants will visit the NIH Clinical Center once during the study.

        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history, EKG, and physical exam. They will
           give blood and urine samples and undergo a psychiatric interview.

        -  Participants will be asked about their alcohol drinking, to see if they have an alcohol
           use disorder.

        -  Participants will play three computerized games. Some will play these games inside a
           magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner.

        -  MRI: strong magnetic field and radio waves take pictures of the brain. Participants lie
           on a table that slides in and out of a cylinder. They will be in the scanner for about
           90 minutes. They may lie still for up to 20 minutes at a time. The scanner makes loud
           knocking noises. They will get earplugs.

      1. Objective: The purpose of this protocol is to obtain a standard set of assessments,
           including brain behavioral, structural, functional, and connectivity (structural and
           functional) information, on all NIAAA research participants, referred to hereinafter as
           Characterization Imaging Instruments (CII); a) to determine how individual differences
           in brain structure and evoked responses relate to generalized trait personality and
           behavior differences (as assessed by psychometric questionnaire instruments and
           behavioral measures); and b) to determine whether these individual differences relate
           specifically to genetic polymorphisms in genes governing neurotransmitter activity.
           Thus, our goal of the CII is to identify the brain structural, functional, behavioral,
           genetic, and other phenotypic factors that are associated with alcoholism.

        2. Study population: Non-treatment seeking adult volunteers and inpatient participants
           with alcohol dependence (ADs). Inpatient ADs refer to individuals diagnosed as alcohol
           dependent through DSM-IV-RT criteria.

        3. Design: This study will require one visit that will include an MRI scan (if the
           participant is determined to be eligible for the scanner) consisting of a whole brain
           structural MRI, Diffusion Tensor MRI, Resting State MRI (rsMRI) as well as several
           functional MRIs (fMRIs), while performing computerized behavioral, motivational, and
           cognitive/emotional tasks. If the participant does not qualify for the MR scans, he/she
           will perform only the computerized behavioral, motivational, and cognitive/emotional
           tasks outside the scanner.  These instruments include instruments in common with a
           similar protocol at NIDA.

        4. Outcome measures:  The outcome measures are differences in behavioral responses using
           standard statistical methods, in brain structural data using AFNI, FSL, SPM and
           FreeSurfer software, and in blood oxygenation dependent level (BOLD) signal measured
           using standard fMRI techniques and analyzed using AFNI and FSL software. Secondary
           outcome measures are to compare the genetic, behavioral and phenotypic factors to
           imaging and behavioral data acquired across other LCTS protocols.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Inclusion Criteria: Adult Participants

        All adult participants must have:

        a. Completed an enrollment protocol, either 98-AA-0009: Screening evaluation for NIAAA
        Protocols, or 05-AA-0121: Assessment and treatment of people with alcohol drinking
        problems, and have been determined eligible for another NIAAA-LCTS study.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Exclusion Criteria: Adult Participants

        a.Exclusion criteria for MR scan*

        i.Have ferromagnetic objects in their bodies which might be adversely affected by MRI
        including implanted pacemakers, medication pumps, aneurysm clips; metallic prostheses
        (including metal pins and rods, heart valves or cochlear implants, shrapnel fragments,
        permanent eye liner or small metal fragments in the eye that welders and other metal works
        may have     any doubt about presence of these objects will result in exclusion from this
        study), or if candidates are uncomfortable in small closed spaces (have claustrophobia),
        or cannot lie comfortably on their back for up to one hour.

        ii.Are pregnant, as determined by a negative pregnancy test.

        iii.Are left-handed.

        b.Are not cleared based on physical and neuromotor examination.

        c.Inpatient participants with alcohol dependence who have symptoms of alcohol withdrawal
        as indicated by the most recent measurement within the past 30 days, as measured by the
        Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment (CIWA) score &gt;  8.

        *Subjects excluded from MR scan will still perform the behavioral tasks which otherwise
        would be performed in the scanner as fMRI tasks.
