            "textblock": "Irreversible electroporation (IRE) is a new, minimal-invasive image-guided treatment method\n      for tumors not amenable for surgical resection or thermal ablation, due to vicinity near\n      vital structures such as vessels and bile ducts. With IRE, multiple electrical pulses are\n      applied to tumorous tissue. These pulses alter the existing transmembrane potential of the\n      cell membranes, and create 'nanopores', after which the cell dies through loss of\n      homeastasis.\n\n      The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety of percutaneous IRE in the treatment\n      of patients with locally advanced pancreatic carcinoma (LAPC). Other objectives are\n      feasibility and efficacy of IRE based upon symptomatic response and tumor response.\n\n      Ten patients with histologically confirmed locally advanced pancreatic adenoacarcinoma (<\n      3.5cm) will undergo percutaneous irreversible electroporation of the tumor using CT and\n      ultrasound guidance. After IRE, patients will be carefully monitored and any (serious)\n      adverse events are registered. Follow-up will consist of frequent CT and MRI scanning, as\n      well as serum CA19.9 tumor marker and quality of life questionnaires and pain registration\n      forms.\n\n      We hypothesize that IRE in the pancreas will induce good symptom palliation and local tumor\n      control, without causing severe complications."
