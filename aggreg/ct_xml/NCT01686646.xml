  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate any improvement in alertness and performance based on cognitive
      function and mood assessment in subjects suffering the common cold, when taking a novel
      paracetamol and caffeine combination verses paracetamol alone.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in number of accurate responses to Rapid Visual Information Processing (RVIP) Cognitive test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 60 minutes post treatment administration</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The RVIP assessed the performance of visual attention mechanisms in remaining vigilant to periodically occurring events. Participants monitored a series of single numbers (0-9) appearing in the centre of the screen. During the RVIP task, participants responded to consecutive sequences of three odd or three even numbers by pressing the corresponding response button as quickly and accurately as possible. The test lasted approximately 9 minutes and number of accurate responses to stimulus was calculated.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in number of accurate responses to Sustained Attention Tasks (SAT) Cognitive test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 60 minutes and up to 120 minutes post treatment administration</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Auditory and visual attention of participants was evaluated using a validated Sustained Attention task. For the sustained visual attention task, participants were required to respond to the letter 's' every time it appears in a continuous stream of letters presented on a screen. For the sustained auditory attention task, participants responded to the number '8' every time it appears in a continuous stream of numbers presented through headphones. Mean values of accurate responses to visual and auditory tests were calculated.</description>
