In addition the trial will assess the\n      treatment of Revlimid/low dose Dexamethasone (Rd) as Salvage after VMP without sufficient\n      response (less than PR) in an observational arm. Key eligibility criteria include patients\n      with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma and who are 65 years of age or older or are not\n      candidates for high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation. Patients\n      with poor performance status or serious coexistent medical conditions will be excluded from\n      this study. After registration all patients receive 6 cycles VMP (modified according to\n      Mateos et al.). Patients who receive at least a PR and completed VMP can be randomized to\n      either Lenalidomide 10 mg/d continuously maintenance or to placebo. Randomization will be\n      stratified according to the quality of response after VMP induction (PR vs. VGPR + stringent\n      complete remission [sCR] + CR). Patients that are not able to complete VMP due to toxicity\n      but reached at least a PR after a minimum of four cycles of therapy should immediately\n      proceed to randomization. Blinded phase continues until progression or end of study. After\n      unblinding, patients who received placebo should be treated with Rd.\n\n      Patients that do not reach PR after induction with VMP or are progressive during treatment\n      with VMP should not be randomized, but switched to the observation arm and treated with Rd\n      immediately. The study treatment ends with the confirmed progression on maintenance\n      treatment (Lenalidomide or placebo) for patients that reached PR with induction treatment,\n      or with the confirmed progression on second-line therapy with Revlimid\u00ae and Dexamethasone\n      for patients that did not reach PR on induction treatment. All patients will be followed up\n      every 3 months after end of study treatment, until end of study. The study ends two years\n      after Last Patient In (i.e. randomization for maintenance) if sufficient events for the\n      primary endpoint were received, but not later than 8 years after trial initiation (whatever\n      comes first)."

The following are examples of highly effective and additional\n                  effective methods of contraception:\n\n                    -  Highly effective methods*:\n\n                         -  Intrauterine device (IUD)**\n\n                         -  Progesterone only hormonal contraceptive (birth control pills,\n                            injections, implants)*\n\n                         -  Tubal ligation\n\n                         -  Partner's vasectomy\n\n                    -  Additional effective methods:\n\n                         -  Male condom (partner)\n\n                         -  Diaphragm\n\n                         -  Cervical Cap\n\n               -  (*)Because of the increased risk of venous thromboembolism in patients with\n                  multiple myeloma taking Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone, combined oral\n                  contraceptive pills are not recommended. If a patient is currently using\n                  combined oral contraception she should switch to one of the effective method\n                  listed above. The risk of venous thromboembolism continues for 4 to 6 weeks\n                  after discontinuing combined oral contraception. The efficacy of contraceptive\n                  steroids may be reduced during co-treatment with Dexamethasone.\n\n               -  (**)Implants and levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine systems are associated\n                  with an increased risk of infection at the time of insertion and irregular\n                  vaginal bleeding.

The first pregnancy test must be performed within 10 to\n                  14 days prior to the start Lenalidomide and the second pregnancy test must be\n                  performed within 24 hours prior to the start of Lenalidomide.

If menstrual cycles are irregular, the\n                  pregnancy testing must occur weekly for the first 28 days and then every 14 days\n                  while on study, at study discontinuation, and at days 14 and 28 following study\n                  drug discontinuation.
