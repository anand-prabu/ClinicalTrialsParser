When the total radioactivity is\n      <1% of the administered dose in all subjects, Period 2 dosing will begin (approximately 8\n      days after the IV dose). On Day 1 of Period 2, each subject will receive single therapeutic\n      oral solution dose (1200 mg). Blood, urine, bile and fecal samples will be collected during\n      both the periods. The subject may be discharged from the unit as early as Day 8 of Period 2.\n      Subjects will visit the study unit for the follow-up visit 7 to 10 days following discharge\n      from the unit."
