  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is used to maintain adequate perfusion of vital organs
      in cardiac arrest patients and is fundamental for the neurological outcome and survival of
      these individuals. Unfortunately, the quality of CPR may be inadequate due largely to
      ineffective chest compressions resulting from rescuer fatigue and interruptions in
      compressions. The LUCAS device (Lund University Cardiopulmonary Assist System, Jolife, Lund,
      Sweden), introduced in 2002, is the most extensively tested and applied automated
      alternative to manual CPR for in-hospital care of cardiac arrest patients and during
      ambulance transfer; the feasibility of application of this device in helicopter emergency
      medical service (HEMS) operations, however, has never been addressed. The objective of this
      project is to equip the three active rescue helicopters in South Tyrol with the LUCAS 2
      mechanical chest compression device to answer the question: What is the feasibility and
      efficiency of using this device for prolonged CPR in cardiac arrest patients requiring CPR
      during HEMS rescue operations and transport?

      This is a non-controlled, observational study. Physiological endpoints: MAP (mean arterial
      pressure); etCO2 (end-tidal expiratory pCO2); ROSC (return of spontaneous circulation); PaO2
      (arterial pO2); PaCO2 (arterial pCO2); endpoints to assess feasibility: time from arrival to
      start of mechanical compressions, problems during transfer into the helicopter and in-field
      manoeuvers, problems with application of device, problems with patient transfer to hospital
      premises, hands-off time, personnel requirements.
