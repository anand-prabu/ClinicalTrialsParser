  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children with autism spectrum disorders often engage in problem behaviors such as
      self-injury, destruction, aggression, and stereotypy. Prior research has clearly shown that
      these problem behaviors may interfere with learning, daily functioning, and social
      participation. As such, engaging in problem behaviors has a negative impact on the health
      and quality of life of children with autism spectrum disorders and their families. One
      promising solution to reduce problem behaviors in this population is the
      Prevent-Teach-Reinforce (PTR) model, which relies on the evidence-based practices of
      positive behavior support. Although the use of PTR has been gaining considerably support in
      schools, the model has never been evaluated as part of a rigorous large-scale study using
      parents as interventionists. Thus, the purpose of the project is to conduct an assessment of
      the effectiveness of a home-based version of the PTR model in reducing problem behaviors in
      children with autism spectrum disorders and in improving families' quality of life. Our
      hypotheses are that implementing the PTR will (a) produce larger reductions in problem
      behaviors than treatment as usual, (b) decrease parental stress, and (c) improve the quality
      of life of the family. The results of the study will allow an examination of whether PTR is
      an effective and acceptable model to reduce problem behaviors at home in this population.
      Given that problem behaviors incur high societal costs when they persist into adolescence
      and adulthood, the study may potentially lead to large cost reductions in the treatment of
      difficulties associated with autism spectrum disorders. By reducing engagement in problem
      behaviors, the implementation of the model may also promote and facilitate the social
      participation as well as improve the quality of life and health of children with autism
      spectrum disorders and their families.
