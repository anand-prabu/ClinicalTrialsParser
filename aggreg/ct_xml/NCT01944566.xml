  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The malodour generation of a person's armpit is caused by the bacteria thriving on that
      armpit. In order to alter or reduce once bad body odour, the living microbial community on
      the armpit of a non-malodorous person will be transmitted (or up scaled and transmitted) to
      the armpit of a malodorous person. The odour is evaluated by a trained smelling panel, the
      bacteria living on the armpit is examined by means of molecular techniques. The microbial
      transplantation and its follow-up happens under the supervision of a medical doctor.
