  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Data collection for this study will be done by clinicians working in inpatient
      rehabilitation units with persons with acute stroke. No interventions are included in this
      study. It is designed to capture trends in current clinical practice for persons with
      stroke. This data will be useful in identifying the most beneficial and effective walking
      treatments as well as most significant patient characteristics that impact recovery for
      persons acutely after stroke. All data collection will take place during the inpatient
      rehabilitation stay.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All persons admitted to the inpatient rehabilitation unit will be screened for inclusion.
      Only those with a confirmed diagnosis of stroke (CVA) will be included. Data collection on
      the participants will begin at the time of admission and continue through discharge. Average
      length of stay for persons with stroke in inpatient rehabilitation units is 21 days. Some
      persons will stay fewer days and some will stay longer. Data collection will include key
      information on physical therapy interventions including gait training, balance training,
      group therapy, manual therapy, exercise, transfer training, stairs, family training,
      wheelchair training, modalities, discharge planning, seated and supine exercises. Other data
      will be collected including tone, motor control, sensation, gait endurance, falls, wounds,
      restraints, deep vein thrombosis, tracheostomy, feeding tubes and blood pressure. Additional
      data collection will include age, gender, race, length of time post stroke, time in
      rehabilitation, Functional Independence Measure scores, case mix group, discharge
      destination. In addition, physician history and physical as well as discharge summary will
      be collected, as will evaluation and discharge notes from therapies (physical, occupation,
      speech, social work). Patients will not be responsible for any costs associated with this
      data collection.
