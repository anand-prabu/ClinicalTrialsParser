    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well cisplatin and radiation therapy with or
      without Triapine work in treating patients with previously untreated stage IB-IVA cervical
      cancer or stage II-IVA vaginal cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin, work
      in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by
      stopping them from dividing. Radiation therapy uses high energy x rays to kill tumor cells.
      Triapine may make tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy. It is not yet known
      whether cisplatin and radiation therapy is more effective when given with or without
      Triapine in treating cervical or vaginal cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the posttherapy 3-month fludeoxyglucose F 18 (18F-FDG) positron emission
      tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) complete metabolic response of
      3-aminopyridine-2-carboxaldehyde thiosemicarbazone (3-AP) (Triapine) radiochemotherapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determining acute &lt; 30 day adverse events of 3-AP radiochemotherapy by Common Terminology
      Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.

      II. Determining the late &gt;= 30 day adverse events of 3-AP radiochemotherapy by CTCAE version
      4.

      III. Determining post-therapy clinical response by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
      Tumors (RECIST), version 1.1.

      IV. Determining the progression-free interval of 3-AP radiochemotherapy. V. Determining
      peripheral blood methemoglobin proportion before and after 3-AP infusion. (Optional)

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive cisplatin intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes on days 2, 9, 16, 23,
      and 30 of radiation therapy. Patients undergo external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) five
      days a week for 5 weeks with a boost in week 6 followed by 5 sessions of high dose rate
      (HDR) brachytherapy once or twice weekly beginning in week 4 or up to 2 sessions of low dose
      rate (LDR) brachytherapy within 3 weeks of completion of EBRT.

      ARM II: Patients receive Triapine IV over 90-120 minutes on days 1, 3, 5, 8, 10, 12, 15, 17,
      19, 22, 24, 26, 29, 31, and 33 of radiation therapy. Patients also receive cisplatin IV and
      undergo EBRT and brachytherapy as in Arm I.

      In both arms, treatment continues for up to 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1, 3, and 6 months.

             composition to 3-AP (Triapine) or other agents used in study

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, symptomatic
             congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, myocardial infarction within six

             hypertension, significant pulmonary disease including dyspnea at rest, patients
             requiring supplemental oxygen, or poor pulmonary reserve; proteinuria or clinically
             significant renal function impairment (baseline serum creatinine &gt; 2 mg / dL), or
             psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study
             requirements are excluded

          -  Patient does not have uncontrolled diabetes mellitus (fasting blood glucose &gt; 200
             mg/dL)

          -  Patients with known glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PD) are excluded
             due to an inability to administer the antidote for methemoglobinemia, methylene blue;
             testing for G6PD is not required for study enrollment and optional

          -  Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients receiving combination
             antiretroviral therapy are ineligible; HIV testing is not required for study
