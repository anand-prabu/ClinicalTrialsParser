A thorough removal of Tenon's capsule was performed in an area much greater than the pterygium body. Free conjunctival autografting after pteryigum excision was performed as follows: the desired size of the conjunctiva under the upper eyelid was marked and excised. No limbal tissue was included in the graft. The excised tissue was placed on the bare sclera and tightly sutured to the sclera and the limbal area. Finally the autograft edges were sutured to the conjunctiva all around.",
