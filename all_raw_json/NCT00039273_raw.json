Treatment\n      repeats every 8 weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or\n      unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed at 4 weeks, every 3 months for 1 year, and then every 6 months for 1\n      year.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-100 patients will be accrued for this study."
