Patients achieving a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) may\n      receive 1 additional course beginning no sooner than 4 weeks after completion of the first\n      course, in the absence of antibodies to MOAB Mik-beta-1. Treatment continues in the absence\n      of disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or severe allergic reaction.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of MOAB Mik-beta-1 until the maximum\n      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2\n      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed at 6-10 days and at 4-6 weeks after therapy. Patients with a PR or CR\n      may be followed every 6 months for 2 years or until relapse. All patients are followed for\n      survival.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 25 patients will be accrued for this study."
