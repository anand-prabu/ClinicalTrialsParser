            "textblock": "This trial will investigate whether the drug BMN 673 has therapeutic benefit in the\n      treatment of advanced endometrial cancer. Nearly 8,000 patients are diagnosed with\n      endometrial cancer in the UK every year. A significant proportion are either diagnosed with\n      advanced disease which may be inoperable and/or metastatic (i.e spread to other organs\n      outside the endometrium), or curable disease which relapses following first line treatment.\n      There is no established standard of care for these patients as both chemo and hormone\n      therapy has limited effectiveness and survival benefit. Survival rates have not improved in\n      the past 20 years. Furthermore there are no so called 'targeted' drugs licensed for its\n      treatment  i.e. drugs that block the growth and spread of cancer by interfering with\n      specific molecules involved in tumor growth and progression. This leaves an unmet need for\n      effective systemic treatments for advanced, inoperable and metastatic endometrial cancer.\n\n      BMN 673 has been shown to be potentially effective in treating cancers known to behave\n      similarly to endometrial disease, both in the laboratory and in Phase I studies involving\n      patients with advanced cancers. Similarly the drug appears to be relatively tolerable. A\n      Phase II trial such as the one proposed by this application could demonstrate activity that\n      might lead to a new effective treatment for patients with inoperable, advanced, recurrent or\n      metastatic endometrial cancer, while the proposed substudy also presents the possibility of\n      discovering a subset of patients more likely to derive benefit from BMN 673.\n\n      This trial is for adult women (18 and above) with advanced, inoperable or metastatic\n      endometrial cancer. Patients will be recruited from approximately 12 NHS Trusts based in the\n      UK. The study is expected to last approximately 18-24 months in terms of recruitment time,\n      and a maximum of 100 eligible women will be registered. All patients will receive BMN 673\n      until their disease worsens or their doctor decides they should stop treatment."
