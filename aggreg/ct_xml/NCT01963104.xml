  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of the project is to evaluate innovative, cost-effective, community-based
      automated hearing screening and education methods to motivate individuals with
      mild-to-moderate hearing loss to enter the hearing healthcare system.

    <description>Subjects will watch a brief animated video that shows how hearing works, take a self-administered hearing screening test, watch a hearing loss counseling video, listen to a demonstration of amplified sounds, and receive printed recommendations for hearing healthcare follow-up. All subjects will complete the Hearing Handicap Inventory for Adults (HHIA) questionnaire and the Hearing Beliefs Questionnaire (HBQ). Approximately 6 months after their initial appointment, subjects in this groups will receive a telephone call and will be asked questions related to their actions and attitudes related to hearing and hearing health care.</description>

    <description>During the test different tones are going to be presented at one volume level. Participants will identify whether or not they heard the tone. All subjects will complete the Hearing Handicap Inventory for Adults (HHIA) questionnaire and the Hearing Beliefs Questionnaire (HBQ). Approximately 6 months after their initial appointment, subjects in this groups will receive a telephone call and will be asked questions related to their actions and attitudes related to hearing and hearing health care.</description>

    <description>During the test subjects will hear a pattern of 3 numbers with variable noise in the background and identify the pattern they hear. All subjects will complete the Hearing Handicap Inventory for Adults (HHIA) questionnaire and the Hearing Beliefs Questionnaire (HBQ). Approximately 6 months after their initial appointment, subjects in this groups will receive a telephone call and will be asked questions related to their actions and attitudes related to hearing and hearing health care.</description>
