The\n      study implements an innovative, cost-efficient, nightmare treatment for trauma-exposed\n      children.  It is the first randomized clinical trial with children, adapting an efficacious\n      adult therapy to a 5-session nightmare treatment for 5-12 year-olds.  Trauma nightmares are\n      a mechanism in development and maintenance of secondary post-trauma psychopathology, medical\n      problems and family dysfunction.  Therefore, this treatment may prevent long-term secondary\n      health and behavioral problems.  It provides a viable healthcare option to Oklahomans,\n      lessening long-term financial medical and behavioral health expenses.  Scientific models\n      currently view PTSD treatment as primary, often leaving nightmares untreated.  That approach\n      does not address the pernicious impact of trauma-nightmares in individuals with\n      sub-threshold PTSD or whose nightmares are a primary condition.  The theoretical innovation\n      of this therapy can advance the field's understanding of the development of trauma sequelae."
