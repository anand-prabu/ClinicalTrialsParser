The primary disease must be located in reference vessel diameters \u2265 2.5 mm\n      and \u2264 7.0 mm.  Trial success is focused on safety including rates of major adverse events\n      through 6 months as adjudicated by a Clinical Events Committee.  Effectiveness will be\n      evaluated using technical success, defined as the percent of target lesions that have a\n      residual diameter stenosis <50% post-treatment with the Pantheris device alone as assessed\n      by Angiographic Core Lab."
