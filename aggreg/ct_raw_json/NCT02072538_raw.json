Furthermore, elevated values were associated with an increased\n      risk of recurrent AMI or death. Therefore, guidelines recommend an early invasive strategy\n      in patients with elevated admission values and kinetic changes. Other criteria for an early\n      invasive strategy include a GRACE risk score >140 points or other cardiovascular risk\n      factors. Hs-cTn assays allow discrimination of patients at very low and high risk. Studies\n      confirmed safety of early discharge protocols in patients with unstable angina (UAP). The\n      aim of this study is to 1) confirm the safety of early discharge without invasive strategy\n      in patients with UAP and to 2) review the optimal timing of stress-testing. Therefore,\n      patients are being randomized into 2 groups with pre-discharge and early post-discharge\n      stress-testing. Endpoints are major adverse cardiovascular events within 30 and 90 days."
