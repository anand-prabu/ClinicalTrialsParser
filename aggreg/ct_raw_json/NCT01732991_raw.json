The\n      underlying prostatic tissue is the site of an ischemic necrosis secondary to the thermal\n      effects of proximity of the PVP. We intend to measure by prostatic MRI and contrast-enhanced\n      ultrasound the necrosis."

The parallel with results of MRI (radiological technique most referenced) during\n      the same period would help to support the experimental results of prostatic\n      contrast-enhanced ultrasound."
