  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Blood-pressure reading of 140/90 mmHg (systolic/diastolic pressure) are typically regarded
      as having high blood pressure as defined in the most recent guidelines. From a physiological
      perspective, the regulation of blood pressure is a complicated process involving different
      biological systems and a number of feedback systems, including the nervous system, hormones,
      control of body fluid and regulators within the vessels themselves. In 90-95% of patients
      with high blood pressure the cause is unknown, whereas the remaining 5-10% may have
      secondary hypertension related to congenital heart defects, certain cancers or kidney
      abnormalities. Prehypertension [systolic blood pressure (SBP) 120-139 mm Hg, diastolic blood
      pressure (DBP) 80-89 mm Hg] is considered a precursor of hypertension and has been
      associated with an increased risk of up to 3.5 times in cardiovascular morbidity and
      mortality later in life.

      According the report of the Joint National Committee on High Blood Pressure (JNC 7) and
      other international guidelines, weight control, reduced intake of salt and reduced alcohol
      consumption, as well as increase of potassium are recommend nutritional approaches to
      prevent and treat hypertension. In observational studies significant inverse association
      between high blood pressure and vegetarian diet rich in fibers, magnesium, potassium,
      calcium and protein have been reported. In addition various studies demonstrated the ability
      of antioxidant vitamins of natural origin to improve vascular function.

      The hypothesis of the study is that supplementation with Cardio Mato (a Tomato Extracted
      Lycopene)for 12 weeks will decrease the blood pressure of subjects with prehypertension
      compared to Placebo.
