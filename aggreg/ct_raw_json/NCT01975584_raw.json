The measurements include stress hormones or other elements in the blood which\n      indicate stress . Early childhood trauma/stress (ELS) information will be collected so we\n      can examine differences in those with trauma histories vs. those with none by sex. There\n      will be one visit for screening before the testing visit. The sample will consist of up to\n      45 clinically stable inpatients and outpatients with DSM-IV schizophrenia or schizoaffective\n      disorder, of which approximately 15 will be women. We will also enroll up to 45 healthy\n      controls without a DSM-IV Axis I or II disorder. Prior to the study all subjects must meet\n      inclusion and exclusion criteria including a medical history.\n\n      The (TSST) is a standard and widely used research assessment procedure that is used to\n      reliably induce stress in human research participants. The TSST uses situations where people\n      think they are being socially evaluated during an interview for a job. Participants are told\n      they are competing with other people for this job, and their task is to convince\n      interviewers that they are the best person for the job. Participants are told they have to\n      prepare a speech, and complete a math challenge in their head."
