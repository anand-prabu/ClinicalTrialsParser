  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine an Adaptive Treatment approach in order to improve
      outcomes of youth with Cannabis Use Disorders who are poor responders to treatment.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will address the current contrasts in youth response to treatment, the problem of
      poor response to treatment and the prevention of relapse.  Results from the study may
      support Adaptive Treatment as an efficacious approach for youth with Cannabis Use Disorder
      who are poor responders to treatment.

      Poor responders fall into two categories, those who failed to achieve a negative drug
      urinalysis during the last session of the initial MET/CBT-7 treatment they attended, and
      those who either dropped out or were administratively discharged at any time during the
      initial MET/CBT-7 treatment.
