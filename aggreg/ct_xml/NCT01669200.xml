  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to assess whether daily dosing with medium chain
      triglycerides in subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) will improve cognitive
      performance.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Twenty eligible subjects will be enrolled in the study that will consist of a baseline visit
      followed by six post-baseline visits. The control and placebo groups will each be comprised
      of ten subjects randomly assigned to the groups. The assessments at baseline will include
      concomitant medications, vital signs, height, and weight. In addition, subjects will
      complete a medical history questionnaire, and receive group instruction on incorporation of
      the study products into the diet from a registered dietitian. Study products will be
      dispensed at each visit in excess of requirements, and re-issued at every visit after
      measurement of the remaining product that subjects will be instructed to bring to every
      visit. The post-baseline study visits will include body weight and vital sign measurements,
      concomitant medications, dispensation of study products, group instruction by a registered
      dietitian, and an assessment for adverse events.

      Between study visits the subjects will receive a telephone call from the study coordinator
      to encourage compliance with the diet, and to ask about any adverse events. The study visits
      will conclude at week 24.  The psychological tests conducted by clinicians at screening will
      be repeated during the cognitive testing visit.
