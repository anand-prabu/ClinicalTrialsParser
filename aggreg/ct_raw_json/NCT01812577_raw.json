Furthermore we collect data on operator and patient\n      satisfaction.\n\n      In this study patients are randomly divided into two groups (20 patient each): TPVB and DS.\n      In TPVB group the block is performed in lateral position at level of T7 with bupivacaine\n      5mg/ml. In DS group the procedure is conducted under local and intravenous anesthesia, and a\n      post-operative analgesia is assigned. Data on patient, on procedures (duration, number and\n      position of lesions etc.), complications with the anesthesiological technique are collected.\n      The intensity of post-operative pain is assessed at 3-6-12 and 24 hours after procedure in\n      both group using VRS pain scale at rest and in movement. Any concomitant event like nausea,\n      vomiting, respiratory complications etc are recorded."
