  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Introduction: The Spanish Society of Family and Community Medicine, started the Program of
      Preventive Activities and Health Promotion, which generates periodic recommendations of
      preventive methods based on scientific evidence. In the last update it has become evident
      the need of modifications to adapt the program to modern times and focuses on improving
      accessibility and offering more flexible responses to users of the program. In this sense,
      the mobile phone technology could be useful, specifically the messaging service to remind
      patients their appointments and increase attendance rates. Main objective Compare the
      percentage of patients in the intervention group compared with the control group who
      achieved a figure of HbA1c &lt;7% in 2013.Design: single blind Randomized Clinical Trial. Study
      population: Patients with diabetes with or without hypertension or lipid metabolism
      disorder, over 18 years, belonging to the Public Health System of Basque Country (primary
      care) meeting the inclusion / exclusion criteria. Sample size: 232 patients (116 per arm) to
      detect a difference in the percentage of patients with HbA1c lower than 7% between groups:
      Short Messages Standard (SMS) group: Mobile messages reminding the next review of Papps.
      Control group: Routine clinical practice. Statistical analysis: The relationship between the
      intervention received and the main variable (compliance with preventive activities at 12
      months) were analyzed using a logistic regression model.
