Mortality linked to the peritonitis is\n      extremely high and variable between 42% and 80% when associated with a systemic framework of\n      severe sepsis.

The coordinating center is at the Intensive Care Unit\n      of the University Hospital of Modena.\n\n      Randomization must be done at the time of admission to ICU.\n\n      The method of randomization will be by \"parallel group\", the type of simple randomization\n      and the randomization list will be obtained through the use of a random number generator\n      computerized in a 1:1 ratio. Patients who meet the inclusion criteria are assigned over the\n      telephone by medical coordinator:\n\n        1. or to the group receiving volemic standard treatment (conventional)\n\n        2. or to the group receiving volemic small treatment (restrictive) The contact number for\n           randomization is always 0594224896\n\n      Group \"conventional\"\n\n      Goals of the treatment:\n\n        1. arterial pressure mean \u2265 65 mmHg or equal to the pre-operative\n\n        2. diuretic rhythm \u2265 1 ml / Kg / h\n\n        3. venous saturation in vena cava \u2265 70% or mixed venous saturation as Swan Ganz's catheter\n           (SG) \u2265 65%\n\n        4. base excess (BE) > - 3\n\n        5.

Number of surgical complications (anastomotic dehiscences, need for re-operation,\n                need for percutaneous drainages of evacuation, the development of abdominal\n                hypertension).\n\n             2. Occurrence of acute respiratory failure identified with respiratory exchanges with\n                values of P / F less than 300 mmHg\n\n             3.

Occurrence of acute renal failure (number of extracorporeal treatments and / or\n                serum creatinine \u2265 1.9 mg / dl)\n\n             5. Occurrence of hepatic insufficiency with serum total bilirubin values greater than\n                2.0 mg / dl\n\n             6. Days of mechanical ventilation\n\n             7. Days of ICU staying\n\n      In the definition of surgical complications all the following situations are included:\n\n        1. anastomotic dehiscences\n\n        2. the need for reoperation\n\n        3. the need to place percutaneous drainages of evacuation\n\n        4. wound infection that requires surgical toilet or with microbiological samples positive\n\n      The accepted definition of abdominal hypertension is hypertension of the abdominal cavity of\n      retroperitoneal, intraperitoneal or parietal origin. The measurement system accepted in the\n      study is exclusively that one of the intravesical bladder catheterization. The values\n      considered as reference are:\n\n        1. mild abdominal hypertension: 10-20 mmHg\n\n        2. moderate abdominal hypertension: 20-40 mmHg\n\n        3. severe abdominal hypertension: > 40 mmHg The numeric variables which indicate organ\n           failure shall be guided by the SOFA score for severity score \u2265 2. In extracorporeal\n           treatments hemo-filtration sessions with both intermittent and continuous methods are\n           considered.\n\n      SIZE OF THE STUDY AND DATA ANALYSIS CRITERIA This is a phase II study, which is exploratory\n      and estimative and that involves randomization of all recruitable patients during the period\n      of study all over the three centers involved in the work. The study will begin on January\n      2010 and will last for 3 years. The sample size has been calculated on the basis of the\n      available data at the Post-Operative Intensive Care Unit of the Hospital in 2007: these data\n      showed a mortality of the patients with acute abdomen undergoing abdominal surgery under\n      emergency and presenting at the moment of arrival to Post Operative Intensive Therapy at\n      least a sign of hypoperfusion of 30%. Assuming a two-tailed alpha level <0.05 and a power of\n      80%, we have calculated that 100 patients per arm are needed to detect an absolute reduction\n      in mortality of 15%. This reduction appears to be significant from the clinical point of\n      view considering previous trials of fluidic therapy in shocked patients . For comparisons\n      between the means, the t-student test will be used. For comparison of events frequencies the\n      \u03c72 test or Fisher's test - as indicated - will be used. A p <0.05 will be considered\n      statistically significant. Static analysis will be performed using version 16.0 of SPSS\n      software."
