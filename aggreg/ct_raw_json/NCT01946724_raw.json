The study will consist\n      of the two following groups:\n\n      Retrospective patients This group will consist of consecutive patients that have already\n      undergone CTO PCI by the PHI CTO team.\n\n        -  The patients will be contacted by telephone for informed consent and will be asked how\n           they are feeling and if they have seen any doctors for their heart conditions.  The\n           patient will also be asked if they are taking antiplatelet medicines as prescribed, and\n           if there have been any changes in on their medicines.\n\n        -  If more than 12 months have passed since the procedure, the patients will be queried\n           regarding medical history\n\n        -  If the patient cannot be contacted, then analysis of data will be limited to\n           de-identified data collected from the chart, procedure angiogram, and the procedure\n           report.\n\n      Prospective patients This group will consist of patients in which the CTO procedure will be\n      performed by the PHI CTO team.\n\n        -  A clinical assessment will be performed before the stent procedure\n\n        -  A blood sample will be taken for routine blood chemistry and hematology\n\n        -  Medications will be prescribed to prevent blood clots\n\n        -  Follow-up will occur 6 and 12 months post-procedure"

Subjects experiencing clinical symptoms considered suggestive of ischemic heart\n             disease (eg, chest pain or discomfort or symptoms considered by the investigator to\n             represent anginal equivalents) or having evidence of myocardial ischemia (eg,\n             abnormal functional study) attributed to the CTO target vessel and scheduled for\n             clinically indicated percutaneous CTO revascularization or are subjects with\n             multi-vessel disease and/or Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) that are undergoing a\n             staged CTO PCI procedure with the intent to achieve complete revascularization.\n\n          3.

Any contraindication to cardiac catheterization or to any of the standard concomitant\n             therapies used during routine cardiac catheterization and PCI\n\n          4. Subjects with any other pathology or indication which in the opinion of the\n             investigator, might put the subject at risk, preclude follow-up, or in any way\n             confound the results of the study\n\n          5. Known previous medical condition yielding expected survival less than one year\n\n          6. Subjects who are unable or unwilling to comply with the protocol or not expected to\n             complete the study period, including its follow-up requirements\n\n          7. Subjects with evidence of ongoing or active clinical instability including any of the\n             following:\n\n               1. Sustained systolic blood pressure < 100 mmHg (if different from baseline) or\n                  cardiogenic shock\n\n               2. Acute pulmonary edema that has not been medically stabilized\n\n               3. Suspected acute myocarditis, pericarditis, endocarditis, or cardiac tamponade\n\n               4. Suspected dissecting aortic aneurysm\n\n          8. Subjects with known clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings including:\n\n               1. White Blood Cells (<1,000 WBC/mm3)\n\n               2. Thrombocytopenia (<100,000 platelets/mm3)\n\n          9. Subjects with history of bleeding diathesis or coagulapathy or refusal of blood\n             transfusions\n\n         10. Female subjects of child-bearing potential with a positive qualitative or\n             quantitative   pregnancy test or with a negative qualitative or quantitative\n             pregnancy test who plan to become pregnant within 12 months of enrolling in the study"
