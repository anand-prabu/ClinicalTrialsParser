The hypothesis being\n      tested is that inhibition of elastase in the airways will help neutrophils decrease the\n      number of bacteria. Each subject with cystic fibrosis will first undergo aerosol therapy\n      with a sterile saline solution and sputum will be collected 2, 4 and 6 hours after the\n      aerosol therapy to measure the density of bacteria. Subsequently, alpha1 antitrypsin, an\n      elastase inhibitor, will be given to the same patients by aerosol therapy twice in 1 day and\n      sputum will be collected at 2, 4 and 6 hours after treatment to measure the density of\n      bacteria.
