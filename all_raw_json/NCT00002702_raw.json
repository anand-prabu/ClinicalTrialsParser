Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. It\n      is not known whether giving interleukin-2 with surgery and radiation therapy is more\n      effective than surgery and radiation therapy alone.\n\n      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying surgery and radiation therapy alone to\n      see how well they work compared to surgery, radiation therapy, and interleukin-2 in treating\n      patients with cancer of the mouth or oropharynx."

Patients are stratified according to\n      center and tumor stage (T2, N0-2 vs T2, N3 or T3-4, N0-3). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2\n      treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients undergo induction comprising interleukin-2 (IL-2) via perilymphatic\n           injections to the ipsilateral myelohyoid muscle and insertion of the\n           sternocleidomastoid muscle on days 1-5 and 8-12. Within 10 days after the last IL-2\n           injection, patients undergo en bloc resection of the primary tumor and corresponding\n           lymphatic drainage area and pre-study margins. Beginning within 4 weeks after surgery,\n           patients with T2, N0-3 disease but with pathohistological evidence of node invasion or\n           capsular rupture of node metastasis or T3-4, N0-3 disease undergo adjuvant radiotherapy\n           5 days a week for 4.5-6.5 weeks. Beginning within 4 weeks after surgery or radiotherapy\n           (if applicable), patients receive adjuvant IL-2 via perilymphatic injections to the\n           contralateral myelohyoid muscle and insertion of the sternocleidomastoid muscle on days\n           1-5. Adjuvant IL-2 continues monthly for at least 1 year in the absence of disease\n           progression.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients undergo resection and radiotherapy (if eligible) as in arm I. Patients\n           are followed monthly for 1 year and then every 2 months for 2 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 260 patients (130 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this\n      study."
