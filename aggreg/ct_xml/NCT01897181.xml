      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the central auditory processing in patients with
      bilateral sensorineural hearing loss and to observe the change of the central auditory
      processing ability after using hearing aids.

      Screening for recruiting

        -  Among patients who are visiting for hearing disturbance, patients with bilateral
           sensorineural hearing loss will be included after audiologic tests, history taking and
           physical examination.

        -  audiologic tests: pure tone audiometry, speech audiometry, impedence audiometry,
           distortion product otoacoustic emission, auditory brainstem response.

      Dividing into &quot;Hearing aids&quot; group and &quot;No hearing aids&quot; group

        -  The use of hearing aids will be recommended to all included patients.

        -  Hearing aids group: patients who want to be prescribed hearing aids (28 subjects)

        -  No hearing aids group: patients who do not want to be prescribed hearing aids (28
           subjects)

      Audiologic test

        -  Hearing in noise test (HINT), central auditory processing disorder test

        -  at screening, 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after starting hearing aids use

    <description>The central auditory processing disorder test is composed of three subtests; duration pattern test, frequency pattern test and dichotic words test. The patient is required to discriminate long duration sound from short one and high frequency sound from low one, and to repeat two words that are given simultaneously.</description>
