White blood cells from donors may be able to prevent\n      graft-versus-host disease in patients with hematologic cancer that has relapsed following\n      donor peripheral stem cell transplantation.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of chemotherapy plus donor white blood\n      cell infusion in treating patients who have relapsed hematologic cancer following donor\n      peripheral stem cell transplantation."

Determine the minimum amount of chemotherapy in combination with donor\n      lymphocyte infusion required to obtain a rate of 30-60% graft versus host disease in\n      patients with hematologic malignancies relapsed after allogeneic stem cell transplantation.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose de-escalation study. Patients receive etoposide IV continuously on\n      days 1-3; cyclophosphamide IV on day 8; donor lymphocyte infusion IV on day 10; and\n      filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously or IV beginning on day 10 and continuing until blood\n      counts recover. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive six de-escalating levels of chemotherapy\n      until the minimum amount of chemotherapy in combination with donor lymphocyte infusion\n      required to obtain a rate of 30-60% graft versus host disease (GVHD) is determined. The\n      target dose level is defined as the level at which 2 of 6 patients develop GVHD, and the\n      next lower dose level has no more than 1 patient experiencing GVHD. Patients are followed\n      every 3 months for the first year, every 6 months for the second year, and yearly\n      thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-21 patients will be accrued over 2 years."
