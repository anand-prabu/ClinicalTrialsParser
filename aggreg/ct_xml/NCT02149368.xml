      The primary objective of this study is to assess changes in alanine aminotransferase (ALT)
      in hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected subjects given daily doses of JKB-122 (naltrexone) for 3
      months who have been nonresponsive to, intolerable to, or relapsed from prior
      interferon-based therapies (pegylated or standard) either alone or in combination with
      ribavirin or other anti-HCV therapies including direct-acting anti-viral agents.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Is male or female, 18 years to 65 years of age.

          2. If female of childbearing potential, must not be pregnant or breastfeeding and either
             postmenopausal (no menses for previous 12 months) or using an effective method of
             birth control (e.g., oral contraceptives, hormonal injectable or implanted
             contraceptives, tubal ligation, or partner with vasectomy plus a barrier method).

          3. Is HCV positive (documented by HCV RNA testing at Screening). Chronic hepatitis C is
             defined as a) Positive for anti-HCV antibody, HCV RNA, or an HCV genotype at least 6
             months before screening, and positive for HCV RNA and anti-HCV antibody at the time
             of screening; or b) Positive for anti-HCV antibody and HCV RNA at the time of
             screening with a liver biopsy consistent with chronic HCV infection (or a liver
             biopsy performed before enrollment with evidence of CHC disease, such as the presence
             of fibrosis), according to &quot;Guidance for Industry. Chronic Hepatitis C Virus
             Infection: Developing Direct-Acting Antiviral Agents for Treatment&quot;.

          4. Has previous results from HCV genotype testing. If previous results are not
             available, such testing should be performed at Screening.

          5. Has had a liver biopsy or Fibroscan™ within 3 years.

          6. Has minimal hepatic dysfunction, defined as follows:

               -  Stage 0, stage 1 or 2 fibrosis(according to liver biopsy or Fibroscan™ results)
                  ALT and AST values not exceeding 5 x ULN (Baseline value for each parameter will
                  be calculated as the average of 3 values obtained 7 days apart, i.e., at each
                  screening visit [Days -28, -21, and -14])

               -  Normal albumin, total bilirubin, and prothrombin time values

          7. Has elevated liver test results (ALT) at least 1.5 x ULN and not exceeding 5 x ULN
             (Baseline value for each parameter will be calculated as the average of 3 values
             obtained 7 days apart, i.e., at each screening visit [Days -28, -21, and -14]).

          8. Is refractory or null responder, which is defined as less than 2 log10 reduction in
             HCV RNA at week 12 of a standard or Peg Interferon/ribavirin or other anti-HCV
             therapies.

          9. Is intolerable to, or relapsed from previous interferon-based therapies or other
             anti-HCV  therapies. Relapser is defined as HCV RNA undetectable at the end of
             treatment with a standard or pegylated interferon-based regimen or other anti-HCV
             therapies, but HCV RNA detectable within 24 weeks of treatment follow-up. The
             intolerable is defined as HCV patients who cannot tolerate the side effects of
             previous interferon-based therapies or other anti-HCV  therapies,  or who were not
             suitable for interferon-based therapies  or other anti-HCV  therapies.

         10. Is opioid-free for at least 10 days prior to the first screening visit (Day -28).

         11. Has not been treated with interferon-based therapies (pegylated or standard), either
             alone or in combination with ribavirin, or other anti-HCV therapies for at least 12
             weeks prior to the first screening visit (Day -28).

         12. Is capable of understanding and signing the informed consent document. If subject is
             unable to sign the informed consent form, then the subject's legal representative or
             guardian may provide written consent per state and institution guidelines.

         13. Agrees to comply with protocol requirements.

          4. Has history of liver cirrhosis

          5. Has positive urine drug screen at Screening

          6. Is currently consuming greater than 30 g of alcohol per day (eg, 2 highballs with 1
             shot each, or 2 beers) or has consumed greater than 2 glasses of alcohol per day
             within 3 months prior to the first screening visit (Day -28)

          7. Is being treated with any prescription narcotic drug (including transdermal delivery
             systems)

          8. Has a known or suspected central nervous system disorder that may predispose to

          9. Has significant history of hypertension

         10. Has received other therapies for HCV infection (interferon, pegylated interferon,
             ribavirin, or others) in the last 12 weeks prior to the first screening visit (Day
             -28)

         11. Requires concomitant use of or treatment with opioids or other excluded drugs such as
             hepatotoxic medications

         12. Has received other investigational agents within 30 days prior to the first screening
             visit (Day -28)

         13. Has a disease that would require chronic use of prescription corticosteroids

         14. Has either autoimmune or genetic liver disease

         15. May be chronically or latently infected with microbial agents other than HCV

         16. Has impaired renal function (i.e. serum  creatinine &gt; 1.5xULN or serum creatinine &gt;
