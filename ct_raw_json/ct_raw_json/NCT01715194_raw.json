Data of the CPAP are downloaded to the internet once daily. On week days, a nurse is checking the downloaded data three times per week. The nurse contacts the patient if\nCPAP was used <4h/ night for 2 consecutive night\nthe median leakage was above 0.4 L/sec on 2 consecutive nights The nurse informs the patient of the problem observed, asks for explanations and gives advice on possibilities to solve the problem. The common problems and the respective solutions are discussed according to the ELF facts sheet (Dry mouth/throat, nasal congestion, skin irritation, conjunctivitis, headache, loss of benefits, appendix 1). The patient is encouraged to use CPAP every night. In the case of regular use and acceptable leakage, a congratulatory message is sent to the patient via sms or e-mail (for procedural rules, see appendix 4)."

On an individual basis, it has been shown that a longer\n      duration of CPAP use is associated with better outcomes in terms of daytime functioning and\n      in the control of metabolic and blood pressure effects of CPAP. For our study, we have\n      therefore decided to use 2 co-primary endpoints, taking into account both aspects of\n      adherence mentioned. Cardiovascular complications are a major concern in OSAS patients.\n      Effective CPAP treatment has been shown to reduce surrogate measures of cardiovascular risk.\n      We hypothesize that intensified efforts for CPAP adherence with telemedicine has a positive\n      impact on a number of surrogate measures of the cardiovascular risk at 1 and 6 months of\n      treatment."
