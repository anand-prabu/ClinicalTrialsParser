The curriculum is based on MBSR manuals with a brief CRF education component incorporated into the first and second class sessions, drawing from information from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network clinical practice guidelines for CRF. In general, the MBSR class includes guided meditation practice; mindful, gentle movement (hatha yoga); didactic material on self-regulatory responses to stress; and group discussion that includes the participants' growing incorporation of mindfulness in adapting to life experiences. Along with class time, each participant is asked to commit 20 minutes per day, six days per week to formal meditation practice using compact disk recordings of the teacher's voice."

This condition contains \"non-specific\" factors similar to MBSR (e.g., facilitator offering participants compassionate attention, empathy, genuine caring, and an opportunity to discuss what is important to them in a supportive environment); however, mindfulness is not presented/practiced in the group."
