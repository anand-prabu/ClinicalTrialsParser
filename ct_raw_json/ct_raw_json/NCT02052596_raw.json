A prednisone dose of < 20 mg/day is allowed. Inhaled, topical and\n             intra-articular corticosteroids are allowed.\n\n          -  Administration or planned administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study\n             protocol within the period starting 30 days before the first dose of study vaccine(s)\n             and ending 30 days after the last dose of study vaccine. This includes any type of\n             vaccine such as (but not limited to) live, inactivated and subunit vaccines (e.g.,\n             inactivated and subunit influenza vaccines).\n\n          -  Administration of long-acting immune-modifying drugs (e.g. infliximab) within six\n             months prior to the first vaccine dose or expected administration at any time during\n             the study period.\n\n          -  Concurrently participating in another clinical study, at any time during the study\n             period, in which the subject has been or will be exposed to an investigational or a\n             non-investigational vaccine/product (pharmaceutical product or device).\n\n          -  Previous vaccination against VZV or HZ and/or planned administration during the study\n             of an HZ or VZV vaccine (including an investigational or non-registered vaccine)\n             other than the study vaccine.\n\n          -  History of HZ.\n\n          -  Vaccination against diphtheria, or tetanus in the last five years or planned\n             vaccination against diphtheria or tetanus during the study period, other than the\n             study vaccine(s).\n\n          -  Administration of a combined tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis (Tdap) vaccine at any\n             time prior to study entry.\n\n          -  Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition resulting\n             from disease (e.g., malignancy, human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] infection) or\n             immunosuppressive/cytotoxic therapy (e.g., medications used during cancer\n             chemotherapy, organ transplantation or to treat autoimmune disorders).\n\n          -  History of any reaction or hypersensitivity likely to be exacerbated by any component\n             of the vaccines including prior severe allergic reaction following tetanus-toxoid,\n             diphtheria-toxoid or pertussis-containing vaccine.\n\n          -  Hypersensitivity to latex. Note: The investigational HZ/su vaccine does not contain\n             latex.\n\n          -  Acute disease and/or fever at the time of enrolment.\n\n               -  Fever is defined as temperature \u2265 37.5\u00b0C /99.5\u00b0F by oral route. The preferred\n                  route for recording temperature in this study will be oral.\n\n               -  Subjects with a minor illness (such as mild diarrhea, mild upper respiratory\n                  infection) without fever may, be enrolled at the discretion of the investigator.\n\n          -  Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the 3 months\n             preceding the first dose of study vaccine or planned administration during the study\n             period.\n\n          -  Pregnant or lactating female.\n\n          -  Female planning to become pregnant or planning to discontinue contraceptive\n             precautions before 2 months after the last dose of study vaccine.\n\n          -  Any condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, prevents the subject from\n             participating in the study.\n\n          -  Any condition which, in the judgment of the investigator, would make intramuscular\n             (IM) injection unsafe.\n\n          -  Encephalopathy (e.g. coma, decreased consciousness, prolonged seizures) not\n             attributable to an identifiable cause within 7 days of administration of a previous\n             pertussis antigen-containing vaccine.\n\n          -  Progressive or unstable neurologic disorder.\n\n          -  History of Arthus-type hypersensitivity reaction following a prior dose of a\n             tetanus-toxoid containing vaccine within the last 10 years.\n\n          -  History of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome within 6 weeks of receipt of a prior vaccine\n             containing tetanus toxoid."
