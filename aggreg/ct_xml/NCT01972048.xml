  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Korean American (KA) women have among the highest breast cancer mortality rates and lowest
      breast cancer screening rates of U.S. American women across racial/ethical groups. This
      innovative project seeks to harness mobile phone technology as a means to take preventative
      health care to a new level among this population. Using the Fogg Behavioral Model this study
      proposes to develop a mobile phone-based intervention designed to motivate KA women to
      undergo an annual mammogram (mMammogram). The overall study aim is to develop and assess the
      feasibility and effectiveness of a 7-day long mMammogram intervention designed to persuade
      KA women to undergo breast cancer screening.

      Specific aims over the three-year period include the following: (1) The first year will be
      devoted to intervention and protocol development. A major emphasis in year 1 will be
      developing the community advisory board (CAB), conducting a series of pre-intervention focus
      groups, and working with pertinent persuasive technology consultants to develop and
      pilot-test the intervention. (2) The second year and the first half of the third year will
      focus on delivery of the intervention. (3) the second half of the third year will be devoted
      to data analysis and dissemination.
