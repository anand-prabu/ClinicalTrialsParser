  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The gluteus medius (Gmed) and gluteus maximus (Gmax) muscles are important components in the
      treatment of many lower limb injuries. Recent studies have evaluated a myriad of exercises
      which activate the Gmed and Gmax, but limited research remains on exercises involving
      resistance and the role of the TFL. The purpose of this study is to evaluate Gmed, Gmax, and
      TFL percent maximal voluntary isometric contraction (%MVIC) and perceived exertion in
      healthy and low back pain patients while performing exercises with and without resistance.
      Methods: A convenience sample of healthy subjects and patients diagnosed with non-radicular
      low back pain will be recruited. Exclusionary criteria will include: current low back or
      lower extremity injury (healthy group), pregnancy, history of hip surgery, and radicular
      symptoms. Surface electromyography will be used to quantify the activity level of the
      gluteal muscles and TFL while performing a series of 8 exercises with and without
      Thera-Band® Resistance Tubing and Stability Trainer. The maximal voluntary isometric
      contraction (MVIC) will be established for each muscle group and the order of exercises
      performed will be randomized to minimize the effect of fatigue. Following the completion of
      each exercise, the patient will rate their perceived exertion level on the Thera-Band®
      Resistance Intensity Scale for Exercise (RISE). The EMG signals will be smoothed and
      rectified and analyzed using a root-mean-square algorithm. Clinical Relevance: The results
      of this study will allow clinicians to better prescribe exercises, proven to activate the
      gluteal muscles and limit the TFL involvement, in the treatment of low back pain.
