  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This PMS study aims to collect safety and reactogenicity data of Synflorix™ in healthy
      infants and children of the local population as per the licensing requirement of the Sri
      Lankan regulatory authority.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The participating physicians (investigators) will be asked to enrol only those subjects to
      whom they administer Synflorix™ in the course of their normal clinical practice according to
      the locally approved Prescribing Information.

      Since there is lack of clarity regarding the PMS study requirement (both from Regulatory
      agency and Ethics Committee), it was decided that GSK will submit Local PSURs on a regular
      basis as desired by Local regulatory agency. The same is communicated to Regulatory agency
      and if they want something more they are requested to revert back with specific
      requirements.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who the investigator believes that their parent(s)/ LAR(s) can and will

        Note: Consent for this PMS study is solely for collection of safety and reactogenicity
        data and not for vaccination that is per routine practice. Data for demography, medical
        history and previous vaccination history, and concomitant medication/vaccination will also
        be collected.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with contraindications according to the locally approved PI.
