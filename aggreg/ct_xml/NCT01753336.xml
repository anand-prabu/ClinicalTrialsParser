    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects enrolled in Study 169 that have no ongoing adverse events, which in the
             opinion of the Investigator are related to study treatment and that precludes them
             from receiving continuing therapy

          -  Completed Study 169, or completed all study visits up to and including Week 4 and in
             the event of an early withdrawal after Week 4 have â‰¤15% reduction in TWSTRS total
             score at Week 4 compared to their baseline TWSTRS total score in the double-blind
             study, and in the Investigator's clinical judgment, would benefit from Dysport for
             CD.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of pure retrocollis or pure anterocollis

          -  Requirement for botulinum toxin injection to site(s) for disorders other than CD and
             unable to avoid such treatment(s) for the duration of the study

          -  Known hypersensitivity to botulinum toxin or related compounds, or any component in
             the study drug formulation

          -  Allergy to cow's milk protein
