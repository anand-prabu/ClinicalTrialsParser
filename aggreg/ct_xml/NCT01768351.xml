  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although current activated vitamin D therapies are approved for treating secondary
      hyperparathyroidism in chronic kidney disease (CKD), a large body of experimental data in
      animals confirms the effects of vitamin D that extend beyond mineral metabolism. Several
      studies show that the benefits are greater with the newer vitamin D analog paricalcitol when
      compared with calcitriol.

      A large gap exists in our knowledge between epidemiological studies in humans that
      demonstrate improved outcomes with vitamin D use and observations in preclinical studies
      demonstrating the pleiotropic effects of vitamin D. To explore the provenance of
      epidemiological outcomes in patients with CKD, we conducted a pilot placebo-controlled trial
      to determine whether the use of paricalcitol leads to improvement in anemia, a marker
      associated with worse outcomes in chronic kidney disease, and whether this effect not only
      reflects the hyperparathyroidism correction, but is also dependent on the direct effects of
      paricalcitol on erythroid progenitor cells.

      To better understand the direct effects of paricalcitol on anemia in patients with chronic
      kidney disease (stage 3-5), we conducted a pilot trial in 60 patients who were randomly
      allocated equally to 2 groups to receive or not paricalcitol orally for 6 months.

    <description>Patients receiving treatment for secondary hyperparathyroidism with calcitriol. The calcitriol dosage schedule provided for an initial dose calculated according to body weight (0.01 mg/kg thrice weekly), and titration was performed on the basis of the serum levels of intact PTH (iPTH) (target 150-300 pg/mL), Ca, P and Ca x P product as suggested by the US National Kidney Foundation Dialysis outcomes Quality Initiative (NKF-DOQI) and Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines. At the same way, the patients not treated started therapy if their values needed, as suggested by the NKF-DOQI and KDIGO guidelines.</description>
