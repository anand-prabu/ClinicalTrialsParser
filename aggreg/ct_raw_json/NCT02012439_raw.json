            "textblock": "Chronic pain is a pervasive, serious problem for many individuals with multiple sclerosis\n      (MS) that is typically inadequately treated by medications alone. There is a critical need\n      to develop and evaluate innovative psychosocial interventions that have the capacity to\n      effectively target the multidimensional nature of MS pain. Cognitive Therapy (CT) is one\n      psychosocial treatment that has been found to be a potentially beneficial treatment for\n      chronic MS pain. This approach teaches patients to identify and replace unhelpful thoughts\n      about pain with helpful, more adaptive thoughts. In addition, over the past decade there has\n      been a steady upsurge of research examining mindfulness meditation-based therapies for the\n      treatment of medical conditions, including symptoms associated with MS. Mindfulness\n      mediation involves training the mind to disengage from automatic thinking patterns to\n      mindfully perceive, in a non-judgmental manner, one's moment-to-moment experiences. This\n      meditation technique teaches patients to become aware of thoughts, emotions, and physical\n      sensations and to recognize that these are transient experiences that can be mindfully\n      perceived, accepted and let go. A promising, more recent trend in treatment development\n      research is the integration of tradition CT with mindfulness-based meditation, an approach\n      referred to as Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT). To date, we are the only research\n      group that has adapted and tested a manualized MBCT approach for the treatment of painful\n      medical conditions. Thus, the proposed pilot randomized controlled trial aims to utilize\n      state-of-the-art research methodology to evaluate traditional Cognitive Therapy (CT)\n      compared to an innovative, newly developed Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT)\n      protocol for the treatment of chronic pain in individuals with multiple sclerosis. This\n      study will answer three primary questions: (1) Do these treatments work to improve chronic\n      pain for individuals with MS and do these treatment also improve associated symptoms such as\n      depression, fatigue, and engagement in daily activities?; (2) How do these treatments work\n      in individuals with MS, i.e., what factors underlie improvement in outcomes during\n      treatment?; and (3) What are the individual person characteristics that best predict\n      outcome? This will be the first study to examine MBCT within an MS population. The results\n      will lead to the emergence of a novel, much needed additional psychosocial treatment option\n      for patients with chronic MS pain."
