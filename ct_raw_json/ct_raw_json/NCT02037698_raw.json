For the initial period for CTO\n      intervention, percutaneous coronary artery intervention (PCI) of CTO lesions are associated\n      with low procedural success rates about 70%. Recently, the success rate of the\n      recanalization of CTOs has been raised in several studies.\n\n      Coronary CT angiography (CCTA) is an effective noninvasive diagnostic modality for detecting\n      coronary artery disease. CCTA can visualize the complete anatomy of coronary arteries in\n      contrast to conventional coronary angiography, reducing the deferral rates from CTO\n      intervention. Assessment of characteristics of CTO lesions by pre-procedural CCTA could help\n      to determine revascularization strategy and estimate the procedure time, leading to lower\n      procedural complications. We suggest that success rates and clinical outcome of\n      intervention of CTO lesion can be improved by pre-procedural CCTA."
