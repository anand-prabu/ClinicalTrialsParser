  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer (CRC) accounts for 10% to 15% of all cancers and is the second leading
      cause of cancer deaths in Western countries. Approximately half of all patients develop
      metastatic disease and become candidates for the palliative chemotherapy which has been
      proved to prolong survival and improve quality of life (QOL) in patients with metastatic
      CRC. The most active chemotherapy regiments include oxaliplatin or irinotecan combined with
      fluoropyrimidines.

      With overall survival in metastatic CRC nowadays routinely around 2 years, the same
      intensity of therapy can hardly be maintained throughout the course of therapy. The
      continuum of care therefore mandates changes in therapy, with treatment breaks or phases of
      less-intensive maintenance therapy interspersed with periods of more-intensive therapy to
      control tumor progression. Thereby, chemo-holidays conceivably reduce the cumulative
      toxicities of chemotherapy, potentially prevent the unplanned, premature discontinuation of
      therapy, preserve the ability to administer further phases of therapy, potentially maximize
      the time on therapy, reduce cost, and could increase QOL for patients. Several trials have
      tested the influence of chemo-holidays on patient outcome, with various rules on when to
      stop which component of antitumor therapy as follows; 1) Completely stopping all therapeutic
      agents, giving patients a completely chemotherapy-free interval (OPTIMOX-2, GISCAD), or 2)
      Stopping only those agents associated with significant (cumulative) toxicity while
      continuing other agents as maintenance therapy (OPTIMOX-1, Combined Oxaliplatin
      Neurotoxicity Prevention Trial [CONcePT]).

      Therefore, we'd like to test if capecitabine maintenance after 8 cycles of capecitabine
      combine with oxaliplatin (XELOX) could prolong progression-free survival without
      deterioration of QOL and toxicities in patients metastatic CRC.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Tumor type other than adenocarcinoma

          -  Second primary malignancy (except in situ carcinoma of the cervix or adequately
             treated basal cell carcinoma of the skin, papillary thyroid carcinoma or prior
             malignancy treated more than 5 years ago without recurrence)

          -  Adjuvant or neo-adjuvant treatment for non-metastatic (M0) disease is allowed if
             completed at least 6 months prior to initiation of study treatment.

          -  Prior radiotherapy is permitted if it was not administered to target lesions selected
             for this study, unless progression of the selected target lesions within the
             radiation portal is documented, and provided it has been completed at least 4 weeks
