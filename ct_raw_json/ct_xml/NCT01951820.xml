  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project will be a double blind study comparing the efficacy of two different topical
      anesthetics used to reduce the pain associated with insertion of dental needles on the
      palatal mucosa. The two topical anesthetics being compared are 20% Benzocaine, and Pliaglis.

      In order to complete a number of different dental procedures it is often necessary to
      provide local anesthesia of the palate. Intraoral injections into the palatal mucosa are
      often uncomfortable and even painful. In an effort to increase patient comfort, a topical
      anesthetic is often used prior to the injection. Test subjects undergoing routine endodontic
      treatment on maxillary teeth will have a 27- gauge dental needle inserted into the mucosa of
      the hard palate as part of the initial step in standard local anesthetic injection. At the
      injection site and prior to the needle stick, the mucosa will be topically anesthetized by
      using one of the two different test compounds (Benzocaine or Pliaglis). After the injection
      patients will be asked to score the level of discomfort associated with the needle stick.

      The purpose of the project is to determine if there is a clinical difference in the level of
      pain felt upon needle stick, between the two different topical anesthetics.

      The Efficacy of the topical anesthetics will be determined by how much pain the patient felt
      (using a Heft-Parker pain analog scale) upon needle penetration.

    <description>The investigation is trying to determine if the compounded topical anesthetic (Pliaglis) is more effective than the active control (benzocaine) in numbing the gums before needle penetration. The effectiveness of the topical anesthetics will be determined by the patient indicating their level of discomfort felt upon needle stick by using a Heft-Parker visual analog pain scale (scale of 0 - 170mm).</description>
