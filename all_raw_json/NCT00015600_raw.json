The project is a partnership of\n      university researchers and the Farmworkers Association of Florida. After collecting\n      extensive data from farmworkers, health providers and farm owners about primary means of\n      pesticide exposure we are collaboratively developing an intervention that will reduce\n      pesticide exposure by educating workers and owners about: the need to have adequate washing\n      facilities; to wash hands frequently; to obey reentry intervals; to change work clothes\n      after work to prevent child exposure and more."
