  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and usefulness of Hand-assisted
      laparoscopic surgery (HALS) for myomectomy, and compare it with the open approach in
      myomectomy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Uterine myomas are the most common benign tumor of the female genital tract and the leading
      indication for hysterectomy. Despite the fact that laparoscopic myomectomy is becoming
      increasingly popular, laparoscopic myomectomy remains underutilized because of inherit
      limitations. The limitations include technical challenges such as dissection of the myoma
      from its bed using the correct plane or multilayer closure of the myoma bed and the concern
      about the strength of the suturing and the subsequent risk of uterine rupture. As a result,
      laparoscopic myomectomy is currently performed only by expert surgeons.

      Hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery (HALS) is a unique surgical approach that may overcome
      the limitations of pure laparoscopic surgery. HALS is not only less invasive than open
      surgery but also causes less technical challenges than laparoscopic surgery based on its
      manual nature and ability to use retractors. In gynecologic field, HALS has also been
      employed in ovarian cancers and large ovarian tumors.

      In theory, HALS seems appropriate procedure, similar to the open approach, for patients with
      multiple or huge myomas. To date, no report has evaluated the feasibility and usefulness of
      HALS compared with open surgery (OS).

    <description>In HALS, a trocar of 5-mm calipers was inserted through the umbilicus. Next, suprapubic transverse skin incision of 3-4cm in length was made and a wound retractor (Alexis; Applied Medical, Rancho Santa Margarita, CA) was inserted through the suprapubic opening.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Inclusion criteria were as follows: women who had myoma-related symptoms such as
        menorrhagia, pelvic pressure/pain, or infertility; women who were not pregnant at the time
        of presentation (i.e., negative for urine pregnancy test or last menstrual period within

        (American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status classification 1 or 2).

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Exclusion criteria included any other uterine or adnexal abnormalities (e.g., abnormal
        endometrial thickness, and suspected ovarian or uterine malignancy), any sign of genital
        infection, presence of submucosal or pedunculated myoma as a dominant myoma, treatment of
        gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist 2 months before surgery, or an inability to
