  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal is to study the effectiveness of Trauma-focused Cognitive Behavioral
      Therapy (TF-CBT) in treating traumatic grief and traumatic stress for orphaned children and
      young adolescents in two East African sites with high prevalence HIV, Moshi, Tanzania (TZ)
      and Bungoma, Kenya (KE), through a randomized controlled trial (RCT). In a previous
      feasibility study of TF-CBT with orphans in Tanzania, the investigators have found a
      group-based TF-CBT intervention to be feasible and acceptable, with promising clinical
      outcomes. In the feasibility study, lay counselors with no prior mental health experience
      delivered the intervention with training and supervision by our team of mental health and
      TF-CBT experts.

      Building on this initial study, the investigators are conducting a RCT to test the
      effectiveness of TF-CBT for traumatic grief and traumatic stress compared to receipt of
      usual care orphan services in TZ and KE. The study involves collaboration with HIV/AIDS
      grassroots organizations and local Co-Investigators in TZ and KE, both of whom are
      longstanding collaborators with the investigators' US team and are located in mixed urban
      and rural areas, allowing examination of effectiveness in two countries and two settings
      (urban/rural). Using a task-shifting approach, in which lay individuals are trained as
      counselors, the investigators will train six counselors in each country, who deliver 20
      groups in each site (10 rural, 10 urban), resulting in 320 children and adolescents (ages
      7-13) who receive TF-CBT and 320 who receive usual care. Outcomes for children are assessed
      at 12-14 weeks (i.e., corresponding with the end of TF-CBT), 6-months post-treatment, and
      12-months post-treatment. TF-CBT experts from the investigators' team partner with the lay
      counselors from the feasibility study (e.g., local trainers) to train the TZ and KE
      counselors, and these local trainers provide the TF-CBT supervision, while supervised
      themselves by the US-based TF-CBT and mental health experts. The investigators expect this
      trial to yield recommendations regarding an effective intervention for orphans that is
      acceptable, feasible, and includes local responsibility as a means to enhance potential
      sustainability in Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LAMICs). Findings will inform other
      efforts to scale up mental health interventions to address the substantial mental health
      gap.
