Determine the\n      relationships between levels of hypoxia, measures of microvascular density, and\n      photosensitizer levels in this patient population.\n\n      IV. Correlate hypoxia and photosensitizer levels with clinical outcome in this patient\n      population.\n\n      V. Determine the toxic effects of EF5 in this patient population.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.\n\n      Patients receive etanidazole derivative EF5 IV over 1-2 hours. Approximately 48 hours after\n      EF5 administration, patients with intraperitoneal tumors undergo surgical resection.\n      Patients with pleural tumors undergo surgical resection approximately 24 hours after EF5\n      administration. Tumors are then analyzed for EF5 binding and microvascular density by\n      immunohistochemistry and fluorescent antibody techniques.\n\n      Patients are followed at 2 weeks and at 30-45 days post EF5 infusion.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 80 patients (50 with intraperitoneal malignancy and 30 with\n      pleural malignancy) will be accrued for this study within 2.5 years. Patients are stratified\n      by disease (intraperitoneal malignancy vs pleural malignancy)."
