Impaired respiratory function judged to pose a risk to the patient during anaesthesia\n             for the device implantation.\n\n          2. Hypertension defined as blood pressure >160 mmHg systolic or >90 mmHg diastolic.\n\n          3. Values for coagulation parameters including platelet count, normalised prothrombin\n             complex (PK-INR), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) outside normal ranges.\n\n          4. Ophthalmological examination (fundus photography, visual acuity and perimetry) with\n             any clinically significant findings that imply safety concerns for this study.\n\n          5. Diagnosis of diabetes mellitus.\n\n          6. History of structural brain disease other than ALS, including tumours and\n             hyperplasia.\n\n          7. An MRI of the brain and cervical spine, and an Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA)\n             of the brain with findings of tumours or potential sources of pathological bleedings,\n             or abnormality that may interfere with the assessments of safety or efficacy or that\n             would, in the judgment of the investigator, represent a surgical risk to the patient.\n             If an MRI and/or MRA has been performed within 1 month prior to screening, the\n             results from that examination can be used.\n\n          8. Any disorder that precludes a surgical procedure (e.g., signs of sepsis or\n             inadequately treated infection), alters wound healing (e.g., including bleeding\n             disorders), or renders chronic i.c.v. delivery or device implants medically\n             unsuitable.\n\n          9. Presence of risk for increased or uncontrolled bleeding and/or risk of bleeding that\n             cannot be not managed optimally due to:\n\n             i. anatomical factors at or near the implant site (e.g., vascular abnormalities,\n             neoplasms, or other abnormalities), ii. underlying disorders of the coagulation\n             cascade, platelet function, or platelet count (e.g., haemophilia, Von Willebrand's\n             disease, liver disease, or other medical conditions) iii. administration of any\n             antiplatelet or anticoagulant medication in the preoperative period\n\n         10. A personal history of thromboembolic disease. A family history of thromboembolic\n             disease will prompt a laboratory assessment to exclude hereditary liability before\n             the patient is declared eligible.\n\n         11. Presence of additional risk factors for thromboembolism such as obesity (BMI > 35) or\n             use of oestrogens including combined contraceptive pills.\n\n         12. Presence of an implanted shunt for the drainage of CSF or an implanted Central\n             Nervous System (CNS) catheter.\n\n         13. Clinically significant abnormalities in haematology or clinical chemistry parameters\n             as assessed by the investigator.\n\n         14. Serological evidence of Hepatitis B virus (HBV), Hepatitis C virus (HCV) or Human\n             immunodeficiency virus (HIV)\n\n         15. Ongoing medical condition that according to the investigator would interfere with the\n             conduct and assessments in the study. Examples are medical disability (e.g., severe\n             degenerative arthritis, compromised nutritional state, peripheral neuropathy) that\n             would interfere with the assessment of safety and efficacy of investigational product\n             or device performance, or would compromise the ability of the patient to undergo\n             study procedures (e.g., MRI), or to give informed consent.\n\n         16. Participation in another clinical trial with an investigational drug or device within\n             3 months prior to screening visit.\n\n         17. For women only: pregnant, breast feeding and/or for fecund women unwillingness to use\n             adequate contraception during the trial such as:\n\n               -  Established use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception\n                  that do NOT contain oestrogens.\n\n               -  Placement of an intrauterine device.\n\n               -  Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or occlusive cap (diaphragm or\n                  cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository."
