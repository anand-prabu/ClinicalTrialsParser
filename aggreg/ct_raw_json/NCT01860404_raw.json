            "textblock": "The Centers for Disease Control now estimates that 1.6 - 3.8 million sports related\n      concussions occur each year in the United States. A large proportion of these athletes have\n      enduring cognitive and neurobehavioral problems. Concussion is a heterogeneous insult to the\n      brain that precipitates a complex pathophysiological process that can result in a cascade of\n      deleterious side effects. At present, there are no proven therapies to mitigate or prevent\n      the neurocognitive and neurobehavioral consequences of sports-related concussions. The\n      limbic hippocampus, a brain structure crucial for learning and memory, is often damaged in\n      concussion. In preclinical studies, analysis of hippocampi isolated from mice after\n      traumatic brain injury demonstrated that only the concentrations of the three branched chain\n      amino acids (valine, isoleucine, and leucine) were significantly altered (reduced) after\n      injury. When these brain-injured animals received dietary supplementation with branched\n      chain amino acids (BCAA's), the concentrations of these amino acids were restored in the\n      injured hippocampus and the injured animals demonstrated significant cognitive improvement\n      to levels comparable to those obtained in non-injured control animals.  In light of these\n      results and the increasing awareness and morbidity associated with concussion, we are\n      conducting a therapeutic exploratory clinical trial to determine the effects of BCAA's in\n      reducing the neurocognitive side effects of sports-related concussion injury."
