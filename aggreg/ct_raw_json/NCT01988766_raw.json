The current study is being done to compare this\n      experience with the incidence of thrombosis from PICC lines.  A secondary aim will be to\n      determine if variables such as level of renal function, prior history of thrombosis or\n      atherosclerosis contribute to the risk of thrombosis when PICC lines are placed.   This data\n      will provide the first comparison of the incidence of thrombotic complications from short\n      term IJ catheter access versus PICC lines."
