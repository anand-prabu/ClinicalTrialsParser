  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to provide evidence of safety and effectiveness of the study
      valve.   The rationale is to offer a replacement mitral valve for patients with anatomy that
      is too small for the currently commercially available valves ranging in size from 16mm to
      37mm.

  <detailed_description>

      The study is a single arm, prospective, non-randomized, multi-center clinical investigation.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the 15mm MHV in
      subjects five years or less of age with a diseased, damaged, or malfunctioning mitral heart
      valve.  The objective will be evaluated by assessing valve-related adverse events, subject
      survival, subject growth, and echocardiogram assessment of hemodynamic function through the
      five year follow-up visit as long as the valve remains implanted.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject requires mitral valve replacement.*

          2. Subject's legally authorized representative gives written consent to participate in
             the clinical study.

          3. Subject is willing and able to return for data collection and follow-up for the
             duration of the clinical study.

               -  Subjects undergoing concomitant procedures (e.g. valve repair) are eligible for
                  this study other than those noted in the exclusion criteria.

          1. Subject is &gt; 5 years of age.

          2. Subject has a contraindication to anticoagulant/antiplatelet medication.

          3. Subject has a prosthetic valve(s) at a site other than the mitral valve prior to the
             study procedure.*

             valve.

          5. Subject has active endocarditis.

          6. Subject has active myocarditis.

          7. Subject has an acute preoperative neurological deficit or cardiac adverse event that
             has not returned to baseline or stabilized ≥ 30 days prior to the study procedure.

          8. Subject has a non-cardiac illness resulting in a life expectancy of &lt; 1 year.

          9. Subject has a known requirement for additional cardiac surgery within 12 months after
             the study procedure.

         10. Subject has been previously enrolled and implanted in this study.

         11. Subject is participating in another study for an investigational drug and/or device.

         12. Subject has any other medical condition that in the opinion of the Investigator will
