  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the acute effects of different meals on
      satiety.  It is hypothesized that a lower carbohydrate meal will result in greater feelings
      of satiety and reduced food intake at a subsequent meal compared to the higher-carbohydrate
      or meal skipping conditions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Satiety refers to feelings of fullness or lack of desire to eat following consumption of a
      food or meal. A number of dietary factors have been shown to influence satiety, including
      food volume, food weight, energy density, food palatability, and certain food ingredients.
      The nutritional composition of a meal appears to also play a significant role in an
      individual's feelings of satiety and ability to stay full until the next meal.
