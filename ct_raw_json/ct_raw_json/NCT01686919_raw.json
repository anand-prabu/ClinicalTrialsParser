Patients with either BMI > 40 kg/m2 or with BMI > 35 kg/m2 and\n      complications who opt for \"gastric bypass\" surgery, go through a standard program including\n      a thorough clinical examination and information on the operation, followed by a learning and\n      coping program that consists of standard dietary advise for weight loss and includes weekly\n      visits during 8 weeks.\n\n      This research project concerns a subgroup in the patient population described above:\n      morbidly obese patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). In this group it will be\n      investigated how an 8 week preoperative milk-free diet affects digestive functions and\n      weight loss. It is known that milk may cause stomach complaints and may make it more\n      difficult to loose weight."
