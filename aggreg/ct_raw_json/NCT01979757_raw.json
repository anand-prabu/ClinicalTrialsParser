The most frequently utilized\n      technique for fat processing is centrifugation. The PureGraft device (Cytori Therapeutics,\n      USA) is a new method that involves washing and filtering the fat to prepare the graft. The\n      investigators compared the subjective and objective outcomes of two fat-processing methods,\n      centrifugation and PureGraft filtration.\n\n      Thirty patients underwent breast reconstruction performed by a single surgeon (OM) after BCT\n      in our department between April 2011 and September 2012. The patients were preoperatively\n      divided into two groups randomly: 15 received fatgrafts processed by centrifugation, and 15\n      received fatgrafts processed by washing in PureGraft bags. The patients were followed up for\n      12-30 months.To measure the subjective outcome, the investigators distributed the BREAST-Q\n      questionnaire to all the patients both preoperatively and one year postoperatively. The\n      BCCT.core software evaluated the objective outcome of breast reconstruction by fatgrafting."
