Problems with this treatment include compliance,\n      adverse reaction, and the possibility of not preventing disease due to INH-resistant\n      organisms. Studies suggest that two or three months of rifampin and pyrazinamide may be more\n      effective than longer courses of INH. A two-month prevention course should help to increase\n      compliance. In addition, the use of two drugs (rifampin and pyrazinamide) may help overcome\n      problems with drug resistance."

Patients\n      are then evaluated every six months. One group of patients takes INH plus vitamin B6 for 12\n      months. The other group of patients takes 1 of 2 doses of rifampin (depending on patient's\n      weight) plus pyrazinamide in 3-4 divided doses for 60 days."
