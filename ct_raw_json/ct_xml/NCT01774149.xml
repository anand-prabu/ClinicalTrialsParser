    <textblock>
      Patients with Diabetes Mellitus Type 1 using electronic self-help tools typically registers
      a large amount of data on their disease. The study intends to see if giving advanced
      feedback on these data can improve their blood glucose management.

    <textblock>
      All patients will be given access to a mobile phone with the diabetes diary known as the Few
      Touch Application (FTA) installed. They may use either their own compatible Android
      handsets, or provided handsets. The study uses a delayed start design. Participants are
      randomized into two groups, who get access to the module &quot;Diastat&quot; after 4 and 12 weeks
      post-enrollment respectively. Each group uses the FTA with Diastat for 8 weeks
      post-intervention (i.e. access to Diastat).

      Diastat is a module within FTA that provides data-driven feedback to the patients using
      their own data. This module is based on the data recorded in a previous trial [1]. Three
      submodules are part of Diastat; Periodicity detection and visualization, multiscale trend
      detection based on the c-SiZer algorithm [2], and situation matching for insulin dosage [3].
