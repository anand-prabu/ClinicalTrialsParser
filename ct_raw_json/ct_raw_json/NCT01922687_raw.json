Fasting total cholesterol concentration ranging from 4.14 to 6.22 mmol/L (160 to 240\n             mg/dL);\n\n          6. Endothelium-dependent flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) below 10%;\n\n          7. Serum activity of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT),\n             and creatine kinase (CK) should be within the normal range;\n\n          8. Patients should not be on treatment with statins or other lipid-lowering drugs within\n             3 months of randomization;\n\n          9. The patients should sign the informed consent form prior to the participation in the\n             trial at the first visit;\n\n         10. Patients should be independent and likely to adhere to the study protocol.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          1. Secondary hypertension;\n\n          2. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) below 2.59 mmol/L (100mg/dL);\n\n          3. Renal dysfunction defined as eGFR<60ml/min/1.73m2;\n\n          4. Current treatment with specific drugs or diets, such as fibrates (especially\n             gemfibrozil), verapamil, amiodarone, grapefruit juice;\n\n          5. Excessive alcohol consumption defined as drinking more than 1L/day;\n\n          6. Stroke within 2 years of randomization or myocardial infarction occurred previous;\n\n          7. Known contra-indications to a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker or statins;\n\n          8. Any life threatening condition;\n\n          9. Current participation in another trial or trials."
