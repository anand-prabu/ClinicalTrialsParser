An\n             ongoing major depressive episode within the last year is reason for exclusion,\n             although a previous history of a depressive episode is not (using DSM-IV diagnostic\n             criteria for a major depressive episode).\n\n          -  Subjects with a recent history (within the past year) of drug or alcohol abuse.\n\n          -  Subjects with clinically significant abnormal laboratory values.\n\n          -  Subjects with irregular menstrual cycles (cycle lengths vary greater than 3 days).\n\n          -  Subjects unlikely to cooperate with the requirements of the study.\n\n          -  Subjects needing frequent or continuous use of any medication, including nicotine (>\n             5 cigarettes daily).\n\n          -  Subjects whose prospective ratings do not show cyclic variation in association with\n             the menstrual cycle (as per inclusion criteria).\n\n          -  Subjects with an irregular sleep schedule, extreme chronotypes or a sleep-wake cycle\n             that does not correspond to the environmental light-dark cycle (e.g., subjects within\n             2 weeks of transmeridian travel, night shift workers, or those with significant\n             advanced or delayed sleep phase syndromes).
