Researchers also want to learn if giving both\n      of these drugs helps donors produce enough stem cells so that only 1 apheresis procedure\n      needs to be performed.\n\n      Researchers will study if using both drugs lowers the risk of the stem cell transplant\n      recipients developing severe forms graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).  GVHD is a condition in\n      which transplanted tissue (such as blood stem cells) attacks the tissue of the recipient's\n      body.\n\n      The safety and effectiveness of this drug combination will also be studied.\n\n      Filgrastim and plerixafor are both designed to help move or \"mobilize\" the stem cells from\n      the bone marrow to the blood."

You will sign a separate\n      informed consent for the transplant procedure.\n\n      Follow-Up Visits:\n\n      About 1, 3, and 6 months after the transplant, an extra sample of bone marrow (about 2\n      teaspoons) will be collected at the same time as the standard of care bone marrow\n      aspiration/biopsy procedures.  This bone marrow sample will be tested to find out how well\n      the donated stem cells have been accepted by your body.  However, you will not have a\n      separate bone marrow aspiration/biopsy only to collect bone marrow for this testing.\n\n      When you return to the clinic at 6, 9, and 12 months for routine transplant follow-up\n      visits, the study staff will try to get information on your health status from the clinic\n      notes in your medical record. If this is not possible, you may receive a phone call from the\n      study staff to check your health status. These calls will last about 10 minutes.\n\n      Length of Treatment:\n\n      You will be on study for about 1 year after the transplant (including follow-up contact by\n      phone, if needed).\n\n      You may be taken off study early if you are not able to follow study directions or if you\n      decide to leave the study.\n\n      This is an investigational study.  Filgrastim is FDA approved for use in stem cell\n      collection.  Plerixafor is FDA approved for use in patients with multiple myeloma and\n      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.\n\n      Up to 30 donor and recipient pairs will take part in this study.  All will be enrolled at MD\n      Anderson."
