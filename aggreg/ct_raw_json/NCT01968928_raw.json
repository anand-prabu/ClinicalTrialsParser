Chemoresistance was inevitable in treatment of metastatic disease and lead\n      to the ominous outcomes. To develop novel therapeutic strategies to overcome chemoresistance\n      is imperative. Cancer cells uptake glucose at higher rates than normal tissue but use most\n      of glucose for glycolysis even under normoxia condition, which is known as the Warburg\n      effect. Pyruvate kinase (PK) catalyzes the last step in the process of glycolysis, and one\n      of it isoform--PKM2 has been reported to be associated with tumor progression and some\n      specific tissues and promotes the Warburg effect in cancer cells."
