Tumor hypoxia is then measured using an intraoperative\n      Eppendorf needle electrode during surgical biopsy or resection. Tumor specimens are tested\n      for EF5 binding using immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry.\n\n      Patients are followed at 4-6 weeks.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40-60 patients (20 with stage I/II disease, 20 with stage III\n      disease, and 20 without stage I-III disease) will be accrued for this study."
