However, the antibodies present in patients\n      with APL may lead to false INR results when using the CoaguChek XS.  This study will compare\n      the accuracy of the CoaguChek XS in measuring INR in patients with APL by measuring INR by\n      the CoaguChek XS and a standard lab as a reference point.  Patients on warfarin for\n      indications other than APL will be measured by both methods as well to serve as a control\n      group."
