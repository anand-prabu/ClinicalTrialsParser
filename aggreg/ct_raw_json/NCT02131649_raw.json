This suspicion is based on rises seen on Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA)\n      blood tests.  Only men who demonstrate the absence of disease on standard imaging scans\n      (Computed Tomography (CT) and bone scans) will be invited to participate.\n\n      This study will be assessing if the imaging probe 18-F Fluorocholine (18F-FCH) used during\n      Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans, can better\n      predict who will benefit from radiotherapy by identifying the source of cancer recurrence.\n      This will be determined by measuring the number of men who have disease identified outside\n      of the prostate bed (the small pocket or depression where the prostate used to be) on their\n      18F-FCH PET scan.  Since F-18-FCH has been shown to be more sensitive in detecting prostate\n      cancer that may have spread into lymph nodes or bone, it may potentially identify areas of\n      prostate cancer spread not seen with standard imaging."
