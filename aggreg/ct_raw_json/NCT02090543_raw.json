Currently there are only\n      limited information to what extend AF patients prefer one or the other treatment option\n      based on patient relevant characteristics of novel oral anticoagulants vs. VKAs. It is also\n      unknown which of the characteristics influences patient preference most and how this relates\n      to a neutral comparator. Furthermore, an additional unknown factor is also how patient\n      evaluate their current treatment and if this leads to differences among treatment with VKAs\n      and rivaroxaban."
