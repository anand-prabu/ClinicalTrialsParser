This study has an adaptive 2-stage design. Bioequivalence\n      based on encapsulated doxorubicin will be tested at the end of Stage 1 using data from at\n      least 24 participants with ovarian cancer. An interim analysis of free doxorubicin will be\n      performed at the end of Stage 1 using data from 42 participants of all cancer types. The\n      study may continue into Stage 2 with additional participants of all cancer types; and final\n      evaluation of bioequivalence for free doxorubicin will be performed at the end of Stage 2.\n      The study will include a screening phase (within 28 days before the first study medication\n      administration) followed by the treatment phase consisting of 2 doxorubicin treatment cycles\n      (28 days each) and an end-of-treatment visit on Day 58. Participants may enter an optional\n      extension phase after 2 cycles. Safety will be evaluated by the assessment of adverse\n      events, vital signs, 12-lead electrocardiogram, clinical laboratory testing, and left\n      ventricular ejection fraction (measurement of the percentage of blood leaving the heart each\n      time when it contracts) throughout the study. Blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis\n      will be obtained from all participants at specified times over 29 days after starting each\n      study drug administration in Cycles 1 and 2 for determination of plasma concentrations of\n      encapsulated and free doxorubicin."
