Although\n      oral ganciclovir has been used as maintenance following induction with IV ganciclovir,\n      patients with reactivation of disease must be reinduced IV. A fixed-schedule regimen in\n      which oral and IV ganciclovir are alternated may prevent reactivation and progression of\n      disease, as opposed to the current therapeutic strategy in which changes in therapy are\n      event-driven. Also, the duration of intermittent IV therapy required to control disease may\n      be short enough to eliminate the need for an indwelling catheter."
