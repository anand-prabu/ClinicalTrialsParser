In the present study, the investigators hypothesized that in\n      patients diagnosed as schizophrenia, adjunct treatment with Curry extract from the plant\n      labeled by botanists as Curcuma Longata, formulated as Super-Curcumin@ , would  bring about\n      :1)positive behavioral changes in areas of socialization, emotional well-being, verbal\n      communication and motivation; 2)improvement in measures of memory. Throughout the study, the\n      proprietary product, Super-Curcumin@ consisting of Curcumin C-3 complex combined with the\n      black pepper extract Bioperine to boost the effects of Curcumin. The study was developed to\n      examine whether Curcumin's interaction  with the two major signal pathways in the brain\n      regulating brain-behavior: the epigenetic signal (histone modification) and the\n      anti-inflammatory signal (inducible nitric oxide synthetase)in preclinical models is\n      translated to beneficial effects in the treatment of schizophrenia."

            "textblock": "Detailed Description:  The overall objective of the study was to evaluate whether the\n      standardized proprietary formulation of curcumin [Super Curcumin@ :C-3 Complex@ with\n      Bioperine@) manufactured by American Finest Inc. NJ USA ] extracted from the curry plant\n      (Curcuma Longata) , can improve the negative symptoms and cognitive impairments in patients\n      diagnosed as schizophrenia and to determine the response rate in negative symptoms at 16\n      weeks. Response rate was defined as the positive change of  minimum 30% or higher from\n      baseline to  the score measured at 16 weeks. Negative symptoms refer to the cluster of\n      symptoms of apathy, alogia, blunted affect and lack of motivation affecting severely the\n      ways the individual functions in the community at large. In the study, the investigators\n      proposed to test the hypothesize that Super curcumin@ is efficacious and safe when combined\n      with standard antipsychotic drugs in the cohort of patients diagnosed as schizophrenia.\n      Throughout the study, the proprietary product(Super curcumin@) was used. Supercurcumin@\n      consisted of the primary medicinally active ingredient, Curcumin C-3 Complex, in combination\n      with Bioperine@, the metabolic enhancer extracted from black pepper, in order to increase\n      the systemic bioavailability of curcumin C-3 complex. For the oral formulation of Super-\n      curcumin@: 1 gm-capsule has 1 gm of curcumin C-3 complex and 5 mg of Bioperine@ . The study\n      protocol consisted of recruiting subjects with diagnosed as schizophrenia who would be\n      receiving either 1 gm or 4 gm of  Super-Curcumin@ given orally once daily for 16 weeks, on\n      negative symptoms and cognition. For assessing the safety and tolerability of Supercurcumin@\n      , the study protocol required that the patients would be monitored regularly for vital\n      signs:blood pressure, pulse,body weight, routine blood chemistry and comprehensive adverse\n      events profile (Treatment Emergent Adverse Events checklist) including the AIMS (Abnormal\n      Involuntary Movement Scale). At baseline and at regular intervals throughout the 16-week\n      treatment period, standardized measures of negative and positive symptoms and neurocognition\n      would be administered to examine the efficacy of Curcumin C-3 complex in schizophrenia. For\n      analysing the results,  within-subject pre- and post-treatment responses  would be subject\n      to statistical procedures to  evaluate whether Super-Curcumin@ can ameliorate the persistent\n      negative symptoms and cognitive deficits in schizophrenia."
