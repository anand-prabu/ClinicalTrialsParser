The pilot regions selected for this intervention\n      are the three northern regions of Thalas, Chiu and Issik-Kul Region in Kyrgyz Republic. The\n      MOH project will be implemented at a first stage in a group of 10 pilot hospitals, randomly\n      selected among the existing hospitals in the above cited regions. Pilot Hospitals will be\n      compared to \"control hospitals\", which are the hospitals in the region not receiving the\n      intervention, using a pre-defined set of indicators of quality of care. The results of the\n      present evaluation on the pilot hospitals will provide data that will inform the MOH on how\n      better to scale up this project at a national scale."
