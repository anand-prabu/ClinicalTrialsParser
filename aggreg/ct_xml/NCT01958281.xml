  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability and antiviral efficacy of sofosbuvir with
      ribavirin (RBV) participants with genotype 1 or 3 hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection who have
      chronic renal insufficiency.

      This study will have 2 parts.

        -  Part 1 will enroll approximately 20 subjects with severe renal insufficiency.

        -  Part 2 will enroll approximately 20 subjects on dialysis following review of safety,
           efficacy and PK data from Part 1.

    <description>AUCtau is defined as the concentration of drug over time (area under the plasma concentration versus time curve over the dosing interval)
Cmax is defined as the maximum concentration of drug
Ctau is defined as the observed drug concentration at the end of the dosing interval</description>

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>AUClast is defined as the concentration of drug from time zero to the last observable concentration
Clast is defined as the last observable concentration of drug
Tmax is defined as the time of Cmax
Tlast is defined as the time of Clast
λz is defined as the terminal elimination rate constant
t1/2 is defined as the estimate of the terminal elimination half-life of the drug</description>

    <measure>Proportion of participants with virologic failure</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Posttreatment Week 24</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Virologic failure will be measured by incidence of viral breakthrough and viral relapse.
Viral breakthrough is defined as HCV RNA ≥ LLOQ after having previously had HCV RNA &lt; LLOQ while receiving treatment, confirmed with 2 consecutive values (second confirmation value could be posttreatment), or last available on-treatment measurement with no subsequent follow-up values.
Viral relapse is defined as HCV RNA ≥ LLOQ during the post-treatment period having achieved HCV RNA &lt; LLOQ at end of treatment, confirmed with 2 consecutive values or last available posttreatment measurement.</description>
