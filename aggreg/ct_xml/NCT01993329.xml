    <textblock>
      This is a randomised, double blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled, three way crossover,
      single centre study in subjects with asthma undergoing inhalation of methacholine and ATP to
      assess the PC20 response of two dose levels of AF-219 compared with placebo.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Non-smokers or former smokers, who stopped smoking 6 months prior to screening. Former
        smokers should not have a smoking history of more than 5 pack years (1 pack of 20
        cigarettes per day over 5 years).

        Pre-bronchodilator (after abstaining from Short acting β2-agonist for ≥8 hrs) Forced
        Expiratory Volume (FEV1) ≥70% of the predicted normal value at the screening visit.

        Pre-bronchodilator (after abstaining from Short acting β2-agonist for ≥8 hrs) Forced
        Expiratory Volume (FEV1) ≥70% of the predicted normal value OR if less than 70% must be
        within +/- 12 % of screening FEV1 prior to randomization.

        History or diagnosis of asthma for at least 6 months prior to screening according to the
        Global Initiative in Asthma guidelines (GINA, 2012).

        Use of Short acting β2-agonist therapy only (≤ 8 puffs per day) for at least 4 weeks prior
        to screening and prior to randomisation.

        Positive response to methacholine challenge (PC20 ≤ 8 mg/mL) at screening.

        Positive response to ATP challenge (PC20 ≤ 200 µmol/mL) at screening.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Hospitalized or attended the emergency department for an asthma attack in the 12 months
        prior to screening.

        Exacerbation of asthma or lower respiratory tract infection during the 4 weeks before
        screening.

        Upper respiratory tract infection during the 4 weeks before screening or prior to
        randomization requiring treatment with antibiotics.

        Inhaled or systemic corticosteroids (oral, intravenous, intramuscular) within 4 weeks
        prior to screening.

        Short-acting or long-acting antihistamines within 48hrs or 7 days, respectively, prior to
        screening.
