Disease is restaged after every 3 courses. Treatment continues in the absence of\n      unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Patients are followed every 3 months for the\n      first year, and then every 6 months thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: There will be 17-26 evaluable patients accrued into this study."
