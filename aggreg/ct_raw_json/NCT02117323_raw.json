            "textblock": "A prospective observational study on corneal opacities in infants and children (1 month to\n      18 years old) will be conducted at CHLA. Most of these cases will be due to congenital\n      corneal opacity (e.g. Peter's anomaly, mucopolysacharidoses) or scarring due to infectious\n      keratitis. Sixty (60) subjects will be recruited. The children will be examined under\n      anesthesia with a portable slit-lamp and OCT. An iVue OCT system (Optovue) attached to an\n      operating microscope-style mount at CHLA will be used for the intraoperative scans. Both\n      cross-sectional and 3-D OCT scans will be performed to assess opacity depth, pachymetry map,\n      endothelial defects, and any abnormal adhesion between the cornea, iris and lens. The\n      anterior chamber angle will also be imaged with cross-sectional OCT to assess angle depth,\n      trabecular meshwork, Schwalbe's line, and possible peripheral iridocorneal adhesion or\n      posterior embryotoxon. OCT of the crystalline lens will be obtained to assess the presence\n      of cataract. Slit-lamp photography will be obtained, and gonioscopy will be performed if\n      indicated. Corneal diameter will be measured with a caliper, and intraocular pressure will\n      be measured with a tonopen (Reichert)."
