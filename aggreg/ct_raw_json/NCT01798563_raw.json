This study will look at the differences\n      between the two sub-types of PD and healthy volunteers.\n\n      The investigators will test the hypothesis that connectivity at rest within the motor cortex\n      and between the motor cortex and motor-associated regions such as the supplementary motor\n      area and the pre motor cortex will not be as strong in PIGD compared to TD (increased\n      activity and functional connectivity in TD group)"
