In addition, the investigators plan to provide\n      a brief motivational intervention for some at-risk teens and see whether alcohol use differs\n      for those teens who receive the intervention and those teens who receive enhanced usual\n      care. The results of this study have the potential to significantly impact the standard of\n      care for identifying and intervening with at- risk youth in primary care settings."
