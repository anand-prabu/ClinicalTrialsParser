Subjects will receive a single dose of HMPL-523 or matching\n      placebo on the morning of Day 1 at a dose of 5, 20, 50,100, 200 or 300 mg, according to the\n      randomization schedule.\n\n      For Cohort 1 a sentinel group (1 HMPL-523 and 1 placebo) will be dosed at 5 mg HMPL-523 24\n      hours prior to the planned dosing of the remaining six subjects. Dosing of the remaining six\n      will be based on investigator judgment. The decision to dose escalate will be made jointly\n      by the Principal Investigator and the sponsor based on the clinical data (safety,\n      tolerability, available PK data and clinical laboratory values).\n\n      -Part B: Multiple Ascending Dose (MAD). Part B of the study has been designed to assess the\n      effects of multiple ascending doses of HMPL-523 in healthy volunteers. The total daily doses\n      and dosing regimen for Part B will be determined based on the review of safety and PK data\n      from Part A, and will be made jointly by the Principal Investigator and the sponsor.\n\n      Pharmacokinetic profile:\n\n        -  During Part A, available concentrations of HMPL-523 in plasma will be determined for\n           each dose level, prior to commencing the subsequent ascending dose.  A full PK profile\n           will be measured through Day 1.  Concentrations of HMPL-523 in urine will also be\n           measured from 0-24 hours on Day 1.\n\n        -  Part B PK sample collection will be adjusted based on Part A study data. It is planned\n           that a full PK profile will be collected through Day 1 and through Day 14.\n\n      Safety data:\n\n      The following safety evaluations will be performed during the study: Adverse events,\n      physical examination, clinical safety laboratory (hematology, clinical chemistry,\n      urinalysis), body weight, oral temperature, triplicate blood pressure and heart rate , and\n      ECG ."
