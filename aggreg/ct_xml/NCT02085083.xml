  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The transition from pediatric to adult IBD care can be stressful and wrought with challenges
      including access to care and establishment of new physician-patient relationships.  There a
      few studies which characterize patterns of healthcare utilization during this critical
      period and its impact on outcomes.  We hypothesize that uninterrupted healthcare utilization
      in academic centers and optimized communication with patients during the pediatric-adult
      transition period is associated with lower hospitalizations and surgery.  This hypothesis
      will be addressed by a randomized clinical trial to determine the impact of monthly regular
      telephone contact with an IBD Registered Nurse versus standard of care during the
      pediatric-adult transition period.   Outcomes will include healthcare utilization,
      health-related quality of life, patient satisfaction, and treatment adherence over 12 months
      of follow-up.  Randomization and analyses will be stratified by whether subjects were
      transferred to adult care in an academic center or in a community practice.  We hope that
      this research will facilitate optimal delivery of healthcare during the pediatric-adult
      transition.
