      This is a multicenter, double-blind, Phase 2b, long-term extension (LTE) to the ADDRESS II
      core trial (EMR 700461-023) (NCT01972568), to evaluate long-term safety and tolerability of
      atacicept in subjects with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The Week 24 visit of ADDRESS
      II core trial will coincide with the Day 1 visit of this LTE trial.
