    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well magnetic resonance (MR)-guided laser interstitial
      thermal therapy works in treating patients with prostate cancer. Laser therapy uses intense,
      narrow beams of light to cut and destroy tissue and may help treat prostate cancer

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the oncologic efficacy of laster interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) with
      primary endpoint of undetectable cancer on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided biopsy of
      treatment zone at 3 months following treatment.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate oncologic efficacy at 12 months following treatment based on biopsy of the
      treatment zone.

      II. To determine treatment-related safety and toxicity. III. To longitudinally assess
      urinary and sexual function in the year following treatment.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo MR-guided LITT.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1, 3, and 12 months.
