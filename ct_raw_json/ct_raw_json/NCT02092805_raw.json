Real rTMS over the hand area of motor cortex (20 Hz, 10 trains with inter train\n      interval 30 second with total pulses 2000, intensity 80% of motor threshold) every day for\n      ten consecutive days (5 days/week) and the coil elevated and angled away from the head as\n      sham stimulation. Patients were evaluated by verbal descriptor scale (VDS), visual analog\n      scale (VAS), and Hamilton rating scale for depression (HAM-D) at the baseline, after 1st,\n      5th, 10th session, 15 day and 1 month after end of sessions.
