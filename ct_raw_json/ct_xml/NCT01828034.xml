  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test an investigational combination of drugs for bile duct
      or gallbladder cancers. Gemcitabine and cisplatin are two forms of chemotherapy commonly
      used in combination to treat bile duct and gallbladder cancers. The investigators are
      looking to improve treatment results. They will attempt to do so by adding the drug MEK162
      to the treatment plan. MEK162 acts by blocking a protein called MEK 1/2 which helps cancer
      cells grow and divide. This study will help answer the question of whether MEK162 is a
      helpful drug in patients with bile duct or gallbladder cancers when given with gemcitabine
      and cisplatin.

    <description>Phase I component of the study, a classic 3+3 cohort dose escalation scheme will be used to identify the MTD of MEK162 when administered with gemcitabine at dose 800 mg/m2 and cisplatin given at dose 20 mg/m2 week 2 &amp; 3 of a 3 week cycle. The final cohort will receive gemcitabine 1000mg/m2 and cisplatin 20mg/m2 week 2 and 3 of a 3 week cycle in combination with MEK162 at the MTD as determined above. In the phase II part of the study, patients will receive MEK162 at the MTD dose plus gemcitabine and cisplatin at the dose level determined acceptable in the phase I portion.</description>
