One form of drug treatment that produces some improvement in tremor of the\n      hands is octanoic acid, which is a food additive that is similar to alcohol. Research\n      suggests that octanoic acid may reduce tremor in the hands/arms with few side effects and no\n      intoxication effects. This study will determine whether octanoic acid may be useful for\n      reducing tremor when it affects the voice. Researchers are hypothesizing that octanoic acid\n      will reduce the effects of tremor on the voice."
