However, preliminary randomised clinical trials\n      indicate that it is beneficial to reduce the sedation level in these patients. The NONSEDA\n      trial is an investigator-initiated, randomised, clinical, parallel-group, multinational,\n      superiority trial designed to include 700 patients from at least six ICUs in Denmark, Norway\n      and Sweden, comparing no sedation with sedation and a daily wake-up trial during mechanical\n      ventilation. This is a substudy of the NONSEDA trial, concerning 250 patients included at\n      trialsite Kolding, Denmark. The aim of the substudy is to assess the effects of no sedation\n      on delirium during admission and cognitive function after discharge from ICU.\n\n      Our hypothesis is that critically ill patients who are not sedated during mechanical\n      ventilation will have better cognitive function after discharge."
