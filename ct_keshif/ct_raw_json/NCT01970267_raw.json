While these symptoms are considered physiological in nature, they can be of\n      considerable inconvenience to many patients which affect essential activities. The\n      investigators wish to assess the safety and efficacy of floater treatment in patients with\n      highly symptomatic floaters using an FDA approved nanosecond infrared yttrium aluminum\n      garnet (YAG) lasers."
