    <textblock>
      SCORE is an active, prospective, non-randomized, multi-center outcome-oriented registry of
      patients implanted with St Jude Medical (SJM) market-released cardiac rhythm management
      (CRM) products. This registry will be conducted in the United States (US).

      The primary purpose of the registry is to evaluate and publish acute and long-term
      performance of market-released SJM CRM products by analyzing product survival probabilities.
      Product status and any related adverse events will be collected to measure survival
      probabilities.
