Despite the high incidence and\n      severity has not yet been demonstrated whether a physical training program can change these\n      outcomes. Objectives: To evaluate the effects of an exercise training program in patients\n      hospitalized for CAP, to compare this effects with traditional physical therapy and assess\n      whether the inflammatory markers correlate with the functional status of the patient and\n      type of treatment. Methods: A controlled, prospective, randomized clinical trial. Patients\n      hospitalized for CAP, adults, conscious, hemodynamically stable and independent to walk will\n      be studied. In the first day, a medical history, measured dyspnea, incremental shuttle walk\n      test, Glittre test, measurement of peripheral muscle strength, spirometry, and the\n      application of quality of life questionnaire Shor Form 36 will be held. The measurement of\n      inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein and tumor necrosis factor) will also be held.\n      Patients will be randomized into two groups: one will perform a program of physical training\n      (stretching, active resistance exercises and aerobic exercises) and the other group held the\n      traditional physical therapy (bronchial hygiene, breathing exercises and walking) for eight\n      days. On the tenth day the same assessment will be carried out initially described."
