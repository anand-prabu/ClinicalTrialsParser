            "textblock": "Diffuse pontine gliomas are tumors on the pons portion of the brainstem. Their peak\n      incidence is in children between 5 and 10 years old. Their location makes surgical resection\n      impossible. Most patients are treated with radiation, which typically delays progression of\n      the tumor for a median time of only about 6 months; median survival time is less than 1\n      year. The addition of chemotherapy has not improved the outcome.\n\n      Alpha, beta, and gamma interferons have been used to treat malignant brain tumors, with\n      mixed results. Different doses and different methods of administration have been studied.\n      Alpha interferon is usually given in high doses 2 or 3 times a week, but it has serious side\n      effects at these doses. Recent studies have shown that administering chemotherapy more\n      frequently at smaller doses (metronomic) may have a better effect against the tumor.\n\n      PEG-Intron(Trademark) is a form of interferon alpha combined with monomethoxy polyethylene\n      glycol (PEG). It has a longer half-life than interferon alone, is administered once a week,\n      and the long half-life reduces the peaks and troughs in blood levels.\n\n      This study will enroll 32 patients under age 21. The primary goals of the study are to\n      determine if there is a difference in the 2-year survival rate of patients treated with\n      radiation alone and those treated with radiation followed by PEG-Intron(Trademark) and to\n      define the toxicities of PEG-Intron(Trademark) in the study doses. Secondary goals are to\n      evaluate various magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques for noninvasive monitoring of\n      changes in the brainstem and to evaluate neuropsychological function.\n\n      In this study, PEG-Intron(Trademark) will be administered subcutaneously once a week at low\n      doses (0.3 microgram per kilogram of body weight) for a 4-week cycle. The cycles will be\n      repeated indefinitely until progression of disease or serious side effects develop.  For\n      less severe effects, the dose will be lowered and the patient may remain in the study. For\n      more severe effects, the dose will be discontinued. Patients in the study may receive\n      supportive medication but may not receive other forms of chemotherapy.\n\n      Patients or their caregivers will be instructed in how to inject the drug. Patients and/or\n      caregivers will be asked to maintain a diary documenting the dose, site of administration,\n      and any side effects. The diary will be reviewed at each National Cancer Institute (NCI)\n      visit. Patients will return to NCI before cycles 2 and 3. If there are no significant side\n      effects, patients may then return to NCI before every other cycle, indefinitely (i.e.,\n      before cycles 5, 7, 9, etc.).\n\n      Patients will undergo the following tests and procedures:\n\n        -  Physical examination, including neurologic exam, monthly\n\n        -  Complete blood count, differential, and platelet count weekly during cycle 1 and every\n           2 weeks thereafter if no severe side effects occur\n\n        -  Blood chemistries weekly during cycle 1 and every 2 weeks thereafter if no severe side\n           effects occur\n\n        -  Endocrine function tests before each cycle\n\n        -  Urinalysis before each cycle\n\n        -  MRI of the brain before cycles 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and every other month; patients may also\n           have proton magnetic spectroscopic imaging performed at the time of the MRI"

            "textblock": "Background:\n\n      Children with diffuse pontine gliomas have a dismal prognosis.  Because surgery in this area\n      is difficult, radiation therapy has been the mainstay of treatment.  Although some children\n      may improve clinically after radiation therapy, the effect is short-lived and almost all\n      progress within several months.  Chemotherapy has not had a significant impact on survival.\n      Interferon-alpha is a cytokine that has been studied in patients with gliomas and has\n      demonstrated some activity in prior clinical trials.\n\n      Objectives:\n\n        -  To compare the 2-year survival of pediatric patients with diffuse pontine gliomas\n           receiving weekly subcutaneous low-dose pegylated interferon alfa-2b (PEG-Intron[TM])\n           injections after standard radiation therapy versus historical controls who have\n           received radiation therapy alone.\n\n        -  To define the toxicities of weekly low-dose pegylated interferon alfa-2b\n           (PEG-Intron(Trademark)) in pediatric patients.\n\n      Eligibility:\n\n      Age:  Patients must be less than or equal to 21 years of age.\n\n      Histological Diagnosis:  Histologic confirmation is not required for this study.  Patients\n      must have a diffuse pontine glioma as diagnosed by MRI criteria below.\n\n      Radiologic Appearance:  Patients must have a diffuse intrinsic tumor with the epicenter\n      presumed to be in the pons.  The T-2 weighted sequence must reveal a diffuse signal\n      abnormality involving at least 50 percent of the pons.\n\n      Prior Therapy:  The patient must have received adequate radiation therapy.  Radiation must\n      be completed between 2-10 weeks prior to the start of treatment with Peg-Intron[TM].\n\n      Design:\n\n      In this study, we plan to administer pegylated interferon alfa-2b (PEG-Intron[TM])\n      subcutaneously once a week to pediatric patients with diffuse pontine gliomas who have\n      completed radiation therapy.  The endpoint of the trial will be 2-year survival compared to\n      historical controls."
