Observed therapy means that a nurse will watch\n      patients take their medications to make sure that they take them correctly.\n\n      It is very important that HIV-positive patients take their anti-HIV medications correctly so\n      they get the best possible benefit from them. Taking the drugs correctly, called\n      \"adherence,\" may keep HIV virus levels in the blood (viral load) low for a longer time.\n      Adherence can also slow the development of drug resistance, and this is especially important\n      in patients with early HIV infection who are just beginning treatment. However, anti-HIV\n      medication schedules are often complicated, and many patients have difficulty remembering to\n      take their drugs at the correct time. This study will look at the effectiveness of a plan to\n      help patients with this problem."

            "textblock": "Novel approaches are needed to improve adherence to combination antiretroviral therapy.\n      Nonadherence can lead to reduced drug levels and inadequate viral suppression, which\n      accelerates drug resistance. Thus nonadherence in the first few months of primary HIV\n      infection can limit therapeutic options for an individual years later.  Barriers to optimal\n      treatment adherence in patients with early HIV infection include complex treatment regimens\n      which disrupt daily routines, drug intolerance, and concomitant illness including\n      depression. Directly observed therapy has been successful in improving overall effectiveness\n      of antituberculosis therapy and may be a useful strategy in HIV-infected patients.\n\n      All patients receive combination antiretroviral therapy with didanosine (ddI), stavudine\n      (d4T), efavirenz (EFV), and nelfinavir (NFV). Patients are randomized to self-administered\n      (SAT) versus observed (MAT) therapy for 24 weeks. Patients randomized to MAT receive one\n      directly observed dose (ddI, d4T, EFV, and NFV) of their antiretroviral regimen by a field\n      worker or nurse at the clinic 5 days per week. As a reminder for the second NFV and d4T\n      dose, MAT patients are provided with an alarm watch programmed to sound at dosing times. The\n      alarm watch also serves as a reminder for weekend doses that will not be directly observed.\n      Patients randomized to SAT receive standard care. All patients are monitored with monthly\n      plasma HIV RNA levels and CD4 and CD8 cell counts. At Week 24, all patients are crossed over\n      to SAT for an additional 48 weeks of follow-up."
