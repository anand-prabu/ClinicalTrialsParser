  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators data reveal an important new observation regarding the recovery of
      breathing during emergence from general anesthesia:  respiration resumes as a prolonged
      abdominal expiration event.

      The present study aims to further clarify the physiology of recovery of breathing with the
      addition of a cutaneous monitor for arterial carbon dioxide measurement and a comparison of
      two different recovery paradigms.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The present study will use non-invasive respiratory inductance plethysmography(RIP) and
      transcutaneous carbon dioxide measurement to compare recovery of respiration under constant
      Transcutaneous carbon dioxide measurement( ptcCO2) with continuous high frequency jet
      ventilation HFJV (study method) with recovery of respiration during rising and apnea
      (current standard).

      The investigators hypothesize that the prolonged abdominal expiration that we observed
      during recovery of breathing in prior studies will be unaffected by arterial carbon dioxide
      (CO2) levels.
