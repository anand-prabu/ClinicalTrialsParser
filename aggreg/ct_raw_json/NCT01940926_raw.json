Integrin alpha(v)beta3 receptor plays an pivotal role in promoting, sustaining and\n      regulating the angiogenesis and was identified as a marker of angiogenic vascular tissue.\n      Cyclic arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) peptides was identified as a key integrin\n      recognition motif which could strongly bind to integrin alpha(v)beta3 and inhibit new blood\n      vessel formation. Animal study in antigen induced arthritis demonstrated that\n      intra-articular administration of a cyclic RGD antagonist of alpha(v)beta3 leading to\n      inhibition of cell infiltrate, synovial angiogenesis, pannus formation, cartilage erosions\n      and even diminishing arthritis severity. For these properties, RGD peptide-based\n      multimodality molecular probes have been developed for noninvasive imaging by targeting\n      integrin alpha(v)beta3. And compared with 18F-FDG PET/CT, radiolabeled RGD imaging is a\n      promising approach to visualize angiogenesis and provide a therapeutic target for\n      anti-angiogenetic and anti-integrin therapy.\n\n      For the further interests in clinical translation of 68Ga-BNOTA-PRGD2, an open-label PET/CT\n      study was designed to investigate the diagnostic performance and evaluation efficacy of\n      68Ga-BNOTA-PRGD2 in RA patients."
