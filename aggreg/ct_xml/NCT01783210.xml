  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators evaluate if changing eating habits and introducing a correct lifestyle in
      women with BMI &gt;25 Kg/m2 would improve unfavorable maternal-fetal outcomes associated with
      excessive weight gain (EWG) during pregnancy. To pursue these goals, eligible women are
      randomly assigned to no intervention (Control group) that receive only a simple nutritional
      booklet about lifestyle and healthy diet during pregnancy without explicit caloric
      restriction or the Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes Program (TLC group) that receive a caloric
      restriction (1500 Kcal/day divided in3 main meals and 3 snacks + 300 kcal/die for overweight
      or 200 kcal/die for obese women submitted to energy expenditure program) associated to a
      mild physical activity (30 minutes at least 3 days/week) The investigators use a tool that
      could easily and practically evaluate not only total GWG at term, but also changes in
      maternal body composition: the bioimpedance analyzer. Needing, moreover, a simple and not
      harmful device that could assess effective energy expenditure and the adherence by pregnant
      women to prenatal exercise, the investigators use SenseWear system armband (SWA).

      Pregnant women, recruited from antenatal clinics, with pre-pregnancy BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2, age &gt;18
      years and single pregnancy are enrolled within 12th week at the Obstetric Unit of
      Policlinico Hospital of Modena.

      Exclusion criteria are as follows: twin pregnancies, chronic diseases (i.e., diabetes
      mellitus, chronic hypertension, untreated thyroid diseases), gestational diabetes mellitus
      (GDM) in previous pregnancies, smoking during pregnancy, dietary supplements or herbal
      products known to affect body weight, other medical conditions that might affect body
      weight, and plans to deliver outside of the Birth Center.

      At the first visit, an accurate obstetric history, family history, and personal history is
      collected for the assessment of exclusion criteria. The blood pressure, height and weight
      are measured, and the BMI is calculated.

      Eligible women are randomly assigned to no intervention (Control group) or the Therapeutic
      Lifestyle Changes Program (TLC group). Randomization is performed using sealed
      envelopes(using a computer-generated random allocation). Study randomization is numbered and
      sealed in white envelops. Randomization occurs in consecutive order at time of the first
      visit. Due to study design, both gynecologist and dietitian know the allocation of the
      patient.

      Every subject receives care in another institution (Antenatal Clinics of Modena Health
      program). Hence, women in both groups receive the same antenatal evaluation including two
      ultrasound examinations and at least 4 obstetric evaluations until term. However, referral
      gynecologists possibly know the allocated arm of their women.

      Randomized subjects receive a 75-g 2-h Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) at 16-18 and/or
      24-28 weeks. The diagnosis of GDM is made for any glucose value exceeding the normal
      cut-off, as reported by the HAPO study. If OGTT is pathological, women are referred to other
      health care specialists.

      Women randomized to both group are scheduled to have a specific follow-up for adherence to
      the program at 16, 20, 28, 36 weeks  and 3 months after delivery also evaluating the fat
      mass, fat-free mass and total body water through the use of the bioimpedance analyzer.
      Moreover, at baseline, 20 and 36 weeks the investigator evaluate the detailed patient's
      metabolism through the Armband or metabolic holter. At baseline and 36 weeks each subject
      have to complete a Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) to identify any change in eating
      habits. The FFQ includes questions about specific food items, such as the frequency of sauce
      consumption, the fat content of several food items, and seasonal consumption of fruit and
      vegetables. While the Control group receives only a simple nutritional booklet about a
      lifestyle (in accordance with Italian Guidelines for a healthy diet during pregnancy), the
      TLC Program includes a specific caloric restriction associated to a mild physical activity
      program.

      The TLC diet comprises 1500 kcal/day and consists of 3 main meals and 3 snacks (breakfast,
      snack, lunch, snack, dinner, and evening snack) that corresponds to the baseline  metabolism
      of a pregnant woman. The dietitian adds an amount of  200 kcal/day for obese or 300 kcal/day
      for overweight pregnant women submitted to physical activity program.The TLC diet has a
      target macronutrient composition of 55% carbohydrate, 20% protein, and 25% fat with
      moderately low saturated fat levels. The exercise intervention is focused on increasing
      walking and developing a more active lifestyle (i.e., walking rather than driving for short
      distances). The recommended exercise prescription for pregnant women is generally consistent
      with recommendations for the general adult population. However, it is important to monitor
      and adjust exercise prescriptions according to the woman's symptoms, discomforts, and
      abilities during pregnancy and be aware of contraindications for exercising during
      pregnancy. All participants are advised to participate in 30 min of moderate intensity
      activity at least 3 days a week. Subjects wear a pedometer (Omron Walking Style III
      HJ-203-EK) on a belt at the back of their waist during walking session for the assessment of
      the adherence to the physical activity program.

    <description>This device can assess effective energy expenditure and the adherence by pregnant women to prenatal exercise. It uses sensors that continuously gather data estimating the wearer's caloric expenditure, duration of physical activity and number of steps taken. Resting energy expenditure, wich is the largest component of total daily energy expenditure, accounting for 60-70% of total expenditure, is measured.This method could be useful to evaluate the adherence to the physical activity program and to detect changes in lifestyle</description>
