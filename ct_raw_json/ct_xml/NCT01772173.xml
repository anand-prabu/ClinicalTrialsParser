  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetic complications are an important source of blindness and mortality among veterans.
      Their occurrence is unpredictable because of the highly variable effect of factors such as
      weight, diet and exercise. Improved prediction of diabetes complications has the potential
      to improve the care for veterans with diabetes, especially if this can be done without any
      extra effort for the veterans or their caretakers. All veterans with diabetes in VHA are
      required to undergo annual retinal photography to screen for current diabetic retinopathy.
      We have recently developed an automated, precise, fast, novel tool for measuring retinal
      vessels in these images. Manual measurement of retinal vessels has shown that these can
      predict future -not current- development of hypertension and also diabetic retinopathy. If
      we can confirm that our tool can flag those veterans at increased risk for developing these
      diabetes complications, this will allow earlier intervention and prevention. Because the
      tool only uses the images that are being taken anyway, there is no extra effort for either
      the veteran or VA staff.

      Background: We hypothesize that retinal vessel derived biomarkers, obtained using our
      automated, precise, fast, novel tool for measuring retinal vessels in retinal images can
      identify veterans at increased risk for diabetic retinopathy and hypertension, before any
      overt signs of retinopathy or increased blood pressure have become apparent. Population
      studies have shown that changes in arterial and venous diameter are associated with future
      development of these complications.

      Purpose: Determine the potential utility of retinal vessel derived biomarkers, from color
      fundus photographs, as a non-invasive independent risk factor for diabetic retinopathy (DR)
      and hypertension in veterans with diabetes.

      Methods: Aim 1. We will evaluate automatically derived retinal vessel parameters (arterial
      and retinal vessel width and branch relationships) as an early biomarker for future
      development of hypertension no less than 2 years later, with normal current normal blood
      pressure. We will compare this biomarker  in retinal images from 500 veterans with diabetes,
      all of whom did not have hypertension at the time of imaging, for those who were and were
      not diagnosed with hypertension no more than 3 years later. Aim 2. To evaluate automatically
      derived retinal vessel parameters as an early biomarker for the risk for development of
      diabetic retinopathy (defined as transition from less than moderate retinopathy AND no
      apparent macular edema according to the International Clinical Diabetic Retinopathy and
      Diabetic Macular Edema Severity Scale) in at risk veterans with diabetes. We will compare
      this biomarker in retinal images from a population of 4000 veterans with diabetes, currently
      without DR, ~10% of who developed retinopathy no less than two years later while the
      remainder did not.
