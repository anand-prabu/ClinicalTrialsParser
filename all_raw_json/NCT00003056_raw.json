Demonstrate that the graft versus host disease (GVHD) prophylactic regimen\n      consisting of T-cell depletion and cyclosporine results in less toxicity than the control\n      regimen of methotrexate and cyclosporine in recipients of peripheral blood stem cell\n      transplants. II. Monitor safety of the two regimens in order to assure that the treatment\n      regimen dose not result in any increase in serious or unexpected toxicities, does not\n      compromise the efficacy of GVHD prophylaxis, and does not compromise the efficacy of the\n      disease therapy.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, controlled, randomized trial. Patients are assigned to high\n      or low risk groups and randomized to the control or treatment arms. Patients are stratified\n      by risk group and by site. Mobilization, apheresis, and successful cryopreservation of the\n      minimum number of CD34 cells for transplant has to be achieved prior to initiating\n      cytoreductive therapy. Following intensive cytoreductive therapy, patients receive either\n      unselected peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) together with the control graft versus host\n      disease (GVHD) prophylaxis regimen or CD34+ cells isolated from PBSC with cyclosporine. In\n      the control group, GVHD prophylaxis consists of two drug therapies, cyclosporine and\n      methotrexate. The cyclosporine is administered first by IV continuous infusion and then\n      later orally, twice a day, in decreasing increments for 180 days. Methotrexate is\n      administered by IV on days 1, 3, 6, and 11. Cyclosporine is discontinued after day +180 if\n      there is no evidence of GVHD. In the treatment group, GVHD prophylaxis consists of T cell\n      depletion of the transplant product using the Isolex positive selection procedure (Isolex\n      selected CD34+ cells) and cyclosporine. The cyclosporine is administered at the same doses\n      and increments as in the control group. In cases where there still is acute or chronic GVHD,\n      the patient is given the appropriate salvage regimens. Patients are followed monthly for 6\n      months after transplant, and then for 2 years to monitor relapses.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: There will be 200 patients accrued (100 in each arm) in this study."
