            "textblock": "The growing knowledge of non-digestible oligosaccharide (NDO)-related health benefits has\n      led to the identification of other fermentable carbohydrates which may improve bone balance\n      and bone health parameters. One such carbohydrate is the corn derivative, soluble corn fiber\n      (SCF). Already known for its association with improved intestinal health and influence on\n      colonic microflora content, we have been studying the effects of SCF on calcium absorption\n      and bone health. First we found that soluble corn fiber (SCF) greatly enhanced calcium\n      utilization and bone properties in a growing rat model. Results from this study demonstrated\n      that SCF was capable of increasing bone mineral content, density and bone strength\n      parameters in 4-week old, male rats. Our study in adolescent boys and girls showed a 12%\n      increase in calcium absorption after consuming 12 g SCF for 21 days compared to a control\n      period in a crossover design using a controlled feeding metabolic balance approach. Given\n      these profound changes on calcium absorption and in bone, a logical next step is to study a\n      dose-response effect of SCF on calcium absorption, bone turnover, and gut microflora in\n      free-living adolescents."
