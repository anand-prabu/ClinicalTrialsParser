Patients having a HER2-positive tumor will be recruited to the study.\n      A [18F]FDG PET/ceCT scan is performed for the measurement of uptake in the tumour and\n      diagnosis of possible metastases. Each subject will receive a single injection of the\n      investigational product [68Ga]ABY-025, followed by measurement of uptake in the tumour or\n      metastases and in normal organs. The investigations will be repeated after HER2 directed\n      therapy."
