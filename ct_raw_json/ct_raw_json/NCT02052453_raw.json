            "textblock": "Patients with PMs and ICDs have traditionally been considered at risk for electrical\n      magnetic interference (EMI) from electrocautery.  EMI can cause oversensing, pacing\n      inhibition, or inappropriate ICD therapies. In July 2011, the Heart Rhythm Society /American\n      Society of Anesthesiologists (HRS/ASA) published an Expert Consensus Statement on the\n      perioperative management of PM and ICDs.\n\n      The purpose of this registry is to collect data on patients with PMs and ICDs undergoing\n      procedures requiring electrocautery using a standardized device management protocol  (ICD-ON\n      Protocol). Decisions about management of patients with these devices will be made based on\n      surgical location, programmed magnet response and pacemaker dependence.\n\n      This registry will document incidence of EMI, changes in  programmed parameters or device\n      related events associated with the procedures.  Observational data will be collected on\n      participants including:  medical history, device parameters, surgical/cautery data, and\n      postoperative device follow-up.    For procedures not requiring reprogramming, postoperative\n      PM and ICD interrogation will be either routine in office follow-up or remote monitoring, as\n      per the subject's routine."
