  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral palsy (CP) is a neuromuscular disorder that affects approximately 800,000
      individuals in the U.S. An estimated 70-80% of these individuals have spasticity which
      affects ambulation and requires management.  Therefore, the treatment of spasticity is a
      primary goal of interventions for children with CP. One treatment widely used to reduce
      spasticity is Botox because of its ability to temporarily paralyze a muscle.  However, no
      studies have determined the effect of Botox treatment on bone in humans.  Also, a low
      intensity vibration treatment has been shown to improve bone structure in the lower
      extremity bones of children with CP.  The aims of this study are: 1) to determine the effect
      of Botox treatment in conjunction with a daily vibration treatment on bone mass and bone
      structure in children with spastic CP, and 2) to identify the mechanism that underlies the
      effect of Botox and vibration on bone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have been working with children diagnosed with cerebral palsy (CP) for the
      past 10 years.  The investigators have found that bone structure is markedly underdeveloped
      and bone strength is severely compromised in children with CP.  Also, an increased fracture
      rate has been observed in the lower extremity bones of children with CP.  There is evidence
      that Botox, which is used to treat spasticity in CP, can improve motor function; however the
      effect of Botox on human bone is unknown.  There is also evidence that low intensity
      vibration treatment can improve bone mass and bone structure.  The overall goal of this
      current research study is to investigate the effect and mechanism of action of Botox and
      vibration on bone in children with CP.  The investigators will also examine the effect of
      Botox on muscle volume.

      A total of 36 participants will participate in this study. The investigators will assess
      bone structure and muscle volume using MRI.  The investigators will assess bone mass using
      DXA.
