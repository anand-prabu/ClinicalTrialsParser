    <textblock>
      The prevalence of IBS in the community has been reported in numerous cross-sectional
      surveys. However, less is known about the incidence of IBS ,mainly due to its slow
      development and to patients under-reporting. Furthermore, only one study has analyzed data
      concerning potential risk factors for the diagnosis of IBS. The investigators will examine
      the incidence of IBS in a large cohort of young adults and will look at the association of
      socioeconomic, anthropometric and occupational factors with IBS incidence.
