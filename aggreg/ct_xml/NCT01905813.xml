  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted in three parts. Part 1 is a dose escalation phase to determine
      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of INCB040093, a PI3Kδ inhibitor, or a tolerated,
      pharmacologically active dose; Part 2 will evaluate the combination of INCB040093 and
      INCB039110, a JAK1 inhibitor, to determine the MTD of the combination or a tolerated dose
      that produces substantial pharmacologic inhibition of both targets; Part 3 will further
      evaluate the chosen doses of INCB040093 alone and in combination with INCB039110 in subjects
      with relapsed/refractory B-cell malignancies.

                  lymphoma and precursor B-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma INCLUDING: any
                  non-Hodgkin's B-cell malignancy such as CLL and rare non-Hodgkin's B-cell
                  subtypes such as Hairy Cell Leukemia, Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia, Mantle cell
                  lymphoma, transformed NHL histologies, etc.
