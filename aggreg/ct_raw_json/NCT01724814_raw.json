The dose of\n      HM12460A to be administered to the subjects with type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes will be\n      guided by PK data from part 1 of the study; the PD assessment of HM12460A in subjects with\n      diabetes will also be informed by knowledge of PK gained from the healthy volunteer study."

Males must be surgically sterile, abstinent or if\n             engaged in sexual relations of child-bearing potential, the subject must be using an\n             acceptable contraceptive method during and for during a period of 60 days after the\n             last dose of Study Drug.\n\n          -  Signed and dated informed consent obtained before any trial-related activities.\n             (Trial-related activities are any procedure that would not have been performed during\n             normal management of the subject).\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  Previous participation in this trial or other clinical trials within the last 3\n             months.\n\n          -  Clinically significant abnormal hematology or biochemistry screening tests, as judged\n             by the Investigator. In particular, healthy subjects with liver enzymes above the\n             upper limit of the normal range and subjects with diabetes who have elevated liver\n             enzymes (AST or ALT >2 times the upper limit of normal) or impaired renal function\n             (elevated serum creatinine values above the upper limit of normal) will be excluded.\n\n          -  History of any illness that, in the opinion of the Investigator, might confound the\n             results of the trial or pose risk in administering the trial drug to the subject. In\n             particular, subjects with significant cardiovascular disease, anemia (hemoglobin\n             below the lower limit of normal) or hemoglobinopathy will not be allowed to enter the\n             trial.\n\n          -  Clinically significant abnormal ECG at screening, as judged by the Investigator.\n\n          -  History of alcohol abuse.\n\n          -  Any positive reaction of drugs of abuse.\n\n          -  Hepatitis B or C or HIV positive.\n\n          -  Use of prescription drugs within 3 weeks preceding the first dosing of insulin,\n             except for medications deemed acceptable per protocol specific list of concomitant\n             medications."
