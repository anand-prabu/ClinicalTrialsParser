Followings are our specific\n      multidiciplinary items that we want to correct.\n\n        1. popularize and educate the asthma action plan\n\n        2. run a emergency call system for acute exacerbation\n\n        3. educate the proper techniques using inhalers\n\n        4. correct the deficiency of magnesium (magnesium 500 mg per day)\n\n      After 1 years, we will measure the numbers of acute exacerbations, lung function including\n      FEV1 and FEV1/FVC, health-related quality of life and level of serum magnesium in study\n      patients."
