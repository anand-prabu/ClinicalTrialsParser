The total number of study subjects will be 100. All of them have diagnosed\n      with ADPKD and hypertension.

Change in average office-based measurements of systolic\n      blood pressure(SBP), average 24-hour systolic blood pressure by ambulatory blood pressure\n      monitoring (ABPM) , incidence of office systolic blood pressure reductions of \u226510, \u226515 and\n      \u226520 mm Hg , office diastolic blood pressure (DBP), number and dosage of blood pressure\n      tablets,  total kidney volume (TKV), total cyst volume (TCV), pain related to cystic kidneys\n      and renal function, will be assessed at 12 months of follow-up.
