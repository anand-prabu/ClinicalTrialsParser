  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hearing loss screening rates in for older persons in primary care clinics are very low even
      though hearing loss is relatively common for older persons.  When diagnosed with hearing
      loss older persons are often reluctant to follow through. This study involves a prospective
      controlled trial comparing the effectiveness of three primary care based protocols for older
      adults â‰¥ 60 who screen positive for possible hearing loss in promoting subsequent access  to
      and use of hearing health care services. The protocols will compare: 1) screening only
      (standard care control); 2) screening plus an illustrated educational brochure; and 3)
      screening plus an in-person educational intervention and an illustrated educational
      brochure.  Screening will be done by primary care personnel.  Participants will be tracked
      for 8 months to assess outcomes.
