Evidence from animal and human studies\n      strongly supports the link between intestinal bacteria and inflammatory bowel diseases\n      (IBD). Dozens of studies reported its efficacy in treatment of severe Clostridium difficile\n      colitis. Preliminary studies using FMT for Ulcerative Colitis (UC), Crohn's diseases (CD),\n      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and constipation have also met with some success. However,\n      the results on CD is very limited. This is an initial step into investigating the potential\n      efficacy of fecal bacteriotherapy for CD, the investigators propose to determine the\n      efficiency, durability and safety of FMT in a series of 30 patients with CD (included cased\n      according Montreal classification: Age > 14 years old, Location L1-3, Behavior B1-3 but\n      without perianal diseases)."
