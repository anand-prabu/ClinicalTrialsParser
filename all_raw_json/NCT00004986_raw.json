These\n      patients undergo a physical examination including stool analysis for Cryptosporidium parvum\n      oocysts and routine laboratory tests at Weeks 2, 4, and 6 after completion of nitazoxanide\n      therapy. Patients who do not show a complete clinical and parasitologic response\n      (therapeutic failure) after 8 weeks of treatment are allowed to remain on nitazoxanide\n      therapy through the Open Label Compassionate Use of Nitazoxanide in Treatment of\n      Cryptosporidiosis in AIDS Patients (UMD-95-009) protocol."
