            "textblock": "Background:\n\n      Managed care systems rely on primary care providers as gatekeepers to make sensible\n      decisions regarding the use of expensive health care resources.  While this model has some\n      intuitive appeal in terms of its potential for decreasing health care costs, it may not be\n      applicable in VA medical centers, where patients are often medically complex and\n      socioeconomically vulnerable.  Thus, other strategies to integrate generalist and specialist\n      care are required.\n\n      Objectives:\n\n      Our objective is to evaluate the effectiveness of an integrated model of primary care for\n      veterans with alcohol dependence and/or depression in which mental health clinical nurse\n      specialists (CNS) are placed within the General Medicine Clinic (GMC).  Our primary outcomes\n      are patients\ufffd disease-specific mental health symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory: BDI) and\n      satisfaction with care (RAND).  Secondary outcomes include quality of care, health services\n      utilization, and health care costs.\n\n      Methods:\n\n      This is a randomized, controlled trial comparing patients in two GMC firms.  After\n      physicians in both firms were trained in the diagnosis and brief treatment of the two\n      conditions, the two firms were randomized into one of two conditions.  Patients in both\n      firms are screened for depression.  Patients who screen positive for depression and give\n      written informed consent are enrolled.  In the control firm, depression screening results\n      are provided to the primary care physician.  In the integrated primary care firm, results\n      are shared with the primary care provider, along with having a mental health clinical nurse\n      specialist in the GMC who is available to implement and support treatment decisions.\n      Telephone interviews are conducted at three and 12 months after enrollment to collect\n      outcome data by persons blinded to the study hypotheses.  Data will also be collected using\n      local VA databases.  Data analysis will utilize generalized estimating equations to account\n      for the repeated measures design, clustering of patients within physicians, and clustering\n      of physicians within clinics.\n\n      Status:\n\n      Data collection was completed during August, 2000.  Data analyses for the one-year follow-up\n      results are in process."
