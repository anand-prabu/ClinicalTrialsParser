      Purpose: Assess whether intensive training with education and daily remote monitoring with
      provider involvement has a lasting positive impact on adherence to medication management.
      The study will seek to enroll 25 subjects with sickle cell disease or thalassemia, and less
      than 100% compliance for taking iron chelators in the previous three month prior to
      participation in the study. Subjects will be asked to monitor their daily iron chelator
      administration by taking a video recording of preparing it and ingesting at least one sip.
      Subjects will also use a medication log to record daily administration of medication, and
      meet with study staff monthly for educational activities. The data collected will be
      analyzed to describe patient adherence and comfort level with the process of daily recording
      of medication management. Mean percent adherence in the pre-study periods and each of the
      study periods will be analyzed and compared.

    <description>Assess whether intensive training with education and daily remote monitoring with provider involvement has a lasting positive impact on adherence to medication management.  Mean percent adherence in the pre-study periods and each of the study periods will be analyzed and compared. The ANOVA will be performed to compare adherence to medication administration during periods of intensive interactions, period prior to study enrollment, and period post training during regular care follow-up.</description>

    <description>Subjects will be asked to monitor their daily iron chelator administration by taking a video recording of preparing it and ingesting at least one sip during months 1-3 and completing the medication administration log during months 1-6.  During months 1-6 subjects will meet with study staff and receive educational materials on a monthly basis.  The data collected will be analyzed to describe patient adherence and comfort level with the process of daily recording of medication management.</description>
