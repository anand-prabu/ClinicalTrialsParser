  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Arthritis is the nation's most common cause of disability.  An estimated 50 million U.S.
      adults (about 1 in 5) report doctor-diagnosed arthritis.  Twenty three million U.S. adults
      of working age (18-64 years) have arthritis; and in this age group arthritis-attributable
      work limitations affect about 1 in 3 people.  An estimated 12% of all patients seeking
      intervention for symptomatic arthritis have an etiology of previous trauma to the involved
      joint.

      The purpose of this study is to examine these inflammatory compounds in the joint fluid
      (synovial fluid), the joint lining (synovium), and in blood among subjects with isolated
      intra-articular fractures.

      The hypothesis is that early levels of intra-articular inflammation and markers of joint
      tissue degeneration following articular fracture in the human knee are predictive of the
      development of PTA (Post Traumatic Arthritis). Early levels of intra-articular inflammation
      and markers of joint tissue degeneration identified from human knee joints following
      articular injury are predictive of the development of PTA in the mouse knee.

      Samples of blood, urine and synovial fluid will be taken at the spanning frame surgery and
      only synovial fluid at the ORIF (Open Reduction Internal Fixation)surgery. Two MRIs
      (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) will be part of this study at 4 weeks and 18
      months.Participants will complete a set of questionnaires(KOOS: Knee Injury and
      Osteoarthritis Outcome Score) at 4 weeks and 18 months.

      40 patients with a closed unilateral articular fracture of the knee requiring operative
      treatment will be enrolled over an 18 month period.  Tissue samples including synovial fluid
      from the injured and contralateral knee, serum and urine will be collected pre-operatively
      at the time of framing and ORIF. If patients only need to have one surgery (ORIF) sample
      will be collected only once. MRI imaging of the injured knee will be obtained after fixation
      at between week 6 and 8 and at 18 months.  Tissue samples will be analyzed for established
      biomarkers of joint inflammation and degradation.  Patients will be followed for 18 months
      to assess for signs of post-traumatic arthritis.  Imaging with plain film and MRI will occur
      at 18 months.  MRI imaging analysis of cartilage thickness and composition changes will be
      assessed in the injured knees.  Assessment of articular cartilage and joint space narrowing
      and KOOS  will be correlated to biomarkers that may be indicative and predictive of joint
      degeneration and the development of PTA.
