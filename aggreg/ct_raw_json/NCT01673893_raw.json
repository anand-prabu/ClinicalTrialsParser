            "textblock": "The primary goal of this registry is to prospectively assess if delivery of weight adjusted,\n      bolus only with either abcixmab or eptifibitide through the ClearWay\u2122 RX in patients\n      admitted for primary PCI lowers readmission rate in comparison to the historical control of\n      the Medicare/Medicaid readmission database. The registry will record the use of the product\n      during the index procedure, and assess whether or not the patient was readmitted within 30\n      days, related to the index procedure.\n\n      The ClearWay\u2122 RX Local Therapeutic Infusion Catheter is a micro-porous PTFE balloon catheter\n      designed for the localized infusion of various diagnostic and therapeutic agents into the\n      coronary and peripheral vasculature. The ClearWay\u2122 RX creates a low pressure fluid layer\n      that surrounds the balloon, allowing more effective delivery of a prescribed therapeutic\n      agent, without excessive stress and uncontrollable mechanical disruption seen with more\n      traditional elastomeric devices. In addition, the ClearWay\u2122 RX is a low pressure irrigating\n      balloon system and non-compliant balloon that limits the amount of mechanical stress on the\n      vessel wall.\n\n      The objective of this prospective registry is to evaluate whether intracoronary (IC)\n      delivery of Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors (GP IIb/IIIa) during Primary Coronary\n      Intervention (PCI) can reduce the likelihood of 30 day readmissions as a result of the\n      original coronary intervention. Intracoronary delivery of GP IIb/IIa inhibitor Abciximab in\n      STEMI has shown to reduce myocardial infarct size, no reflow or slow flow, improve TIMI flow\n      and Myocardial Blush Grade2,3. The ICE trial4 (N=376) compared IC delivery of GP IIb/IIa\n      inhibitor Eptifibitide bolus only administration, bolus with maintenance infusion of\n      Eptifibitide, to standard intravenous (IV) bolus with maintenance infusion. At 24 month\n      follow up, the Major Adverse Coronary Events (MACE) rate was lower in the IC bolus only\n      group (2.5%) versus IC bolus and maintenance infusion (5.8%), and IV bolus with maintenance\n      infusion (10.8%). Further, target lesion revascularization, and readmission rates were\n      significantly lower in the IC bolus only arm, (10.9% versus 16.8% and 28% respectively)."
