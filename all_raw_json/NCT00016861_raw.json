Patients are accrued into stratum 1\n      initially and into stratum 2 if stratum 1 closes due to dose-limiting toxicity of\n      myelosuppression or diarrhea. Patients on anticonvulsants will be accrued into stratum 3 and\n      must meet the eligibility criteria for the stratum that is open (stratum 1 or stratum 2).\n      (Stratum 1 closed as of 2002-09-15).\n\n      Patients receive irinotecan IV over 90 minutes weekly for 4 weeks. Treatment repeats every 6\n      weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of irinotecan until the maximum tolerated\n      dose (MTD) with and without anticonvulsants is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose\n      preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed every 6 months for 4 years and then annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 20-25 patients will be accrued for this study."
