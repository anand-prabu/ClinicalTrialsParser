      The purpose of this project is to expand and enhance the New Haven Mental health Outreach
      for Mothers (MOMs) Coalition beyond pregnancy and depression to include a broader definition
      of mental illness (depressive, anxiety, and substance use disorders), and a larger target
      population (low-income, racially and ethnically diverse, pregnant and parenting women) in
      the City of New Haven.  Through this expansion, the Coalition will bring together the
      community of women, their families and advocates, healthcare providers, policy and agency
      leaders, and academics, to inform the development and conduct of public health approaches
      around the mental health of low-income, racially and ethnically diverse, pregnant and
      parenting women.  The specific goals of this Phase I proposal are:

        1. To conduct a community-led needs assessment on the mental health of low-income,
           ethnically and racially diverse pregnant and parenting women in the City of New Haven.

        2. To provide randomized intervention services to improve signs/symptoms of
           depression/stress/trauma among mothers living in public housing in New Haven, CT
