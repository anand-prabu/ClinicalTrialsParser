            "textblock": "OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the safety in children of recurrent neuroblastoma of two weekly\n      subcutaneous injections of autologous, or partially HLA-matched allogeneic, neuroblastoma\n      cells that have been modified by insertion of the interleukin-2 gene introduced by a\n      retroviral vector. II. Determine whether multiple histocompatibility-restricted or\n      unrestricted antitumor immune responses are induced by this treatment and the cell dose\n      required to produce these effects. III. Obtain preliminary data on the antitumor effects of\n      this regimen.\n\n      OUTLINE: Autologous or partially HLA-matched allogeneic neuroblastoma cells are transduced\n      with a human gene for interleukin-2 production. Patients receive subcutaneous injections of\n      the gene-modified cells on days 1 and 8, with the second injection containing 10 times more\n      cells than the first injection. After a 3-4 week rest, stable and responding patients may\n      receive additional weekly injections at the second dose. Cohorts of 3-6 patients will be\n      entered at increasing cell doses until the maximum tolerated dose is estimated. Multiple\n      injection sites may be used at the higher cell-dose levels. Patients are followed every week\n      for 6 weeks, every other week for 6 weeks, and monthly for 1 year. Additional visits may be\n      required as clinically indicated.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 12 patients each will be entered into the autologous and\n      the partially HLA-matched allogeneic tumor cell treatment groups. Accrual is expected to\n      require 4 years for the autologous tumor cell group and 2 years for the partially\n      HLA-matched allogenic tumor cell group."
