            "textblock": "The treatment of chronic heart failure (CHF) is a key challenge in public health. Despite\n      medical advances, 1-year mortality of NYHA III-IV CHF is 28%. Undernutrition is an\n      independent risk factor for mortality and complications. Up-to-date, interventional studies\n      involving nutrition are scarce in CHF. Academic societies are recommending the use of oral\n      nutritional supplements (ONS) in case of weight loss, without defining the modalities. ONS\n      could improve nutritional status in undernourished CHF patients, but solely administered,\n      have a limited impact on undernutrition, physical performance and prognosis. A multimodal\n      approach integrating physical exercise, nutritional intakes, polyunsaturated n-3 fatty acids\n      (n-3 PUFA), and anabolizing hormones, has to be privileged. A recent trial has shown the\n      clinical benefits of such an approach in patients with chronic respiratory insufficiency\n      (CRI), who have similar nutritional and muscular characteristics.\n\n      Exercise rehabilitation is well validated in CHF patients, but has never been validated in\n      case of undernutrition. Exercise rehabilitation allows improving exercise capacity, quality\n      of life and cardiovascular outcomes including mortality.\n\n      N-3 PUFA supplementation improves muscle strength and endurance in CRI patients. n-3 PUFA\n      supplementation decreases by 30% cardiovascular mortality of CHF patients. n-3 PUFA could be\n      useful for CHF patients rehabilitation.\n\n      Androgenopenia is a prognostic factor in CHF. Androgen substitution improves significantly\n      muscle strength, walking endurance and quality of life. In the context of a multimodal\n      approach, Androgen substitution together with exercise rehabilitation and ONS could have a\n      beneficial effect on muscle mass, strength and endurance of CHF patients, as already\n      described in CRI, elderly and HIV patients.\n\n      The study hypotheses that a 3-month multimodal approach associating exercise rehabilitation,\n      androgen substitution, n-3 PUFAs and ONS improves exercise capacity of undernourished CHF\n      patients."
