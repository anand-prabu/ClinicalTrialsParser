Determine whether defects in fibrillin-1 cellular processing are present in\n      the tsk1 mouse model that carries a known FBN1 gene rearrangement and in a population of\n      Choctaw Native American patients with systemic sclerosis who have a strong genetic\n      predisposition to the disease.\n\n      II.  Determine the ultrastructural features of fibrillin-1 in these patients. III.  Screen\n      the FBN1 gene for mutations beginning at the regions homologous to the tsk1 duplication and\n      latent transforming growth factor binding proteins in these patients and in an unaffected\n      Choctaw control group.\n\n      IV.  Determine the correlation between fibrillin-1 abnormalities and clinical presentation,\n      autoantibodies, and ethnicity."
