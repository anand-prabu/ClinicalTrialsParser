  <brief_summary>

      The objective is to clinically assess the Kinesia HomeView system for automated and remote
      monitoring of Parkinson's disease (PD) motor symptoms.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently, there is limited access to movement disorder specialist centers for a significant
      portion of the PD population. Treatment effectiveness is judged during office visits by
      improvement of patient motor symptoms and quality of life. Clinicians evaluate patients by
      having them perform specific motor tasks and rating the severity on a 0-4 scale. A major
      limitation is that a single evaluation in a clinical setting may not accurately reflect
      motor symptom fluctuations experienced over the course of a day, week, or month. Clinicians
      currently lack effective, affordable medical devices that can be easily delivered to a
      patient's home for monitoring symptoms on a more continuous basis as motor symptoms
      typically change throughout the day. Kinesia HomeView provides a repeatable, automated
      system clinicians can use to remotely monitor PD motor symptoms on a more continuous basis
      in a patient's home. The investigators hypothesize use of the Kinesia HomeView system will
      improve outcomes and decrease costs especially for patient populations in areas not in close
      proximity to movement disorder specialists.
