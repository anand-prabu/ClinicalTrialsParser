            "textblock": "Rehabilitation after lumbar disc surgery (prolapse) focuses on various elements such as\n      endurance, strength, stretching and information. Evidence concludes that it is not harmful\n      to return to activity after lumbar disc surgery, and restrictions to activities after these\n      operations are today more or less nonexistent. Some studies have shown that high intensity\n      programs might be more effective, but they are probably more expensive. In recent years\n      cognitive interventions have received more attention in rehabilitation programs after lumbar\n      disc surgery. The cognitive approach is focused on providing patient knowledge to reduce\n      uncertainty so that he or she can understand what is important after lumbar disc surgery so\n      that belief in self-efficacy increases. A goal of the rehabilitation is to get the patient\n      to resume normal activities. Reviews ask for how much treatment are needed in a\n      rehabilitation program after lumbar disc surgery.\n\n      The study will be a randomized clinical trial. The study will compare two different\n      post-operative rehabilitation programs (general information or general information +\n      exercise therapy). Both groups will begin treatment 1 day after  surgery. Subjects in\n      exercise therapy group are supposed to continue with exercises 3 months.\n\n      In this study the following hypothesis will be studied:\n\n        1. Brief intervention, an educational model, alone after lumbar disc surgery do have the\n           same effect on pain in legs and low back as brief intervention, an educational model,\n           combined with exercise therapy.\n\n        2. Exercises which are instructed after lumbar disc surgery in a rehabilitation program,\n           are being done by the patients."
