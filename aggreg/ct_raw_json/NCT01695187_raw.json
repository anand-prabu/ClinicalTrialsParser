Have recurrent herpes labialis as defined by a history of three (3) or more cold sore\n             recurrences on the lips and/or skin surrounding the lips in the previous year. The\n             majority of their cold sore recurrences proceeded by a well-defined history of\n             prodromal symptoms including redness, pain, burning, tingling, itching, swelling or a\n             tight sensation of the lip at the site of the outbreak;\n\n          3. Be willing to refrain from using systemic or topical antiviral agents or systemic\n             corticosteroids within 4 weeks prior to study drug administration and for the\n             duration of the cold sore recurrence;\n\n          4. Be willing to refrain from using any topical pharmaceutical or cosmetic products\n             other than the study medication in or around the nasal and perioral areas for the\n             duration of the cold sore recurrence;\n\n          5. Be willing to refrain from participation in another clinical trial;\n\n          6. Be willing and able to use phone or internet to obtain the combination to unlock\n             their study medication kit;\n\n          7. Be able to read and write in English and understand and comply with the protocol\n             requirements;\n\n          8. Be able to give informed consent and have signed a written informed consent form.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          1. Known hypersensitivity to one of the drug ingredients, including soybean oil,\n             polysorbate (Tween), alcohol, EDTA, or cetylpyridinium chloride (found in some\n             mouthwashes and lozenges);\n\n          2. Severe chronic illness including renal failure, severe respiratory or cardiac\n             disease, chronic infections, immunodeficiency syndrome, uncontrolled diabetes\n             mellitus or untreated severe thyroid disease;\n\n          3. Received (within the last 6 months) or receiving chemotherapy;\n\n          4. Significant skin disease on the face (such as atopic dermatitis, cystic acne, severe\n             rosacea, eczema, psoriasis or other chronic vesiculobullous disorders) or lesions,\n             wounds, abrasions, piercings, tattoos, irritation or other skin conditions on or\n             around the nasal and perioral areas that would interfere with the treatment or\n             assessment of the primary lesion complex.  Subjects with mild controlled psoriasis,\n             eczema, acne or dermatitis or other conditions may be included if the condition does\n             not interfere with the ability to evaluate a herpes labialis lesion or local skin\n             irritation;\n\n          5. Previously received herpes vaccine;\n\n          6. Active alcohol or drug abuse;\n\n          7. Prior randomization into any NanoBio study;\n\n          8. Any condition that would potentially make them unable to participate for the entire\n             trial period;\n\n          9.
