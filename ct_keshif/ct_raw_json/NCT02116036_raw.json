            "textblock": "The antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS) is a syndrome associated with excessive blood\n      clotting (thrombosis). APS is among the most common cause of heart attack and stroke in\n      patients under the age of 50 and is particularly prevalent in patients with autoimmune\n      conditions. Patients with APS and prior thrombosis require lifelong anticoagulant therapy to\n      prevent recurrent clots; such therapy is currently provided with warfarin. Warfarin requires\n      frequent bloodwork monitoring, and many medications or foods can alter its effect, which can\n      put people either at increased risk for clotting or bleeding. Rivaroxaban is a new mediation\n      that prevents blood clots that does not require bloodwork monitoring and that has fewer\n      interactions. This study is a pilot feasibility study which will: 1) examine our ability to\n      identify 150 eligible APS patients; 2) measure our ability to obtain consent from 135 of\n      these patients; and 3) test our hypothesis that we can obtain 95% compliance with daily\n      rivaroxaban administration. The investigators propose to treat eligible patients with\n      rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily. Patients will be followed for a minimum of one year and their\n      rates of bleeding and thrombosis will be monitored as secondary outcome measures."
