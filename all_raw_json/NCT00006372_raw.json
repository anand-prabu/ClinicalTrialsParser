Treatment\n      continues every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of doxorubicin HCl liposome, gemcitabine,\n      and vinorelbine until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as\n      the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting\n      toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for up to 1 year.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 9-24 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-18\n      months."
