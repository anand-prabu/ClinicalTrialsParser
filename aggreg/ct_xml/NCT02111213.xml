      This research study will evaluate the effectiveness of a computer-based 'virtual lay
      advisor' compared to a proven human lay advisor/promotora to promote regular walking among
      inactive midlife and older Latino adults.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Spanish or English-speaking Latino men or women

          -  Aged greater than or equal to 50 years

          -  No plans to move within the next year

          -  Inactive (have not engaged in moderate-intensity or more vigorous physical activity

          -  &gt; 3 days per week for at least 20 min per day) within last 6-months

          -  Able to participate in study intervention and assessments at their local neighborhood
             senior center

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any medical condition or disorder that would limit participation in moderate
             intensity physical activity (such as sustained walking), including life-threatening
             disorders, myocardial ischemia, and major functional disabilities in the orthopedic
             area

          2. Not stable on their medications, including hormone replacement therapy, for â‰¥ 3
             months (given that changes in medications can create additional stress and burden
             over and above attempts to change lifestyle behaviors);

          3. Severe depressive symptomatology (score &gt; 16 on the 18-item Spanish version of the
             Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale), the English version will be used
             as appropriate

          4. Gross levels of dementia (score&lt; 23 on the Folstein Mini-Mental State Exam)

          5. Inability to complete a face-to-face training session with a computer-based program
