Possible Participants will be screened to\n      assess their eligibility to enter the study within 14 days prior to study Day 1.\n      Participants will be confined at the Clinical Research Center (CRC) from the time of\n      Check-in on Day -1 until discharge on Day 5. Participants will return to the CRC on Days 8\n      and 15 and there will be a follow-up call or visit on Day 22. A review of all clinical and\n      laboratory data through Day 8 evaluations in each cohort will be done by the Medical Monitor\n      and the  Principal Investigator (PI) prior to proceeding with dosing any further cohort, if\n      indicated.
