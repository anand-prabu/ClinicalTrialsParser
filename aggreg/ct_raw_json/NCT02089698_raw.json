Clinical measurements will include\n      preoperative and 3-month postoperative corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA), endothelial\n      cell counts (ECC) and preoperative and 1-day postoperative central corneal thickness (CCT).\n      Intraoperative measurements will include phaco time, torsional time, aspiration time, case\n      time, cumulative dissipated energy (CDE) and balanced salt solution volume (BSS).\n\n      The study was performed according to established ethical standards for clinical research\n      Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the University of Sao Paulo in Brazil, conducted between\n      November 2010 and February of 2011. All surgeries will be performed at the University of Sao\n      Paulo. Physicians conducting postoperative evaluation will not have access to patients'\n      medical records. Exclusion criteria will be previous ocular surgery, central endothelial\n      cell count less than 2000 cells/mm2, glaucoma or intraocular pressure greater than 21 mmHg,\n      amblyopia, retinal abnormalities, steroid or immunosuppressive treatment and connective\n      tissue diseases.
