  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of E3810 10mg once and twice
      daily in maintenance therapy for PPI resistant gastroesophageal reflux disease patients.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is  randomized, multicenter, parallel-group, double-blind trial that investigates the
      efficacy and safety of E3810 10mg twice daily over a period of 52 weeks.  The non-recurrence
      rate as endoscopically confirmed at 52 weeks shall be the primary end point, and this shall
      be examined through a randomized, multicenter, parallel-group, double-blind trial that
      investigates the efficacy and safety of E3810 10mg twice daily over a period of 52 weeks.
