  <brief_summary>

      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of trabectedin+DOXIL as a
      third-line chemotherapy regimen (treatment) in patients with platinum-sensitive
      advanced-relapsed epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer who
      received 2 previous lines of platinum-based chemotherapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized (individuals assigned to study treatment by chance), open-label
      (identity of assigned study drug will be known), active-controlled study in adult female
      patients with platinum-sensitive advanced-relapsed epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal,
      or fallopian tube cancer who received 2 previous lines of platinum-based chemotherapy.
      Approximately 670 participants will be enrolled. Patients will be stratified by 4 criteria
      defined in the protocol and randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to the trabectedin+DOXIL
      combination therapy group (Arm A) or to the DOXIL (pegylated liposomal doxorubicin)
      monotherapy group (Arm B). During the treatment phase, patients will receive study drug
      infusions according to 21-day cycles in Arm A and 28-day cycles in Arm B. Treatment will
      continue until the occurrence of disease progression or unacceptable treatment toxicity, or
      until 2 cycles beyond a confirmed complete response is documented. Up to 2 additional cycles
      of study drug are allowed after complete response, at the discretion of the principal
      investigator. Efficacy assessments will be evaluated using Response Evaluation Criteria in
      Solid Tumors. Disease assessments, including assessments for patients who discontinue
      treatment for reasons other than disease progression, will be performed until disease
      progression, the start of subsequent anticancer therapy, withdrawal of consent, or the
      clinical cutoff date. Collection of survival status will continue until at least 514 deaths
      have been observed. Serial pharmacokinetic (PK) samples will be collected in a subset of
      patients who voluntarily consent to the PK portion of the study. Safety will be monitored
      throughout the study. An interim analysis of overall survival (OS) will be performed after
      approximately 308 participants have died. The final analysis of OS will occur when
      approximately 514 deaths have been observed.
