                "textblock": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n          1. Histologically or cytologically proven mCRPC with documented metastases (measurable\n             or evaluable disease is acceptable) now eligible for treatment with docetaxel\n             chemotherapy\n\n          2. Disease progression since the last change in therapy defined by one or more of the\n             following according to the Prostate Cancer Working Group (PCWG2) criteria (J Clin\n             Oncol 2008;26:1148-1159):\n\n             i. PSA progression as defined by the prostate cancer working group (2) (PCWG2)\n             criteria (Scher et al. 2008 J Clin Oncol. 26; 1148). This must be based on a series\n             of at least 3 readings at least 7 days apart. The 3rd reading must be >= 2ng/ml. In\n             the event where an intermediate reading is lower than a previous reading, then the\n             patient will still be eligible (ie. the 3 readings do not need to be consecutive).\n             The first of the three readings must have been obtained after commencing the previous\n             systemic therapy, or, in the case of androgen receptor antagonists, after\n             discontinuing.\n\n             ii. Radiographic progression of nodal or visceral metastases as defined by RECIST\n             version 1.1 (Eur J Cancer 2009;45:228). See Appendix 5 iii. The appearance of two or\n             more new bony metastases\n\n          3. Serum testosterone <1.7 nmol/L (ongoing LHRH analogue or antagonist therapy is\n             permitted to maintain a castrate state)\n\n          4. Discontinuation of prior therapies for prostate cancer \u2265 4 weeks prior to commencing\n             study treatment (with the exception of an LHRH agonist or antagonist where required\n             for ongoing testosterone suppression)\n\n          5. No anti-androgen withdrawal response. Withdrawal responses typically occur following\n             combined androgen blockade (LHRH analogue/antagonist or orchidectomy combined with an\n             anti-androgen) as initial therapy for a prolonged period, or in patients who respond\n             to an anti-androgen as second-line therapy. Consistent with PCWG2 guidelines,\n             investigators should evaluate such patients for withdrawal response for 6 weeks and\n             then confirm disease progression. Investigators need not wait to assess withdrawal\n             response in patients who did not respond, or who showed a PSA decline for \u2264 3 months,\n             after an anti-androgen was administered as a second-line or later intervention\n\n          6. ECOG performance status 0 or 1\n\n          7. Hb \u2265 9g/dL; platelets \u2265 100 x 109/L; neutrophils \u2265 1.5 x109/L\n\n          8. Bilirubin \u2264 ULN ; ALT and AST \u2264 1.5 x ULN\n\n          9. Sodium and potassium within the normal range for the site\n\n         10. Able to swallow study drugs (without crushing/opening in the case of AZD5363)\n\n         11. Life expectancy > 3 months\n\n         12. Aged 18 years or over\n\n         13. Provision of written informed consent\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          1. Previous treatment with cytotoxic chemotherapy (patients may have received previous\n             or ongoing bisphosphonates or denosumab). There are no restrictions on prior use of\n             second generation hormonal therapies e.g. abiraterone, enzalutamide\n\n          2. Prior malignancy with an estimated \u2265 30% chance of relapse within 2 years following\n             curative treatment\n\n          3. Previously identified brain metastases, or spinal cord compression unless treated\n             with full functional recovery\n\n          4. Prior radiotherapy to > 30% of bone marrow\n\n          5. Administration of an investigational agent within 30 days of first dose of study\n             medication\n\n          6. Type I or II diabetes mellitus requiring either insulin or oral hypoglycaemics for\n             routine management. Patients with type II diabetes mellitus that is well controlled\n             by dietary measures alone are eligible to participate. Patients found to have a\n             fasting glucose \u22657 mmol/L (\u2265126 mg/dL) or glycosylated haemoglobin >8% (64 mmol/mol)\n             at screening should be assessed for appropriate management according to local policy.\n             Those in whom dietary measures alone provide good diabetic control will be eligible\n             for inclusion\n\n          7. Malabsorption syndrome, previous gastrointestinal surgery, or other gastrointestinal\n             condition that may affect drug absorption\n\n          8. Coronary artery bypass graft, angioplasty, vascular stent, myocardial infarction,\n             angina pectoris or congestive heart failure (NYHA \u2265 grade 2) within the last 6 months\n\n          9.

Proteinuria (either 3+ on dipstick analysis or >500 mg/24 hours) or creatinine >1.5 x\n             ULN concurrent with creatinine clearance <50 mL/min (assessed as per local practice\n             e.g. by Cockcroft and Gault estimation)\n\n         14. Exposure to potent inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 or substrates of CYP3A4\n             within 2 weeks before the first dose of study treatment (3 weeks for St John's Wort)\n\n         15.
