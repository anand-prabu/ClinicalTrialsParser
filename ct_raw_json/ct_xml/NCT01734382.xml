  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label Phase IV study will evaluate the efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics,
      pharmacodynamics and immunogenicity of RoActemra/Actemra (tocilizumab) in reduced dose
      frequency in patients with adequately controlled systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis who
      have experienced a laboratory abnormality on twice weekly RoActemra/Actemra dosing. Patients
      will receive RoActemra/Actemra 12 mg/kg or 8 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks. After 4
      consecutive infusions, patients who experience an event of neutropenia, thrombocytopenia or
      liver enzyme abnormality will move to every 4 weeks RoActemra/Actemra administration.
      Anticipated time on study treatment is 52 weeks.
