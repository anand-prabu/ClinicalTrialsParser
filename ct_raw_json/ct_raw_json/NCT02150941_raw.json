The current\n      practice is to try to wash off and suction up these blood clots with the endoscope.\n      However, this is often not successful due to blood clots blocking the suction channel.\n\n      A new device has been approved by Health Canada that attaches to the endoscope and helps\n      prevent blockage.  It is believed that this device will help doctors suck out blood clots\n      and potentially improve visualization, identification of the cause of bleeding, and possibly\n      health outcomes, although this has never been proven.  The purpose of the investigators\n      clinical trial is to test whether this device works and whether it can help patients with\n      UGIB."

            "textblock": "STUDY DESIGN:\n\n      This is a randomized clinical trial of BioVac direct suction device compared to standard\n      endoscopy suction for UGIB.  The study will be performed at London Health Sciences Center\n      Victoria Campus and University Campus with an anticipated recruitment period of three years.\n       Approval from the Western University Research Ethics Board will be obtained prior to\n      patient recruitment and the trial will be registered with the United States National\n      Institute of Health website (www.clinicaltrials.gov).\n\n      STUDY POPULATION:\n\n      All patients over the age of 18 admitted to hospital with a diagnosis of UGIB will be\n      considered for recruitment.  Patients already admitted to hospital with another diagnosis\n      who develop UGIB will also be included.\n\n      INTERVENTION:\n\n      Patients with UGIB will undergo upper endoscopy as deemed clinically indicated by their\n      treating physician.  If the source of bleeding is found within the first 5 minutes (timer to\n      be started once the gastroscope is inserted past the upper esophageal sphincter) or there is\n      no blood in the upper GI tract, the patient will be excluded from the study as additional\n      suctioning will provide no benefit.\n\n      If the source of bleeding is not found within the first 5 minutes due to blood clots, the\n      patient may benefit from additional suctioning.  The patient will be randomized in random\n      blocks of between 2-6 stratified by site (University Campus and Victoria Campus) to either\n      BioVac device or standard endoscopy practice.  Stratification by site is necessary to\n      control for different endoscopist practice patterns at each site.  Those randomized to\n      BioVac device will insert the device through the gastroscope and suction as much blood as\n      possible to identify the bleeding lesion.  Those randomized to standard endoscopy suction\n      will use the gastroscope suction instead.  Due to the suctioning power of the study device,\n      a sham device is not possible since even an identical appearing placebo device would be\n      recognizable due to its lack of suction.  To address this, only objective outcomes not\n      subject to operator bias were selected.  In addition, the outcomes assessor and patient will\n      be blinded.  Otherwise, the endoscopy will be performed at the discretion of the\n      endoscopist."
