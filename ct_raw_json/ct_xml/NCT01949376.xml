  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to improve our understanding of potential changes in size,
      shape and activity in some brain areas that can occur in women receiving different types of
      Breast Cancer therapy, and how these changes are related to the development of mild
      cognitive impairment as the result of these treatments.

    <textblock>
      This study aims to identify neuroimaging biomarkers for predicting mild cognitive impairment
      (MCI) in breast cancer patients receiving adjuvant chemo and/or hormonal therapy by
      examining hippocampal-cortical neurocircuitry. Adjuvant therapies increase long-term
      survival, but produce changes in cognitive function in 30% (up to 70%) of women on average
      with breast cancer. Cognitive decline negatively impacts quality of life in patients and
      their supporters. Therefore, early identification of patients at risk for developing
      treatment-related cognitive impairment is needed to develop potential prevention or
      treatment options and prevent further decline. Our recent work demonstrates that patients
      receiving adjuvant hormonal treatment exhibit decline in cognition as soon as three months
      post treatment. Although neuroimaging studies have identified brain changes associated with
      chemotherapy (&quot;chemo brain&quot;, no investigation has assessed the type and severity of such
      changes following hormonal therapy, nor has any study determined which individuals are at
      greatest risk for cognitive impairment.

      Our central hypothesis is that measures of the hippocampal-cortical integrity can be used to
      predict cognitive decline, and changes of specific domains of cognitive performance in
      patients receiving adjuvant therapy over time will be related to changes in specific
      components of this circuitry over time.

        CON subjects will be recruited from advertisement and through the Northwestern University
        (NU) Cognitive Neurology and Alzheimer's Disease Center (CNADC).

        The CH+ and CH- patients will be recruited from the 3 following sites, through physician
        referral: a) outpatient facility at Galter Pavilion of Northwestern Memorial Hospital; b)
        to Maggie Daley Center for Women's Cancer Care at Prentice Women's Hospital; and c) Lynn
        Sage Comprehensive Breast Cancer Center at Prentice Women's Hospital.

        Additional participants will be recruited (a) through advertisement in local newspapers,
        craigslist, and at community programs that serve cancer patients, including hospitals and
        support groups, and (b) from community educational events sponsored by the Robert H. Lurie
        Comprehensive Cancer Center and the Women's Health Research Institute.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Female, within the age range of 40-70

          -  Post-menopausal, or will undergo hormonal therapy.

          -  CH+ patients - any stage of breast cancer without brain metastasis, has undergone
             surgery prior to screening, will undergo hormonal therapy with or without
             chemotherapy.

          -  CH- patients - any stage of breast cancer without brain metastasis, has undergone
             surgery prior to screening, will undergo no therapy or radiation therapy.

          -  CON - cognitively normal on the basis of annual neuropsychological and research
             neurological examinations done as part of the Uniform Data Set (UDS), of the NIA
             Alzheimer's Disease Centers (ADC) program, recruited from the NU CNADC Clinical Core.
