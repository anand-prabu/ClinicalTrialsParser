  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the preliminary lead-in study is to determine whether circulating
      tumor cells in patients with metastatic progressive castration-resistant prostate cancer or
      metastatic progressive breast cancer can be captured using a novel mesenchymal-marker based
      ferrofluid (N-cadherin or O-cadherin based).

      The primary objective of each comparative cohort (second stage, prostate cancer) is to
      compare the non-detection rate of circulating tumor cells between the standard and novel
      methods.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Prostate cancer patients will be eligible for inclusion in this study only if all of the
        following criteria apply:

          1. Histologically confirmed diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the prostate.  Small cell or
             neuroendocrine tumors of the prostate are also permitted.

          2. Clinical or radiographic evidence of metastatic disease.

          3. Castrate levels of testosterone (&lt;50 ng/dl)

          4. Evidence of disease progression on or following most recent therapy as evidenced
             clinically by the treating physician or by either of the following:

               -  Two consecutive PSA levels greater than the PSA nadir achieved on ADT, separated
                  by greater than one week

               -  Radiographic evidence of disease progression as defined by new bone scan lesions
                  or growth of soft tissue/visceral metastases &gt;1 cm in diameter (2 cm for lymph
                  nodes).

          5. Age &gt; 18 years.

          6. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent
             document.

        Breast cancer patients will be eligible for inclusion in this study only if all of the
        following inclusion criteria apply:

          1. Histologically confirmed diagnosis of invasive breast cancer.

          2. Clinical or radiographic evidence of metastatic disease.

          3. Evidence of disease progression on the current or following the most recent therapy,
             determined either clinically by the treating physician or  by radiographic evidence
             as defined by new bone scan lesions or soft tissue/visceral metastases &gt;1 cm in
             diameter (2 cm for lymph nodes).

          4. Age &gt; 18 years.

          5. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent
             document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        A patient will not be eligible for inclusion in this study if any of the following
        criteria apply:

          1. History of intercurrent or past medical or psychiatric illness that would make
             participation in a blood drawing protocol difficult or not feasible at the discretion
             of the principal investigator or co-investigator(s).

          2. Treatment with an anthracycline or mitoxantrone within 1 week of CTC collection
