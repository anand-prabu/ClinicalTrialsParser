    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to understand how carotid endarterectomy (CEA) or percutaneous
      carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS) affect memory and thinking resulting in improving or
      worsening of thinking or memory.  There have been many studies on this subject, some finding
      that certain patients gain improvement in their brain function and others might get worse.
      The goal of this study is to discover which patients are more likely to have improved
      cognitive functioning.  Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and percutaneous carotid angioplasty
      and stenting (CAS) are not investigational and are an accepted treatment for your condition.
       In addition, subjects that choose not to undergo surgery will also be included in this
      study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At the present time, large multi-center clinical trials support the use of carotid
      revascularization for symptomatic carotid stenosis and for asymptomatic carotid stenosis
      (greater than 60%) to prevent stroke.  Guidelines supporting the use of carotid
      endarterectomy for asymptomatic stenosis are based largely on the Asymptomatic Carotid
      Atherosclerosis Study (ACAS) which reported a 47% relative risk reduction for ipsilateral
      stroke or death in patients randomized to surgery compared to best medical management over 5
      years.  These data were further substantiated by the recent publication of the Medical
      Research Council Asymptomatic Carotid Surgery (ACST) trial results (1); however, both trials
      estimated that at least 40 operative procedures were required to prevent a single disabling
      stroke or death in one patient after 5 years (2). These data underscore the importance of
      understanding the cognitive risks of carotid revascularization and developing strategies to
      limit factors that contribute to this risk especially in asymptomatic patients.

      The purpose of this study is to better understand the effect of carotid revascularization
      (using either carotid endarterectomy (CEA) or percutaneous carotid angioplasty and stenting
      (CAS)) on cognitive outcome by prospectively collecting cerebral blood flow data and
      cognitive testing data prior to and after carotid revascularization procedures.

        Patients with unilateral, asymptomatic, significant carotid artery stenosis who are  ≥18
        years of age who do not present with past or current significant cerebrovascular and
        neuropsychological disease.

          -  Patients with hemodynamically significant carotid artery stenosis (according to CREST
             criteria: ≥ 60% by angiography, OR  ≥ 70% by ultrasound, OR ≥ 80% by CTA or MRA)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with prior large vessel infarct

          -  Patients with intracranial stenosis

          -  Patients with major depression

          -  Patients with Alzheimer disease (clinically defined or Wechsler IQ &lt;80)

          -  Patients who have had previous ipsilateral carotid surgery
