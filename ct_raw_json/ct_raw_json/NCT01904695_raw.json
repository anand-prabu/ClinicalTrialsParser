The inference\n      methods of causal relationship between treatment and clinical effect under real-world study\n      may help.\n\n      Objectives: This study aims to assess the efficacy of Phlegm and Stasis Syndrome\n      differentiation method in treating resistant hypertension and explore causal inference in\n      the real-world study.\n\n      Research design and methods: It is a multicenter, prospective, two-arm, cohort study\n      including 200 patients with resistant hypertension (doctors' diagnosis based on the American\n      Heart Association criteria 2008). Essential hypertension subjects, aged 18-70 years, blood\n      pressure > 140/90 mm Hg even used to be on 3 or more medications for a month and diagnosed\n      as Phlegm and Stasis Syndrome will be included. Thiazide diuretics and/or two more\n      antihypertensive agents for 8 weeks, Chinese herbs (for synchronic treating phlegm and blood\n      stasis) and nonpharmacological recommendations were initiated in the observational group and\n      the control group received the same interventions without Chinese herbs.\n\n      Outcome measures: The primary outcomes will be Systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood\n      pressure reductions and changes in symptoms and signs. Cardiac event and death incident will\n      be the secondary outcomes. Possible side effects and adverse reactions arising from the\n      treatment like diarrhea will be recorded.\n\n      Discussion: This is a rigorous methodology pilot study and 200 participants is enough to\n      calculate sample size in later formal trial."
