  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A new bone-seeking radiopharmaceutical drug, called Radium-223 dichloride (formerly known as
      &quot;Alpharadin&quot;), is currently under development. It is an injectable aqueous solution
      containing radium-223, a radionuclide that emits radiation of another quality and with a
      different distribution than radiopharmaceuticals currently in use.

      After injection of the drug into the blood, a large portion of the drug will accumulate in
      the bones, and irradiate the skeletal metastases. The drug is expected to be retained longer
      in the painful sites of bone than in other sites of the body, and may alleviate pain through
      its radiation. Radium-223 is expected to be both efficacious as regards the targeted
      localised irradiation, and also to have a favourable safety profile.

      The radiopharmaceutical drug Radium-223 has not been given to humans before. In this first
      clinical study in man, a so-called phase I study, the safety, tolerance and the toxicity of
      various radioactivity doses of Radium-223 will be evaluated.

    <description>The study had 2 parts. Part 1a was designed with single injections of Radium-223 given to cohorts of 5 patients for each of 5 pre-defined dose levels. Part 1b was designed to retreat and fractionate the dose of Radium-223 in multiple injections.Based on the revised correction factor by calibration, recalculations verified that the single injection doses administered in the part 1a were : 46, 93, 163, 213 and 250 kBq/kg b.w. Two re-treated patients (dose group 6) received a second dose that resulted in a total dose of 250 kBq/kg b.w. The fractionated doses were 1/5 and ½ of the highest dose in part1b (i.e. 250kBq so 5 x 50 and 2 x 125 kBq/kg b.w. respectively).</description>

    <description>- Single injection. Starting dose 46 kBq/kg b.w. Escalating doses 93, 163, 213 and 250 kBq/kg b.w. (9.8.2 Changes in addition to those described in amendments) After completion of the five dose levels above, the protocol was amended and the study extended to include patients to received multiple injections of Radium-223 - Re-treatment: Patients who had earlier been included in the study and received dose levels 46, 93 or 163 kBq/kg b.w. could be given a second injection, provided that the total dose did not exceed 250 kBq/kg b.w. - Fractionated dose (multiple dosing) Patients were given multiple injections in treatment: 5 injections of 50 kBq/kg b.w. at 3 weeks intervals. Patients were given multiple injections in treatment: 2 injections of 125 kBq/kg b.w. at 6 weeks interval</description>

          -  has histologically or cytologically confirmed breast or prostate carcinoma

          -  presents with bony metastases, confirmed by scintigraphic imaging within the previous
             4 weeks

          -  relapsing with new foci in the skeleton after previous external radiotherapy
