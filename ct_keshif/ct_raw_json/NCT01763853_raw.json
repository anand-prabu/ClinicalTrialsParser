Indeed, relative or absolute hypovolemia is a common phenomenon\n      that the intensivist must recognize early and treat promptly. Fluid challenge may have\n      adverse side effects associated with fluid administration. The diffusion within the\n      interstitial space may favor edema formation and cause cardiac dysfunction by volume\n      overload. Edema formation is global and may specifically alter pulmonary alveolar epithelial\n      integrity, leading to enhanced alveolar edema and impaired gas exchange.\n\n      Currently, two types of fluids are frequently used, crystalloids and Hydroxyethyl starches.\n      Hydroxyethyl starches have the theoretical advantage of causing greater volume expansion.\n\n      We hypothesized that a fluid resuscitation therapy with hydroxyethyl starch generates less\n      pulmonary edema than a fluid resuscitation therapy with crystalloids.\n\n      The aim of our study is to compare alveolar fluid clearance, as a marker of alveolar edema\n      fluid resorption, in 2 groups of patients: those treated with hydroxyethyl starch and those\n      treated with crystalloid."
