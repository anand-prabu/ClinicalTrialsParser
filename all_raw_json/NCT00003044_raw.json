Evaluate the safety and efficacy of cisplatin-epinephrine injectable gel\n      (Intradose MPI-5010) in patients with unresectable primary hepatocellular carcinoma.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is an open label, two stage, multicenter study. Patients receive intratumoral\n      treatment with ciplatin-epinephrine (MPI-5010) once weekly, for up to four treatments within\n      a six week period, followed by an evaluation two weeks after last treatment. Immediately\n      after the first course, an optional second course of treatment may be undertaken at the\n      discretion of the investigator. Patients with a complete response, partial response, and/or\n      an increase in necrosis of at least 30% of total treated tumor volume will be followed\n      monthly for up to 6 months. At the completion of 6 months follow up or following\n      documentation of disease progression or development of new tumors, patients are monitored\n      for survival in an extended follow up period. All nonresponders at the last 2 week\n      posttreatment evaluation are entered in the extended follow up and monitored monthly for\n      survival.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Up to 55 patients will be accrued for this study."
