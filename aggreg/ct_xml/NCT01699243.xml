  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Machine learning techniques and algorithms originally developed for use in the field of
      robotics can be applied to continuous, noninvasive physiological waveform data to discover
      hidden, hemodynamic relationships.  Newly developed algorithms can, in real-time: 1) predict
      cardiovascular collapse well ahead of any clinically significant changes in standard vital
      signs, 2) monitor and estimate fluid resuscitation needs, 3) estimate acute blood loss
      volume, and 4) estimate intracranial pressure. We hypothesize that these same methods can be
      used to predict functional hypovolemia during regional anesthesia for labor or fetal
      intervention.

      Specific aims:

        1. Collect noninvasive physiological waveform data from patients undergoing regional
           anesthesia for labor or fetal intervention at the University of Colorado Hospital and
           Children's Hospital Colorado.

        2. Combine the physiological data from patient monitors with clinical and demographic
           data, including maternal problem list, medications, volume infused, use of
           vasopressors, arterial and venous pressures, fetal heart rate, fetal umbilical artery
           Doppler velocimetry, maternal uterine artery Doppler waveform, fetal and neonatal
           outcomes etc. for use in developing mathematical model for early detection of maternal
           functional hypovolemia.

        3. Develop robust, real-time, computational models for:

             -  estimating maternal volume status prior to administration of epidural anesthesia

             -  estimating effective intravascular volume loss during maternal regional anesthesia

             -  predicting an optimal, individual specific requirement for IV resuscitation and/or
                need for vasopressor agents while providing adequate analgesia using regional
                techniques and optimizing the fetal outcomes

             -  identifying mothers susceptible to epidural induced hypotension
