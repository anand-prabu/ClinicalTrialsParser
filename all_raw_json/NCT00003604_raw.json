Measure the degree of\n      rebound lymphocytosis generated by this regimen in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is an open label study. Patients receive interleukin-2 IV over 15-30 minutes\n      on 3 consecutive days weekly for 6 weeks, followed by 2 weeks of rest. Patients receive 2\n      treatment courses, each 8 weeks in duration. Patients are followed every 6 months until\n      death.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued within 1 to 2 years."
