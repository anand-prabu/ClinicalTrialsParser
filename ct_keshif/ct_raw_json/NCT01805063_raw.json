            "textblock": "Firefighters are at increased risk of death from heart attacks when compared to other\n      emergencyy service professionals whose jobs involve similar components such as emergency\n      call-outs and shift work. In the largest analysis of cause of death amongst on-duty\n      firefighters, firefighter deaths were classified according to the duty performed during the\n      onset of symptoms or immediately prior to any sudden death. The majority of deaths due to a\n      cardiovascular cause (i.e. heart attack) occurred during fire suppression whilst this\n      activity represented a relatively small amount of a firefighters professional time. There\n      was also a risk of death associated with other duties such as emergency non-fire response\n      and physical exertion.\n\n      The investigators hypothesize that participation in active fire-fighting duties impairs\n      blood vessel function and increases blood clot formation when compared with\n      non-fire-fighting activities. In this study, healthy career firefighters will be assessed\n      after three periods of duty: fire-suppression, emergency response without fire suppression\n      and following a sedentary shift. The investigators will take blood samples to measure\n      platelet activity (platelets are the particles in blood that help blood clot) and will\n      examine how blood clots outside of the body. The investigators will then perform studies\n      placing small needles in the arm to assess blood vessel function following these duties. By\n      undertaking this comprehensive assessment of blood, blood vessel and heart function the\n      investigators hope to understand the mechanisms whereby the risk of a heart attack, fatal or\n      otherwise, is posed throughout these distinct duties that firefighters undertake on a daily\n      basis."
