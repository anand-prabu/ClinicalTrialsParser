            "textblock": "Rheumatoid and psoriatic arthritis patients benefit from anti-TNF-\u03b1 therapy, once it is\n      effective in reducing joint and skin manifestations in 60-70% of patients with inflammatory\n      articular joint and skin diseases. Thus, identifying the presence and amount of TNF-\u03b1 in the\n      joint or skin in these patients may help in guiding the course of treatment more\n      efficiently. The investigators research group has developed a novel approach to label\n      anti-TNF-\u03b1 with technetium-99m. Here the investigators compare the results obtained with\n      scintigraphy and MRI in rheumatoid and psoriatic arthritis. The 99mTc-anti-TNF-\u03b1\n      scintigraphy might recognize the molecule involved in the inflammatory process and provide\n      crucial information to help physicians taking decisions about the drugs to be used based on\n      biological evidence and which are cost-effective and appropriate for the treatment of\n      choice. It allows direct identification of the monoclonal antibody anti-TNF-\u03b1 in the\n      articular joints and skin while it also ensures that the drug has reached its therapeutic\n      target. It also allows correlation between the presence of the drug and clinical responses."
