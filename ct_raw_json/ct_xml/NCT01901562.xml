    <textblock>
      In this prospective clinical trial, patients who sign an approved informed consent for
      ductoscopy to assess etiology of Pathologic nipple discharge (PND) will be enrolled in the
      study. Consented patients who have been diagnosed with a solitary papilloma within the
      discharging duct will be recruited to have interventional ductoscopy.

      Patients who are identified ductoscopically with a solitary non-sessile papilloma will
      undergo an attempted ductoscopic papillomectomy (DP). Patients with ductoscopic findings
      other than single non-sessile papilloma will undergo standard ductoscopically guided
      microductectomy.  The investigators will investigate whether the ductoscopic basket can be
      used as a safe endoscopic extraction instrument without adverse events. Histopathological
      evaluation will be performed to confirm the ductoscopic diagnosis and to determine the
      existence of any malignant tissue.

    <textblock>
      Nipple discharge is the third most common breast related symptom for which women seek
      medical care, accounting for 37% of all breast complaints. Pathologic nipple discharge (PND)
      is defined as spontaneous or easily expressible single duct nipple discharge, which
      contributes to 5% of referrals to breast surgeons. Patients with PND represent a diagnostic
      and therapeutic challenge for the surgical clinician. The most frequent causes of PND in
      these cases are intraductal papilloma (IP) in 36% to 66%, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) in
      3% to 20% and other benign causes in up to 23%. The evaluation of women with PND usually
      involves radiological(mammography, ultrasound, ducto (galacto)graphy and cytological (nipple
      smear, ductal lavage) examinations; however, each of these procedures has found to have low
      sensitivity and specificity. A ductoscope is an instrument which allows visualization of
      abnormalities and polypoid lesions within the ductal system with access via the nipple
      orifice to aid in evaluation of PND. Moreover, it is currently being used to improve
      localization of lesions in patients with PND. Ductoscopically guided excision is an
      improvement over standard surgical approaches with terminal duct excision which removes a
      large volume of tissue with potential cosmetic deformity and for young women may make breast
      feeding not possible. Ductoscopy also allows retrieval of intraductal cells for diagnostic
      purposes using brush cytology.
