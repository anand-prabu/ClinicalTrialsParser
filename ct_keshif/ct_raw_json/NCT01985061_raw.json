This is the goal our prospective trial; we\n      aim to prospectively evaluate in a prospective multicenter trial the efficacy of different\n      conditioning regimens in patients with high-risk myeloid malignancies.\n\n      The study is a phase II trial randomizing patients between a prospective active control arm\n      (BX2) and two experimental arms (BX3 and BX4). A standard group was kept in this clinical\n      trial in order to avoid the limitations induced by the comparison with historical controls\n      in the context of continuously improving practice. Each experimental arm will be conducted\n      in parallel according to a standard phase II trial design.\n\n      In addition, this trial will associate four ancillary studies to the main clinical\n      objective: 1/ a prospective assessment of the quality of life of the patients over a period\n      of 2 years 2/ an analysis of the cost effectiveness of the procedure, assessed over a period\n      of 2 years 3/ an observational busulfan pharmacokinetic study 4/ a busulfan pharmacogenomic\n      study"
