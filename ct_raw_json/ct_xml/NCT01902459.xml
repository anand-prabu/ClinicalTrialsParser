      The objective of this study is to evaluate the clinical utility of EVARREST™ Fibrin Sealant
      Patch (Fibrin Pad) as an adjunct to hemostasis in soft tissue bleeding during
      intra-abdominal (stomach area), retroperitoneal (hip and stomach area), pelvic (hip area)
      and non-cardiac thoracic (chest area) surgery.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects ≥18 years of age, requiring an elective or urgent, open intra-abdominal,
             retroperitoneal, pelvic or non-cardiac thoracic surgical procedures;

          -  Subjects must be willing to participate in the study and provide written informed
             consent.

          -  Presence of an appropriate Target Bleeding Site as identified intra-operatively by
             the surgeon;

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with known intolerance to blood products or to one of the components of
             EVARREST™ or unwilling to receive blood products;

          -  Female subjects who are pregnant or nursing.

          -  TBS is from a large defect in an artery or vein where the injured vascular wall
             requires repair and maintenance of vessel patency or where there would be persistent
             exposure of EVARREST™ to blood flow and/or pressure during  absorption of the
             product;

          -  TBS with major arterial bleeding requiring suture or mechanical ligation;

          -  TBS within a contaminated or infected area of the body;

          -  Bleeding site is in, around, or in proximity to foramina in bone, or areas of bony
             confine;

          -  Subjects with any intra-operative findings identified by the surgeon that may
             preclude conduct of the study procedure;
