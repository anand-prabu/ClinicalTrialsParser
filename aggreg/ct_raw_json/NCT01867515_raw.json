The\n      proposed research compares the performance of normally-hearing and hearing-impaired\n      listeners on measures of speech understanding in the presence of different types of signal\n      distortion and speech understanding of signals with enhanced spectral dynamics. A\n      computational model based on the amount of potential information available in speech will be\n      used to quantify differences in speech intelligibility due to hearing status and stimulus\n      characteristics."
