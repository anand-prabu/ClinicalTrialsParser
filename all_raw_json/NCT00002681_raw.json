Interleukin-2 may stimulate\n      a person's white blood cells to kill leukemia or lymphoma cells. Combining these two\n      therapies may be an effective treatment for leukemia and lymphoma.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of monoclonal antibody therapy plus\n      interleukin-2 in treating patients who have leukemia or lymphoma."

Treatment\n      continues for up to 1 year in the absence of disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or\n      development of neutralizing antibodies.\n\n      Patients are followed weekly for 2 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 25 patients with Hodgkin's lymphoma and 14 each with AML and\n      CML will be accrued for this study."
