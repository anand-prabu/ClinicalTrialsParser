Patients are stratified according to tumor size and location as visualized by chest\n      radiography, CT scan, or positron-emission tomography scan (peripheral tumor (distal to the\n      subsegmental bronchi) no greater than 2 cm in diameter vs peripheral tumor greater than 2 cm\n      in diameter vs central tumor no greater than 2 cm in diameter vs central tumor greater than\n      2 cm in diameter). Patients are randomized to one of two arms.\n\n      Prior to dosing with sputum induction adjunct, all patients expectorate sputum\n      spontaneously.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive a single dose of INS316 by inhalation.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive a single dose of placebo (normal saline) by inhalation.\n\n      In both arms, patients expectorate sputum during dosing, immediately after dosing, and then\n      within 15, 30, and 60 minutes after dosing.\n\n      Patients are followed on day 1 after dosing, for up to 8 weeks until a diagnosis is made,\n      and then up to 3 months if diagnosis is malignant.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 800 patients (or until 600 confirmed diagnoses of\n      malignancy are made) will be accrued for this study."
