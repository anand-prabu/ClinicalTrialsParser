  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective multi-site study. Subjects with distal radius fractures will be
      enrolled. Subjects will be treated surgically with a Sonoma WRx™ device or managed
      non-operatively with a splint or cast. Subjects will be enrolled in each group according to
      physician's standard of care (either casting/splinting or surgery) for distal radius
      fractures. Subjects will be enrolled based on the study's inclusion/exclusion criteria with
      a final qualifying decision made by a group of three independent adjudicators. The final
      qualifying review should allow for similar patient groups within each arm of the study due
      to the variability that can arise in fracture classification. Review by the adjudicators
      should be completed within 1 week.

             intra-articular fracture

          -  Fracture classified as an AO/OTA A2, A3,  C1 or C2 with or without an ulnar styloid
             fracture

          -  Must be treated within the first 14 days of injury,

          -  Male or female greater than or equal to 65 years of age.

          -  Able to understand the requirements of the study, provide a written informed consent
             and comply with the study protocol

             disclosure of personal health information

          -  Fracture that can be treated closed with or without closed reduction

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Concomitant contralateral or ipsilateral upper extremity fractures

          -  Ipsilateral ulna (excluding styloid) fracture

          -  Open fracture

          -  Previous ipsilateral distal radius fracture in the 2 years prior to enrollment with
             deformity

          -  Unstable distal radioulnar joint after fracture fixation

          -  Fractures where the transverse fracture line is less than 10mm from the distal radius
             joint surface

          -  Artery or Nerve injury secondary to fracture

          -  History of alcoholism
