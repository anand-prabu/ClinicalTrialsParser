  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of Behavioral Activation and
      Supportive Therapy added to the standard acute psychiatric inpatient care. Therapy starts
      during inpatient care and can continue in an outpatient facility if the patients are
      discharged before 12 sessions has been completed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Psychiatric inpatient care is reserved for individuals with the most acute mental health
      problems. The period after discharge is associated with increased risk for relapse,
      non-adherence and suicide. Delivering high quality psychosocial interventions during and
      after acute psychiatric inpatient care is known to be a difficult challenge. This study will
      investigate the effectiveness of adding either Behavioral Activation or Supportive Therapy
      to the standard acute psychiatric inpatient care. Subjects with different psychiatric
      diagnoses and elevated depressive symptoms are assessed and randomized after admission.
      Therapists from the nearest outpatient facility initiate 12 sessions of Behavioral
      Activation or Supportive Therapy as soon as possible. The 12 sessions are delivered twice
      weekly at the inpatient unit or at the outpatient facility, depending on whether the patient
      is admitted or discharged. Treatment as usual interventions(medications, nursing etc.) are
      not manipulated in the study. The main assessment points are pre-, post, 6 months follow-up
      and 12 months follow-up. The main outcome measure and some process measures are also
      administered at session 3, 6 and 9.
