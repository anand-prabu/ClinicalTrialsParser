  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We are studying an investigational drug called intranasal oxytocin (Syntocinon®).
      Syntocinon® has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use in helping
      women breastfeed, but it has not been approved for use in children with ASD. However, there
      is previous research conducted that has indicated that after administration of oxytocin,
      adults with ASD demonstrated improvements in social cognition, and reduced repetitive
      behaviours and anxiety. There is also early research to suggest that children may also
      benefit in these areas. The purpose of this study is to test if oxytocin works to help
      children and adolescents with ASD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Extensive data has been accumulated to suggest that central release of oxytocin is important
      for social cognition and function, as well as likely involved in anxiety modulation and
      repetitive behaviors.  The Principal Investigator and Co-Principal Investigator of this
      study have previously documented: 1) an association between ASD and a single nuclear
      polymorphism of the oxytocin receptor gene, 2) ability to measure oxytocin levels in the
      blood by enzyme immunoassay and 3) preliminary data to support safety and efficacy of
      intranasal oxytocin in the treatment of social deficits and repetitive behaviors in adults
      with autism.  A medication treatment targeting the core deficits of ASD in childhood is
      highly valuable because it could influence the developmental trajectory and make further
      psychosocial interventions possible.  In this context, we propose a randomized placebo
      controlled trial of intranasal oxytocin in children and adolescents with ASD.
