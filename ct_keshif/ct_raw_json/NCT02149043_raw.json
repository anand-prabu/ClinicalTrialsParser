Diagnostic methods currently in use, clinical (endoscopy), imaging (CT, MR) or\n      laboratory (C - reactive protein, calprotectin) give an insight into disease activity, but\n      are possibly associated with significant discomfort for the patient and / or  increased risk\n      of irradiation  and potential allergic reactions on contrast agents. For that reason there\n      is a need for a noninvasive, biologically inert method for evaluation of disease activity in\n      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Thermography possesses most of these characteristics. The\n      aim of this study is to find potential link between pathological thermographic signs and\n      endoscopic findings, serum C reactive protein (CRP) and calprotectin in the stool of\n      patients with active and extensive ulcerative colitis."

In addition, patients with UC will receive colonoscopy\n      evaluations.\n\n      Expected scientific contribution: The results of this paper would give additional\n      contribution to existing tools for pursuing ulcerative colitis activity thus demonstrating\n      the potential of thermography as a complementary method to standard methods in assessing\n      disease activity. Establishing diagnostic criteria for this method would be a good addition\n      to present clinical practice."
