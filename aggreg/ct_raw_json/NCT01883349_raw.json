Several studies have shown that cognitive function improves\n      post-transplant, indicating that there may be some reversibility in the process. This study\n      will examine the correlation between cognitive impairment and structural brain changes\n      before and after renal transplantation. We will also study the correlation of cognitive\n      function with serum inflammatory markers before and after transplant."
