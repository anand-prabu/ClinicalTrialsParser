The INA catheter is used for locating\n      and ablating ventricular tachycardia that has failed standard radiofrequency ablation. This\n      approach is desirable because some people have ventricular tachycardia that originates deep\n      within the heart muscle where it is not abolished by ablation with standard catheters.\n\n      The investigators seek to determine whether the INA catheter can potentially help people who\n      have ventricular tachycardia that has failed standard radiofrequency ablation. The\n      investigators also want to determine if it is likely to be safe, without excessive side\n      effects."
