      Laser photocoagulation of the retina targeting the outer layers is an established therapy
      for proliferative retinopathy and macular edema from diabetic microangiopathy or retinal
      vein occlusion, centrals serous retinopathy, and extrafoveal subretinal neovascular
      membranes. However, collateral damage occurs and scotomas can result when using conventional
      lasers with pulse duration of 100ms and more. This is particularly relevant for laser
      treatments of the macula where the main therapeutic effect results from stimulation of the
      retinal pigment epithelium cells and photoreceptor damage is thought to be an unnecessary
      side effect. Recent experimental research with new laser devices using much shorter pulse
      duration has shown that photoreceptor damage can be greatly reduced and the retinal pigment
      epithelium selectively targeted, hence the term selective retinal pigment epithelium laser
      therapy (SRT).  Investigators hypothesize that SRT is equally effective as standard laser
      photocoagulation for macular disease but minimizes local visual field defects.

      In this study, patients with central serous retinopathy, macular edema from diabetic
      microangiopathy or branch vein occlusion, and non-exudative age-related macular degeneration
      will be treated with SRT. Patients will be assessed 1, 3 and 6 months after treatment.

      Background

      Laser photocoagulation of the retina targeting the outer layers is an established therapy
      for proliferative retinopathy and macular edema from diabetic microangiopathy or retinal
      vein occlusion, centrals serous retinopathy, and extrafoveal subretinal neovascular
      membranes. However, collateral damage occurs and scotomas can result when using conventional
      lasers with pulse duration of 100ms and more. This is particularly relevant for laser
      treatments of the macula where the main therapeutic effect results from stimulation of the
      retinal pigment epithelium cells and photoreceptor damage is thought to be an unnecessary
      side effect. Recent experimental research with new laser devices using much shorter pulse
      duration has shown that photoreceptor damage can be greatly reduced and the retinal pigment
      epithelium selectively targeted, hence the term selective retinal pigment epithelium laser
      therapy (SRT). In age-related macular degeneration, regression of drusen has been observed
      after laser treatment with convention laser or SRT. Investigators hypothesize that SRT is
      equally effective as standard laser photocoagulation for macular disease but minimizes local
      visual field defects.

      Objective

      To assess the efficacy of SRT in patients with central serous retinopathy, macular edema
      from diabetic microangiopathy or branch vein occlusion, and non-exudative age-related
      macular degeneration. Up to five patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy can
      optionally be treated with SRT too.

      Methods

      At baseline and during follow-up patients will receive a full ophthalmic examination
      including optical coherence tomography, fundus autofluorescence imaging, fluorescein
      angiography (FA), and visual acuity testing. SRT (SRT Vario Laser, Medizinisches
      Laserzentrum Lübeck GmbH, Germany) will be delivered under topical anesthesia. For titration
      of energy spots will first be applied outside the major arcades. Immediately thereafter FA
      will be performed for extrapolation of the laser dose, since the treatment is sub-threshold
      and laser spots will not be visible biomicroscopically. The patient will then be treated at
      the discretion of the ophthalmologist with up to 500 laser burns. One hour after the laser
      treatment FA will be repeated to confirm the treatment effect. Patients will be assessed 1,
      3 and 6 months after treatment. Pulse duration can be chosen between 200ns and 2μs. The
      maximum pulse energy will be 1mJ. 1-30 pulses will be applied for every laser burn at a
      frequency of 100Hz.
