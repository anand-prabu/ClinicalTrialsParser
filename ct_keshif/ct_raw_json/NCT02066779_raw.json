            "textblock": "If the subject decides to participate, they will follow the typical clinic visit schedule\n      for patients that have had DBS surgery. They will be expected to have several DBS\n      programming sessions to determine the best setting. These sessions will include completing\n      questionnaires and testing movement and coordination.\n\n      The investigators are comparing the 2 types of programming.  Subjects will be \"randomized\"\n      into one of the two study groups.  One group will have the DBS system programmed using\n      standard clinical care and one group will have the DBS system programmed using a iPAD\n      computerized system. Randomization means that one is put into a group by chance. It is like\n      flipping a coin.  Subjects will have an equal chance of being placed in either group.\n      Neither the subject nor the investigator can choose what group a subject will be in.\n\n      A subject's standard clinical care will not change unless they are in the group that is\n      randomized to use the iPAD computerized system to select the settings. Both groups will\n      follow the same schedule of office visits that all subjects with DBS follow.  For the group\n      which has their DBS programmed using the iPAD computerized system, the clinical decision\n      support tools will be used bedside during postoperative care.  These tools will not provide\n      the final DBS settings and investigators do not anticipate that this approach will obviate\n      the need for motor exams.  The clinical decision support system is meant to help programmers\n      choose good initial settings and then explore around those initial settings to optimize\n      patient care.\n\n      As part of usual patient care, some tests and questionnaires will be administered.\n      Investigators will use the results of those tests and questionnaires for this research\n      study.\n\n      The only difference between this study and routine clinical care at the UF Center for\n      Movement Disorders & Neurorestoration outpatient clinic is that a subject may be programmed\n      with the use of a computerized, iPad-based tool, and the time spent will be recorded in each\n      programming visit.  The only additional questionnaire patients will be asked to complete\n      beyond what is normally performed in our clinic is the multi-dimensional caregiver strain\n      index (MCSI)."
