Nevertheless, the markers used for the detection, such as a-feto protein,\n      asialoglycoprotein receptor or epithelial cell adhesion molecule, CD133 or CD90, are not\n      specific for HCC CTCs. In spite of these limitations, a timely determination of the\n      existence of CTCs will be beneficial for the monitoring of distant metastases, the\n      evaluation of therapeutic attempts, and the prediction of prognosis."
