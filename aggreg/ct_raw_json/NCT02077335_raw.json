Both procedures will be done in an identical manner.  The 2 procedures will be separated by an interval of 7-14 days   Treatments will  be done with interstitial catheters inserted transperineally with transrectal ultrasound guidance under sterile conditions.  Optimization of treatment plan will be done with Brachyvision software (Varian, Palo Alto CA) based on CT-scan imaging done post-implant.    Optimization parameters will be the following:\nProstate :\nV100 > 95%\nV150  30-35%\nV200 < 15%\nD90 > 90% (12,15Gy)\nBladder\n\u2022 V75 < 1cc\nRectum\n\u2022 V75 < 1cc\nUrethra\nV125 = 0cc D10 < 120%\nTreatments will be carried out with an Iridium-192 afterloader.
