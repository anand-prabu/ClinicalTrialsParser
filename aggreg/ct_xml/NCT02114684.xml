  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label randomized controlled clinical trial comparing two regimens for
      treatment of smear-positive pulmonary TB, among patients previously treated for TB. The
      primary objective is to determine if a moxifloxacin-containing regimen, substituting
      moxifloxacin for ethambutol, of 24 weeks duration is superior to a control regimen of 32
      weeks duration in improving treatment outcomes in patients with recurrent TB and shortens
      the duration of TB treatment.

                  than 3 times the upper limit of normal

               -  Serum total bilirubin level less than 2.5 times upper limit of normal

               -  Creatinine clearance (CrCl) level greater than 30 mls/min

               -  Platelet count of at least 50 x109cells/L

               -  Serum potassium greater than 3.0 mmol/L

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients on a Nevirapine (NVP)-containing ART regimen at screening

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding

          -  Received an antibiotic active against M. tuberculosis in the last 14 days (e.g.
             fluoroquinolones, macrolides, standard anti-tuberculosis drugs).

          -  Patients with known  M.  tuberculosis resistance to any of the study drugs at
             screening

          -  History of prolonged QT syndrome or current or planned therapy with quinidine,
             procainamide, amiodarone, sotalol, or ziprasidone during the intensive phase of

          -  Known allergies or intolerance to any of the study drugs.
