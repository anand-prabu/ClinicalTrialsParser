  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Persistent smoking after lung cancer has been the subject of medical, therapeutic and
      epidemiological publications for twenty years of research. Continued persistent smoking is
      all the more a problem for oncologists as there is evidence that smoking cessation, with
      lung cancer, gives therapeutic benefit. Quitting smoking can improve the response to
      treatments (chemotherapy, radiotherapy, surgery), quality of life and overall survival.
      However many patients refuse adhesion to tobacco cessation. Daily practice leads us to the
      hypothesis that adhesion differences aren't related to the denial of medical information,
      nor to resignation or to nicotine dependence. Patients who continue smoking seem to face a
      form of impossibility to wean. Cigarette seems to be felt as a part of their body in their
      narration and description of their body image.
