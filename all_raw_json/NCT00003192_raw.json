Determine the objective response rate of a 120 hour continuous infusion of\n      aminocamptothecin (9-AC) in chemotherapy naive patients with adenocarcinoma of the stomach\n      or gastroesophageal junction. II. Characterize the nature of the toxicity of 9-AC on this\n      schedule in this patient population. III. Determine the duration of response, time to\n      progression, and survival of this patient population. IV. Study the pharmacokinetics and\n      pharmacodynamics of 9-AC on this schedule in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is an open label, multicenter study. Patients receive intravenous\n      aminocamptothecin by continuous infusion over 120 hours on days 1-5 and 8-12 followed by 1\n      week of rest for a 3 week cycle. Therapy continues for a minimum of 6 weeks (2 full cycles)\n      unless there are unacceptable toxic effects or rapid disease progression. Dose escalation\n      may occur in patients who complete 3 cycles of therapy without unacceptable toxicity. All\n      patients will be followed for survival.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: This study will accrue 14-40 patients within 18 months."
