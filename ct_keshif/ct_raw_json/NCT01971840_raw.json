Our group has done so far two interventions based on\n      after-school programs of recreational physical activity to control obesity and other\n      cardiovascular risk factors in primary school children (8-to-11 years)in Cuenca, Spain.\n\n      The first edition, called MOVI, showed moderate effect in reducing adiposity and improving\n      the lipid profile, but did not significantly improve overall cardiometabolic risk, mainly\n      because of did not reduce blood insulin levels. A second edition (MOVI-2), increased\n      duration and intensity of the sessions and was more focused on increased muscle strength.\n      Preliminary analysis also show a decrease in body fat, a reduction of global cardiometabolic\n      because of decreased insulin levels.\n\n      Our project integrates a multidimensional intervention to promote physical activity, with a\n      mixed design (cross-over randomized trial, and a qualitative study) and consist of two\n      sub-projects that share the same study population: \"Effectiveness of an intervention of\n      physical activity promotion in schoolchildren on preventing obesity during the adiposity\n      rebound period: a cross-over randomized cluster trial\" and \"Effectiveness of physical\n      activity intervention to prevent obesity and improve academic performance in children with\n      and without ADHD risk\".\n\n      The two interventions are based on a cross-over randomized trial aimed to test the\n      effectiveness of an intervention to promote physical activity in the school environment\n      (MOVI-KIDS) during two-years in 22 schools (20 public and two private schools) in the\n      provinces of Cuenca and Ciudad Real, Spain.\n\n      This principal subproject consisted of a mixed study including both the trial cited above\n      and a nested qualitative study aimed to identify barriers and facilitators to physical\n      activity in children in the school environment (social and family factors, urban planning,\n      etc.), and produce knowledge about the perceptions of children, parents and teachers on how\n      you can improve conditions of physical and social environment to facilitate physical\n      activity.\n\n      The hypotheses of this third edition are that a multidimensional intervention promoting\n      physical activity in children at the adiposity rebound period (4-7 years),in the school\n      environment (MOVI-KIDS), lasting two-years, will to:\n\n        1. Reduce the body fat percentage in the intervention group versus the control group in\n           2%.\n\n        2. Improve the several components of fitness: aerobic capacity, strength, speed and\n           agility.\n\n        3. Reduce the carotid intima-media thickness and\n\n        4. Reduce fat, increase fat free mass, and reduce sedentary behavior."
