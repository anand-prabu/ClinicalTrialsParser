  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Loss and recovery of consciousness during  propofol anesthesia seem to be mediated by
      different mechanisms beyond the actual effect-site concentration of anesthetic drug. This
      eventual difference between dose response curves for loss of consciousness (LOC) and for
      recovery of consciousness (ROC) beyond hysteresis has received the name of neuronal inertia.
      We performed a volunteer-study comparing  LOC and ROC curves during a slow, steady-sate,
      stepped target controlled infusion of Propofol. Our hypothesis is that, at steady-state
      conditions between plasma an effect-site concentration, there is still going to exist a
      difference between LOC and ROC, demonstrating the existence of neuronal inertia.

    <description>determination of plasma concentration of PROPOFOL at the time of Loss of Consciousness and the time of recovery of consciousness during the 7-minute step infusion.
Provided it is a slow increasing infusion we assume a pseudo-equilibrium state between plasma and effect site.
the existence of a difference between these two values will support the hypothesis of neuronal inertia</description>

    <time_frame>2 hours (during slow increasing TCI (Target controlled Infusion) of PROPOFOL</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>we measured the BISPECTRAL INDEX all through the protocol: from previous to start the infusion until 7 minutes after recovery of consciousness. values of BIS at LOC and ROC will be compared.
a potential difference found between those two values supports the theory thas LOC and ROC reflects different neuronal processes Other clinically relevant endpoints (loss of palpebral reflex, onset of amnesia) will be registered in order to build the pharmacodynamic loop.</description>

    <description>plasma concentration of PROPOFOL (mcg/ml) at other clinically relevant endpoints (amnesia onset, loss of palpebral reflex, etc...) will be determined in order to build a pharmacodynamic curve,</description>

    <description>plasma concentration of PROPOFOL (mcg/ml) from venous blood samples will be determinated every 7 minutes, that means at the end of each TCI step. assuming the 7-minute step gave enough time to reach a pseudo-equilibrium state, we consider the results comparable to effect site concentration.</description>

    <description>to compare plasma (and effect site) Propofol concentration predicted by the model with measured values thus evaluating model´s performance. Median performance error (MDPE) and median absolute performance error (MDAPE), divergence and other often reported parameters will be determinated.</description>

    <description>spectral analisis of 32-channel EEG during infusion. a specified time-frame around those two events (i.e.: 14 minutes) will be reconstructed in images and analyzed. cortical areas with enhanced activity and how do this activity changes during loss of consciousness and the recovery of it will be evaluated with a mathematical model in order two determine wether those events correspond with two different processes instead of a bidirectional single one.</description>

    <description>(healthy volunteers, non invasive monitoring and O2 supply via nasal cannula) Target controlled infusion of propofol using Schnider´s pharmacokinetic parameters in a slow, stepped fashion. beginning at Cp 0.5 mcg/ml and increasing in 0.5 mcg/ml every 7 minutes until LOC occurred, then a prolonged step of 14 minutes (2 samples), increase 2 steps further and then decrease in 0.5 mcg/ml steps until ROC and a 7 minute registry after ROC.
Blood sampling for propofol plasma level every 7 minutes (at the end of each step, allowing for pseudo-equilibrium condition.
