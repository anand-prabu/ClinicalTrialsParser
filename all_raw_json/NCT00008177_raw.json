            "textblock": "Giving chemotherapy, such as fludarabine phosphate, and total-body irradiation before a\n      donor peripheral blood stem cell transplant helps stop the growth of cancer or abnormal\n      cells. Also, radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies, such as iodine I 131 monoclonal antibody\n      BC8, can find cancer cells and carry cancer-killing substances to them without harming\n      normal cells. When the healthy stem cells from a donor are infused into the patient they may\n      help the patient's bone marrow make stem cells, red blood cells, white blood cells, and\n      platelets. Sometimes the transplanted cells from a donor can also make an immune response\n      against the body's normal cells. Giving radiolabeled monoclonal antibody therapy together\n      with fludarabine phosphate and total-body irradiation before the transplant together with\n      cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil after the transplant may stop this from happening.\n      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of iodine I 131 monoclonal\n      antibody BC8 when given together with fludarabine phosphate and low-dose total-body\n      irradiation followed by donor stem cell transplantation and immunosuppression therapy in\n      treating older patients with advanced acute myeloid leukemia, high-risk myelodysplastic\n      syndrome, or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia"
