Nicotine dependence may prolong the exposure to these toxic substances. The\n      Central Nervous System (CNS) is consisted by a large amount of Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids\n      (PUFAS) from omega-3 serie. Omega-3 takes part in several actions, including the modulation\n      of dopaminergic neurotransmission. In its deficiency is detected a hypofunctioning of the\n      mesolimbic and mesocortical pathway, related to the reward system, involved on the context\n      of nicotine dependence.

Objective: Investigate a possible\n      association between increased serum levels of omega-3 and the reduction in nicotine\n      dependence. Material and Methods: In the clinical study, placebo controlled, double-blind,\n      parallel, randomized, will be administered to 60 volunteers: placebo or fish oil for 90\n      days. Psychometric assessments will be carried out, measurements of serum levels of PUFAS,\n      levels of carbon monoxide (CO) and cotinine in plasma will be done for monitoring the\n      clinical course. Data Analysis: Repeated measures (ANOVA) for the dependent variables\n      (dependency, anxiety, depression, motivation, compulsion, dosage of PUFAS, exhaled CO and\n      cotinine) and independent (groups and time) to check for significant differences. If so, a\n      second ANOVA with covariates will be conducted. Significance is p <0.05 in all analyzes."
