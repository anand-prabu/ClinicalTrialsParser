Respiratory failure is a major cause  for reintubation which\n      increase severity of illness, this is an independent risk factor for nosocomial pneumonia,\n      increased hospital stay and mortality. Currently, respiratory physiotherapy  includes,\n      manual expiration assist often associated with nasotracheal aspiration. Despite of this\n      care, respiratory failure occur in 30% of patients within 48  after planned extubation. MI-E\n      has been evaluated for neuromuscular disease patient, and increase peak cough flow and the\n      airway clearance. So the beneficials effects of MI-E should be confirmed in a trial in this\n      specific population.\n\n      We planned to conduct a study evaluating the efficacy of MI-E in the prevention of\n      extubation failure and mortality in these patients. If no signs of respiratory failure\n      appeared after 120 min of a spontaneous breathing trial, patients will be extubated and\n      randomly allocated after extubation to MI-E group or control group. The clinical follow-up\n      will be as follow: the incidence of extubation failure, the reintubation, the ICU or 28-day\n      survival,90-day survival, ICU  length of stay."
