            "textblock": "Introduction\n\n      Despite maintaining adequate mean arterial pressure and central venous oxygen saturation,\n      the mortality is still high in severe sepsis and septic shock. Previous studies have\n      demonstrated that derangements in microvascular flow play a role in sepsis-induced multiple\n      organ dysfunction and death. Because of the clinical significance of microcirculatory\n      dysfunction in severe sepsis and septic shock, recent advances in image technology have been\n      used to investigate microcirculation. A sidestream dark-field (SDF) video microscope has\n      been developed to visualize the microcirculation, but its measurement of microvascular blood\n      flow classification is semi-quantitative. Previous studies have shown that a full-field\n      laser perfusion imager can quantitatively measure the change of microcirculatory blood flow\n      intensity. For clinical studies, sublingual microcirculation is most easily investigated\n      using a SDF video microscope.\n\n      Because lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or endotoxin is a specific ligand for Toll-like receptor 4\n      (TLR4), it can induce the following reactions including excessive immune and inflammatory\n      responses, oxidative stress , capillary leakage, endothelial damage, impaired arteriolar and\n      venular vasoregulation, and activation of the coagulation cascade. Subsequently, these\n      reactions can lead to microcirculatory dysfunction. Recently, a TLR4 antagonist, eritoran\n      tetrasodium (E5564), has been reported to inhibit LPS response without TLR4 agonistic\n      activity in animals as well as in humans, but it fails to reduce mortality of severe sepsis\n      and septic shock. Polymyxin B adsorber hemoperfusion (PMX) have been proved to reduce\n      mortality of severe sepsis and septic shock.Since 1994 to 2007, more than 60,000 patients\n      have received this treatment. In a systematic review, the results show that PMX therapy was\n      associated with significantly lower mortality risk (risk ratio, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.43 to\n      0.65).21 In a prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled trial (Early Use of Polymyxin\n      B Hemoperfusion in Abdominal Sepsis [EUPHAS]), the results show that SOFA scores improved in\n      the polymyxin B group but not in the conventional therapy group (change in SOFA, \u22123.4 vs\n      \u22120.1; P =0.001), and 28-day mortality was 32% in the polymyxin B group and 53% in the\n      conventional therapy group (unadjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.43; 95% confidence interval\n      [CI], 0.20-0.94; adjusted HR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.16-0.80). Iba et al. have revealed that\n      polymyxin B hemoperfusion can maintain better microcirculation and survival in a septic rat\n      model.\n\n      The investigators hypothesize that polymyxin B hemoperfusion can decrease blood endotoxin\n      level and reduce endotoxin-related microcirculatory dysfunction. The purpose of this\n      prospective randomized controlled open study is to investigate the effect of polymyxin B\n      hemoperfusion on the sublingual microcirculation in patient with clear or suspected severe\n      sepsis and septic shock by gram-negative bacteria. The serum level of endotoxin, mean\n      arterial pressure, dose of vasopressors and inotropics, SOFA score, PaO2/FiO2 ratio, and\n      28-day mortality will be investigated.\n\n      Methods\n\n      This protocol was reviewed by the National Taiwan University Hospital Research Ethic\n      Committee(201208067RIB). Patients who meet the inclusion criteria and do not present any of\n      the exclusion criteria will be randomly assigned to one of the two groups (the control group\n      the PMX-HP group). In the control group, patients will receive standard treatment for sepsis\n      according to the practice guidelines. In the PMX-HP group, patients will receive standard\n      treatment for sepsis and polymyxin B hemoperfusion.\n\n      The hemoperfusion will be performed in the intensive care units within 24h after diagnosis\n      of severe sepsis or septic shock. The 1st PMX-HP (day 0) will run for 2 hours. The 2nd\n      PMX-HP must be performed within 24 to 36 hours after the end of the 1st treatment, ideally\n      24 hours.\n\n      The SDF video microscope (MicroScan, Microvision Medical) will be used to investigate total\n      small vessel (less than 20 \u03bcm) density (TSVD), microvascular blood flow classification of\n      each small vessel, perfused small vessel density (PSVD), microvascular flow index (MFI), and\n      heterogeneity index (HI) of sublingual microcirculation. This device illuminates the tissues\n      with polarized green light and measures the reflected light from the tissue surface. Both\n      superficial capillaries and venules can be visualized because the scattered green light is\n      absorbed by haemoglobin of red blood cells which are contained in these vessels. At each\n      time point, five continuous image sequences (20 seconds) will be digitally stored, and data\n      of the best three images (at least, if possible five) will be averaged for statistical\n      calculation. The images will be analysed afterwards with automated analysis software (AVA\n      3.0, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). Total\n      small vessel density is automatically calculated by the software. A semi-quantitative method\n      is used to classify the microvascular blood flow of each small vessel as follows: (0) absent\n      (no flow or filled with microthrombosis), (1) intermittent flow (absence of flow for at\n      least 50% of the time), (2) sluggish flow, and (3) continuous flow. (Figure 1) Small vessels\n      with blood flow classification of (2) and (3) are considered as perfused small vessels, and\n      the perfused small vessel density are automatically calculated. To calculate MFI score, the\n      image is divided into four quadrants, and the same ordinal scale (0 to 3) is used to assess\n      blood flow in each quadrant. The MFI score represents the averaged values of the four\n      quadrants. The heterogeneity index is calculated as the highest MFI minus the lowest MFI\n      divided by the mean MFI across the best three to five images at certain time point.\n\n      Limulus Amebocyte Lysate (LAL) test will be used to detect and quantify serum level of\n      endotoxin. The critical component of the LAL reagents used in endotoxin tests is derived\n      from blood cells (amebocytes) of the horseshoe crab, Limulus polyphemus. It contains the\n      proteins of the blood clotting mechanism, which is triggered by endotoxins. LAL reagents are\n      primarily used to test for endotoxins in injectable pharmaceuticals, biological products,\n      and medical devices. They are also used in renal dialysis centers and a wide range of other\n      applications. LAL tests are described in the Bacterial Endotoxins Test chapter in the United\n      States Pharmacopeia (Chapter 85) and in the equivalent chapters in the European\n      Pharmacopoeia (Chapter 2.6.14) and the Japanese Pharmacopoeia (Part I, General Tests, No.\n      6). The investigators will adopt the chromogenic method as purchased from the Associates of\n      Cape Cod Inc. (ACC). The LAL reagent is formulated with a synthetic substrate which gives a\n      yellow color when acted upon by endotoxin activated enzyme. The test is read at 405 nm,\n      usually in a microplate reader. The maximum sensitivity is 0.005 EU/mL.\n\n      Safety\n\n      The blood pressure, body temperature, BUN, creatinine, ALT, AST, bilirubin (total/direct),\n      lactate, sodium, potassium, and complete cell count will be monitored during the experiment.\n      Adverse effects of polymyxin B hemoperfusion (bleeding, nephrotoxicity, neurotoxicity\n      [agitation, weakness, drowsy, ataxia, numbness, blurred vision, and paresthesia],\n      thrombocytopenia, and altered coagulation.) will be monitored.\n\n      Statistics\n\n      According to our previous study, the total small vessel density of the patients in the\n      control group was 20.0 mm/mm2, 20 patients per group can detect a 12 % increase in total\n      small vessel density of the patients in the PMX-HP group with an \u03b1 level of 0.05 and \u03b2 level\n      of 0.8.\n\n      Data will be analysed using statistical software (SPSS 20; IBM SPSS, Chicago, IL). Means at\n      certain time point between the two groups are compared using t test. Means from serial\n      examinations between the two groups are compared using repeated measurement analysis of\n      variance (with the factors of time and group) followed by Tukey or Dunnett's T3 multiple\n      comparison tests. Data of MFI are expressed as median (interquartile range) and compared\n      using the Mann-Whitney analysis following with adjustment for multiple comparisons. A P\n      value < 0.05 is considered to indicate a significant result."
