  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to ﬁnd out whether treatment to prevent kidney rejection
      with belatacept in presence of Thymoglobulin induction and withdrawal of steroids will
      result in less delayed graft function or &quot;sleepy kidney&quot; after transplant than that seen in
      patients who get tacrolimus as their main drug to prevent rejection instead of belatacept.
      The investigators will also look at whether patients who get belatacept have the same,
      lesser or more problems that those who get tacrolimus.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      New York Presbyterian Hospital-Columbia University Medical Center (NYPH-CUMC) performs
      nearly 250 renal transplants annually; of these approximately half are recipients of a
      variety of deceased donor kidneys, usually with cold ischemia time (CIT) &gt;24 hours leading
      to an approximate incidence of delayed graft function (DGF) of 50%. The main focus of this
      study will be to determine whether initial immunosuppression with belatacept with
      Thymoglobulin induction will result in lower incidence and/or more rapid disappearance of
      DGF than that observed in patients who receive tacrolimus based immunosuppression. NGAL
      determinations will bne made in the first months after transplantation to correlate with
      clinical DGF.

    <description>To assess whether treatment with Thymoglobulin induction and belatacept based maintenance immunosuppression would reduce delayed graft function (DGF) rates among recipients of deceased donor renal transplants as measured by clinical findings and NGAL marker, as specified below and defined by others. This will be compared to the incidence of DGF in patients treated with a Tacrolimus based regimen.
Patients who require hemodialysis in the first 7 days after transplantation and/or patients whose serum creatinine decreases &lt;10% during 3 consecutive days after the transplant will be considered to have DGF in the absence of other confounding factors such as obstruction or infection. NGAL will be used as a verification marker of DGF.</description>

    <description>Belatacept 10 mg/kg will be administered in the operating room approximately 1 hour prior to kidney allograft reperfusion (Day 0). It will then be administered at 10 mg/kg on the following post-transplantation days: Day 5, 14, 30, 56, and 84. After that it will be given every four weeks at a dose of 5mg/kg. Patient will receive induction with rATG to a cumulative target dose of 6mg/kg.</description>
