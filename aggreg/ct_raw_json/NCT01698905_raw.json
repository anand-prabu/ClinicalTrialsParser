For female patients\n                  on the study, study participation assumes the vasectomized male partner is the\n                  sole partner for that patient or b. A combination of any two of the following\n                  (i+ii or i+iii or ii+iii): i) Barrier methods of contraception: condom or\n                  occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal\n                  foam/gel/film/cream/ vaginal suppository ii) Use of oral, injected or implanted\n                  hormonal methods of contraception or other forms of hormonal contraception that\n                  have comparable efficacy (failure rate <1%), for example hormone vaginal ring or\n                  transdermal hormone contraception iii) Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD)\n                  or intrauterine system (IUS)"
