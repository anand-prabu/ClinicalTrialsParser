  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart Failure with preserved Ejection Fraction (HFPEF) accounts for 40-50% of all heart
      failure patients with a frequency of hospital admissions for acute decompensation and short
      and long term mortality similar to patients with heart failure with reduced ejection
      fraction (HFREF). Patients with HFPEF are often preload dependent and despite admission to
      the hospital for acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF), are typically difficult to
      diurese due to the development of acute kidney injury. No studies have been performed
      evaluating treatment strategies for these patients.  We hypothesize that changing the method
      of diuresis and/or the addition of low-dose dopamine for the treatment of ADHF in patients
      with HFPEF will reduce renal injury, resulting in a shorter length of stay, and decrease
      hospital readmissions over the ensuing year.  This trial will randomize patients to either
      bolus or continuous infusion furosemide and then to either dopamine or no dopamine.  The
      primary endpoint will be renal function at 72 hours as measured by change in GFR.  Secondary
      endpoints for readmission, functional capacity, quality of life, and amount of diuresis will
      also be collected.
