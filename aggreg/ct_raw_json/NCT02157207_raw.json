            "textblock": "The overall goal of this application is to investigate the effect of aging on how acute\n      antioxidant supplementation affects decrements in arterial function observed in African\n      Americans (AA). Additionally, this application will facilitate the applicant's emergence as\n      an independent investigator in integrative clinical physiology. Oxidative stress (OS),\n      contributes to hypertension, diabetes, heart failure, atherosclerosis, sepsis and aging.\n      Increased OS leads to the development of endothelial dysfunction and subsequent  development\n      of cardiovascular disease through the inactivation of nitric oxide (NO) by superoxide (O2)\n      and other free radicals. African Americans (AA) have increased OS and inflammation in vivo\n      and in vitro, and have a lower serum concentration of most antioxidants. Endothelial cells\n      of AAs have steady state NO/ O2/ONOO- balance that is close to redox state, which is a\n      characteristic of endothelium impaired function disorders. Endothelium-derived NO is a\n      vasodilator and inhibits monocyte adhesion and platelet activity and therefore is important\n      in the maintenance of vascular homeostasis. These specific differences in OS could be a\n      contributing mechanism to the high prevalence of cardiovascular disease, especially\n      hypertension and heart failure, observed in AA.  Aging causes increases in OS, endothelial\n      dysfunction, and decreased arterial compliance, thus increasing the risk of cardiovascular\n      disease. Acute supra-physiological dosages of antioxidants have been shown to transiently\n      restore endothelial function in older adults and patients with coronary artery disease and\n      hypertension by scavenging free radicals.However, it is unknown if acute antioxidant\n      supplementation can diminish differences in vascular function between AA  and Caucasians\n      (CA). It is also unknown if acute antioxidant supplementation with  known efficacy will\n      differentially affect blood flow in AA vs CA during exercise."
