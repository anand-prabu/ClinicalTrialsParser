Formerly, the investigators planned the study\n      to decide more safety adjuvant protocol (recommend dose: RD) for Gemcitabine or S-1 after\n      hemihepatectomy using CRM (continual reassessment method) analysis and decided the recommend\n      doses. Note: In the former study, the investigators decided that tolerable ratio of DLT\n      would be less than 10%.\n\n      Herein, the investigators planned the study to evaluate efficacy (recurrent free survival as\n      primary outcome, and overall-survival as secondary outcome) and safety (as secondary\n      outcome) in our recommended protocols, and to compare the efficacy as randomized control\n      trial."
