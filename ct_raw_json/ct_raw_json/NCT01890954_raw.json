The CTR system is comprised of two algorithmic layers:\n      (i) A Safety Supervision Module (SSM) which contains a predictive insulin request dampener\n      (or brakes); (ii) a Range Correction Module (RCM), consisting in (a) a Hyperglycemia\n      Mitigation System, and (b) Insulin on Board controller. Both modules will receive continuous\n      glucose monitoring (CGM) and historical insulin delivery data. The SSM will monitor the\n      safety of the subject's continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion pump (CSII) to prevent\n      hypoglycemia. The RCM will be responsible for optimizing blood glucose (BG) control and\n      mitigating postprandial hyperglycemic excursions through a mix of increased basal rate and,\n      potentially, isolated insulin boluses. To run CTR, we will use our wearable artificial\n      pancreas platform, known as DiAs (Diabetes Assistant) which consists of a smart phone\n      running CTR and connected to standard insulin delivery and CGM devices."
