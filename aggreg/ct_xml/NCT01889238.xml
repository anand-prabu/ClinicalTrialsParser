  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if enzalutamide is safe and effective in the
      treatment of patients with advanced breast cancer that express the androgen receptor but do
      not express the estrogen or progesterone receptor and are not Her2 amplified.
