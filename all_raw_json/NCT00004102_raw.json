Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.\n      Leucovorin may increase the effectiveness of fluorouracil by making tumor cells more\n      sensitive to the drug.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy consisting of\n      oxaliplatin, fluorouracil, and leucovorin in treating patients who have colorectal cancer."

Evaluate the quantitative and qualitative toxicities of oxaliplatin combined\n      with fluorouracil and leucovorin calcium in patients with advanced adenocarcinoma of the\n      colon or rectum.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients receive leucovorin calcium IV over 10-20 minutes followed within 10\n      minutes by fluorouracil IV bolus on days 1, 8, 15, 29, 36, and 43. Patients receive\n      oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours prior to leucovorin calcium and fluorouracil on days 1, 15, 29,\n      and 43. Treatment repeats every 8 weeks for 3 courses in the absence of disease progression\n      or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with stable or responding disease may receive additional\n      courses upon approval by the sponsor. Patients are followed at 30 days.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-35 patients will be accrued for this study."
