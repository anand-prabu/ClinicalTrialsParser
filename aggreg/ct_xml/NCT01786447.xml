  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if specific brain injury biomarkers have utility
      as blood-based traumatic brain injury (TBI) diagnostic and monitoring tools. This will be
      accomplished by examining the relationships between potential serum-based TBI biomarkers and
      clinical measures of injury severity, occurrence of complications, and outcome, in subjects
      with mild or moderate TBI as well as in orthopedic control subjects.
