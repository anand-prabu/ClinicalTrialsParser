  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prospective, two-arm, randomized study of the effectiveness of the BTL-9000 LLLT in
      achieving 3 cm or greater average waist circumferential reduction in LLLT group of subjects
      relative to the base line and 1 cm or greater reduction relative to the average waist
      circumferential reduction of the Placebo group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prospective, randomized, blinded, two-arms study of waist circumferential reduction
      following 5 once-a-week treatments. One arm is the LLLT group of 25 subjects who are treated
      with the BTL-9000 LLLT and the other arm is the Placebo group of 15 subjects treated with
      the sham device. The objective of the study is to demonstrate the effectiveness of the
      BTL-9000 LLLT treatment in achieving average post-treatment waist circumferential reduction
      of 3 cm or greater across the waistline relative to the baseline assessment and of 1 cm or
      greater than the average waist circumferential reduction of the Placebo group.

    <description>The subjects in the LLLT group whose average post-treatment waist circumference shows reduction of 3 cm or greater across the waistline relative to the base line assessment and their average waist circumferential reduction is 1 cm or greater than the average circumferential reduction of Placebo group are considered to meet the study primary outcome success criteria.</description>
