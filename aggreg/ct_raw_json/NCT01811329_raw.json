The four shakes\n      are: high dairy fat, high dairy fat + MFGM, high palm fat, high palm fat + MFGM.\n\n      Eligible participants will arrive to the Western Human Nutrition Research Center (WHNRC) at\n      the University of California (UC) Davis campus on the morning of each test day after a\n      10-12-hr overnight fast. Upon arrival participants will fill out a questionnaire about their\n      dietary and medication intakes and physical activity for the past 72 hours to ensure\n      compliance. Compliant participants' weight and blood pressure will be measured and a fasting\n      blood draw will be taken before participants consume their test meal. Participants will only\n      consume this test meal and water freely for the duration of the test day. Blood will be\n      drawn serially at 1, 3 and 6 hours postprandially. Participants will be tested on the\n      additional three arms on three different spaced apart by two weeks.\n\n      On the third or fourth test day, participants' body composition and bone mineral density\n      will be measured by dual x-ray absorptiometry."
