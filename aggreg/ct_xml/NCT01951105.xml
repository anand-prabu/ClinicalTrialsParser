  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to determine if early treatment with Carbidopa/Levodopa and Naproxen in
      individuals with sub-acute back pain (SBP) is associated with changes in blocking transition
      to chronic back pain (CBP).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The transition from acute low back pain to chronic low back pain has been shown to be a
      result of changes in brain circuitry. Learning mechanisms give rise to the transition from
      acute to chronic pain and render the pain to become more emotional. The aim of this study is
      to further explore the idea that persistent pain, following an inciting injury, leads to an
      aversive learning signal that reorganizes the brain into a chronic pain state. We
      hypothesize that blocking the emotional/motivational learning response triggered by
      peripheral nerve injury in a critical time window will decrease the probability of
      transition to chronic pain. The primary hypothesis to be tested in the study is that early
      treatment with Carbidopa/Levodopa and Naproxen in individuals with sub-acute back pain (SBP)
      should decrease related reorganization and block transition to chronic back pain (CBP). This
      will be done through a 6 month, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, three-arm,
      parallel-group trial of the pharmacological treatment Carbidopa/Levodopa for individuals (N
      = 200) with sub-acute back pain (SBP). A baseline MRI scan will be used to determine each
      subject's pain type and group assignment. Individuals with recovering sub-acute back pain
      will be observed over 6 months. Individuals with a persisting sub-acute back pain will be
      randomized to receive either 12 weeks of Carbidopa/Levodopa plus naproxen or placebo plus
      naproxen. The main outcome measurements will be the results of MRI scans at the baseline and
      final visit, assessment of back pain by the VAS pain scale, as well as pain assessment
      through self-reported questionnaires.
