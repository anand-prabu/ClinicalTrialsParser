The collaboration with St. Francis Community Hospital and input from the Kasarani\n      community will increase the breadth, reach, and impact of this HIV prevention intervention\n      in Kenya."

            "textblock": "In 2010, HIV/AIDS accounted for up to 29% of all deaths and 24% of all disabilities in\n      Kenya. There is a particular need to concentrate HIV education, testing, and linkage-to-care\n      efforts among high-risk adolescents; by age 18, 47% of women and 58% of men have had sexual\n      intercourse. Only one in four young Kenyans used condoms the first time they had sex, and\n      only half of 15-24 year olds had comprehensive HIV knowledge. The goal of this intervention,\n      Project TEACH-Kenya, is to adapt two proven HIV interventions, Project BRIEF and STEP, to an\n      urban setting in the Kasarani District of the Nairobi Province, Kenya. According to the US\n      President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) Five-Year Strategy, a successful\n      prevention program brings together a combination of evaluated, tailored interventions, to\n      stem the spread of HIV infection among high-risk populations. This synergistic model,\n      referred to as combination prevention, serves as the basis for adapting the current\n      intervention encompassing HIV testing and counseling, risk behavior reduction programs, and\n      linkage to care and ART initiation to the Kenyan context. Project TEACH-Kenya will develop\n      tailored, theory-based educational videos, linkage procedures, and a tailored prevention\n      program for adolescents 13-18 years old and pilot and test the intervention at St. Francis\n      Community Hospital, a high volume community-based hospital in Kasarani. The majority of\n      adolescents that access St. Francis's services are orphan and vulnerable children affected\n      by HIV/AIDS (OVC-HIV) who are disproportionately poor and malnourished and are at increased\n      risk for acquiring HIV, stressing the need for this intervention. The outcome of this\n      project will be a feasible, evidence-based, cost- and time-effective program to improve HIV\n      education and increase testing and linkage-to-care rates among adolescents in Kenya."
