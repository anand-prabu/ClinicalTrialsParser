The study consists of 3 phases, screening phase (21 days prior to\n      administration of study medication), treatment phase, and a follow up phase. In the\n      treatment phase, participants will receive 2 treatments, ie, Treatment A: single oral dose\n      of simeprevir (TMC435) 50 mg followed 5 hours later by a single 10 minute IV infusion of\n      [3H]-TMC435 (100 microcurie) 100 microgram; and Treatment B: single oral dose of simeprevir\n      (TMC435) 150 mg followed 5 hours later by a single 10 minute IV infusion of [3H]-TMC435 (100\n      microcurie) 100 microgram. Treatments will be administered in two consecutive treatment\n      periods, first Treatment A in Period 1, followed by Treatment B in Period 2; separated by a\n      washout period (period when the participant is not receiving any study medication) of 7 to\n      14 days. The follow up will be for 5 to 7 days after end of Period 2. Blood samples will be\n      collected for full plasma pharmacokinetics evaluations; along with urine and stool samples\n      for analysis of total plasma radioactivity. Safety evaluations for adverse events, clinical\n      laboratory tests, electrocardiogram, vital signs, physical examination, liver volume\n      determination, and specific toxicities will be monitored throughout the study. The total\n      duration of the study will be approximately 42 days."
