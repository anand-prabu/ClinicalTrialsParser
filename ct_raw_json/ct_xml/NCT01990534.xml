      This phase 4, single-arm, open-label, multicenter study is designed to evaluate the efficacy
      and safety of brentuximab vedotin as a single agent in adult patients with histologically
      confirmed CD30+ relapsed or refractory classical HL who have not received a prior stem cell
      transplantation (SCT) and are considered to be not suitable for SCT or multiagent
      chemotherapy at the time of study entry.
