The maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/Recommended Phase 2 Regimen (RP2R) of dabrafenib\n      plus panitumumab will be defined first in Part 1. Upon definition of a tolerable dose of\n      dabrafenib plus panitumumab, trametinib will be added to the combination and subsequent\n      cohorts will dose with all three drugs in combination. Part 2 of the study will consist of\n      expansion cohorts to enroll subjects with BRAF-mutation V600E or V600K positive CRC, and\n      investigate safety and clinical activity of dabrafenib in combination with panitumumab and\n      trametinib plus dabrafenib in combination with panitumumab. For each combination\n      (dabrafenib/panitumumab and dabrafenib/trametinib/panitumumab), the optimal safe and\n      tolerable dose combinations defined in Part 1 will be brought forward into Part 2. Based on\n      the safety and tolerability of these combinations, these doses may be modified during Part 2\n      of the study. Part 3 of the study will be a randomized Phase II study comparing dosing with\n      dabrafenib in combination with panitumumab and trametinib plus dabrafenib in combination\n      with panitumumab as compared to a chemotherapy comparator. Subjects will be assigned to one\n      of three treatment groups in a randomized fashion to compare safety and clinical activity:\n      1) dabrafenib plus panitumumab, 2) dabrafenib plus trametinib plus panitumumab, or 3)\n      chemotherapy comparator. Dose levels for dabrafenib, trametinib, and panitumumab in Part 3\n      will be chosen based on emerging PK, PD, and tolerability data from Part 1 and Part 2. In\n      the event that the benefit/risk ratio for either of the two experimental combinations is not\n      sufficiently positive (either due to excessive toxicity or clearly inferior efficacy), one\n      of the arms may be excluded from Part 3 of the study."
