This study\n      also will see if these vaccines are safe to use either alone or in combination.\n\n      Treatment with anti-HIV drugs does not always keep HIV viral load low and under control.\n      This study will look at the effect of the HIV vaccine, vCP1452, on the immune response and\n      how it works in combination with Remune. Information about immune responses and the safety\n      of these vaccines in HIV-positive patients will be gathered."

            "textblock": "Human viral infections are controlled by the immune system. However, the multiple immune\n      responses provoked by HIV infection do not control the infection in most people. The ability\n      to specifically augment CTL responses with an immunotherapeutic vaccine may strengthen the\n      containment of viremia afforded by antiretroviral agents and thereby extend the durability\n      of viral suppression. The current study will attempt to determine whether therapeutic\n      immunizations with HIV-1 immunogen and vCP1452 are safe and able to augment HIV-1 specific\n      immune responses for a longer period of time than antiretroviral therapy alone, and if both\n      agents are better than either by itself.\n\n      Patients currently enrolled in A5058s under A5057/A5058s Versions 1.0 and 2.0 will be given\n      the option of continuing their participation in A5058s through this independent study.\n      Rollover patients register to Step II and begin treatment/evaluations on A5058s at the same\n      study week that they were on in Versions 1.0 and 2.0 of A5057/A5058s. New patients enter\n      Step I and will not need to register to Step II. Step I patients are stratified on the basis\n      of HIV viral load, antiretroviral history, and current antiretroviral treatment. Within each\n      stratum, patients are randomized to 1 of the following 4 treatment arms:  HIV-1 immunogen\n      plus  ALVAC placebo, HIV-1 immunogen placebo plus ALVAC placebo, HIV-1 immunogen placebo\n      plus vCP1452, or HIV-1 immunogen plus vCP1452. Patients receive an injection at study entry\n      and every 12 weeks thereafter until the end of the study, a minimum of 2 years. Step II\n      patients receive the same treatment as patients in Step I. Patients are evaluated every 12\n      weeks for clinical, immunologic, and virologic parameters. Patients continue taking the\n      antiretroviral treatment that they were taking at study entry until reaching a virologic\n      relapse as defined in the protocol. If no response to a new drug regimen occurs, or the\n      antiretroviral therapy is not changed, immunizations may continue as long as the viral load\n      remains below 5,000 copies/ml."
