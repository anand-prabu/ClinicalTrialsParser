The investigators hypothesize that the\n      pharmacist-led intervention will reduce inappropriate prescriptions by at least 20% over\n      6-months compared to usual care.  The intervention consists of simultaneously educating\n      consumers and providing physicians with an evidence-based pharmaceutical opinion on\n      inappropriate prescriptions."
