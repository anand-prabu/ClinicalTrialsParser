      This is a clinical study to characterise the lung function, airway morphometry,
      pharyngometry and inhalation profiles in patients with mild to severe Idiopathic Pulmonary
      Fibrosis (IPF) over a period of up to 6 months. Inhalation profiles will be recorded from
      patients with IPF as they inhale during tidal breathing, and following two sets of
      instructions (maximal effort and 'long, steady and deep' inhalation), across a range of
      airflow resistances that reflect those of typical inhalers used to deliver medication to the
      lungs. Mouth and throat dimensions will be measured using an acoustic reflectance
      Pharyngometer. Measurements of lung function will be made using conventional sprirometry,
      plethysmography and diffusion, whilst Low Dose High Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT)
      will be used to scan the airways at two lung volumes; functional residual capacity (FRC) and
      total lung capacity (TLC). Data from HRCT will be used to reconstruct airway morphometry,
      and model inhaled particle deposition within the lung. Overall, the study allows a further
      understanding of the IPF patient population, using the data to assist in the development of
      new inhaled products for this disease. Following up the patients with additional HRCT scans
      at 3 and 6 months will enable the sensitivity of CT based criteria of disease progression to
      be compared with lung function criteria. No investigational product will be used in this
      study.
