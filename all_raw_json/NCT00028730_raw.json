            "textblock": "RATIONALE: Giving chemotherapy and total body irradiation before a donor bone marrow\n      transplant helps stop the growth of cancer and abnormal cells and helps stop the patient's\n      immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. When the healthy stem cells from a\n      donor are infused into the patient they may help the patient's bone marrow make stem cells,\n      red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Sometimes the transplanted cells from a\n      donor can make an immune response against the body's normal cells. Giving antithymocyte\n      globulin and removing the T cells from the donor cells before transplant may stop this from\n      happening.\n\n      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well total-body irradiation and chemotherapy\n      followed by T-cell depleted donor bone marrow transplant works in treating young patients\n      with hematologic cancer."

Patients receive thiotepa IV over 4 hours on days -5 and -4 and\n      cyclophosphamide IV over 30 minutes on days -3 and -2. Patients who cannot receive\n      cyclophosphamide, due to prior hemorrhagic cystitis or exposure to high-dose\n      cyclophosphamide or ifosfamide, receive fludarabine IV over 30 minutes on days -5 to -1.\n      Patients planning to receive family member HLA-mismatched or unrelated bone marrow\n      transplantation receive horse anti-thymocyte globulin IV once daily on days -5 and -4.\n      Patients undergo allogeneic T-cell-depleted bone marrow transplantation on day 0. Patients\n      receive filgrastim (G-CSF) IV every 12 hours beginning on day 7 and continuing until blood\n      counts recover.\n\n      Patients are followed every 2-4 weeks for the first 100 days post-transplantation, every 6\n      weeks for 6 months, every 3 months for 1 year, and then every 3-6 months until 2 years\n      post-transplantation.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients (25 with HLA 6/6 antigen-matched related donors\n      and 25 with HLA 5/6 antigen-matched related donors or HLA 5/6 or 6/6 antigen-matched\n      unrelated donors) will be accrued for this study within 3 years."
