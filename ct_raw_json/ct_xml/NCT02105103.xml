      Accu-Chek® Insight Insulin Pump EU Study is a Multicenter Study to evaluate the  Accu-Chek®
      Insight Insulin Pump in routine practice.  This is an open-label, prospective,
      multinational, multicenter study evaluating the CSII therapy with the Accu-Chek Insight
      Insulin pump in routine practice in adult subjects with Type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Subjects
      must have beenn on intensive insulin therapy for at least siz months  i.e. either on CSII or
      MDI.All Subjects will receive training in the preparation, programming and daily use of the
      Accu-Chek Insight Insulin pump.In addition, subjects previously on MDI may receive more
      training in order to be comfortable with the use of an insulin pump.The study will be
      conducted in 10-12 sites in Austria, France and the United Kingdom.  A total of 80-95
      subjects will be enrolled in this study.

    <description>A new insulin pump, the Accu-Chek® Insight insulin pump, will be used by all subjects enrolled in this study. The usability of the Accu-Chek® Insight insulin pump for the intended use has already been investigated in a Human Factor study. The study subjects may encounter the following potential risks of CSII therapy while participating in the study: Possible hypoglycemia; Possible hyperglycemia which might progress to ketosis and DKA; Infusion site reactions (bleeding, bruising, discomfort, pruritus, pain, plaster reactions, inflammation, infection etc.)</description>
