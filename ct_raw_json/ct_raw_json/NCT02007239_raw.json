            "textblock": "Subjects with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) often have life-threatening\n      complications at the time of diagnosis resulting from excessive inflammation.  This\n      excessive inflammation is driven by abnormally high levels of cytokines--proteins involved\n      in inflammation.  Standard therapy for HLH does not directly target these cytokines.\n      Tocilizumab is a medicine that blocks one of the cytokines that is elevated in patients with\n      HLH.\n\n      This is an open-label single-arm uncontrolled trial with biologic endpoint. This study will\n      use tocilizumab in subjects with HLH and high cytokine levels in an attempt to decrease the\n      damage caused by these proteins.  All subjects will receive standard therapy, in addition to\n      tocilizumab.  We hypothesize the tocilizumab will decrease levels of certain important\n      cytokines.  This may make it easier to treat subjects with HLH overall.\n\n      TCZ will be administered as a single dose (8mg/kg) intravenously.  Eligible subjects will be\n      inpatients at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) main campus.  10 subjects with\n      HLH will be enrolled.  All subjects will be initiated on standard HLH-directed treatment.\n      Cytokine levels [including serum interferon (IFN-\u03b3) and interleukin (IL-6)] will be\n      monitored, in addition to other laboratory and clinical markers of HLH disease activity."
