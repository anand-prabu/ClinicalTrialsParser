  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High tidal volume during mechanical ventilation has been reported to increase mortality in
      patients with acute lung injury or acute respiratory distress syndrome. High tidal volume
      was also reported to be associated with increased mortality in adult patients without acute
      lung injury or acute respiratory distress syndrome. However, the influence of high tidal
      volume on clinical outcome in pediatric patients who underwent surgery for congenital heart
      disease has not been evaluated yet. The investigators attempted to evaluate the effect of
      tidal volume on clinical outcome in both cyanotic and non-cyanotic congenital heart disease.
