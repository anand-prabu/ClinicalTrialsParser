    <textblock>
      Many cancer patients are prescribed drugs to which their cancer is already resistant - and
      thus suffer toxicity with no potential for benefit. Previous attempts to assess
      chemoresistance or sensitivity in vitro have failed. This is a feasibility study in human
      patients with newly diagnosed or recurrent lymphoma to determine how human cancerous lymph
      nodes in situ respond to standard of care therapeutics precisely microinjected with the
      CIVO(tm) microdosing system.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  18 years of age or over

          -  Newly diagnosed lymphoma that would typically be treated with agents in the R-CHOP
             regimen OR recurrent/progressive lymphoma in patients who were previously treated
             with at least one drug in the R-CHOP regimen or bendamustine.

          -  At least one cancerous lymph node that is considered accessible for percutaneous
             injection by the investigator and that is at least 2 cm in longest dimension.

          -  ECOG performance status of 0-2 (or a Karnofsky performance status of &gt;50%).

          -  Labs required for enrollment: Absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1000/mm3, platelet count &gt;
             50,000/mm3, hematocrit &gt; 25%, and coagulation, liver and renal function tests within
             normal limits.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Lymphoma patients in which the delay of up to 3 days to surgery or other factors
             associated with the study are not feasible.

          -  Patients with central nervous system disease.

          -  Any therapy that is potentially immunosuppressive or has anticancer activity in the 4
             weeks prior to device microinjection.

          -  Patients with active fungal, viral, or bacterial infections

          -  Pregnant women.

          -  Inability to give informed consent.
