    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, prospective, multi-center study of 225 female subjects age 30-50 years
      with symptoms from uterine fibroids.  All subjects will be followed for a total of
      thirty-six (36) months following uterine fibroid embolization.

    <description>The primary effectiveness endpoint for this clinical trial is the proportion of subjects who have success, defined as 50% menstrual blood loss (MBL) reduction or less than 80 ml of MBL per cycle, evaluated by the Alkaline Hematin (AH) method, at 12 months.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is able to provide informed consent and must sign the Institutional Review
             Board approved Informed Consent Form.

          -  Pre-menopausal women age 30-50 years at time of enrollment

          -  Have been selected forUterine Fibroid Embolization (UFE) prior to entry to the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has a history of pelvic malignancy

          -  Patient has an abnormal Pap smear within 12 months of the planned Uterine Fibroid
             Embolization procedure

          -  Patient with coexisting condition that might explain abnormal bleeding (including
             endometrial hyperplasia and adenomyosis) or pelvic pain (including endometriosis and
             ovarian cysts).

          -  Is at substantial risk for the need of organ transplantation, such as renal
             insufficiency.

          -  Patient has evidence of current or recent pelvic inflammatory disease or uterine
             infection.

          -  Patient with a severe contrast allergy or renal insufficiency that would represent a
             contradiction to the administration of iodine-based contrast agents.

          -  Patients unable to comply with the follow-up requirements of the study.
