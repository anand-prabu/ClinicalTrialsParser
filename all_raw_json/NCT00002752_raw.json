Patients are stratified by prior external beam radiotherapy (yes\n      vs no).\n\n      Patients receive iodine I 131 labeled MOAB 81C6 intraventricularly followed by unlabeled\n      MOAB 81C6 intraventricularly.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of iodine I 131 labeled MOAB 81C6 until the\n      maximum tolerated dose is determined. The MTD is defined as the highest dose preceding that\n      at which 3 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed monthly for 2 years, every 2 months for 2 years, and then every 3\n      months thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-6 patients per cohort will be accrued for this study."
