To evaluate overall response rate, overall survival, progression-free survival and\n      duration of response.\n\n      II. To describe the toxicities associated with BKM120 in lymphoma. III. To evaluate\n      prognostic factors for aggressive lymphoma and whether there's a correlation with clinical\n      benefit.\n\n      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. To assess serum cytokines before and after BKM120 therapy. II. To assess\n      phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway member expression on paraffin-embedded tumor\n      samples pre-treatment.\n\n      III. To assess on paired fresh tumor tissue obtained from consenting patients pre- and\n      post-therapy the change in activation of PI3K pathway members.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients receive PI3K inhibitor BKM120 orally (PO) on days 1-28.
