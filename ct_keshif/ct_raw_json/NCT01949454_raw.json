            "textblock": "The investigators aim to evaluate a new potentially cost-effective approach to improving\n      trichiasis surgery outcomes, perioperative topical anti-inflammatory therapy.  The\n      investigators hypothesize that adjunctive topical fluorometholone therapy following\n      trichiasis surgery will reduce the risk of recurrent trichiasis.  The rationale for this\n      hypothesis is that interruption of inflammation postoperatively would reduce postoperative\n      scarring, leading to better outcomes.  As an initial step toward evaluating this modality,\n      the investigators believe it to be necessary to evaluate topical corticosteroid therapy in a\n      safety-oriented study, for which the investigators also hypothesize that fluorometholone\n      will have a perioperative safety profile acceptable for large-scale programmatic use.\n      Topical corticosteroid therapy is associated with potential risks of cataract induction and\n      intraocular pressure (IOP) elevation in susceptible individuals.  Fluorometholone has lower\n      intraocular penetration than alternative corticosteroids, with correspondingly less\n      IOP-raising effect while still having favorable effects on conjunctival inflammation, and is\n      a low-cost generic drug.  Its poor delivery of corticosteroid into the eye itself provides\n      an advantage in this setting, as the major side effects of therapy are the result of\n      intraocular effects, and therapy only is needed to the conjunctiva.  However, prior to use\n      in a large-scale trial it is sensible to make sure adverse outcomes are not observed in a\n      substantial number of TT patients in a smaller scale trial.  Secondary goals of such a trial\n      are to evaluate alternative topical corticosteroid dosing schedules to identify an optimal\n      dosing schedule and to identify any preliminary signals of potential efficacy."
