It has been shown that an inhibition of p-Akt may\n      lead to a reduction in the expression of MMP-2 or u-PA as well as in the invasion of tumor\n      cells. DNE3 could reduse the phosphorylation of Akt in B16-F10 cells. To make a linkage\n      between p-Akt and protease expressions, the effects of DNE3 on several transcription factors\n      were examined. It is well known that the activation of AP-1 and NF- kB and the downstream of\n      the PI3K-Akt pathway are associated with inflammation, cell invasion, migration, and\n      angiogenesis, and that suppression of any of these transcription factors is potentially an\n      effective means to block tumor invasion or metastasis, as well as blocking the factors that\n      bind to these regulatory elements, and therefore represents an appropriate approach to\n      inhibit the synthesis of MMPs or u-PA. In our studies, DNE3 was found to effectively\n      suppress the DNA binding activity and the expression of NF- kB while the protein level of I-\n      kB, the endogenous inhibitor of NF- kB, was gradually increased along with the concentration\n      of DNE3.\n\n      Us repeatedly in laboratory studies proved thatHS68, human foreskin fibroblast cells, was\n      used to demonstrate that DNE3 exerted no cytotoxicity on normal foreskin fibroblast cells.\n      In conclusion, Dioscorea nipponica potently inhibits melanoma invasive and metastatic\n      potential; therefore, they may constitute a valuable tool in the combination therapy of\n      metastatic melanoma and in the prevention of melanoma metastases with Dabrafenib and\n      Trametinib"
