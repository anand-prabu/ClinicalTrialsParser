Is due to undergo treatment with myeloablative conditioning (radiation-based or non\n             radiation based) before HSCT.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          1. Will undergo reduced intensity conditioning before HSCT.\n\n          2. Has got known allergy to any ingredient in the study product or to peanuts,\n             peppermint oil, or soya.\n\n          3. Is pregnant or breast feeding.\n\n          4. Has any other concurrent medical condition that, in the opinion of the investigator,\n             would increase the risk to the patient, compromise evaluation of the investigational\n             device, or interfere with the conduct of the study.\n\n          5. Has an unstable condition (eg, a psychiatric disorder, a recent history of substance\n             abuse) or is otherwise thought to be unreliable or incapable of complying with the\n             study requirements.\n\n          6.
