Its application is associated with complex hemodynamic repercussions,\n      therefore is important to identify them for safety and effectiveness of the technique\n      application.\n\n      The main objective of this research is to evaluate the hemodynamic repercussions using\n      doppler echocardiography in healthy volunteers submitted a different values of positive end\n      expiratory pressure (PEEP) by the following ventilatory modes: Continuous positive airway\n      pressure (CPAP) and Bilevel.\n\n      The study hypothesis is that the positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) may cause\n      hemodynamic repercussions as: reduction of the ventricles pre-load, left ventricle after\n      load, cardiac output and reduction in the diameter of the superior vena cava, due to the\n      increase in the intrathoracic pressure and pulmonary volumes."
