            "textblock": "Neck pain is a prevalent musculoskeletal dysfunction. Studies point that individuals with\n      chronic pain have metabolic, vascular and electromyographic changes in trapezius muscle.\n      Moreover, a common clinical sign in this muscle in subjects with neck pain is the presence\n      of myofascial trigger points. These are related to the sensory, motor and autonomic changes,\n      being defined as palpable nodules located in the taut band of skeletal muscle. In this\n      context, the focus on treatment modalities stands out in the literature, however, other\n      resources commonly used in clinical practice still lack scientific evidence. Therefore, the\n      aim of this project is to evaluate the effectiveness of physiotherapy resources in the\n      treatment of myofascial trigger points in the trapezius muscle of patients with neck pain.\n      For such, volunteers with neck pain for more than 90 days, of both genders, aged between 18\n      and 59 years and bilateral myofascial trigger points in the upper trapezius will be\n      randomized into the following groups: group 1 (kinesiotherapy, n = 20), group 2\n      (kinesiotherapy + static ultrasound, n = 20), group 3 (kinesiotherapy + diadynamic currents,\n      n = 20) and group 4 (untreated control, n = 20). Volunteers will undergo ten sessions of\n      treatment, being realized the following evaluations: surface electromyography, infrared\n      thermography, numerical scale of pain assessment, algometry, Neck Disability Index and skin\n      impedance. For data analysis, normality test will used to verify the data distribution and\n      consistent statistical test for the appropriate comparisons within and between groups, and\n      thus considered two factors in the comparisons, time and group. Will adopt a significance\n      level of 5%."
