  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overarching goal of this study is to determine whether combined cognitive training and
      Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) reduces drinking in high-risk drinkers. To
      this end, specific study purposes are: 1) replicate previous findings that cognitive
      retraining reduces drinking levels, 2) test whether cognitive retraining can be enhanced
      with tDCS, and 3) investigate the neural changes that result from cognitive retraining and
      tDCS.  We hypothesize that those participants who receive alcohol avoidance cognitive
      training will have greater reductions in drinking.  In turn, those participants who receive
      a higher level of applied tDCS during alcohol avoidance response training will have better
      avoidance learning, as well as, a larger reduction in drinking behavior.  Finally, those
      participants receiving a higher level of applied tDCS will have more neuronal response
      associated with alcohol avoidance during the brain imaging session.

    <description>Blood oxygen level dependent responses will be examined prior to and post-treatment to determine if these responses change differentially by treatment group.  The BOLD response is a proxy measure of blood flow in the brain that occurs in response to the presentation of a sensory stimulus, in this case pictures of alcohol-contain beverages.  We will examine the change in BOLD response from before treatment to after treatment in a subset (~1/2 of the total sample, distributed across all 4 treatment arms) of the participants who complete the MRI assessments.</description>
