    <textblock>
      Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a common cause of respiratory illness in infants
      and children around the world. This study will evaluate the safety and immune response to a
      RSV vaccine in two groups of participants: healthy children who have already had an RSV
      infection (RSV seropositive) and healthy infants and children who have not already had an
      RSV infection (RSV seronegative).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      RSV is the most common viral cause of serious acute lower respiratory illness (LRI) in
      infants and children under 5 years of age around the world. RSV illness can range from mild
      upper respiratory tract illness (URI) to severe LRI, including bronchiolitis and pneumonia.
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a single dose of a
      RSV vaccine in healthy children. Study researchers will first evaluate the vaccine in
      healthy RSV-seropositive children and will then evaluate the vaccine in healthy
      RSV-seronegative infants and children.

      This study will first enroll healthy RSV-seropositive children ages 12 to 59 months (Group
      1). At study entry, participants will undergo a medical history review, physical
      examination, blood collection, and a nasal wash procedure. Participants will be randomly
      assigned to receive either the RSV vaccine or placebo vaccine, administered as nose drops.
      Subjects will be actively monitored for 28 days following administration of vaccine or
      placebo; monitoring will include medical history reviews, clinical assessments, and at some
      visits, nasal washes. On the days where no study visit is scheduled, study researchers will
      contact participants' parents or guardians for medical follow-up.

      Study researchers will evaluate the study data of participants in Group 1 before enrolling
      participants in Group 2, and study data from Group 2 will be reviewed before enrolling
      participants in Group 3. Participants in Groups 2 and 3 will include healthy
      RSV-seronegative infants and children ages 6 to 24 months. These participants will also be
      randomly assigned to receive either the RSV vaccine or placebo vaccine, administered as nose
      drops. Subjects will be actively monitored for 56 days following administration of vaccine
      or placebo; monitoring will include medical history reviews, clinical assessments, and at
      some visits, nasal washes. On the days where no study visit is scheduled, study researchers
      will contact participants' parents or guardians for medical follow-up. At a study visit on
      Day 56, participants will undergo a medical history review, blood collection, and a nasal
      wash procedure.

      For participants in Groups 2 and 3, from November through March following each participant's
      vaccination visit, parents or guardians will monitor participants for RSV-associated
      illnesses and report these on a weekly basis via telephone calls to study researchers.
      Participants may have additional study visits that may include blood collection and/or nasal
      wash procedures during this follow-up period.

             opportunities for transmission of virus through direct physical or aerosol contact
             are acceptable.

        Inclusion Criteria for Seronegative Infants and Children:

          -  Receipt of another investigational vaccine or investigational drug within 28 days of
             receiving this investigational RSV vaccine

          -  Has received antibiotics or systemic or nasal steroid therapy for acute illness
             within the previous 3 days prior to vaccination (steroid skin creams or lotions and
