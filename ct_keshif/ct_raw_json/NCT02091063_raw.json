The target\n      population will include patients with histologically confirmed relapsed or refractory\n      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or Hodgkin's lymphoma, with an expansion cohort of patients with\n      mantle cell lymphoma.\n\n      The phase Ib will be conducted to determine the safety and tolerability of two dosing\n      schedules of ACY-1215 monotherapy in patients with lymphoid malignancies.  Patients will be\n      accrued simultaneously to two dose cohorts (Arm A and Arm B) of ACY1215.  Selection into\n      each cohort will occur by alternation.  All patients will take the prescribed dose of\n      ACY1215 orally for 28 consecutive days.  Patients enrolled into Arm A will take ACY1215 160\n      mg daily (QD), whereas patients enrolled into Arm B will take ACY1215 160 mg twice daily\n      (BID). ACY-1215 will be supplied as a liquid for oral administration (PO).  Each dose will\n      be administered at least 1 hour after ingestion of food followed by at least 4 ounces of\n      water.  Patients will be instructed not to ingest food or other oral medication for at least\n      2 hours after each ACY-1215 dose. Frequency in phase II will be determined based on Phase Ib\n      results."
