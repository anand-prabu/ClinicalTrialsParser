  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Electronic eyeglasses, Amblyz™glasses, are a new medical device designed to treat amblyopia,
      which intermittently become opaque and provide effective occlusion for 50% of the time they
      are worn. A non-randomized study reported that Amblyz glasses yield an improvement in the
      amblyopic eye and offer an alternative effective treatment. We are unaware of any randomized
      clinical trial reports of response to AmblyzTM glasses treatment of amblyopia.

      Our hypothesis: Amblyz™glasses can improve visual acuity of the amblyopic eye as effective
      as traditional patching treatment.

      The primary objective is to determine if AmblyzTM equally treats amblyopia as the standard
      2-hour patching amblyopia treatment. This study is designed to evaluate the effectiveness of
      a novel amblyopia treatment, AmblyzTM glasses, in treating moderate amblyopia. Children ages
      3 to &lt;8 years with visual acuity of 20/40 to 20/80 in the amblyopic eye will be enrolled and
      randomized into two groups: 4-hour AmblyzTM glasses treatment group and standard 2-hour
      patching control group.
