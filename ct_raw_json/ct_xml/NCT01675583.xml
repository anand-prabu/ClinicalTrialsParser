    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy of an optical device designed and
      developed to quantitatively monitor blood flow velocity of wound sites. It is hypothesized
      that the blood flow velocity of the wound site will provide critical information on the
      efficacy of hyperbaric oxygen therapy.
