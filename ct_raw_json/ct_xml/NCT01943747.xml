  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To mark 10 years of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC), and timed to coincide with World
      Sepsis Day, on September 13, 2013,  the SSC, ESICM and SCCM will be conducting an
      international point prevalence study of severe sepsis and septic shock.  The goal of this
      project is to determine the world wide burden of severe sepsis and define current practices
      of sepsis care internationally.  The study is a simple data collection exercise for patients
      presenting with either severe sepsis or septic shock on World Sepsis Day.

      De--‐identified patient--‐level data will be collected on patients presenting to a
      participating intensive care unit or emergency department with severe sepsis or septic shock
      over a 24 hour period from 00:00 to 24:00 November 07, 2013. De--‐identified data that is
      already collected as part of routine clinical care will be collected for this study. Data to
      be collected includes hospital and ICU characteristics, patient characteristics, severity of
      illness, and adherence to SSC bundle elements and mortality. It will take between 30--‐60
      minutes to collect and enter data for each patient admitted with severe sepsis or septic
      shock over the 24 hours study period.
