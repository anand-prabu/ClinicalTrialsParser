  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Outcomes Registry for Better Informed Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation (ORBIT-AF II) is
      a multicenter, prospective outpatient disease registry to evaluate the utilization of
      target-specific antithrombotic agents, such as FXa (factor Xa) inhibitors and direct
      thrombin inhibitors, and associated outcomes. Importantly, the ORBIT AF II registry will
      permit the collection and analysis of post-approval observational data needed for evaluating
      the outcomes associated with these new agents when used in broader patient populations
      outside of clinical studies. The ORBIT-AF II registry will focus on patients with newly
      diagnosed atrial fibrillation (AF) as well as those who have been recently started on a
      target-specific oral anticoagulant agent. Taken together, the ORBIT-AF I and ORBIT-AF II
      registries will offer a broad and contemporary view of AF therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The registry will be used to evaluate, describe, and document the safety of target-specific
      anticoagulant agents (and other antithrombotic agents) in patients with Atrial Fibrillation
      (AF), the clinical outcomes associated with their use, the treatment patterns and clinical
      course of patients with AF, including those who undergo cardiac procedures of interest
      (ablation, cardioversion, catheterization and surgery, for examples), and characteristics of
      patients with new onset/first-detected AF. Additionally, the registry will be used to
      summarize patterns of switching or discontinuation of antithrombotic agents in the United
      States. The registry will be a nationwide collaboration of health care providers (eg,
      cardiologists, internists, primary care physicians, electrophysiologists, quality
      improvement personnel, office/practice managers, research coordinators, and pharmacists).
      Target enrollment will be approximately 15,000 patients. It is anticipated that enrollment
      will complete in 2 years. Consecutive patients who meet the eligibility criteria will be
      approached and educated about the registry. Patients who express interest will provide
      informed consent. Patients enrolled in the registry will be followed for up to 2 years.
      Patient follow-up by their AF care provider will continue as scheduled according to local
      clinical practice. Data collection will occur at 6-month intervals for approximately 2 years
      from the time of enrollment of the patient (baseline, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months). Data
      capture will include demographics, medical history, cardiovascular history, vital signs,
      echocardiographic and laboratory data, AF status and type (paroxysmal, persistent,
      long-standing persistent/permanent), pharmacotherapy, contraindications to oral
      anticoagulant therapy, and provider specialty. Clinical outcomes and safety data capture
      will include major adverse cardiac events (MACEs).
