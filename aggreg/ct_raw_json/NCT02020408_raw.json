Because palatable food stimulates dopamine secretion, we\n      propose to use a challenge with brain imaging that will stimulate dopamine release which we\n      hypothesize will generate anxiety rather than pleasure in AN, and will help explain why AN\n      restrict eating in order to reduce anxiety. This study will help to understand the unique\n      puzzling symptoms in eating disorders and contribute to finding better methods for\n      identifying effective treatments for these often relapsing and sometimes chronic disorders."

To avoid the confounding effects of malnutrition,\n      and because they have behaviours and neural circuit alterations relevant for this study, we\n      will study 25 recovered (REC) restricting-type AN, 25 REC bulimic-type AN (AN-BN), 25 REC\n      BN, and 25 control women (CW).
