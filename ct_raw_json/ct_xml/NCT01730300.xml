      The main purpose of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of Levonorgestrel Releasing
      Intrauterine devices (LNR-IUD) on genitourinary symptoms in patients with abnormal uterine
      bleeding. The patients were asked urogenital distress inventory (UDI) (which includes;
      irritative symptoms, stress symptoms, obstructive discomfort) and incontinence impact
      questionnaire (IIQ) (which includes; physical activity, travel, social/relationships,
      emotional health)questionnaires in the day of application LNR-IUD and six months later this
      procedure. Statistical analyse will be performed to evaluate the changes in this time
      period.
