      AIMS HYPOTHESIS In a high risk population the EarlyCDT-Lung test reduces the incidence of
      late stage tumours;3 / 4 / Unclassified (U) at diagnosis compared to normal clinical
      practice.

      AIMS To assess the effectiveness of EarlyCDT-Lung test in increasing early stage lung cancer
      detection, thereby reducing the rate of late stage (3 / 4 / U) presentation, compared to
      normal clinical practice; to assess the cost-effectiveness of EarlyCDT-Lung test compared to
      normal clinical practice; to assess the effectiveness of EarlyCDT-Lung test in reducing
      adverse outcomes including potential psychological and behavioural consequences.
