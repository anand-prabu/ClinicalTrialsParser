The investigators partner with faith-based\n      organizations, since they play a highly prominent role in Latino community life. This\n      three-phase study will: (1) improve understanding of the organizational infrastructure,\n      skills and resources required by Latino churches to implement EBIs for cancer control, (2)\n      develop a capacity-building intervention; and (3) test the intervention's effectiveness in a\n      randomized trial."
