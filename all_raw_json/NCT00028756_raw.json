Compare the overall and progression-free survival of patients with stage III or IV\n      transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder urothelium treated with immediate versus deferred\n      adjuvant chemotherapy after radical cystectomy.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to\n      participating center, tumor status (pT1-2 vs pT3 vs pT4), and node status (node positive vs\n      node negative with 15 or more nodes sampled vs node negative with less than 15 nodes\n      sampled). Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms.\n\n      ARM I: Beginning within 90 days of radical cystectomy, patients receive a total of 4 courses\n      of adjuvant chemotherapy.\n\n      ARM II: Beginning at the time of clinical relapse, patients receive a total of 6 courses of\n      adjuvant chemotherapy.\n\n      Patients in both arms receive one of the following chemotherapy regimens to be determined by\n      participating center:\n\n      REGIMEN A (Classical M-VAC): Patients receive classical M-VAC comprising methotrexate IV on\n      days 1, 15 and 22; vinblastine IV on days 2, 15, and 22; and doxorubicin IV and cisplatin IV\n      on day 2. Courses repeat every 28 days.\n\n      REGIMEN B (High-dose M-VAC): Patients receive high-dose M-VAC comprising methotrexate IV on\n      day 1 and vinblastine IV, doxorubicin IV, and cisplatin IV on day 2. Patients also receive\n      filgrastim (G-CSF subcutaneously once daily on days 4-10. Courses repeat every 14 days.\n\n      REGIMEN C (Gemcitabine and cisplatin): Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on\n      days 1, 8, and 15 followed by cisplatin IV on day 1 or 2. Courses repeat every 28 days.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 5 years, and then\n      annually thereafter.\n\n      Peer Reviewed and Funded or Endorsed by Cancer Research UK"
