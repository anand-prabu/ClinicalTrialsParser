  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of the HOPE-4 study, Phases (hypertension (HT) and cardiovascular
      disease (CVD)), is to develop and test a program for cardiovascular disease risk assessment
      and treatment involving: (1) simple screening and treatment guidelines implemented by
      non-physician health workers (NPHW); (2) single pill containing blood pressure and
      cholesterol lowering drugs; and (3) family or friends and mobile phone technology to help
      participants comply with the treatment regimen. This program has the potential to reduce
      major cardiovascular events by 35% over 6 years, as compared to usual care.

      Study design: open-label, cluster randomized controlled trial design.

      HT Phase: 50 urban and rural communities in Colombia and Malaysia will be randomized to
      participate in an intensive cardiovascular (CV) risk detection and control program by
      non-physician health workers (NPHW) or to care as usual for 12 months.

      CVD Phase: Continuation and expansion of HT Phase to include a total of 190 urban and rural
      communities in countries within Asia (India, Malaysia, Philippines), South America
      (Colombia, Argentina), and Sub-Saharan Africa (South Africa, Tanzania, Rwanda) that will be
      allocated to participate in the intensive CV risk detection and control program by NPHW or
      to care as usual for a target of 6 years.

      Communities will be randomized 1:1 with a central randomization list to either a)
      intervention or b) control.

    <description>In intervention communities, management plans will be developed by the NPHW for all enrolled participants.  The NPHWs will educate participants about CVD, HT treatment, lifestyle modifications and initiate therapy according to the modified WHO CVD risk-management algorithm, including referral of high-risk patients to physicians and safety monitoring where appropriate.   Participants in intervention communities will have support from family or friends (treatment supporters) and will receive educational materials and treatment reminders using text-messaging, email, and printed materials, as appropriate for the participant and the community setting. Standard and half-dose Polycap formulations will be provided to the NPHWs and supervising physicians for participant treatment.</description>
