This study is also evaluating recruitment rate,\n      completion rate, device usability, and outcome measures feasibility.\n\n        -  Goal for recruitment: 100% of 30 subjects meeting all inclusion criteria can be\n           recruited over the 36 week pilot recruitment phase.\n\n        -  Completion and compliance: 90% of subjects will complete the study, 90% of sessions\n           within each subject will be completed, and for completing subjects, 100% of measures\n           will be completed.\n\n        -  Useability: all therapists and subjects must rate useability as good or better.\n\n        -  Success of blind: subject accuracy at guessing group membership must be at or near 50%."
