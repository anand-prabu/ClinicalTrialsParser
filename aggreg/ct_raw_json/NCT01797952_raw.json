            "textblock": "The study will be conducted at departments of Medical Oncology and Hematology, All India\n      Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS).\n\n      Patients with various malignancies who are taken up for high dose chemotherapy followed by\n      stem cells transplant (blood and marrow transplant) have very high chances of developing\n      severe oral mucositis (generally 60-80% in different studies and our own previous\n      experiences). This not only causes significant morbidity but also hampers quality of life\n      needing use of parenteral nutrition, analgesics, and antibiotics.\n\n      No definite treatment exists for prevention or treatment of oral mucositis in this group of\n      patients.  Though one study has suggested that use of IV palifermin (a keratinocyte growth\n      factor) will reduce duration and severity. Palifermin is very expensive and not available in\n      country. Recently investigators have shown effectiveness of a probiotic Lactobacillus CD 2\n      in reducing incidence and severity of chemo-radiotherapy induced mucositis in head and neck\n      squamous cell cancer patients. (Published online in European Journal of Cancer:\n      http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejca.2011.06.010)European Journal of Cancer 2012;4:875-881.No\n      significant toxicity has been reported with its use.\n\n      A pilot study on similar aspect was completed recently at our center(Clinical trial.gov\n      identifier:NCT 01480011) and in 31 patients who received this only 6 (20%) developed grade\n      III or IV Mucositis. Now, investigators want to study the efficacy of this drug to reduce\n      severity of mucositis in patients undergoing myeloablative hematopoietic stem cell\n      transplantation.  The study drug and placebo will be supplied by CD Pharma India Private\n      Limited.\n\n      Investigators further give undertaking that study will be carried as per GCP and declaration\n      of Helsinki."

The lozenge should be\n      kept in mouth for it to dissolve by itself. A hot beverage (e.g. tea, coffee, milk etc.)\n      should not be taken for at least half an hour before and after the medication since elevated\n      temperature can inactivate the bacteria.\n\n      Duration of treatment The treatment will start 4-7 days before starting chemotherapy for\n      conditioning regime of HSCT and will continue till resolution of mucositis or Day+24 post\n      stem cell infusion which-ever is earlier.\n\n      Efficacy Assessments\n\n      Clinical activity will be defined as reduction in the incidence and severity of chemotherapy\n      induced mucositis in HSCT patients. Most recent version of CTCAE; clinical score of CTC\n      V4.03 ( as also outlined in CTCAE version 3.0) will be used for mucositis assessment.\n      Also,WHO and Oral Mucositis assessment score will be recorded. The study will have the\n      following primary and secondary endpoints:\n\n      Primary endpoint\n\n      1. Determine the incidence of grade III and IV mucositis in patients undergoing allogeneic\n      or autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantation in two groups.\n\n      Secondary endpoint\n\n        1. Determine the incidence of all Grade of mucositis in patients undergoing allogenic or\n           autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantation in two groups.\n\n        2. Duration of and time period for healing of chemotherapy induced oral mucositis.\n\n        3. Determine incidence and severity of dysphagia and requirement of IV antibiotics in two\n           groups\n\n      Safety Assessments\n\n        1. Medical History\n\n        2.
