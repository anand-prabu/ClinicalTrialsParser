  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot randomized trial is to determine whether the fibromyalgia
      integrative training (FIT Teens) intervention is superior to cognitive-behavioral therapy
      (CBT) alone in reducing pain among adolescents with juvenile fibromyalgia (JFM).

      Hypothesis 1: Patients in the FIT Teens group will show significantly greater reduction in
      pain intensity than the CBT group at final study assessment (i.e., 3-month follow up).

      Hypothesis 2: Patients in both the FIT Teens and CBT groups will show significant reductions
      in functional disability and depressive symptoms at final study assessment (i.e., 3-month
      follow up).

      CBT has been found to have beneficial effects on improving coping among adolescents with JFM
      and increasing patients' ability to engage in daily activities.  The purpose of this study
      is to evaluate whether CBT can be enhanced with specialized neuromuscular training, in the
      new fibromyalgia integrative training (FIT Teens) intervention, to produce stronger pain
      reduction than CBT alone.  Neuromuscular training originates from the field of pediatric
      sports medicine and has been successfully used for injury prevention but has never before
      been utilized for pain management in JFM. This type of training emphasizes education and
      proper training in fundamental movement skills prior to the initiation of more vigorous
      physical activity and exercise.  It is expected that the neuromuscular training integrated
      with established CBT techniques will enhance patients' ability to engage in exercise and to
      achieve better JFM pain control. Adolescents with JFM will be randomly assigned to receive
      either the 8-week FIT Teens intervention or an 8-week CBT program with assessments at
      baseline, post-treatment and 3-month follow-up.
