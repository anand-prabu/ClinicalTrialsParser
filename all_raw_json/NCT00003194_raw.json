Combining chemotherapy with peripheral stem cell\n      transplantation may allow the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill\n      more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy and peripheral\n      stem cell transplantation in treating patients who have recurrent or refractory solid\n      tumors."

Patients also receive G-CSF\n      beginning on day 5, 24-36 hours following the last dose of topotecan. PBSC are reinfused on\n      day 6 (36-48 hours following the last dose of topotecan) of each course of therapy. Patients\n      receive 3 courses of therapy.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of thiotepa until the maximum tolerated\n      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6\n      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed at 1 and 2 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 24 patients will be accrued into this study."
