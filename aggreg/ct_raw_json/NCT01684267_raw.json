The focus will be on correcting hip hiking (i.e.\n      exaggerated unilateral upward movements of one side of the pelvis) in post-stroke patients.\n      The human-robot interface will be based on impedance control techniques so that the\n      force-field actuators generate smooth virtual spring/damper restitution forces at the\n      patient's pelvic area.\n\n      As part of the study we will determine whether the force fields applied by the actuated\n      components of the device can effect an acute change in gait biomechanics, primarily pelvis\n      motion during stance and swing phases, in healthy subjects and patients with stroke during\n      ambulation. The investigators will also evaluate the usability of the orthosis in terms of\n      donning & doffing, user confidence, and comfort."
