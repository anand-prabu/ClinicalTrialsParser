      The study objectives are to assess any changes in visual acuity and visual field observed
      following the administration of RPh201 during an overall treatment period of at least 13
      consecutive weeks with an option to extended the treatment phase to another 13 weeks (26
      weeks total), and at the follow-up visit at 3 month after end of treatment in patients with
      optic nerve neuropathy.
