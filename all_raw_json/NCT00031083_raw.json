The\n      purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety and any harmful effects of injection of\n      BG00001 into brain tumors.  Also, this study will help determine whether the virus carrying\n      the beta interferon gene will enter brain tumor cells and cause the cancer cells to die.\n      This study will require one hospital admission for the actual procedure of drug\n      administration.  All other visits will be conducted on an out-patient basis"
