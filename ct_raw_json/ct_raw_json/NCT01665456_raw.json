For instance, in 2008/09 maternal mortality ratio was estimated to be 488/100,000\n      live births. Direct obstetric complications such as puerperal sepsis, postpartum hemorrhage,\n      pre-eclampsia and eclampsia, obstructed labor and indirect causes including HIV, malaria and\n      anemia in pregnancy are responsible for the majority of these cases. Just under 44% of\n      births in Kenya are delivered under the supervision of a skilled birth attendant.\n\n      The overall objective of this study is to determine the effect of provider type in the\n      occurrence and management of serious childbirth related complications among postpartum women\n      at the community level in Bungoma and Lugari Districts of Western Province, Kenya.\n\n      The proposed study will employ a case control study design in which women with obstetric\n      complication(s)will be cases and women without obstetric complications will be controls.\n      Controls will be sampled concurrently with the cases. Each time a new case is diagnosed, a\n      control is selected from the population at risk in the neighborhood at that point in time.\n\n      The study population will consist of women aged 15-49 years with a delivery in the past 12\n      months. A woman who reports having experienced a birth-related complication will be\n      recruited as a case while woman who reports having experienced no complication during\n      child-birth will be recruited as a control."

For\n      instance, no one knows what happens to pregnancy outcomes for both the mother and the baby\n      in a context where a significant proportion of women are delivered by neighbors, relatives\n      or on their own. Literature is also scanty regarding the outcomes of child birth related\n      complications in situations where Traditional Birth Attendants conduct a significant\n      proportion of deliveries.\n\n      A thorough understanding of factors that fuel disrespect and abuse as well as their effect\n      on utilization of delivery services will help providers and programme managers to explore\n      ways of addressing this issue. This study hypothesizes that since majority of deliveries\n      take place at the household level, most complications and even deaths are likely to occur at\n      this level.\n\n      The overall objective of this study is to determine the effect of provider type in the\n      occurrence and management of serious childbirth related complications among postpartum women\n      at the community level in Bungoma and Lugari Districts of Western Province, Kenya.
