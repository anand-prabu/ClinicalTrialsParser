Compare the time to\n      progression and one-year survival rate of patients treated with this regimen. III. Determine\n      the safety of this regimen in these patients. IV. Compare the overall tumor response rate,\n      duration of response, and quality of life of patients treated with this regimen.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. Patients\n      are stratified according to number of organs with metastases (1 vs more than 1) and ECOG\n      performance status (0 vs 1). Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms. Arm I:\n      Patients receive oral AE-941 (Neovastat) twice a day. Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo\n      twice a day. Treatment continues in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease\n      progression. Quality of life is assessed on day 1 and then every 8 weeks thereafter.\n      Patients are followed every 4 weeks until disease progression and then every 8 weeks\n      thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 280 patients will be accrued for this study within 12 months."
