Determine whether the doubling times of multifocal carcinomas occurring within a single\n      prostate are consistent with a model in which low-volume carcinomas have slow doubling times\n      and high-volume carcinomas have fast doubling times.\n\n      OUTLINE:\n\n      Patients receive broxuridine IV over 30 minutes on day -1. Approximately 12-96 hours later,\n      patients undergo surgery to remove the prostate. Tumor tissue is examined by immunostaining\n      for the presence of broxuridine to determine doubling times of the tumor."
