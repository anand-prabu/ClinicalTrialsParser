To test this hypothesis, the following two references for bowel motility will be tested:  a) the study site will minimally record the number of stools for a period up to 24 hours.  The event field in the laptop computer will be used to note each observation.  b) if the study site has the capacity, abdominal ultrasound will be used to observe for the frequency and magnitude of bowel peristalsis.
