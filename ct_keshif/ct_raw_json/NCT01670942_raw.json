Treatment for pneumothorax may consist of high-flow\n      oxygen therapy in the case of very small or \"occult\" pneumothorax, or tube thoracostomy\n      (\"chest tube\") in the case of larger pneumothorax.  Treatment for pneumothorax will be at\n      the discretion of the attending trauma surgeon.  Once the pneumothorax has radiographically\n      resolved, the chest tube, if used, has been removed, and prior to discharge from the\n      hospital, subjects will undergo a two hour stay in a hypobaric chamber.  In the first phase\n      of the study, they will undergo a two hour stay in a hypobaric chamber at a barometric\n      pressure of 565mm Hg, simulating the change in pressure from Salt Lake City to a cruising\n      airliner. If subjects in the first phase do not suffer any adverse events, the investigators\n      will proceed with the second phase.  In the second phase of the study, subjects will undergo\n      a two hour stay in the hypobaric chamber at a barometric pressure of 471mm Hg, simulating\n      the change in pressure from sea level to a cruising airliner.  Prior to the hypobaric\n      exposure, and at the conclusion of the two hours under hypobaric conditions, single view\n      chest radiographs will be performed."
