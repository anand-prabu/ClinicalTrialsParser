            "textblock": "Nonattendance at scheduled appointments at outpatient clinics is a common problem in general\n      medical practice, representing a significant cost to the health care system, and resulting\n      in disruption of daily work planning.Nonattendance at medical appointments has consequences\n      not only for doctors (as it requires a greater use of resources and time), but also for\n      patients, because there may be deterioration in the quality of care, and dissatisfaction\n      associated with delays in obtaining a new appointment.\n\n      Previous studies have reported that nonattendance at scheduled appointments is most\n      frequently associated with those patients attending follow-up appointments, generally those\n      assigned to another professional, those with appointments on Fridays, and those with\n      appointments assigned 1 - 2 weeks in advance. Nonattendance was also associated with younger\n      patient age, greater psychological problems, and lower socioeconomic status.Furthermore, in\n      patients with chronic diseases, the nonattendance rate was also reported to be lower.\n      Clinical patient characteristics can be important predictors of nonattendance, but they\n      required high quality electronic health records to predict nonattendance accurately In the\n      United States and Europe, the nonattendance rate is estimated to be between 6.5%-55%; there\n      is little evidence regarding nonattendance in Latin America. Many studies have described the\n      prevalence and impact of nonattendance at scheduled medical appointments, and possible\n      strategies to decrease the nonattendance rate. However, few studies have utilized the\n      characteristics associated with nonattendance for building predictive models, which might\n      better identify those patients who may not attend a scheduled appointment"
