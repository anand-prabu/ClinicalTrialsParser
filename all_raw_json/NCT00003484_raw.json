A single dose of I 131 MAb 81C6 is delivered via the\n      intralesional catheter.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of I 131 MAb 81C6 until the maximum\n      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2\n      of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicities.\n\n      After the MTD has been established, patients in the phase II portion of the study receive\n      therapy as in phase I.\n\n      Beginning 4 weeks after the monoclonal antibody treatment, patients begin chemotherapy.\n      Patients receive carmustine IV over 1 hour on day 1 and irinotecan IV over 90 minutes once\n      weekly for 4 weeks. Treatment is repeated every 6 weeks for at least 4 courses in the\n      absence of disease progression.\n\n      Patients are followed initially at 4 weeks, then every 6 weeks for 1 year.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 41 patients will be accrued for this study."
