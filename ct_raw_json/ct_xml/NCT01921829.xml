  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a randomized clinical trial to evaluate if taking diuretics
      (medications that increase urine production and help with fluid removal from the body) in a
      standardized fashion (using a guideline for adjusting doses based on measured urine output)
      could improve health outcomes in patients with cardiorenal failure or cardiorenal syndrome
      (combined heart and kidney failure) with edema (too much fluid in their arms, legs, and/or
      lungs).  Under usual care, these patients are treated with diuretics and other medications
      in increasing doses, but not necessarily to maintain a specific amount of urine output per
      day.  Current heart failure (HF) treatment guidelines do not provide any standard protocol,
      or guideline, for adjusting diuretic doses.  At the point when kidney function worsens to
      the degree that the kidneys are no longer able to respond to the medications used to remove
      fluid, either ultrafiltration (UF) or dialysis (also called hemodialysis [HD]) is typically
      started in order to remove fluid.  In both UF and dialysis, excess fluid is removed from the
      body by using a machine.  In dialysis, both waste products and fluid are removed and
      electrolyte abnormalities are corrected.  In UF, only fluid is removed.  Both procedures use
      the same machine.  This study will test whether a Protocolized Diuretic Strategy (ProDiuS),
      a plan for adjusting diuretic doses based on measured urine output, will improve clinical
      care for cardiorenal syndrome.  Such a plan for adjusting diuretic doses is needed to
      improve symptoms, decrease the length of hospital stays and rehospitalization rates, and
      improve health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in cardiorenal syndrome patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure (HF) accounts for over 1 million hospital admissions annually in the United
      States and is a leading cause of disability and healthcare costs.  Cardiorenal syndrome and
      worsening renal function are independent risk factors for morbidity and mortality in HF.
      Effective fluid removal, manifested by a decrease in body weight, is one of the most
      important goals of treatment in cardiorenal syndrome.  Current medical therapeutic options,
      including sodium and fluid restriction, diuretics, blockade of the
      renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, inotropes, and nesiritide, are suboptimal in patients
      with advanced cardiorenal syndrome.  When medical therapies fail, ultrafiltration (UF) may
      be used for mechanical fluid removal using dialysis or UF machines.  UF can effectively
      remove fluid in HF patients, but its precise role in the therapy of cardiorenal syndrome is
      still unclear.  A multicenter randomized controlled trial (CARRESS-HF) suggested that UF was
      not superior to a stepped pharmacologic diuretic regimen, with a similar amount of weight
      loss with the two approaches and a higher rate of adverse events in the UF group.
      Therefore, a protocolized diuretic strategy is needed that is superior to current clinical
      care in the management of cardiorenal syndrome.

      Current HF guidelines do not provide any standard protocol for diuretic dosing.  The
      variation in usual clinical care may explain the long hospital stays and worsening renal
      function common in these patients.  One retrospective observational study compared a
      diuretic dosing protocol to usual diuretic therapy for patients admitted with acute
      decompensated HF.  Protocol diuretic use was associated with greater weight loss and
      significantly lower risk of 30-day readmission.  However, due to its retrospective design,
      the baseline characteristics of the two groups differed in many pertinent covariates, and
      its generalizability is limited.

      The proposed study aims to determine if a protocolized diuretic treatment strategy over 96
      hours, as opposed to usual clinical care, results in improved clinical decongestion,
      clinical outcomes, and health-related quality of life (HRQOL), while preserving renal
      function in hospitalized patients with cardiorenal syndrome.  It is a prospective randomized
      single-blind trial with equal allocation (1:1) and random block randomization of 150
      participants hospitalized on the HF or Cardiology services at University of Pittsburgh
      Medical Center (UPMC) for cardiorenal syndrome recruited over 3 years (approximately 50
      participants/year).  Participants with cardiorenal syndrome and diuretic resistance who have
      failed medical therapy for 48 hours in hospital will be randomized to a Protocolized
      Diuretic Strategy (based on the stepped pharmacologic algorithm used in the CARRESS-HF
      trial) vs. Usual Care for 96 hours.  Participants will be followed daily in the hospital
      during the treatment period, as well as at 1-month and 3-month follow-up visits in the
      outpatient HF clinic.

      Primary Research Question:

      1. In hospitalized patients with cardiorenal syndrome, does a protocolized diuretic
      treatment strategy, as opposed to usual clinical care, result in improved clinical
      decongestion based on change in body weight at 96 hours? Primary Hypothesis.  In
      hospitalized patients with cardiorenal syndrome, protocolized diuretic therapy will result
      in greater reduction in body weight at 96 hours and improved clinical decongestion compared
      to usual care.

      Secondary Research Questions:

        1. Do clinical outcomes, including length of hospitalization, number of rehospitalizations
           for HF, and mortality, improve after protocolized diuretic therapy compared to usual
           care over 3 months? Hypothesis 1.  Protocolized diuretic therapy will be associated
           with reduced length of hospital stay, decreased rehospitalization rates, and decreased
           mortality, compared to usual care.

        2. Do other measures of volume status improve after protocolized diuretic therapy compared
           to usual care during hospitalization and over 3 months? Hypothesis 2.  Protocolized
           diuretic therapy will be associated with not only greater reduction in body weight
           (primary outcome), but also greater decongestion based on increased venous compliance
           of the internal jugular vein (via Doppler ultrasound), negative fluid balance, and
           clinical decongestion, compared to usual care.

        3. Do HRQOL outcomes improve after protocolized diuretic therapy compared to usual care
           over 3 months? Hypothesis 3.  HRQOL indices in physical well-being, mental well-being,
           and sleep quality domains will improve after protocolized diuretic therapy compared to
           usual care.

        4. Do renal outcomes (safety endpoints), including renal function changes, need for UF or
           renal replacement therapy, and occurrence of acute kidney injury, differ between
           protocolized diuretic therapy and usual care during hospitalization and over 3 months?
           Hypothesis 4.  Protocolized diuretic therapy will be superior to usual care in terms of
           worsening renal function, need for UF or renal replacement therapy, and occurrence of
           acute kidney injury.

      Subgroup Research Questions:

      1. Do outcomes differ between the Protocolized Diuretic Strategy vs. Usual care stratified
      by type of heart failure (e.g., systolic dysfunction (EF &lt;40%) vs. diastolic dysfunction (EF
      â‰¥40%); ischemic vs. other; none-mild vs. moderate-severe mitral regurgitation (MR) or
      tricuspid regurgitation (TR))? Hypothesis 1.  No difference will be seen between treatment
      and control groups based on type of heart failure.

      This trial is of utmost interest to cardiologists and nephrologists, who struggle to find
      the optimal diuretic and medical management strategy to effectively remove excess fluid yet
      preserve renal function.  It is highly relevant to many clinicians and the community at
      large, as HF and cardiorenal syndrome are a leading cause of hospitalizations and healthcare
      costs.  If a protocolized diuretic strategy can be found that optimally removes fluid in an
      efficient and safe manner, it could potentially be disseminated to community physicians
      and/or incorporated into public policy or HF treatment guidelines in order to improve
      quality of care and reduce healthcare costs in this population with high morbidity and
      mortality.
