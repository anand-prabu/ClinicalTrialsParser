  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mitiglinide, a benzylsuccinic acid derivative, exerts selective action on the ATP-dependent
      K (KATP) channel  of pancreatic Î²-cells and reportedly possesses a stronger affinity to the
      channel compared with other insulinotropic  sulphonylurea receptor ligands, namely
      repaglinide and nateglinide. Preprandial administration of mitiglinide efficiently reduces
      postprandial hyperglycemia and improves overall glycemic control.

      This was a 12-week, open, randomized study for comparing Mitiglinide versus  Acarbose. The
      purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Mitiglinide vs Acarbose in
      patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects aged between 18 and 70, regardless of gender

          2. Subjects with type-2 diabetes mellitus diagnosed according to 1999 WHO criteria
             within 5 years

          3. Subjects who had not received insulin secretagogues, insulin sensitizers, incretin
             mimetics or alpha-glucosidase inhibitors

             the intestine (like Gastrocardiac Syndrome, severe hernia, intestinal obstruction,
             intestinal ulcer and intestinal surgery)

          5. Subjects with endocrine system diseases such as hyperthyroidism and cushing's
             syndrome etc.
