  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Morning-only colonoscopy preparation may improve efficiency by allowing same-day patient
      preparation and colonoscopy. The aim of the investigators study is to compare the efficacy
      and tolerability of morning-only Polyethylene Glycol (PEG) to split-dose preparation in
      hospitalized patients undergoing colonoscopy.

      This is a single-center, prospective, endoscopist-blinded study in which hospitalized
      patients scheduled to undergo diagnostic colonoscopy were randomly assigned to receive one
      gallon of PEG either the morning of colonoscopy or as a split-dose (evening-morning). The
      primary end point is efficacy of colonoscopy preparation measured by the Ottawa scale. The
      investigators pre-specified a non-inferiority margin of 1.5 for the difference in Ottawa
      scale between arms. Secondary end points are patient compliance and tolerance.

    <description>Colonoscopy was performed by gastroenterology fellows under the supervision of attending physicians and both were blinded to the type of preparation taken by the study patients. Bowel cleansing was evaluated by the Ottawa scale. Scoring of each part of the colon (right, middle and left) was done separately and the total amount of fluid was noted. The scores were then added to calculate the total score out of 14.</description>
