Combining\n      chemotherapy with monoclonal antibody therapy may kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of liposomal doxorubicin and\n      trastuzumab in treating women who have advanced breast cancer."

Courses repeat every 21\n      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study."
