The\n             Simbec normal ranges are shown in Appendix 3.\n\n          -  Subject with a negative urinary drugs of abuse screen (Appendix 2) (N.B. a positive\n             alcohol result may be repeated at the discretion of the Investigator).\n\n          -  Subject with negative HIV and Hepatitis B and C results.\n\n          -  Subject with no clinically significant abnormalities in 12-lead electrocardiogram\n             (ECG).\n\n          -  no clinically significant abnormalities in vital signs.\n\n          -  willing and able to comply with the requirements of the protocol.\n\n          -  satisfy a medical examiner about fitness to participate in the study.\n\n          -  provide written informed consent to participate in the study.\n\n          -  Smokers are eligible to participate in the study.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  Relevant abnormality in medical history or on examination, including history of\n             dementia, or other psychiatric, neurological, immunological, respiratory or\n             cardiovascular disorder. Particularly exclude subjects with signs of peripheral\n             neuropathy. Abnormal laboratory findings suggesting the presence of a systematic\n             disorder.\n\n          -  Participation in a clinical study of an unlicensed drug in the previous 4 months, or\n             a marketed drug study within the previous 3 months. (N.B.  washout period between\n             trials defined as the period of time elapsed between the last dose of the previous\n             study and the first dose of the next study).\n\n          -  Known allergies, including allergy to chemicals like and excipients associated with\n             UE2343.\n\n          -  Recent or clinically significant history of drug or alcohol abuse.\n\n          -  Blood donation greater than 500 ml in the previous 3 months.\n\n          -  Inability to communicate well with the Investigator (i.e., language problem, poor\n             mental development or impaired cerebral function).\n\n          -  Receipt of regular prescribed medication within 7 days of the first study day and /\n             or receipt of vitamins, minerals, herbal remedies and nutritional supplements within\n             7 days of the first study day. Subjects taking long lasting drugs more than 7 days\n             before the study may be excluded at the physician's discretion. Inclusion of subjects\n             who have taken over the counter drugs during this period will be reviewed on a\n             case-by-case basis in relation to the safety aspects and objectives of this study."
