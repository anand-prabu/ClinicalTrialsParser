  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the use of repetitive transcranial magnetic
      stimulation (rTMS) in helping to prevent relapse in major depressive disorder. rTMS is known
      to be an effective treatment for major depressive disorder, but there is also evidence that
      it may be effective in the maintenance of remission following treatment. However, it is not
      yet clear what maintenance strategy will yield the best outcome in preventing relapse.

      In this study, eligible patients who have finished one full course of rTMS for treatment of
      major depression will be randomized into three groups: (i) cluster rTMS, (ii) taper rTMS,
      and (iii) treatment as usual. The 'cluster rTMS' group will receive two weeks to daily rTMS
      four months after the completion of their regular rTMS treatment, the 'taper rTMS' group
      will receive three sessions a week for two weeks followed by two sessions a week for two
      weeks immediately following their regular rTMS treatment, while the 'treatment as usual'
      group will receive standard follow-up care from their own psychiatrist and/or primary care
      doctor.

      The investigators hypothesize that the group with cluster treatment will show significantly
      lower relapse rates in depressive symptoms as compared to the other groups.

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy of rTMS to the dorsolateral
      prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) as a maintenance therapy following standard rTMS treatment in
      major depressive disorder.

      A total of 45 patients will be recruited for this study. Patients who have completed a
      standard six-week rTMS treatment for major depressive disorder will be randomly assigned to
      one of the three groups: cluster rTMS, taper rTMS, and treatment as usual.  Patients in the
      'cluster' group will receive two weeks of daily rTMS (10 rTMS sessions) four months after
      completing their rTMS treatment.  Patients in the 'taper' group will receive rTMS
      immediately after completing rTMS treatment and the frequency of the sessions will be
      tapered as follows: three sessions a week for two weeks, and then two sessions a week for
      two weeks.  The maintenance plan for patients in 'treatment as usual' group will be decided
      individually and may include any or all of the following: continue or start on medication,
      start psychotherapy and/or follow-up visits with psychiatrist or primary care provider.

      Each session of rTMS will be identical: lasting about one hour and consisting of 3000 high
      frequency (10 Hz) pulses. After finishing their last session of rTMS treatment, all patients
      will be seen by the rTMS psychiatrists bi-monthly for up to two years. Each visit will last
      approximately half an hour during which time the Hamilton Depression (Ham-D) Scale will be
      administered.

      Given the high relapse rates following rTMS treatment for depression, the investigators hope
      that results from this study will be very helpful to patients suffering from major
      depressive disorder in improving their quality of life by reducing their rate of relapse.
