Patients receive test meals of Sustacal on days 3 and 4 and are\n      assessed for insulin response.\n\n      Beginning on day 5, patients are given recombinant human insulin-like growth factor I\n      subcutaneously every 12 hours for a total of 3 doses.  The first dose (on day 5) is given 30\n      minutes before a Sustacal challenge, the second dose is followed by a bedtime snack, and the\n      third dose (on day 6) is followed by a supervised fast."
