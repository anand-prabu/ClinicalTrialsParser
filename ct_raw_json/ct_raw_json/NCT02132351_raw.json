Four thousand hepatologists will be invited\n      to participate in the questionnaire through e-mail invitations to answer 50 questions of the\n      questionnaire. The questionnaire will be hosted on Survey monkey website and results will be\n      analyzed to get the consensus opinion of participants for the use of invasive and\n      non-invasive methods for assessment of hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis and factors affecting\n      their preferences.\n\n      Statistical analysis plan Analysis of data will be performed using SPSS 17 (Statistical\n      Package for Scientific Studies) for Windows. Description of qualitative variables will be in\n      the form of numbers (No.) and percent (%). Description of quantitative variables will be in\n      the form of mean, standard deviation (SD). Questionnaire results will be compared against\n      different baseline characteristics of the studied group. According to the type and\n      distribution of data, suitable tests for inferential statistics will be used.  Significance\n      of the results will be presented in the form of P-value."
