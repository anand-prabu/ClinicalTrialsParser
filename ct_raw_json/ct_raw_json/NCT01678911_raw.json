Subjects\n      with Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Interstitial Cystitis, Ulcerative Colitis, and Prostatitis\n      will be recruited. The purpose of this research is to look at how the study drug can be used\n      to benefit people who experience this type of pain. This is a phase IV study done to study\n      the safety and effectiveness of the drug. At this point the drug has been approved by the\n      Food and Drug Administration and has been reported to be well tolerated and effective in the\n      treatment of various chronic pain conditions, particularly in neuropathic pain. About 36\n      subjects will take part in this study."

The amount of weeks on placebo versus the study drug will not be\n      equal. You will be assigned a study group by chance using a process similar to the flip of a\n      coin. This process is called randomization.  Neither you nor the study staff will select the\n      group you will be in. However, if you have a medical emergency, we can get this information.\n      A placebo looks like the study drug but is an inactive substance that has no medication.\n      Researchers use a placebo to see if the study drug works better or is safer than not taking\n      anything."
