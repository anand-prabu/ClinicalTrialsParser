Determine the response rate in patients with Philadelphia chromosome positive chronic\n      phase chronic myelogenous leukemia treated with imatinib mesylate.\n\n      II. Determine the disease-free survival of patients treated with this drug. III. Determine\n      the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients. IV. Determine the toxic effects of this\n      drug in these patients. V. Determine the rates of hematological, cytogenetic, and molecular\n      response and time to response in patients treated with this drug.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to disease (chronic\n      myelogenous leukemia [CML] in first chronic phase after failing interferon therapy or\n      demonstrating intolerance to interferon [closed to accrual as of 12/05/03] vs CML relapsing\n      after stem cell transplantation or in second or subsequent chronic phase [closed to accrual\n      as of 7/29/05] vs newly diagnosed CML in first chronic phase with no prior treatment [closed\n      to accrual as of 7/29/05] vs newly diagnosed CML in first chronic phase with no prior\n      treatment).\n\n      Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate once daily on days 1-28.
