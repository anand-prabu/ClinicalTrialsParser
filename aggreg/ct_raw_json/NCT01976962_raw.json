By using advanced functional imaging techniques available\n      on state-of-the-art MRI scanners to clearly show the specific location of the tumour inside\n      the prostate, the investigators can use advanced radiation therapy techniques to\n      specifically target the tumor and control it with as few radiotherapy clinic visits as\n      possible. This is different than current techniques which treat the whole prostate gland to\n      the same dose, delivered over 7-8 weeks of daily radiotherapy visits. By increasing the\n      radiation dose to the active tumor while still maintaining adequate radiation dose to the\n      rest of the prostate, the investigators hope to better control prostate cancer and reduce\n      complications to nearby normal tissues."

The strategy will make\n      use of the combined effectiveness of several functional imaging approaches to identify the\n      dominant lesion(s) within the prostate. An SBRT treatment plan will be designed which\n      utilizes 5 fractions to treat the entire prostate gland with an additional boost to the\n      dominant lesion.  The lower dose to the entire prostate should reduce normal tissue\n      complications but still be effective in treating prostate cancer while the increased dose to\n      the dominant lesion should improve tumour control. The use of only 5 fractions will reduce\n      the number of patient visits, thus reducing overall treatment costs."
