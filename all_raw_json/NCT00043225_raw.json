Participants will have\n      blood tests, pulmonary function tests, a sputum culture, and buccal swabbing (cotton\n      swabbing of the inside of the cheek to collect cells for DNA study).  In addition, their\n      medical records will be reviewed for a history of lung infections and the results of various\n      tests, including pulmonary function studies, chest X-rays and bacterial cultures.  Blood\n      samples collected previously at the Medical College of Wisconsin or the University of\n      Wisconsin-Madison will also be analyzed for antibodies to bacteria.\n\n      Although this is a one-time study, participants may be asked to return for repeated tests."
