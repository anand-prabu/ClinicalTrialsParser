The study involves four single injections; two doses of\n      LY2963016 and two doses of US-approved Lantus\u00ae. The study will have 4 periods. In each\n      period, a single injection will be administered before undergoing a euglycemic clamp that\n      lasts for 24 hours. There will be at least a 7 day washout between each period. Side effects\n      will be documented. Study participation is expected to last up to 14 weeks."
