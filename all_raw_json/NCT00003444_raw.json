It is not yet known whether giving\n      radiation therapy with interferon alfa-2b is more effective than giving interferon alfa-2b\n      alone in treating melanoma.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of radiation therapy plus\n      interferon alfa-2b with that of interferon alfa-2b alone in treating patients who have\n      melanoma that has metastasized to lymph nodes in the neck, under the arm, or in the groin."

Evaluate the effectiveness of postoperative hypofractionated radiotherapy in\n      combination with high dose interferon in preventing regional relapse in patients with\n      malignant melanoma with any number of nodes with clinical extracapsular extension or\n      previous nodal basin recurrence. II. Evaluate the effectiveness of this therapy in\n      prolonging relapse free and overall survival in this patient population. III. Evaluate the\n      toxicity of this therapy in this patient population.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified according to prior nodal basin\n      recurrence, site of disease, and extracapsular extension. Following surgery, patients are\n      randomized to receive either interferon alfa-2b alone or five treatments of radiotherapy\n      followed by interferon alfa-2b. Patients receive radiotherapy 2 days a week for 2.5 weeks.\n      Patients receive interferon alfa-2b IV over 20 minutes daily for 5 days for a total of 28\n      days, followed by subcutaneous injections 3 times a week for 48 weeks. Patients are followed\n      every 3 months for 2 years, then every 6 months for 3 years, then annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 167 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years."
