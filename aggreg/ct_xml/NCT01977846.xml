  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stargardt disease is currently an incurable and untreatable macular dystrophy that causes
      severe visual loss in children and young adults, thereby causing enormous morbidity with
      economic, psychological, emotional, and social implications. There are no FDA approved
      therapeutic treatments for this disease. Therefore, the objective of this study is to
      collect natural history data from a large population of children and adults in order to
      evaluate possible efficacy measures for planned clinical trials.

      Participants will be recruited from each Investigator's own patient population as the study
      requires the availability of both multiyear retrospective data, as well as ongoing
      prospectively collected data.

  <eligibility>
    <study_pop>
      <textblock>
        The study population shall consist of up to 250 Stargardt disease patients (minimum of 150
        patients) recruited at up to 14 clinical centers across the US and Europe.  Participants
        must be at least 6 years old, able to cooperate in performing the examinations and be
        willing to attend their regular 6 month follow-up visits for up to 24 months.

        The participants must present with atrophic lesions secondary to STGD with a minimum
        diameter of 300 microns and all lesions together must add to at least 12 mm2 (equivalent
        to no more than 5 disc areas) in a least 1 eye. Participants should be previously
        genotyped and have at least 2 confirmed pathogenic mutations in the ABCA4 gene. If only 1
        ABCA4 allele contains a pathogenic mutation, then the patient needs typical phenotype,
        i.e. at least one eye must have flecks at the level of the retinal pigment epithelium
        typical for STGD. Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) must be 20 ETDRS letters (20/400
        Snellen equivalent) or better.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Provide a signed informed consent form and authorization allowing the disclosure and
             use of protected health information.

          -  The designated primary study eye must have at least one well-demarcated area of
             atrophy as imaged by fundus autofluorescence with a minimum diameter of 300 microns
             and all lesions together must add to less than or equal to 12 mm2 (equivalent to no
             more than 5 disc areas in a least one eye) and a BCVA of 20 ETDRS letters (20/400
             Snellen equivalent) or better.

          -  Two (2) pathogenic mutations confirmed present, in the ABCA4 gene. If only one ABCA4
             allele contains a pathogenic mutation, the patient shall have a typical Stargardt
             phenotype, namely at least one eye must have flecks at the level of the retinal
             pigment epithelium typical for STGD.

          -  The primary study eye must have clear ocular media and adequate pupillary dilation to
             permit good quality FAF and sd-OCT imaging in the opinion of the investigator.

          -  Be able to cooperate in performing the examinations.

          -  Be willing to undergo ocular examinations once every 6 months for up to 24 months.

          -  Be at least six years old.

          -  Both eyes can be included if inclusion criteria are fulfilled for both eyes.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Ocular disease, such as choroidal neovascularization, glaucoma and diabetic
             retinopathy, in either eye that may confound assessment of the retina morphologically
             and functionally.

          -  Intraocular surgery in the primary study eye within 90 days prior to baseline visit.

          -  Current or previous participation in an interventional study to treat STGD such as
             gene therapy or stem cell therapy. Current participation in a drug trial or previous
             participation in a drug trial within six months before enrollment. The use of oral
             supplements of vitamins and minerals are permitted although the current use of
             Vitamin A supplementation shall be documented.

          -  The site Principal Investigator may declare any patient at their site ineligible to
             participate in the study for a sound medical reason prior to the patient's enrollment
             into the study.

          -  Any systemic disease with a limited survival prognosis (e.g. cancer, severe/unstable
             cardiovascular disease).

          -  Any condition that would interfere with the patient attending their regular follow-up
             visits every 6 months for up to 24 months, e.g. personality disorder, use of major
             tranquilizers such as Haldol or Phenothiazine, chronic alcoholism, Alzheimer's
             Disease or drug abuse.

          -  Evidence of significant uncontrolled concomitant diseases such as cardiovascular,
             neurological, pulmonary, renal, hepatic, endocrine or gastro-intestinal disorders.
