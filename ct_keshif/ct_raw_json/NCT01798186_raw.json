Must not have history of significant medical or psychiatric illness judged by the\n             investigator to put the participant at greater risk of experiencing an adverse event\n             due to exposure or completion of other study procedures.\n\n         10. Cannot have been enrolled in another clinical trial or have received any drug as part\n             of a research study within 30 days prior to dosing.\n\n         11. No history of panic/anxiety reaction to extended periods of confinement in close\n             quarters, smoke filled areas, or tight social situations.\n\n         12.
