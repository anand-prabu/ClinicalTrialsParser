Initially we instilled at most 0.5 ml saline solution(SS) at 0.9% followed by 10 manual hyperinflation maneuvers interspersed with 10 vibrocompression maneuvers and as a last procedure, we performed an aspiration of the orotracheal tube airways and mouth. Between the aspirations the child was re-connected to the ventilator.",
