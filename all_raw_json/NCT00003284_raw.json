Combining chemotherapy with peripheral stem cell\n      transplantation may allow the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill\n      more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of high-dose combination chemotherapy\n      followed by peripheral stem cell transplantation in treating patients with lung cancer."

Evaluate the response rate of high dose chemotherapy followed by autologous\n      peripheral blood stem cell transplantation in the treatment of lung cancer.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients undergo stem cell harvesting. Patients receive radiation therapy to\n      primary site and metastatic sites, if necessary. Patients receive a high dose of paclitaxel\n      by 24 hour continuous infusion, then stem cells are infused 72 hours later. After a 3-4 week\n      recovery period, patients receive ifosfamide and carboplatin by daily continuous infusion on\n      days -7, -6, -5, and -4. Etoposide is administered by continuous infusion twice daily on\n      days -7, -6, -5, and -4. Stem cells are again infused on day 0. Filgrastim (granulocyte\n      colony-stimulating factor; G-CSF) begins on day 0. Patients may receive radiotherapy\n      following recovery from chemotherapy. Patients are followed weekly for the first 6 months,\n      then periodically for at least 2 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: This study will accrue 30 patients in 3 years."
