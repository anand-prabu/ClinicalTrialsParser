In\n      order to prevent seizures, many surgeons administer prophylactic anti-epileptic medication\n      during the intra-operative and post-operative period, however, such practice is not\n      supported by clinical data.  Retrospective review found the incidence of postoperative\n      seizures was higher in those who received anti-epileptics versus those who did not.  The\n      goal is to examine the utility of levetiracetam (Keppra) for seizure prophylaxis in patients\n      undergoing surgical repair of ruptured and unruptured intracranial aneurysms."
