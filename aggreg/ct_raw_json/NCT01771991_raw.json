Patients will be randomized to alternatively receive\n      topical SOD or placebo as instructed on twice daily use for 3 months. Pre and post treatment\n      quality of life surveys and objective assessment will determine if the topical SOD improves\n      neck fibrosis/function and global quality of life.\n\n      This study will increase clinical trial awareness and participation while potentially\n      improving the long term functional outcomes of head and neck cancer patients."
