      An open-label, clinical trial of autologous cMet redirected T cells administered
      intratumorally (IT) in patients with breast cancer.  Fifteen evaluable patients will be
      enrolled in stepwise fashion.  Step 1 will enroll patients with metastatic breast cancer
      refractory to at least 1 standard therapy, step 2 will include newly diagnosed patients with
      operable triple negative breast cancer.

      This study is designed to determine the safety and feasibility of intratumoral
      administration of autologous T cells that have had genetic material transferred into the
      cell to redirect them to target breast cancer cells rather than their usual target.
      Eligible subjects will have metastatic breast cancer refractory to at least one standard
      therapy or to newly diagnosed with operable triple negative breast cancer.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Step 1 subjects only: metastatic breast patients refractory to at least one standard
             therapy, with easily accessible metastatic deposits (cutaneous, subcutaneous, or
             superficial and/or palpable adenopathy/mass).

          -  Step 2 subjects only: Newly diagnosed, operable, triple negative breast cancer, i.e.
             ER/PRnegative, her2/neu-negative, with tumor size between between 2- 5 cm (T2) as
             measured by either clinical breast exam, mammogram, ultrasound or MRI, with or
             without ipsilateral axilla node involvement (N0 or N1).

          -  cMet expression in greater than or equal to 30% tumor cells as demonstrated on
             immuno-histochemistry analysis of archival slides. Punch biopsy or percutaneous core
             biopsy may be offered to Cohort 1 patients.

          -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years old

          -  Baseline Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Clinical Performance Status 0 or 1

          -  Life expectancy greater than 6 months

          -  WBC greater than or equal to 3.0

          -  Plt greater than or equal to 75,000

          -  Hgb greater than or equal to 10 g/dl

          -  dequate renal function established within 14 days before treatment defined as serum
             creatinine less than 1.5 times upper limit of normal

          -  Adequate hepatic function established within 14 days before treatment defined as:

          -  Total bilirubin less than 1.5 times upper limit of normal, and

          -  ALT and AST less than 2.5 times upper limit of normal

          -  Women of child bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test (blood or urine)
             within 14 days before treatment and agree to use appropriate contraception from study
             screen through the duration of the trial. Men must agree to use appropriate
             contraception from study screen through the duration of the trial.

          -  Tumor staging by standard imaging within the past 30 days (Step 1 subjects only).

          -  Signed and dated written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Step 1 subjects only:

          -  Currently taking cytotoxic chemotherapy; however, patients receiving
             non-investigational hormone therapy, lapatinib, and/or trastuzumab are eligible
             provided these medicines are at a stable dose and were begun more than 30 days prior
             to the first IT injection

          -  Metastatic deposits near a great vessel or spinal cord

          -  Step 2 subjects only:

          -  Prior therapy for breast cancer

          -  Women already undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy to treat their primary triple
             negative breast cancer

          -  Step 1 and 2 subjects:

          -  Positivity for HIV-1/HIV-2, Hepatitis B virus, and Hepatitis C virus active infection

          -  The use of the following within 30 days before treatment:

          -  Immunosuppressive drugs

          -  Systemic glucocorticoids

          -  Hematopoietic growth factors

          -  Experimental therapy

          -  Use of anti-coagulants such as coumadin, heparin, or Lovenox within 14 days before
             treatment

          -  Pregnant women or nursing mothers

          -  History of alcohol abuse or illicit drug use within 12 months of study initiation

             interpretation of study results

          -  Significant psychiatric disorder and any other reason in the Investigators opinion
             that would jeopardize protocol compliance or compromise the patients ability to give
             informed consent.

          -  Prior MI ascertained from medical history and review of systems
