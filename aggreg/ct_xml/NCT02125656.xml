  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleep is an essential biological process for life and great value to functions such as
      learning, memory processing , cell and brain repair. Recently, new evidence points to the
      relationship between lack of sleep and carbohydrate metabolism , establishing a framework
      for insulin resistance observed in studies with restriction and sleep deprivation on several
      nights and in a single night . To reverse this process , one of the most effective
      strategies is physical exercise and part listed in the literature as a non-pharmacological
      tool for prevention and health promotion , as well as in the treatment of some diseases .
      However , the pace of modern society causes people to practice less physical exercise , lack
      of time being the main reason . In this scenario, the High Intensity Interval Training (
      HIIT ) emerges as a powerful strategy that induces major changes optimizing the time spent
      on such activity. Considering the benefits of this mode , the purpose of this study is to
      investigate the effects of high-intensity interval training in the context of insulin
      resistance observed during sleep deprivation.  Will be recruited 20 male volunteers, aged
      between 18 and 35 years old, healthy, with normal sleep duration equivalent to 7-8 hours /
      night, not smoking and regular eating habits. They will be submitted to a protocol of 6
      sessions of high-intensity interval training for two weeks, and since the end period, sleep
      normally, or be deprived of sleep for 24 hours. Biochemical (thyroid hormones, cortisol,
      glucagon, free fatty acid, cholesterol, glucose and insulin) will be undertaken as well as
      evaluation of body composition by plethysmography, basal metabolic rate by indirect
      calorimetry and insulin sensitivity through Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) before and
      after the training period.

    <description>Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT)  is performed after at least 8 hours of fasting overnight, by oral administration of standard dose of 75g anhydrous glucose dissolved in water (dextrose). The plasma glucose levels are fasting measured (before administration of glucose state) and 30, 60, 90, 120, 180 and 240 minutes after administration. Volunteers will be advised to follow the same eating patterns before testing.</description>

    <description>6 sessions in 2 weeks (Monday, Wednesday and Friday). Each training session will consist of repeated high-intensity efforts in a workload that matches the peak oxygen uptake for 60 seconds. These sprints are interspersed with active recovery for 75 seconds on low intensity (30W). The training sessions will have three minutes of heating in 30W. There will be 8 shots in the first and second session, 10 shots in the third and fourth session and 12 shots in the fifth and sixth session.</description>
