Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy is the major molecular bond coupling\n      between the atoms vibrational spectra and molecular rotational spectra.\n\n      In this study, consists of three phases:\n\n      Stage one:\n\n      Continuous enrollment requires inpatient surgery 300 cases of thyroid cancer patients and\n      breast cancer patients, 200 cases of preoperative determination of tumor on the surface\n      infrared spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy of the anterior tumor tissue and lymph node\n      surgery, measured in vivo; at the same time into the group of 50 patients healthy people,\n      the determination of surface infrared spectroscopy of the thyroid and breast area. Paraffin\n      pathological findings as the gold standard, the thyroid and breast cancer patients were\n      divided into the benign group and malignant group, relatively healthy and good, the\n      distribution of differences of the surface infrared spectrum of malignant group, while\n      relatively good in the malignant group IR spectra of the distribution of differences.\n\n      Phase II:\n\n      Were enrolled, infrared spectroscopy and pathological specimens were collected at different\n      stages. Paraffin pathological findings as the gold standard, were established two tumor\n      surface, the infrared spectra of the fresh in vitro and in vivo for tumor benign or\n      malignant diagnosis discrimination system.\n\n      Phase III:\n\n      Into the infrared spectra collected data on behalf of the above-mentioned discrimination\n      system to verify its sensitivity, specificity and accuracy; both paraffin pathological\n      findings as the gold standard to compare the infrared spectral discrimination systems and\n      intraoperative frozen section pathology for the diagnosis of benign and malignant tumors\n      correctly rate differences, to explore the clinical value of infrared spectroscopy\n      discrimination system."
