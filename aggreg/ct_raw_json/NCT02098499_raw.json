Research data was derived from an IRB approved protocol. All subjects met IHS migraine\n      criteria and received a one liter bolus of normal saline plus 25 milligrams (mg) of\n      diphenhydramine. Subjects were subsequently randomized to receive 10 mg metoclopramide or 5\n      mg haloperidol IV. Pain was self-reported at onset and at 20 minute intervals using a 100mm\n      visual analog scale (VAS). Adequate pain control was considered to be patient satisfaction\n      with symptomatic relief. If adequate pain relief was not obtained after 80 minutes, rescue\n      medication was given at the treating physician's discretion.  Adverse reactions were\n      recorded and electrocardiograms (ECGs) were obtained before and after study medication\n      administration.  Follow up phone surveys were performed 72 hours after discharge to assess\n      headache recurrence, adverse effects, and patient satisfaction."
