Determine the maximum tolerated dose and dose limiting toxicity of BMS-214662 in patients\n      with acute leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, or chronic myeloid leukemia in blast phase.\n\n      II. Determine any preliminary evidence of antileukemia activity of this drug in these\n      patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study.\n\n      Patients receive BMS-214662 IV over 1 hour weekly for 4 weeks. Treatment continues every 4\n      weeks for a maximum of 12 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease\n      progression.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of BMS-214662 until the maximum tolerated\n      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6\n      patients experience dose limiting toxicities.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 30 patients will be accrued for this study within 10 months."
