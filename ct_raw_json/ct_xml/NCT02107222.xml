      A Multicenter, Randomized, Controlled Trial to Determine Safety and Efficacy of Pump
      Assisted Lung Protection (PALP™) for Low Flow Carbon Dioxide (CO2) Removal in Conjunction
      with Liberation from Mechanical Ventilation Compared to Mechanical Ventilation Alone in
      Patients with COPD Exacerbation and Respiratory Failure

      Primary Study Objectives

      • To evaluate the clinical effect of PALP™ in reducing the time on invasive ventilation in
      patients with an exacerbation of COPD requiring invasive mechanical ventilation.

      Secondary Study Objectives

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of PALP™ in patients with an exacerbation of
           COPD requiring invasive mechanical ventilation.

        -  To determine if rates of adverse events (AEs) are reduced in patients who receive PALP™
           and invasive mechanical ventilation vs invasive mechanical ventilation alone.

        -  To determine mortality rates in patients who receive PALP™ and invasive mechanical
           ventilation vs invasive mechanical ventilation alone.

        -  To determine if PALP™ will effectively reduce the number of subsequent acute
           decompensations requiring hospital admission for ventilatory support (invasive or
           noninvasive).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female, and ≥40 years of age

          2. Known history of COPD

          3. Currently experiencing an exacerbation of COPD

          4. P/F ratio &gt;150 mmHg

          5. Currently endotracheally intubated and requiring invasive mechanical ventilation
             (must have been on invasive mechanical ventilation for 24-48 hours)

          6. Able to tolerate large bore intravenous (IV) cannulation required for proper
             operation of study device

          7. For female patients of child-bearing potential, a negative urine or serum pregnancy
             test at screening; all female patients will be considered of child-bearing potential
             unless they are post menopausal for at least 1 year or have been surgically
             sterilized (bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, or hysterectomy)

          8. Written informed consent obtained according to local regulations; or, if unable to
             provide written informed consent due to incapacitation, a legally authorized
             representative is able to provide written informed consent on behalf of the patient

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any end-stage medical conditions with expected survival &lt;6 months

          2. Tracheostomy

          3. Unable to provide central venous access

          4. Acute brain injury

          5. Any legally authorized document(s) that may restrict aggressive medical management
             such as &quot;Do Not Resuscitate,&quot; &quot;Do Not Intubate,&quot; etc.

          6. Risk of bleeding or clotting such as:

               -  Known bleeding diathesis or abnormal clotting

               -  Recent or current use of medications known to increase risk of bleeding

             or activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) &gt;1.5 times the upper limit of normal
             (ULN) range for their respective laboratory values
