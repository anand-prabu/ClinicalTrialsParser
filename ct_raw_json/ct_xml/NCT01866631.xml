        To retropsectively review the NCIS registry of females diagnosed with breast cancer in
        years 2002 to 2008 with regards to clinical quality indicators as published by the
        European Sociaty of Breast Cancer Oncologists (Eur J Can 2010; 46:2344-2356). We will
        extract data from a pre-existing breast cancer registry which belongs to NCIS, looking at
        data which includes the following:(1) Completeness of clinical and imaging diagnostic
        work-up(2) Completeness of prognostic and predictive characterization(3) Multidisciplinary
        discussion(4) Appropriate surgical approach(5) Appropriate post-operative radiation(6)
        Avoidance of over-treatment(7) Appropraiet hormonal therapy(8) Appropriate chemotherapy
        and other medical therapy(9) Staging, counselling, follow-up and rehabilitative procedures
