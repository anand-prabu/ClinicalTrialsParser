During each intervention, glucose profiles will be continuously\n      monitored by continuous glucose monitoring (CGMS). The duration of each intervention is 3d\n      (mimimum) to 6d (maximum), depending on the quality of night-time glucose control and the\n      technical quality of glucose sensor readings. Between the interventions, the patients follow\n      their normal prescribed diet."
