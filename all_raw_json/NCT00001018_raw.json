In\n      each group, six patients are randomized to receive letrazuril and two patients receive\n      matching placebo. In the pharmacokinetics determination phase of the study, patients receive\n      a single dose of letrazuril or placebo following a meal. Following a 72-hour blood\n      collection, patients enter the blinded, treatment phase of the study and receive letrazuril\n      or placebo as a single dose daily, after a meal, for 3 weeks. Patients with persistent\n      Cryptosporidium oocysts in their stools at the end of the blinded treatment phase may\n      continue with open-label treatment of letrazuril at the same dose for 4 weeks; the dose may\n      subsequently be escalated every 4 weeks, to a maximum, if oocysts persist. Patients who have\n      Cryptosporidium oocysts eradicated from their stools will discontinue treatment and be\n      followed for 3 months. All patients undergo clinical follow-up at 3 and 6 months."
