  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to help determine if palifermin and/or leuprolide acetate can
      help the immune system recover faster following a stem cell transplant. Blood stem cells are
      very young blood cells that grow in the body to become red or white blood cells or
      platelets. The transplant uses stem cells in the blood from another person. The donor can be
      a family member or a volunteer donor. This is called an allogeneic stem cell transplant.

      The investigators want to see if palifermin and/or leuprolide acetate can help the immune
      system recover faster after an allogenic transplant because experiments have shown they may
      be able to do this.
