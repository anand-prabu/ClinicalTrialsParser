  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Limitation of activity is one of the main item used by composites scores designed to assess
      the level of asthma control. Since this item is systematically subjectively assessed by the
      patient, the investigators would like to know if these subjective data are correlated with
      objective data.

      Aims of this study are: 1) To describe what means &quot;limitation of activity&quot; for asthma
      patients and how they deal with; 2) To describe the objective exercise capacity and
      characteristics of daily activity in two situations (on exacerbation, out of an
      exacerbation).
