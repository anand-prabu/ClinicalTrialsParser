The effects on safety and efficacy caused by changing the administration method of\n           metformin hydrochloride associated with switching to Metact Combination Tablets\n\n        2. The effects on compliance associated with switching to Metact Combination Tablets\n\n        3. Safety and efficacy in patients who showed inadequate response to pioglitazone\n           hydrochloride and were then switched to Metact Combination Tablets\n\n      The planned sample size was 1000 participants. The usual adult dosage is one tablet of\n      Metact administered orally once daily after breakfast (15 mg/500 mg or 30 mg/500 mg of\n      pioglitazone/metformin hydrochloride).\n\n      <Precautions Related to Dosage and Administration> Edema due to pioglitazone administration\n      has been reported with comparative frequency in women. Therefore, it is preferable to be\n      vigilant for edema and start Metact Combination Tablets at a dosage equivalent to 15 mg of\n      pioglitazone once daily when administering the study drug to women."
