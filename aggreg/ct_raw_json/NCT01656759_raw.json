The\n      patient and the independent reviewer will be blinded as to which treatment group the patient\n      is assigned to. This information will be linked to a confidential database for later review\n      by the principal investigator.\n\n      Treatment allocation:\n\n      All eligible patients (i.e., meeting inclusion criteria and no exclusion criteria) will be\n      treated and observed per the research protocol. All patients will maintain the right to\n      refuse participation and receive a specific treatment of the study if desired.\n\n      Trial Population:\n\n      The target sample size is 70 patients for both the treatment and control groups (140 total)\n      with each group split evenly between males and females. There will be one actively enrolling\n      surgeon (Dr. Brett Levine). The goal is to enroll a total of 140 subjects experiencing joint\n      pain that warrants a TKA. The specific diagnosis for the joint pain will not direct the\n      subjects' assignment or eligibility at the time of surgery. All 140 patients will be\n      enrolled from the office of the primary investigator (Dr. Brett Levine). All indications for\n      TKA will be included unless one of the exclusion criteria is met."
