  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether bilateral orthotopic lung transplantation
      (BOLT) followed by cadaveric partially-matched hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
      (HSCT) is safe and effective for patients aged 5-40 years with primary immunodeficiency
      (PID) and end-stage lung disease.

    <textblock>
      This is an original IND for an investigator initiated phase I/II study. The primary purpose
      of the study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of performing bilateral orthotopic lung
      transplantation (BOLT) followed by cadaveric, partially HLA-matched CD3+/CD19+-depleted
      hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) from the same donor for patients with primary
      immunodeficiency diseases (PID) and end-stage lung disease.  For many patients with primary
      immunodeficiencies, HSCT is a curative, life-saving therapy, resulting in restoration of
      function in the immune system. Patients with primary immunodeficiencies often develop
      pulmonary complications as a result of chronic or recurrent infections, making them
      ineligible for HSCT due to the high risk of mortality and pulmonary complications. Lung
      transplant prior to HSCT would allow for restoration of pulmonary function prior to HSCT,
      allowing PID patients to proceed to HSCT, which would be curative for the patient's
      underlying immunodeficiency.  As a secondary aim after successful engraftment with donor
      bone marrow, there is realistic hope for tolerating planned withdrawal of immunosuppression
      achieving eventual freedom from all immunosuppressive drugs and attaining a tolerant state.
