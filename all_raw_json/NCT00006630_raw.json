It is the only treatment available for those\n      viruses. The only available supply of VIG has developed a discoloration over time and\n      therefore is considered an investigational new drug by the FDA. This study will allow it to\n      be used for intramuscular injection in a controlled setting for people who may need it\n      [during HIV vaccine research]."

It is\n      the only product available for the treatment of vaccinia and other orthopox infections. The\n      only lot currently available was released as a licensed product in 1995 but is being treated\n      as an investigational new drug because of slight discoloration in the solution. This study\n      makes existing stocks of VIG available as a short-term solution for the lack of a licensed\n      immune globulin to treat vaccinal infections.\n\n      Before receiving injections and 3 and 6 months after injections, patients are tested for\n      HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C with pre- and post-test counseling. Referrals for\n      appropriate medical care are provided. Participants have multiple injections (depending on\n      body weight) of VIG at 1 or 2 clinic visits. Following administration of VIG, participants\n      are observed for 1/2 hour at the clinic. Participants return to the clinic for as many as 10\n      visits to monitor for any adverse reactions and signs and symptoms of vaccinia infections.\n      On Days 7, 84, and 168 participants return to the clinic for evaluations and have blood\n      drawn to check for the response to the VIG injections."
