  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over the past years, endovascular interventions have become an important part of treatment
      in patients with peripheral arterial disease.1 Indication for endovascular repair of
      femoropopliteal lesions has been considerably enlarged as shown in the TASC classification.1
      Enlargement of endovascular therapy indication was based on patient choice for a less
      invasive technique and evidence based medicine. Consequently, TASC classification of lesions
      has been modified to reflect increased evidence for endovascular treatment of more extensive
      femoropopliteal lesions, and indication for endovascular repair has been enlarged to more
      severe TASC types. In summary, endovascular treatment is indicated for TASC A and B lesions
      which correspond to femoropopliteal lesions ≤15-cm. To treat these lesions, the
      interventionalists have at their disposal a huge tool box. Evaluation of these tools is
      crucial to determine the right treatment strategy to avoid further reinterventions and
      overcosts.

      The objective of the BATTLE trial is to compare a bare metal self expandable nitinol stent
      (Misago RX) versus a paclitaxel eluting stent (Zilver PTX) in the treatment of
      above-the-knee intermediate length femoropopliteal lesions.

      From hospitals in Europe (France, Switzerland) we will randomly assign patients with
      symptomatic atherosclerotic femoropopliteal lesions to be treated either by bare metal stent
      or paclitaxel eluting stent. In total, 186 patients will be randomized (93 per group).
