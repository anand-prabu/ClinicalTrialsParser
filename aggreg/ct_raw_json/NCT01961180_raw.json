Furthermore there are changes similar to those\n      seen in diabetes.\n\n      Cipralex is known to decrease stress hormones. But no investigations are on the effect of\n      cipralex on PCOS, or how the increased stress hormones affect the PCOS condition.\n\n      We will examine 2x20 women with PCOS. They will be randomized to Cipralex or placebo.\n      Treatment duration is 12 weeks."
