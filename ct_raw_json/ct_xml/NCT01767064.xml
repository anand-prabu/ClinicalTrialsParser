  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inappropriate antibiotic prescribing for acute respiratory infections (ARIs) persists
      despite decades of intervention efforts. Negative outcomes of inappropriate antibiotics
      include increased costs of care, adverse drug reactions, and rising prevalence of
      antibiotic-resistant bacteria. To address this public health problem, we apply the
      principles of commitment and consistency in an effort to influence clinician decision-making
      through the implementation of a low-cost behavioral &quot;nudge&quot; in the form of a simple public
      commitment device.  Clinicians were asked to post in their exam room a signed letter
      indicating their commitments to reducing inappropriate antibiotic use for ARIs. Our
      hypothesis is that clinicians displaying the poster-sized commitment letters will decrease
      their inappropriate antibiotic prescribing for ARIs as compared to clinicians in the control
      condition (with no posted letter).

    <description>Using data from electronic health records, we will calculate clinician antibiotic prescribing rates for antibiotic-inappropriate ARI diagnoses: acute nasopharyngitis (ICD-9 460.x), acute laryngitis without obstruction (465.8), acute laryngopharyngitis (465.0), acute bronchitis (466.x), acute upper respiratory infections of other multiple sites (465.8), acute upper respiratory infections not otherwise specified (465.9), bronchitis not specified as acute or chronic (490.x), non-streptococcal pharyngitis (462.xx), and influenza with other respiratory manifestations (487.1).  To control for temporal trends in antibiotic prescribing and provider-fixed effects, we will fit a logistic mixed effects model that predicts inappropriate antibiotic prescribing as a function of study arm and an indicator for baseline versus intervention period (a difference-in-differences regression).</description>

    <description>The poster-sized (18x24 inches) commitment letter, written at the 8th grade reading-level and displayed in English and Spanish, emphasize clinician commitment to guidelines for appropriate antibiotic prescribing and explain why antibiotics are not appropriate in many cases.  These letters, featuring clinician photographs and signatures, are displayed in clinician exam rooms for a 16-week period.</description>
