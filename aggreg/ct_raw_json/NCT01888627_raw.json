            "textblock": "The trial is carried out at the Psychosis Center of the Department of Psychiatry and\n      Psychotherapy at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE), which has the\n      responsibility to treat all adult psychosis patients within its catchment area of\n      approximately 300.000 habitants.\n\n      The IC model was implemented into a network of the Psychosis Center of the University\n      hospital (UKE), private psychiatrists of the UKE catchment area and other outpatient\n      facilities. As such, following health care structures are part of the model and could be\n      used by each patients and its relatives according to need:\n\n        -  Specialized inpatient unit with attached day-clinic for psychotic disorders;\n\n        -  Acute inpatient unit of the Department;\n\n        -  Specialized psychosis outpatient center separated into a schizophrenia-spectrum and\n           bipolar outpatient teams with a variety of diagnosis-specific evidence-based\n           individual- and group therapies, low-threshold offers to promote day structure (e.g.,\n           cooking, sport or art groups), an early detection and intervention service with a\n           mobile early detection team with professionals from the child- and youth and adult\n           psychiatry, possibility of peer-to-peer and relatives-to-relatives counseling, relative\n           groups, etc.;\n\n        -  A multidisciplinary assertive community treatment (ACT) team, which was basically\n           implemented according to guidelines of the Assertive Community Treatment Association\n           and according to the Dartmouth Assertive Community Treatment Scale (DACTS). However,\n           compared to the traditional ACT model there are two im-portant differences: (1) While\n           traditional ACT models have a responsibility for SPMI patients independent from the\n           underlying diagnosis, the present model solely focus on patients with psychotic\n           disorders; (2) The fidelity of the ACT team was further increased by composing a team\n           of highly educated psychosis experts (i.e. consultant psychiatrists, psychiatrists,\n           psychologists, nurses, social worker). Members of the ACT team received\n           diagnosis-specific training in pharmacotherapy, cognitive behavioral (CBT), dynamic,\n           and/or family psychotherapy.\n\n        -  A specialized day-clinic for first-episode psychosis patients in the age range of 15-29\n           years managed by the child- and youth and adult psychiatry;\n\n        -  A working support outpatient center with outpatient and day-clinic treatment\n           facilities;\n\n        -  20 private psychiatrists participate in the treatment network of the IC model (their\n           duties and responsibilities are described below).\n\n        -  Further participants of the network are: a psychiatric nursing service, a specialized\n           housing support service and a specialized psychosis living unit.\n\n      Within this network, the main responsibility for the individual patient and his relatives is\n      generally allocated according to need and preferences to two specific members of the ACT\n      team, of which one has to be a psychiatrist responsible for pharmacotherapy. However, when\n      pharmacotherapy is stable and adherence assured, private psychiatrists are allowed to take\n      over this responsibility. In this case, the specific IC contract with the private\n      psychiatrists includes several quality assurance guidelines.\n\n      Briefly, the staff/client caseload ratio of a single full time employed ACT team member is\n      1:15-25. In any case, the first responsibility of the network is a broad assessment of the\n      psychotic disorder, comorbid psychiatric and somatic disorders, traumatic events, previous\n      service engagement and medication adherence, social problems, etc. Thereby, a need-adapted\n      treatment plan will be developed together with the patient, relatives and other caregivers.\n      If the patient starts IC during inpatient, transition from in- to outpatient care will be\n      organized. Participant, relatives and other caregiver re-ceive two telephone numbers: one of\n      the ACT therapists for all contacts within office hours (Monday to Friday from 8 am to 6 pm)\n      and a 24 hours crisis number for all emergencies or questions outside office hours. The\n      primary ACT/private psychiatrists subteam is responsible for high-frequent face-to-face\n      treatment contacts fostering \"open-end\" continuity of care, coordinating treatment and\n      social support (case man-agement), promoting and ensuring service engagement and medication\n      adherence, and offering intensive need-adapted individual psychotherapy at the earliest\n      possible time point. Crisis intervention is offered at any time and is always conducted by\n      two ACT members of which one is the primary ACT therapist. Access to other need-adapted and\n      diagnosis-specific evidence-based interventions is organized within the specialized\n      psychosis outpatient center or the work support center, e.g. psychoeducation groups, social\n      skills training, meta-cognitive training, bipolar psychotherapy groups, etc. Further, all\n      low-threshold interventions in the outpatient center could be used at any time. Thereby\n      day-clinic equivalent program could be organized while being in outpatient status. As many\n      of these patients are at risk for service disengagement and medication non-adherence, a\n      strict 'no-drop-out' policy is implemented including all admissions out of the catchment\n      area.\n\n      Managed Care Briefly, the UKE is the managed care organization for the IC model and has full\n      financial responsibility. The UKE receives a yearly per-patient rate, which was calculated\n      according to real direct health care costs of the individual patient including inpatient-,\n      day-clinic- and outpatient treatment. More then 20% of this rate is caused by 'hospital\n      hopping' and re-peated emergency room visits. Within one year the calculated yearly\n      per-patient rate now includes: (1) all inpatient days, (2) all day-clinic, (3) all\n      interventions by the ACT team, (4) all interventions in the Specialized psychosis outpatient\n      center, (5) all inter-ventions by private psychiatrists (they receive 4-times higher\n      finances per-patient per-year from the overall yearly per-patient rate), (6) all\n      psychotherapeutic interventions, (7) all assessments to insure quality of outcome, and (8)\n      all managed care facilities. There two specific arrangements: (1) the IC model starts\n      financially at the first day of admission to hospital. This arrangement supports a quick\n      enter into the new IC model and reduced the financial risks for the health insurances. (2)\n      One specific guideline within the model is to stop hospital hopping. To foster this\n      guideline, the UKE has to pay from the yearly per-patient rate every admission in a hospital\n      outside the network from the 4th day.\n\n      Assessments and measures Assessments are carried out at baseline, and at 6 weeks, 3, 6, 12,\n      18, 24, 30, 36, 42, and 48 months follow-ups. At baseline, following variables were\n      assessed: 1) Diagnosis of the psychotic disorder and co-morbid AXIS I disorder(s) with the\n      Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I disorders (SCID-I). In case of clinical\n      evidence for a co-morbid AXIS II disorder, a SCID-II interview for DSM-IV Personality\n      Disorder was applied40; 2) demographic and illness characteristics were assessed with the\n      German version of Early Psychosis File Questionnaire (EPFQ) including age, gender, marital\n      status, years of school education, completed professional education, employment/occupation\n      at entry, ability of independent living, traumatic events, family history of psychiatric\n      illness, previous suicide attempts, previous hospital admissions including involuntary\n      admissions, insight into illness and forensic history. Duration of untreated prodrome,\n      psychosis (DUP) and untreated illness (DUI) will be assessed with the DUP scale). Medication\n      non-adherence was defined according to Robinson et al. as failure to take medication for 1\n      week or longer. This definition was chosen because stopping medication for a week clearly\n      indicates a problem with acceptance of pharmacological treatment (as opposed of just\n      forgetting a dose).\n\n      At baseline and all follow-up time points following structured assessment are applied: 1)\n      Psychopathology with the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS); 2) severity of illness with\n      the Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI); severity of illness of affective psychosis with\n      the Clinical Global Impression Scale-Bipolar version (CGI-BP); 3) level of functioning with\n      the Global Assessment of Functioning Scale (GAF), 4) Quality of life with the Quality of\n      Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire (Q-LES-Q-18). The Q-LES-Q-18 is a self-report\n      instrument scored on a 5-point scale ('not at all or never' to 'frequently or all the time')\n      with higher scores indicating better enjoyment and satisfaction with specific life domains.\n      The global QOL index is the average score of all 18 items; a score of 4.1 points\n      characterize a quality of life comparable with healthy controls; 5) Patients' satisfaction\n      with care with the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ-8). The CSQ-8 is a 8-item\n      instrument that is scored from 1 to 4. The total score ranges from 8 to 32; the mean\n      satisfaction score is computed with a minimum score of 1 and a maximum of 4.\n\n      Service disengagement was present, if a patient repeatedly refuses further treatment despite\n      need and several attempts of reengagement (phone calls of patient and potentially home\n      visits of the ACT team). Service used data were assessed from the official IC database,\n      which covers inpatient admissions, day-clinic admissions, and treatment contacts by the ACT\n      team, in the psychosis outpatient center or by the private psychiatrists."
