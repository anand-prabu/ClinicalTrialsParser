This leads to the development of insulin resistance, even in patients with\n      type 1 diabetes mellitus.  The purpose of this study is to assess the effects of metformin\n      as adjunctive therapy on anthropometric parameters, insulin resistance and metabolic control\n      in overweight and obese patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus.\n\n      The study  group consists of  200  Caucasian type 1 diabetic patients with elevated adipose\n      tissue content as measured by electrical bioimpedance,  treated at the Poznan University of\n      Medical Sciences Department of Diabetology in 2009-2014. All patients have type 1 diabetes\n      diagnosed by autoimmune antibodies, and are treated with intensive insulin therapy. This\n      group is divided into metformin treated arm (group I+ M, 100 subjects), the remaining 100\n      patients are treated with insulin alone (control group, group I). Metformin is administered\n      at least 6 months at a mean dose of 1000 mg/day.\n\n      The investigators would like to assess the impact of metformin treatment on metabolic\n      control, insulin resistance and anthropometric parameters in overweight and obese patients\n      with type 1 diabetes."
