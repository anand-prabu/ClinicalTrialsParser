      The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the safety of a simultaneous treatment regimen
      compared to a sequential treatment regimen when two separate areas with AKs (one located on
      face/scalp and the other located on trunk/ extremities) are treated with ingenol mebutate
      gel

          -  Subjects with 4 to 8 clinically typical, visible and discrete AKs within a contiguous
             25 cm2 treatment area on face or scalp

             assessments of the selected treatment areas

          -  Clinical diagnosis/history or evidence of any medical condition that would expose a
             subject to an undue risk of a significant AE or interfere with assessments of safety
             and efficacy during the course of the trial, as determined by the investigator's
             clinical judgment.

          -  Anticipated need for hospitalisation or out-patient surgery during the first 15 days
