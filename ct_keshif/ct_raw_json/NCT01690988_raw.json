Delirium occurs commonly (10% to 70%) in patients older than\n      60 undergoing large surgeries. The purpose of this study is to test rigorously whether a\n      drug called ketamine can decrease the chance that patients will experience delirium after\n      their surgery. The investigators are also testing whether ketamine decreases postoperative\n      pain, postoperative opioid consumption, postoperative nausea and vomiting, ICU and hospital\n      length of stay, and adverse outcomes (e.g. hallucinations and nightmares)."

            "textblock": "Postoperative delirium is one of the most common complications of major surgery, affecting\n      between 10% and 70% of all elderly surgical patients. Delirium manifests as poor attention\n      and inability to think logically, and is associated with longer intensive care unit and\n      hospital stay, long lasting cognitive deterioration, and increased mortality rate.  Studies\n      have shown that a low sub-anesthetic dose of ketamine, an anesthetic drug, has the potential\n      to decrease several postoperative complications, including delirium, pain, opioid\n      consumption, and nausea and vomiting. Low dose ketamine would be particularly appealing as a\n      drug to prevent delirium and other postoperative complications, as it is inexpensive and\n      extremely safe. However, these proposed benefits of ketamine in the perioperative setting\n      have not yet been tested in a large clinical trial. The investigators are therefore\n      proposing a pragmatic, exploratory clinical trial to support or refute the contention that\n      low dose ketamine decreases the incidence of postoperative delirium, with the possibility of\n      conducting a larger randomized clinical trial pending the results of this study. At the time\n      of enrollment, patients will undergo the same delirium and pain evaluation that will be used\n      postoperatively. Additionally patients will be screened for functional dependence using the\n      Barthel Index of Activities of Daily Living, for depression using the Geriatric Depression\n      Scale - Short Form, and for obstructive sleep apnea using the STOP-Bang criteria.  They will\n      also be asked about any falls they have experienced in the six months prior to surgery.\n      Comorbid conditions, including the components of the Charlson Comorbidity Index, will be\n      obtained by reviewing the patients' medical records.  Any available preoperative lab\n      results, including electrolytes and blood counts, will also be recorded.\n\n      Patients will be randomized to receive low dose ketamine or placebo following induction of\n      anesthesia and prior to surgical incision. Blinded observers will assess delirium on the\n      afternoon/evening of postoperative day 0 (if feasible) and twice daily (morning and\n      afternoon/evening with at least six hours between assessments) on postoperative days 1-3\n      using the Confusion Assessment Method or the Confusion Assessment Method for Intensive Care\n      Unit. Acute pain will be assessed via the observer-based Behavioral Pain Scale or Behavioral\n      Pain Scale (Non-Intubated) with subsequent administration of the patient-reported Visual\n      Analog Scale from postoperative days 0-3. Postoperative opioid consumption will be assessed\n      from the patients' medical charts for postoperative days 0-3. Postoperative nausea and\n      vomiting will be assessed via a patient-reported section of the Behavioral Pain Scale or\n      Behavioral Pain Scale (Non-Intubated) for postoperative days 0-3. ICU and/or hospital length\n      of stay will be assessed from the patients' medical charts. Adverse outcomes (e.g.\n      hallucinations and nightmares) will be assessed via the Confusion Assessment Method or the\n      Confusion Assessment Method for Intensive Care Unit for postoperative days 0-3."
