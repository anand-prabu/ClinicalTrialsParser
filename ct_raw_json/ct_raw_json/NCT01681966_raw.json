The formulation is designed to slowly release\n      the ropivacaine over 36-72 hours.  By providing local analgesia over a long time span, the\n      need for systemic analgesics is expected to be reduced and hospital stays may be shortened.\n      The purpose of this study is to determine the ease of usage and administration of LNP in the\n      surgical setting, to follow the PK profile of LNP over 72 hours and evaluate the duration of\n      analgesia witnessed in the surgical setting."
