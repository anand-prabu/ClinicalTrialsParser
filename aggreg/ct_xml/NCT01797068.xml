  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A large proportion of frequent ED users have Medicaid insurance. The purpose of this study
      is to evaluate the effectiveness of patient navigation for reducing Emergency Department
      (ED) visits and hospitalizations and improving patient-centered outcomes (e.g.,
      self-reported health status, quality of life, access/barriers to care) among Medicaid
      patients who are high utilizers of the ED, as well as to identify best practices for
      engaging and providing healthcare services to underserved patients using patient navigation.
       This study will address needs that have been identified within the New Haven community and
      the local healthcare system, contribute to knowledge and literature surrounding the use of
      patient navigation to improve care for underserved patients and improve health system
      efficiency, and inform the design and development of programs that address these needs both
      locally and in other communities.
