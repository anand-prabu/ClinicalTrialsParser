  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 2-part study. In Part 1 of the study, subjects will undergo a pain reporting
      training program  in which a painful stimulus will be applied to the subject's hand, and the
      subjects will be asked to report how painful the stimulus is.  Over the course of the pain
      training sessions, feedback will be provided to the subject about how accurately they are
      reporting their degree of pain, relative to the amount of pressure stimulus applied to evoke
      pain.  Those subjects  who have adequate pain reporting ability will be asked to continue
      into Part 2 of the study in which 3 different blinded study drugs will be  administered to
      each subject, in a crossover design to compare whether or not the study drugs improve pain
      associated with diabetic neuropathy.

    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, randomized, two-part study in adults (ages 18-75 years) with
      Painful Diabetic Neuropathy (PDN).

      In Part 1 of the study, eligible subjects will enter a 4-week Pain Training Period.  During
      the Pain Training Period, subjects will receive three weekly in-clinic training sessions
      using repeated rating of experimental pressure pain stimuli. Subjects will receive feedback
      during this training and will be evaluated on their pain-reporting ability during each
      in-clinic session.  Subjects with acceptable pain-reporting ability at the conclusion of the
      Pain Training Period will be eligible to enter Part 2 of the study.  Subjects with
      unacceptable pain-reporting ability at the conclusion of the Pain Training Period will be
      discontinued from the study.

      Part 2 of the study will consist of three consecutive double-blind crossover periods.  Each
      crossover period will include 31 days of double-blind treatment.  A follow-up visit will
      occur 14 Â± 7 days after the last dose of study medication.

      One of three treatments (placebo, pregabalin, or pregabalin + AZD5213) will be administered
      during each crossover treatment period, as determined by a randomly assigned treatment
      sequence.

      Approximately 65 subjects will be screened in Part 1 of the study, in order to randomize up
      to approximately 32 subjects in Part 2 of the study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        1. Male or female, age 18 to 75 years, inclusive, at Screen. 2.  Subjects must provide
        informed consent in accordance with local regulations before the conduct of any
        study-related procedures.  The informed consent should reflect the protocol stipulations
        concerning the use of contraception. 3. Diagnosis of Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes mellitus
        for at least 1 year prior to Screen.  4. Diabetes-related painful neuropathy for at least
        6 months prior to Screen. 5.  Pain that began in the feet and is symmetric or nearly
        symmetric.  6.  Diabetes has been clinically stable for at least 2 months prior to Screen,
        and between Screen and baseline (Day 35).  7.  At Screen and baseline, score of at least 4
        on Item 5 (&quot;average pain&quot;) of the modified Brief Pain Inventory for patients with painful
        diabetic peripheral neuropathy (BPI-DPN).  8.  Able to participate in all scheduled
        evaluations and to complete all required tests and procedures.  9.  In the opinion of the
        investigator, the subject must be considered likely to comply with the study protocol and
        to have a high probability of completing the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        1. Known or suspected hypersensitivity to pregabalin.  2.  Clinically important illness or
        infection (e.g., chronic, persistent, or acute infection) within 30 days prior to screen
        or between screen adn baseline.  3.  Presence of any psychiatric or neurologic disorder or
        any other disorder or symptom, if, in the judgement of the investigator, the disorder or
        symptom is likely to confound interpretation of drug effect or affect the subject's
        ability to complete the study.  Any clinically important abnormality, as determined by
        investigator at Screen or baseline, in physical or neurologic examination, vital sign,
        ECG, or clinical laboratory test results that could be detrimental to the subject, or
        could affect the subject's ability to complete the study.  4.  Initiation or change in
        intensity or frequency of non-pharmacologic therapy for PDN, including psychotherapy,
        physical therapy, massage, acupuncture, acupressure, or chiropractic care, within 3 months
        prior to baseline).
