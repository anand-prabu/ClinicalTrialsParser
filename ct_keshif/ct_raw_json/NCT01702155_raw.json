Absence of CNS involvement by leukemia.\n\n          6. Absence of uncontrolled intercurrent illnesses, including uncontrolled infections,\n             cardiac conditions, or other organ dysfunctions.\n\n          7.

The interval from prior treatment to time of study drug administration is < 2 weeks\n             for cytotoxic agents or < 5 half-lives for noncytotoxic agents.  Exceptions: Use of\n             hydroxyurea is allowed before the start of study  and may be administered up to day 5\n             of the first cycle.\n\n          2. Any >grade 1 persistent clinically significant toxicities from prior chemotherapy.\n\n          3.
