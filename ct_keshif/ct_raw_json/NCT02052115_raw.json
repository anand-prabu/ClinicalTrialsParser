Cancer treatment-related changes that likely mediate weight\n      loss and exercise success include the long term effects such as fatigue, psychological\n      distress and impaired executive (cognitive) function.\n\n      This study will explore the variability in how breast cancer survivors respond to a\n      behavioral weight loss intervention.  The primary objectives include determining the degree\n      to which success with a behavioral weight loss intervention in overweight breast cancer\n      survivors is explained by measures of  executive function as measured with task performance\n      at 6 and 12 months and associated brain function imaging (fMRI), collected at baseline\n      only.Additionally, the study is designed to determine the degree to which selected measures\n      of cancer-related symptoms account for variance in the success of breast cancer survivors at\n      6 and 12 months following entry into a behavioral weight loss and exercise intervention."
