These reperfusion's injuries can be reduced by injection of\n      cyclosporin A (CsA) at the time of reperfusion. This post-conditioning reduces the final\n      infarct size 20 to 40%. This has been demonstrated in STEMI patients non-complicated by\n      cardiogenic shock. Early revascularization in the AMI complicated by cardiogenic shock\n      improves short-term and long term survival by reducing the size of the myocardial\n      infarction. The hypothesis of this study is that the administration of Cyclosporin A to\n      these patients, in addition to mechanical reperfusion, is likely to reduce the severity of\n      the multi-organ failure associated with the cardiogenic shock and improve clinical outcome."
