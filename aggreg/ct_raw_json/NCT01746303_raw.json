Mood\n      will be assessed as a potential covariate of the neurobehavioral outcome measures and  data\n      on red blood cell fatty acid content, metabolic parameters, inflammation, and anthropometric\n      factors will be gathered to assess compliance and explore individual differences in response\n      to the intervention and to evaluate potential mechanisms of action."
