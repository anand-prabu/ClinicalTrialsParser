  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess whether or not adalimumab (Humira®) can influence
      pain medication in participants with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA)
      and ankylosing spondylitis (AS) with or without comorbidities, which do not constitute a
      contraindication for adalimumab as stated in the released summary of product
      characteristics. Therefore it shall be evaluated if pain medication which is used in these
      participants is changed, reduced or stopped due to adalimumab treatment.

    <textblock>
      This is a non-interventional, observational study in which Humira (adalimumab) is prescribed
      in the usual manner in accordance with the terms of the local marketing authorization with
      regards to dose, population and indication. The assignment of the patient to a
      Humira-containing regimen has to be decided in advance and has to be current practice. The
      prescription of Humira is clearly separated from the decision to include the participant in
      this study.

    <time_frame>from Day 0 to month 12</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The BMQ-Specific comprises two 5-item factors assessing beliefs about the necessity of prescribed medication (Specific-Necessity) and concerns about prescribed medication based on beliefs about the danger of dependence and long-term toxicity and the disruptive effects of medication (Specific-Concern) The BMQ-General comprises two 4-item factors assessing beliefs that medicines are harmful, addictive, poisons which should not be taken continuously(General-Harm) and that medicines are over used by doctors (General-Overcure). The total score, the sum of all the points from the Specific AND General questions range from 17 (lowest score) to 85 (highest score). Patients who have positive beliefs about medicine have a score &lt; 47 and patients who have negative beliefs have a score &gt; 47.</description>

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The 11-item Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM) Version II is an instrument to assess patients' satisfaction with medication, providing scores on four scales â€&quot; side effects, effectiveness, convenience and global satisfaction. The 11 questions can be answered either with yes/no or by means of a five or seven stage scale (e.g. ranging from very unsatisfied to satisfied). SCALE SCORING ALGORITHM: TSQM Scale scores range from 0 to 100 and no computed score should be lower or higher than these limits. Higher scores represent higher satisfaction.</description>

    <description>The Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index  consists of 6 questions pertaining to the 5 major symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis: fatigue, spinal pain, joint pain/swelling, areas of localized tenderness (=enthesitis), duration of morning stiffness, severity of morning stiffness</description>

    <description>The ESR is a practicable and sensitive but not specific parameter for measuring disease progression. By means of the ESR it can be generally distinguished between an active and non active rheumatic disease.</description>

    <description>The CRP is an acute phase reactant plasma protein, normally produced by the liver, which is commonly used as an indirect measure of the extent and activity of an inflammation.</description>

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The MMAS is a 4-item Self-Report Measure of Medication-Taking Behavior. It measures both intentional and nonintentional non-adherence (based on forgetting, carelessness, stopping medication when feeling better, or stopping medication when feeling worse). The 4-item MMAS-4-item consists of 4 questions which can be answered with yes (=0 point) and no (=1point). The MMAS score is the sum of all four question and range from 0 (=non-adherent) to 4 (=adherent).</description>
