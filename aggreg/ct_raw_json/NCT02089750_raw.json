Additionally, custom-made shoe orthotics plus chiropractic treatment will\n      further improve patients' low back pain and dysfunction while maintaining that improvement\n      during the one year study follow-up period.\n\n      Specific Aims:\n\n        1. To determine the changes in perceived pain levels (Numeric Pain Rating Scale) and\n           dysfunction (Oswestry Disability Index) in patients with chronic low back pain after\n           six weeks of custom-made shoe orthotic use with or without chiropractic care as\n           compared to no care.\n\n        2. To determine the changes in perceived pain levels and dysfunction in patients with\n           chronic low back pain after twelve weeks of custom-made shoe orthotic use.\n\n        3. To determine the changes in perceived pain levels and dysfunction at 3, 6, and 12\n           months following the 12 week treatment period."
