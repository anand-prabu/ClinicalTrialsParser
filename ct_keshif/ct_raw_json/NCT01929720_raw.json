Explore the underlying endocrine and immune mechanisms responsible for a specific\n      symptom cluster (anxiety-insomnia-depression-pain-fatigue) observed among advanced cancer\n      patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\n      ARM I: Patients wear a wrist actigraph, collect saliva samples, and complete a sleep diary\n      and worry record daily in weeks 1 and 5. Patients also receive education on the components\n      of anxiety (physical cognitive, and behavioral) and practice relaxation techniques and\n      behavioral sleep strategies in weeks 2-5. Blood draw is optional.\n\n      ARM II: Patients wear a wrist actigraph, collect saliva samples, and complete a sleep diary\n      and worry record daily in weeks 1 and 5.  Blood draw is also optional.  This is a wait-list\n      control arm, so patients in this arm, after a six-week period of treatment as usual with\n      their oncologist, then receive the intervention."
