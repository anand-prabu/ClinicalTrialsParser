Subject has a known hypersensitivity to baclofen.\n\n          5. Subject has a significant history of cardiac, neurologic, psychiatric, oncologic,\n             endocrine, metabolic, renal or hepatic disease\n\n          6. Subject has taken or used any investigational drug or device in the 30 days prior to\n             screening.\n\n          7. Subject has taken either prescribed or over the counter medication for 48 hours prior\n             to baclofen administration on either of the study days, other than hormonal birth\n             control.\n\n          8.
