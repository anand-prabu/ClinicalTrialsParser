            "textblock": "Enteric fever is responsible for over 20 million illnesses and 200,000 deaths each year. S.\n      Paratyphi A accounts for a substantial and increasing proportion of these cases, as high as\n      90% in some regions of Asia. There are currently no vaccines directed against S. Paratyphi\n      A, although there some candidates in preclinical and phase 1 trials. This study is funded by\n      the European Vaccine Initiative and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Paratyphoid is a\n      human-restricted infection, for which there are currently no small animal models available.\n      In order to further our understanding of the host-pathogen interactions, this study will\n      develop a novel human challenge model in which to investigate this infection, using a recent\n      successful typhoid challenge model as its template.\n\n      Healthy subjects to ingest a dose of Salmonella enterica serovar Paratyphi A, strain\n      NVGH308, after drinking a bicarbonate buffer.

If this is not reached with the first\n      cohort of 20 participants, the dose will be escalated and the process repeated. A maximum of\n      80 participants will be enrolled. Total follow up will be over the course of one year.\n      Descriptive clinical and laboratory data collected from participant observations, samples of\n      blood, faeces, urine and saliva will allow insights into the disease and the host response.\n      These insights will forward our knowledge of paratyphoid disease and may help discover or\n      develop diagnostic methods.\n\n      This study is funded by the European Vaccine Initiative and the Bill and Melinda Gates\n      Foundation.

This serves an important\n      function because field trials in endemic areas are expensive and time consuming. Speeding up\n      this process using our model will be of great benefit to endemic areas."
