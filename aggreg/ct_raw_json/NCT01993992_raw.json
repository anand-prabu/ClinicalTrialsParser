We currently decrease pre-operative anxiety by\n      parental accompanying until the children put to sleep. However, references indicate that\n      parental anxiety can increase the post-operative delirium. Heart rate variability was used\n      to measure the anxiety status of parents. We think sympathetic tone elevation measured by\n      heart rate variability may not induce by anxiety alone, thus we want to explore this\n      question by using Stat-Trait Anxiety Inventory questionnaire."
