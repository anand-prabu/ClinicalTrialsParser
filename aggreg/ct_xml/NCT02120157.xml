  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We propose a multi-institutional phase II haplo-identical T cell replete BMT study in
      children with high-risk leukemias. The myeloablative conditioning regimen prescribed will be
      TBI-based for lymphoid leukemias and busulfan-based for myeloid leukemias. Our goal is to
      establish an easily exportable, inexpensive platform for haplotransplantation that has a
      safety profile equivalent to matched related and unrelated BMTs. The primary objective will
      be to estimate the incidence of 6-month non-relapse mortality, hypothesizing that NRM is &lt;
      18%.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient age 0.5-25years

          -  Patients must have a first-degree related donor or half-sibling who is at   minimum
             HLA haploidentical. The donor and recipient must be identical at at least one allele
             of each of the following genetic loci: HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-Cw, HLA-DRB1, and HLA-DQB1.
             A minimum match of 5/10 is therefore required, and will be considered sufficient
             evidence that the donor and recipient share one HLA haplotype.

          -  An unrelated donor search is not required for a patient to be eligible for this
             protocol, or a donor search and donor mobilization may be abandoned if the clinical
             situation dictates an urgent transplant.  Clinical urgency is defined as 6-8 weeks
             from referral to transplant or a low-likelihood of finding a matched, unrelated
             donor. Patients with an eligible HLA-matched RELATED should not be enrolled on this
             trial.

          -  Patients must have at least one of the following high-risk conditions listed below
             (criteria are meant to complement existing criteria within COG protocols):

          -  Acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) in CR1* as defined by at least one of the following:

        hypodiploidy induction failure MRD after consolidation

        - Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in CR1 with high risk features defined as: High allelic
        ratio FLT3/ITD+ Monosomy 7 Del (5q) Standard risk cytogenetics with positive minimal
        residual disease at the end of Induction I chemotherapy (for patients being treated on or
        according to COG AAML1031 who have had MRD studies sent to Seattle or performed at their
        local institution where the flow assay is sensitive enough to detect &gt; 0.1% blasts)

          -  Acute Leukemias in 2nd or subsequent CR (CR&gt;2)

          -  Mixed phenotype/Undifferentiated Leukemias in 1st or subsequent CR*

          -  Secondary or therapy related leukemias in CR  &gt; 1

          -  NK cell leukemia or NK cell lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma CR &gt; 1 Myelodysplastic
             syndrome (MDS)

          -  JMML (patients are eligible if they are not eligible for COG1221)

          -  Prior transplant eligible if  &lt; 18yo, &gt;6 months has elapsed since BMT, and patient is
             off immunosuppression for &gt; 3 months with no GVHD

          -  No known active CNS involvement or extramedullary involvement by malignancy. Such
             disease treated into remission is permitted.

          -  Acute Leukemia - Remission is defined as morphology with &lt; 5% blasts with no
             morphological characteristics of acute leukemia (e.g., Auer Rods) in a bone marrow
             with &gt; 20% cellularity.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients will not be excluded on the basis of sex, racial or ethnic background.

          -  Poor cardiac function: left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;45% as determined by MUGA
             or ECHO. For pediatric patients LVEF &lt;45% or a shortening fraction below normal
             limits for age.

          -  Symptomatic pulmonary disease. Poor pulmonary function: FEV1, FVC, and DLCO &lt;50%
             predicted (corrected for hemoglobin) for patients who have not received thoracic or
             mantle irradiation. For patients who have received thoracic or mantle irradiation,
             FEV1 and FVC &lt;70% predicted or DLCO &lt; 50 of predicted. For children unable to perform
             PFTs because of developmental stage pulse oximetry &lt; 92% on RA.

          -  Poor liver function: bilirubin &gt;2 mg/dl (not due to hemolysis, Gilbert's or primary
             malignancy). ALT or AST &gt; 3 x laboratory upper normal limits.

          -  Poor renal function: Creatinine &gt;2.0mg/dl or creatinine clearance (calculated
             creatinine clearance is permitted) &lt; 60 mL/min based on Traditional Cockcroft-Gault
             formula: 140 - age (yrs) x Smaller of Actual Weight vs. Ideal Body Weight (kg)  / 72
             x Serum creatinine (mg/dl) Multiply by another factor of 0.85 if female Intended for
             ages 18-110, serum creatinine 0.6-7 mg/dl For patients &lt;18 years: CrCl will be
             estimated by the Schwartz formula. A measured CrCl or a GFR may be substituted to
             determine the subject's CrCl.

          -  Schwartz equation: CrCl (ml/min/1.73m2)=[length (cm) x k] /serum creatinine K = 0.45
             for infants 1 to 52 weeks old k = 0.55 for children 1 to 13 years old k = 0.55 for
             adolescent females 13-18 years old k = 0.7 for adolescent males 13-18 years old

          -  HIV-positive

          -  Positive leukocytotoxic crossmatch Specifically, complement dependent cytotoxicity
             and flow cytometric crossmatch assays must be negative, and the mean fluorescence
             intensity (MFI) of any anti-donor HLA antibody by solid phase immunoassay should be
             &lt;3000.  Consult with PI for the clinical significance of any anti-donor antibody.

          -  Women of childbearing potential who currently are pregnant (HCG+) or who are not
             practicing adequate contraception or who are breastfeeding

          -  Uncontrolled viral, bacterial, or fungal infections (currently taking medication and
             have progression of clinical symptoms) Patients with symptoms consistent with RSV,
             influenza A, B, or parainfluenza at the time of enrollment will be assayed for the
             above viruses and if positive are not eligible for the trial until they are no longer
             symptomatic (patients may have continued assay positivity for a period of time post
             resolution of symptoms secondary to the nature of the assay
