  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since polymers have been identified as a possible cause of late complications of drug
      eluting stents, new stents are being designed to improve polymers' biocompatibility or to
      bond drugs on stents without polymers.

      Biolimus A9 is the therapeutic agent used in the BioFreedom drug coated stent. Biolimus A9
      is a proprietary semi-synthetic sirolimus derivative. It is highly lipophilic, rapidly
      absorbed in tissues, and able to reversibly inhibit growth factor-stimulated cell
      proliferation.

      In this study, we use intracoronary optical coherence tomography (OCT) to evaluate the
      BioFreedom Stents after implantation regarding endovascular healing over time as primary
      objective; and also to evaluate secondary OCT, angiographic and clinical outcomes at various
      specific time points.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intra-coronary stenting is currently the standard of care post-balloon angioplasty for
      ischemic heart disease. Traditionally, bare metal stent (BMS) is used but in recent years it
      has been largely been replaced by drug-eluting stent (DES) which has reduced rates of
      restenosis. (1) However, the long term safety of DES still remains controversial due to
      reports of late stent thrombosis which presumably occurs secondary to delayed arterial
      healing and local hypersensitivity reactions which may be related to the drug, the polymer,
      or both. (2). Virmani et al (3) reported that patients who died of late stent thrombosis 18
      months after sirolimus-eluting stent (SES) implantation showed a severe localized
      hypersensitivity reaction that involved the whole vessel wall and this reaction may be
      caused by polymer or from the drug-release kinetics of SES. It is known from preclinical and
      clinical studies that, nonabsorbable polymer can induce persistent inflammation which may
      lead to delayed cellular proliferation and 'late catch-up' restenosis (4).

      Early (ie first) generation DES consisted of a metal stent for vessel scaffolding, cytotoxic
      drug for neointimal growth inhibition and a polymer coating to improve the biocompatibility
      of the stents or as a vehicle to load drugs onto stents. Since polymers have been identified
      as a possible cause of late complications of DES, new stents are being designed to improve
      polymers' biocompatibility or to bond drugs on stents without polymers. Biodegradable
      polymers are likely to be safer than nonabsorbable polymers because inflammation will be
      eliminated after the polymer degrades.

      The BioFreedom drug coated stent (DCS) Coronary Stent Delivery System is comprised of three
      key components including 1) a 316 L stainless steel bare metal stent platform which has been
      modified with a proprietary surface treatment resulting in a selectively micro-structured,
      abluminal surface. The selectively micro-structured surface allows 2) Biolimus A9TM (drug)
      adhesion to the abluminal surface of the stent without the use of a polymer or binder. The
      drug-coated stent is crimped onto 3) a delivery system which includes a high pressure,
      semi-compliant balloon incorporated onto the distal tip of a rapid exchange delivery
      catheter system. The delivery system has two radiopaque markers inside the balloon, which
      fluoroscopically mark the ends of the stent to facilitate proper stent placement.

      Biolimus A9 is the therapeutic agent used in the BioFreedom DCS. Biolimus A9 is a
      proprietary semi-synthetic sirolimus derivative. It is highly lipophilic, rapidly absorbed
      in tissues, and able to reversibly inhibit growth factor-stimulated cell proliferation.
      Current data suggest that Biolimus A9, on a molecular level, forms a complex with the
      cytoplasmic proteins that inhibit the cell cycle between the G0 and G1 phase. The result is
      an interruption of the cascade governing cell reproduction, growth, and proliferation.
      Related pharmaceuticals, sirolimus and everolimus, are well tolerated cytostatic
      immunosuppressive agents with predictable and similar adverse event profiles.  Biolimus A9
      is closely related chemically to both sirolimus and everolimus.  Based on administration in
      healthy volunteers, Biolimus A9 has been shown to have a very similar adverse event profile
      to these other two drugs when used at equivalent dose levels., Biolimus A9 easily crosses
      the cell membrane to achieve therapeutic effects in target smooth muscle cells and, compared
      with the sirolimus-eluting Cypher stent (SES), the high lipophilicity of BA9 leads to
      relatively low systemic exposure.(5) Furthermore, the drug coating is applied only to the
      abluminal surface of the stent, allowing the drug release to be directed almost entirely
      into the vessel wall where it targets the smooth muscle cells injured by the angioplasty
      procedure. On the other hand, there is little drug release on the luminal surfaces of the
      stent, thus there is less inhibition of endothelial cells which need to grow on the inside
      of the stent in order for healing to occur.

      Animal studies have shown the Biofreedom stent demonstrates equivalent or less early and
      late reduction of intimal smooth muscle cell proliferation compared with the Cypher
      Sirolimus-eluting stent (SES) in a porcine model. After implantation of BioFreedom stent,
      delayed arterial healing has been shown to be minimal, and there was no increased
      inflammation at 180 days compared with SES implantation (6). Pharmacokinetic and tissue
      concentration analyses showed that there was no high early peaking of Biolimus A9 level in
      blood (6). On-going studies of Biofreedom in humans showed non-inferiority of in-stent late
      lumen loss at 12 months versus paclitaxel eluting stents (PES) (7).

      This current EGO BIOFREEDOM study protocol is designed based on the approved protocols of
      the EGO Study and EGO-COMBO Study, which were both successfully completed.  We aim to focus
      mainly on the time frame, degree of endothelialization, and the subsequent neointimal
      proliferation after BioFreedom stent implantation, as assessed by the state-of-the-art
      intracoronary imaging - optical coherence tomography (OCT), which has been used extensively
      in the completed EGO and EGO-COMBO study.

      Indeed, intracoronary optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a simple catheter-based imaging
      technique using optic fibre to achieve very detailed assessment (resolution down to 100
      microns) in intra-coronary stent apposition, early stent coverage (endothelialization) and
      late stent neoinitmal growth (restenosis).  It is performed as part of routine cardiac
      catheterization procedure and provides high-resolution cross sectional images of the
      coronary arteries. OCT has been shown to be safe in clinical practice (8). The LightLab C7XR
      OCT system (Frequency Domain OCT) is a commercial available product with CE Mark and FDA
      approval, which has been used in the EGO Studies.  The OCT catheter is a non-occlusive optic
      fibre which is extremely small and flexible. It poses no additional risk to the patient
      other than those inherent risks of a standard angioplasty procedure.
