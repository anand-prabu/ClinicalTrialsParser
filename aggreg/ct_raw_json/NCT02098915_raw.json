However, the evidence to\n      support this practice remains weak. Investigators hypothesize that a prokinetic agent given\n      intravenously (infused into a vein) may be effective in improving gut motility in children\n      with gastroschisis."

There will be two arms to the\n      trial: the experimental arm will receive intravenous metoclopramide and the control arm will\n      receive placebo. Patients will receive prokinetic agent therapy, dosed according to weight,\n      or placebo. Each subject will receive the intervention for 28 days or until achievement of\n      full enteral feeding, whichever comes first. Primary outcome: Days to achieve full enteral\n      feeding when all intake (at least 150 ml/kg/day for 72 hours) is given as breast milk or\n      formula by gavage or by mouth. Secondary outcomes: 1. Duration (days) until initiation of\n      enteral feeds. 2. Duration (days) on parenteral nutrition. 3. Weight gain, measured by grams\n      per day per week during therapy. 4. Occurrence of adverse effects associated with the use of\n      metoclopramide. 5. Rate of catheter-related sepsis episodes (line positive blood cultures\n      necessitating antibiotic treatment or catheter removal). 6. Incidence of necrotizing\n      enterocolitis (NEC) based on clinical criteria and presence of pneumatosis intestinalis on\n      an abdominal X-ray. 7. Duration of hospitalization (number of days from admission until\n      final hospital discharge). 8. Conjugated bilirubin levels measured weekly."
