Radiation\n      therapy uses high energy x rays to kill tumor cells. Specialized radiation therapy, such as\n      stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT), that delivers a high dose of radiation directly\n      to the tumor may kill more tumor cells and cause less damage to normal tissue. SBRT has been\n      shown to provide excellent results when used in early stage lung cancer, but has not yet\n      been applied to patients with more advanced disease."

III.\n      To assess overall survival at 1 and 2 years.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of radiation therapy and SBRT.\n\n      Patients undergo radiation therapy daily and receive carboplatin and paclitaxel weekly for\n      4.5 weeks. Patients then undergo 2 boost SBRT treatments 2-3 days apart.\n\n      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 5 years."
