      Identify the cause of chronic allograft dysfunction using a combination of comprehensive
      clinical and histologic information in Chinese renal transplant recipients, then to identify
      the position of CNI nephrotoxicity in CAD.Chronic allograft dysfunction reflects the dual
      impact of both immunologic and nonimmunologic (primarily calcineurin inhibitor
      [CNI]nephrotoxicity) injury. In previous, CNI nephrotoxicity is overstated and considered
      one of the major causes of CAD, however, recently there has been found most death-censored
      graft losses to be the result of alloimmune or autoimmune injury, with only a minority of
      cases attributable to CNI toxicity. Unfortunately, Situation of objective CNI toxicity in
      CAD in China is not well analyzed. To improve perception of Neo safety with more local
      evidence, we want to do a retrospective study to identify the cause of chronic allograft
      dysfunction using a combination of comprehensive clinical and histologic information in
      Chinese renal transplantation recipients.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  18 years of age or older

          -  Kidney transplant recipients, only  including recipients of living-donor grafts

          -  Underwent an allograft biopsy between January 2005 and December 2011 because of
             developing deterioration of graft function*.

               -  Deterioration of function was defined as (1) an unexplained and persistent
                  greater than or equal to 25% increase of CR over baseline (in the absence of
                  potential confounding factors) or (2) new onset proteinuria (defined as
                  albumin/CR ratio â‰¥0.2 or a protein/CR ratio &gt;0.5).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Multiple organ transplants, prior transplant with any other organ or tissue

          -  Patients who did not have the information regarding the pathological diagnosis

          -  Patients who did not have the histological sections of the allograft biopsy
