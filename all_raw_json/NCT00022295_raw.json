Treatment repeats every 14 days\n      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of phenoxodiol until the maximum tolerated\n      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2\n      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed at 4 weeks.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 18-36 patients will be accrued for this study."
