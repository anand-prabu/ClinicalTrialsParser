            "textblock": "Prostate Cancer (PC) affects 1 in 7 men. Nearly half of those diagnosed with PC will receive\n      androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) as part of their treatment. ADT is good at managing PC\n      but has many side effects. Researchers have shown that exercise, specifically one-on-one\n      supervised exercise improves many of the side effects of ADT. However, exercise programs for\n      men on ADT are not widely available. More questions need to be answered in order for\n      exercise programs to become part of PC treatment. First, can programs that require fewer\n      resources, such as group-exercise or home-based exercise, also improve ADT side-effects?\n      Second, do exercise-related benefits continue beyond the structured exercise program? And\n      what makes people continue exercising? Third, which exercise program is most cost-effective?\n\n      In this study, the investigators will compare: (a) group supervised in-centre; (b)\n      home-based supported; and (c) 1:1 supervised in-centre exercise programs to see which\n      program is most effective for men with PC on ADT. The investigators will also look at what\n      motivates people to continue to exercise both during a structured program and after the\n      program is complete and will examine which exercise program is most cost-effective.\n\n      The investigators will ask men with PC on ADT that are being treated at either Princess\n      Margaret Cancer Centre in Toronto or the Tom Baker Cancer Centre in Calgary to participate\n      in the study. When a patient agrees to participate, he will be randomly placed in 1 of the 3\n      exercise programs. All programs will include the same type of exercises (aerobic, resistance\n      and flexibility) and all participants will exercise 4-5 days per week for 30 minutes per day\n      (as tolerated) for the length of the program (6 months). The investigators will look at how\n      men with PC on ADT respond to the exercise program by measuring quality of life (QOL),\n      fatigue and different physical measures before, during, and after the exercise program.\n\n      Although the investigators know that supervised one-on-one exercise is most effective at\n      improving ADT side-effects, it is unknown if other forms of exercise are just as beneficial\n      and more financially responsible. This study will allow the investigators to begin to answer\n      these questions so that structured exercise programs become a regular part of PC treatment."
