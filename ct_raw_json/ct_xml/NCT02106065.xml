      The purpose of this study is to study the effects of an education and skill-building
      intervention on family caregivers of Veterans with dementia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      According to VA estimates, nearly 500,000 Veterans suffer from dementia. There is currently
      no cure for dementia. Ultimately, dementia will have a large impact on quality of life in
      Veterans and families, lead to expensive nursing home placement, and decrease life
      expectancy for patients and family caregivers. The experience of high burden in a caregiver
      for a Veteran with dementia increases the likelihood of permanent nursing home placement and
      can separate Veterans from their families. To address the high burden of caring for a
      Veteran with dementia, we aim to study the effect of a rehabilitative intervention for
      family caregivers of Veterans with dementia. Our novel approach will use video technology
      that can reach caregivers in rural areas who do not have easy access to major VA medical
      centers.
