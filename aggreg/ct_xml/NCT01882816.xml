    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Phase 2 study is to find out what effect, good and/or bad, external beam
      radiation therapy, has on the patient and their thyroid cancer where surgery is not an
      option or where despite surgery, the disease is still present.

    <description>Pts will undergo baseline history &amp; physical exam &amp; laboratory studies as part of initial assessment for protocol eligibility. Baseline imaging will include FDG PET/CT scan, according to our standard of care. Pts will provide written informed consent. Pts will receive intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) in once-daily fractions (Monday through Friday, excluding holidays). A total dose of 70Gy is planned. Pts will be seen weekly during radiation as per standard procedure at MSKCC. Approximately 3 months after completion of radiation, radiologic response assessment will be performed as per our standard guideline. This will include a FDG PET/CT scan, as well as a recommended cross-sectional imaging of the primary tumor (with CT scan &amp;/or MRI). Clinic visits will take place approximately every 3 months for 2 years, approximately every 6 months for the next 3 years, &amp; approximately annually thereafter.</description>

The DW and multiparametric MRI will be recommended for 3 months, 6 months, and then every 6 months (all +/- 4 weeks) until 2 years post-RT unless contraindicated for main campus patients only. This schedule may be altered, as clinically indicated.</description>
