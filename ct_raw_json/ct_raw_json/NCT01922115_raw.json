OAB is more prevalent in the elderly population -\n      a group that also has a higher baseline risk of cognitive dysfunction. Our objective is to\n      evaluate the effect of an anticholinergic medication on cognitive function in elderly women.\n      Subjects will be randomized to:1) trospium chloride or 2) placebo. There are three aims: 1)\n      To evaluate changes in cognitive function in elderly women taking trospium versus placebo,\n      using validated cognitive assessment tests. 2) To develop a useful battery of cognitive\n      screening tests for monitoring the cognitive safety of OAB management. 3) To understand how\n      the timing of cognitive changes relates to the timing of improvement in OAB symptoms. The\n      investigators will recruit 60 women aged \u2265 65 with the diagnosis of OAB. Cognitive\n      assessments will be performed at baseline and Week 1 and 4 after drug initiation using\n      paper-based validated questionnaires. OAB improvement will be assessed with validated\n      questionnaires."
