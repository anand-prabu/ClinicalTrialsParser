To improve prescribing and\n      thus reduce undesired drug effects is a great challenge for doctors and nurses in primary\n      health care.\n\n      Performance of drug utilization reviews is recommended in order to reduce the negative\n      impact of inappropriate prescribing in the elderly. However, scientific evidence on their\n      efficacy is lacking, especially regarding patient-related health outcomes (2,3). Most\n      studies are carried out in inpatient care, making it difficult to draw conclusions regarding\n      primary health care (2).  Moreover, studies in this scientific field diverge regarding the\n      content and structure of drug utilization reviews, which implies that comparison between\n      studies becomes challenging, if not impossible.\n\n      This trial aims at educating health care providers in how to perform drug utilization\n      reviews, and to help them implement theory into practice."
