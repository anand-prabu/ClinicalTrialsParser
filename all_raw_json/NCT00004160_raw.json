Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor\n      cells. Combining chemotherapy with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of chemotherapy plus radiation therapy\n      in treating patients who have stage III non-small cell lung cancer that cannot be surgically\n      removed."

Determine the maximum tolerated dose and dose limiting toxicity of\n      gemcitabine and paclitaxel in combination with radiotherapy in patients with locally\n      advanced stage IIIA or IIIB non-small cell lung cancer. II. Assess response rate, duration\n      of response, disease free survival and failure in this patient population on this regimen.\n      III. Determine the pharmacokinetics of gemcitabine and paclitaxel during the\n      chemoradiotherapy phase.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of gemcitabine. Induction phase: Patients receive\n      gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8 and cisplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1.\n      Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 2 courses. Chemoradiotherapy phase: Patients receive\n      paclitaxel IV over 1 hour and gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes beginning 2 hours into\n      paclitaxel infusion on day 1 of weeks 6, 9, and 12. Patients undergo conventional chest\n      radiotherapy on Monday though Friday for weeks 6-11. Cohorts of 3-5 patients receive\n      escalating doses of gemcitabine until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The\n      MTD is defined as the dose at which at least 2 of 5 patients experience dose limiting\n      toxicity.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A minimum of 17 patients will be accrued for this study."
