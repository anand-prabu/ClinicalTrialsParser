Participants will be randomized into one of two study arms: Weight Loss\n      Control (n = 20) subjects follow a calorie-reduced diet for a weight loss or \u226510%; or Weight\n      Loss-High Protein: (n = 40) subjects follow a calorie-reduction diet for a weight loss of\n      \u226510%, with a high proportion of high quality protein at each meal. Intakes of > 30g of high\n      quality protein will be achieved three times a day by subjects in this group, predominantly\n      all from animal sources and 60-70% of animal protein from pork.

The statistical analyses will\n      proceed chronologically in 3 phases: 1) descriptive analyses that will summarize the\n      distribution of the covariates and dependent variables, 2) bivariate analyses of the\n      association between group membership and the outcome measures, and 3) controlled\n      multivariable analyses, which assess the association between experimental group and the\n      outcomes, controlling for the important covariates."
