            "textblock": "As the major insulinomas are functioning islet cell tumors, surgical resection is currently\n      first-line therapy for or treatment of insulinomas. However, the surgical resection of\n      pancreatic neoplasm is conditional for specific patients and  may be associated with\n      substantial life-threatening complications. Several studies declared that endoscopic\n      ultrasound (EUS)-guided lavage may offer an alternative to surgical resection of\n      insulinomas. Nevertheless, their sample sizes were small and conclusions were built based on\n      short-term outcomes. In addition, the amount of ethanol administrated for different types of\n      insulinomas were inconsistent among those studies.\n\n      The present study aims to evaluate the safety, feasibility and efficacy of EUS-guided\n      ethanol ablation therapy of insulinomas. We will use cytopathology and immunohistochemistry\n      in combination with EUS-FNA for diagnosis of insulinoma. After EUS-guided ethanol ablation\n      therapy, the safety and efficacy will be assessed at the baseline and different time points\n      during follow-up by physicians blinded to the treatment or control status."
