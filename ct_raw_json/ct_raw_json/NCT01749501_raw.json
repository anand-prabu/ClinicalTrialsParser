The objectives of the study include:\n      1.) Does the medication protocol outlined in this study provide optimal intubation\n      conditions? (i.e.good jaw relaxation, open and immobile vocal cords and suppression of gag\n      reflex) 2.) Does the addition of a muscle relaxant prior to intubation contribute to less\n      attempts and achieving successful intubation as opposed to neonates who do not receive the\n      muscle relaxant."

Each patient will be monitored for study purposes for at\n      least 24 hours after intubation attempt to record any potential side effects of the\n      medication.  The investigators plan to have a data safety monitoring board established\n      composed of three pediatric doctors / specialists not associated with this study.\n\n      The response of paralysis, onset and duration will be assessed clinically.  Onset of muscle\n      relaxation will be described as the absence of spontaneous movements and flaccidity,\n      measured in seconds from the end of the medication administration.  Duration of paralysis\n      will be determined by the difference in time from the onset of paralysis to the return of\n      spontaneous movements and pre-intubation tone"
