Participants are\n      randomized into two groups, who get access to the module \"Diastat\" after 4 and 12 weeks\n      post-enrollment respectively. Each group uses the FTA with Diastat for 8 weeks\n      post-intervention (i.e. access to Diastat).\n\n      Diastat is a module within FTA that provides data-driven feedback to the patients using\n      their own data. This module is based on the data recorded in a previous trial [1]. Three\n      submodules are part of Diastat; Periodicity detection and visualization, multiscale trend\n      detection based on the c-SiZer algorithm [2], and situation matching for insulin dosage [3].\n\n        1.
