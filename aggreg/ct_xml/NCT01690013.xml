      Klinefelter syndrome is the most common sex-chromosome disorder in men with a prevalence of
      1 in 660 men. The syndrome is associated with hypogonadism. Many patients with Klinefelter
      syndrome have psychological complaints and physical discomfort. Some patients report a
      positive effect of testosterone treatment, whereas others do not.

      The aim of this study is:

      (i) To investigate quality of life in patients with Klinefelter syndrome. (ii) To
      investigate functional, physical and mental health in patients with Klinefelter syndrome.

      Questionnaire concerning mental and physical health and life quality are sent out to
      patients with KS and to age-, educational- and zipcode-matched men from the general
      population. The questionnaire include questions about housing, income, marital status,
      fatherhood, medication, chronic disease,school and education, attachment to the labor,
      sexual and erectile function, life quality, mental and physical health, satisfaction with
      life and symptoms of attention deficits hyperactivity disorders.
