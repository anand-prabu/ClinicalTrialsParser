            "textblock": "RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies can find and locate tumor cells and either kill them or\n      deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Drugs used in\n      chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or\n      die. Combining more than one drug and combining chemotherapy with monoclonal antibody\n      therapy may kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of monoclonal antibody therapy plus\n      combination chemotherapy in treating patients with advanced colorectal cancer."

Define toxicity and the maximum tolerated dose of humanized monoclonal\n      antibody A33 (MOAB A33) when combined with carmustine, fluorouracil, vincristine, and\n      streptozocin in patients with advanced colorectal cancer. II. Determine the effect of\n      chemotherapy on human antihuman antibody response and on the pharmacokinetics of humanized\n      MOAB A33 in these patients. III. Define the humanized MOAB A33 dose for a phase II study.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of humanized monoclonal antibody A33 (MOAB A33).\n      Patients receive humanized MOAB A33 IV once a week for 14 weeks. Chemotherapy begins on day\n      29 and consists of carmustine IV on days 29-33, fluorouracil IV on days 29-33 and 64-68,\n      vincristine IV on days 29 and 64, and streptozocin IV every 7 days, beginning on day 29, for\n      10 doses. Courses repeat every 14 weeks in the absence of disease progression or\n      unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of humanized MOAB\n      A33. The maximum tolerated dose is defined as the dose at which no more than 2 of 6 patients\n      experience dose limiting toxicity.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: There will be 3-18 patients accrued into this study over 2-9 months."
