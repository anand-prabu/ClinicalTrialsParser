All participants are treated according to the\n      Swedish National Guidelines for Endometrial Cancer.\n\n      130 women with endometrial cancer  who have a hysterectomy with lymphadenectomy (high-risk\n      endometrial carcinomas) and 130 women with endometrial cancer  who have a hysterectomy\n      without lymphadenectomy (low-risk endometrial carcinomas) are prospectively enrolled in the\n      study.\n\n      The participants are examined preoperatively and on 3 occasions postoperatively, i.e. 4-6\n      weeks , 6 months and 12 months postoperatively.\n\n      Determination of occurrence of lymphedema of the lower extremities are determined\n      objectively by 1) a standardized clinical evaluation according to Bruna et al.[1] and 2)\n      determining the leg volume according to the cone model by Sitzia [2] by systematically\n      measuring of leg circumferences. In addition, occurrence of lymphedema is measured\n      subjectively by the participants.\n\n      On the same four occasions as the leg circumference measurements are conducted the patients\n      complete two generic health related quality of life forms (the EuroQol EQ-5D and the\n      Short-Form 36 SF-36) and the condition specific quality of life form for limb lymphedema\n      (LYMQOL).\n\n      Demographic and clinical data are systematically collected until one year postoperatively\n      including occurrence of complications and given adjuvant oncological therapy such as chemo-\n      and radiation therapy.\n\n      On each occasion of clinical control a vaginal ultrasound examination is carried out in\n      order to register pelvic and abdominal lymphocele formation or lymphatic fluid effusion\n      intraabdominally."
