The study will enroll older cancer patients and\n      their caregivers admitted to 9100 and 9300, which are hematological and non-hematological\n      malignancy units at Duke University Medical Center (DUMC) respectively. Findings derived\n      from this study will inform the development of interventions for better discharge\n      preparation of caregivers for home caregiving. Additionally, the study has the potential to\n      reduce non- emergent use of acute healthcare services through caregiver support and\n      education."
