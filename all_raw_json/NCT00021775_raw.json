It is important to know about the\n      rate of HIV infection and how to get people to enroll for any future studies. This study\n      will be done at 4 study locations."

Very different\n      study designs may be required depending on these parameters, such as the ability of HPTN\n      research centers to recruit study participants and the rate of HIV incidence observed in\n      study populations. This study will be conducted at 4 HPTN sites to establish the necessary\n      research knowledge and infrastructure.\n\n      This study enrolls participants from St. Petersburg, Russia; Xinjiang and Guangxi, China;\n      and Chennai, India who are at high risk for HIV infection due to sexual and/or drug use\n      behaviors. Participants who meet the screening criteria then complete an HIV risk assessment\n      interview, receive HIV pre-test and risk reduction counseling, and undergo phlebotomy for\n      HIV antibody testing. Participants who test positive are referred to available services and\n      studies. Those who test HIV-negative and meet eligibility criteria are enrolled and\n      maintained in follow-up over the next 12 months. Participants complete \"locator contacts\" at\n      Months 3 and 9 and have follow-up visits at Months 6 and 12 for similar tests as performed\n      at entry. In a substudy of this trial in China, participants will be interviewed about their\n      drug use, social networks, needs, and perceptions about HIV/AIDS. These results will be used\n      by HPTN to design more culturally sensitive and appropriate trials in the future."
