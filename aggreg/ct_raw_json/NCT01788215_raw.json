This heterogeneous disorder is characterized by\n      anovulatory infertility, androgen excess, an increase in the ratio of LH to FSH, and\n      morphologic polycystic changes to the ovaries.  Obesity and insulin resistance are also\n      metabolic factors associated with PCOS that further increase the morbidity in these\n      patients.  Inducing fertility in patients with PCOS can be a challenge, as it most often\n      involves ovulation induction that can lead to ovarian enlargement, hyperstimulation, and\n      multiple-birth pregnancies.  This study is designed to determine novel effective strategies\n      to promote normal cycling in this patient population."
