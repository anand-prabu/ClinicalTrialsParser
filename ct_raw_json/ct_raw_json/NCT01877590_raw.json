            "textblock": "Cardiovascular complications account for the highest mortality in type 2 diabetic patients,\n      mainly due to coronary artery disease (CAD). Most of the attention in treating CAD in type 2\n      diabetes is understandably directed toward treating coronary artery conditions. However\n      there are other treatable culprits in these patients.\n\n      Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is widespread in type 2 diabetic patients with CAD, even\n      in the absence of hypertension. It is a strong predictor of cardiovascular events and\n      all-cause mortality. Regression of LVH has been associated with an improved prognosis,\n      independent of change in blood pressure (BP). Therefore, cardiovascular events and mortality\n      in type 2 diabetes with CAD might will be reduced if the investigators can find novel\n      therapies to regress LVH.\n\n      Alpha-lipoic acid reduces oxidative stress which then regresses LVH. Alpha-lipoic acid can\n      improve endothelial function in diabetic conditions. Hence, the main aim of this study was\n      to assess whether alpha-lipoic acid could regress LVM in type 2 diabetic patients with CAD."
