      The purpose of this study is to determine whether ublituximab in combination with
      lenalidomide (Revlimid速) is safe and effective in patients with B-Cell Lymphoid Malignancies
      who have relapsed or are refractory after CD20 directed antibody therapy

    <description>4 cohorts, with 3 - 6 patients per cohort, as follows:
Cohort 1:  Ublituximab 450 mg + Lenalidomide 10 mg
Cohort 2:  Ublituximab 450 mg + Lenalidomide 15 mg
Cohort 3:  Ublituximab 600 mg + Lenalidomide 10 mg (escalation to 15 mg permitted after cycle 1)
Cohort 4:  Ublituximab 900 mg + Lenalidomide 10 mg (escalation to 15 mg permitted after cycle 1)
Ublituximab is an IV infusion on days 1, 8, and 15 of cycles 1 &amp; 2 followed by a planned maintenance with a single infusion on day 1 of cycles 3 thru 6.
Lenalidomide is taken orally on days 9 - 28 of cycle 1 followed by daily administration on Days 1 - 28 for cycles 2 thru 6. Non-hodgkins lymphoma patients may have up to a 7 day rest period (Days 21-28) in any cycle.</description>
