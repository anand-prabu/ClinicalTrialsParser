      This is a phase 3, multi-national, multi-center, randomized, masked, controlled study to
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of an injectable fluocinolone acetonide intravitreal (FAI)
      insert for the management of subjects with non-infectious uveitis affecting the posterior
      segment of the eye. Patients will be randomized to receive either a sham injection or the
      FAI insert and will be observed for three years following treatment.
