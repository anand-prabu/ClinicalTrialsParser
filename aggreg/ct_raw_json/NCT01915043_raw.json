In the literature there are numerous educational\n      recommendations to avoid the appearance BCRL, but there is a lack of adherence to these\n      recommendations. With the increase of mobile technologies among adults, the mobile devices\n      can be an effective method to meet their education.\n\n      Objective: To determine the effectiveness of therapeutic adherence a brief educational\n      intervention through a smartphone-based application in the prevention of lymphedema in women\n      with mastectomies.\n\n      Method: 100 women survivors of breast cancer will be randomized to a group that will receive\n      lymphedema prevention education and an app specific for better adhesion compared to the\n      control group will receive education only. They will be monitored for 28 weeks by specific\n      measures of lymphedema onset, volume and perimeter arm and hand strength lymphedema\n      disability questionnaire and other measures of fatigue, quality of life and mood related to\n      cancer.\n\n      Discussion: The lack of adherence to health education is the main cause of failure in\n      maintaining these brief educational interventions, whether the program is beneficial, it\n      could be successfully implemented in clinical practice."
