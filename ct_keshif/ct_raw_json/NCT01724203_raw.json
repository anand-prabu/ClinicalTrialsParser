Probiotic supplementation is safe for use in infants to the\n      elderly and has demonstrated beneficial effects for a wide variety of health conditions such\n      as acute diarrhea, antibiotic-associated diarrhea, allergies, and inflammatory bowel\n      disease. The immune-enhancing benefits of probiotics are attractive, particularly for\n      infants, a group that is particularly prone to a variety of infections, e.g. respiratory\n      tract infection, strep throat, and diarrhea. Probiotic supplementation has been utilized in\n      previous studies of childhood infections with promising results.\n\n      In this study, the safety and effectiveness of 12-week probiotic supplementation on the\n      incidence and duration of infectious episodes in infants aged 6 to 12 months will be\n      determined. The subjects will receive follow-on formula containing 1 million CFU/g\n      Lactobacillus rhamnosus HN001 (trademarked DR20), 1 million CFU/g Bifidobacterium animalis\n      subsp. lactis HN019 (trademarked DR10), or placebo formula for at least three feeds per day\n      for 12 weeks."
