  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multi-center phaseⅢstudy to evaluate
      efficacy and safety of oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy plus MB-6(320 mg/capsule, 6 capsules
      tid) in patients with stage 3 colorectal cancer who underwent surgical excision of their
      primary tumor.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigational new drug, MB-6, in the proposed clinical trial is to be used as an
      adjuvant therapy for metastatic colorectal cancer patients. All of six extracts have been
      used in human with a long history, and many literatures reported the medicinal use either
      individually or as ingredients of formulations. MB-6 may provide its therapeutic benefits
      via inhibition of tumor induction or enhancing the efficacy of chemotherapy in colorectal
      cancer.
