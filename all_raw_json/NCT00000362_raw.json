            "textblock": "The purpose of this study is to determine whether chin-down posture or use of a thickened\n      liquid diet is more effective in the prevention of aspiration and aspiration pneumonia in\n      patients with Parkinson's disease and/or dementia. Liquid aspiration is the most common type\n      of aspiration in older populations, especially those suffering from debilitation, dementia,\n      and depression. Pneumonia may develop as a consequence of aspiration and is the fifth\n      leading cause of death in the US among persons age 65 years and over. Current treatment\n      involves either use of chin-down position with swallowing or use of thickened liquids in the\n      diet, without any clear evidence supporting the use of one treatment over the other. This is\n      a Phase III inpatient and/or outpatient study in which all participants will be randomly\n      assigned to either the chin-down position or the thickened liquid treatment group based on\n      swallowing function during a modified barium swallow. This study is scheduled to recruit\n      patients for a three-year period; participation by each individual patient spans no more\n      than three months after entry."
