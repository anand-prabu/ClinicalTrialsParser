        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is at least 18 years of age.

          -  Subject has been diagnosed with diabetes mellitus (type 1 or type 2 diabetes)

          -  Subject agrees to sign two (2) copies each of the Subject Informed Consent Form and
             to follow the procedures of the study.

          -  Subject agrees to allow the HCP to perform finger stick for blood glucose test by the
             meter and the YSI instrument. Up to one retry of finger stick will be needed in the
             event of insufficient blood collected or test failure.

          -  Subject agrees to allow the HCP to perform venous puncture for blood glucose test by
             the meter and the YSI instrument, and for haematocrit (HCT) test. Up to one retry of
             venous puncture will be needed in the event of insufficient blood collected or test
             failure.

          -  Subject agrees to provide demographic and medical history information and give access
             to medical records where appropriate.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is currently working for, has previously worked for, or has an immediate
             family member working for a company manufacturing and/or marketing blood glucose
             monitoring products.

          -  Subject has already participated in this study.

          -  Subject is known pregnant
