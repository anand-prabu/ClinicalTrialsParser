            "textblock": "While it is well established that platelets are integral to hemostasis, more recent evidence\n      points to an important role for platelets in inflammation and immunity. Platelet activation\n      and sequestration in pulmonary tissue is a key feature in inflammatory or infectious states\n      such as sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Platelets may mediate acute\n      lung injury (ALI) by recruiting neutrophils, triggering neutrophil extracellular DNA nets,\n      and releasing granule contents and microparticles. Anti-platelet therapy in this setting may\n      prevent platelet activation, platelet - leukocyte aggregate formation, and inflammation.\n\n      The objective of this pilot study is to determine if ticagrelor therapy in individuals with\n      pneumonia reduces markers of platelet activation, platelet-leukocyte aggregates,\n      inflammation, acute lung injury, and lung mechanics.  Because the benefit of anti-platelet\n      therapy may the greatest in patients with more significant lung injury, the investigators\n      will enroll patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) requiring hospitalization or\n      patients with hospital acquired pneumonia (HAP) within 48 hours of diagnosis.  On study day\n      1, subjects will be randomized to receive ticagrelor (180 mg load and 90 mg BID) or placebo.\n      Study medication (ticagrelor or placebo) will be administered twice daily on days 2 - 7 or\n      until hospital discharge, if sooner than 7 days.  Blood will be collected and assays\n      performed on day 1 prior to study medication administration (baseline), day 2, 3, 7, day of\n      discharge (if before 7 days), and 30 days for analysis of platelet count, markers of\n      platelet activation, platelet - leukocyte interactions, biomarkers of inflammation, and\n      measurements of lung mechanics."
