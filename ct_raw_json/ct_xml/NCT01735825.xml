      The purpose of this study is to compare efficacy of coronary in-stent restenosis therapy
      using drug eluting paclitaxel-coated balloon catheters with the latest generation of drug
      eluting stents releasing everolimus.

    <textblock>
      In-stent restenosis after coronary angioplasty is currently one of the main limitations of
      this method, leading to a recurrence of exertional angina pectoris or manifesting as acute
      coronary syndrome. Histopathologic substrate of in-stent restenosis is neointimal
      hyperplasia.

      Repeated plain balloon angioplasty or using cutting balloon catheters in the treatment of
      in-stent restenosis does not achieve satisfactory results. Brachytherapy, used in the past,
      it has also abandoned. The current treatment of in-stent restenosis is the use of drug
      eluting stents. Local drug released from these stents prevents new neointimal
      hyperplasia.This treatment carries the risk of late thrombosis (due to delayed
      neoendotelization) the stent struts and requires rigorous long-term dual antiplatelet
      therapy with the risk of bleeding complications. The drug-coated balloon catheters provide
      short-term penetration of the active substance into the vascular wall, leading to the
      inhibition of hyperproliferation vascular smooth muscle cells, but due to short-term effect
      they do not affect negatively stent struts neoendotelization. Comparable effects of in-stent
      restenosis therapy using paclitaxel releasing balloons was demonstrated in comparison with
      paclitaxel releasing stents, however, the development of drug eluting stents meanwhile
      progressed. The aim of our study is to compare efficacy of coronary in-stent restenosis
      therapy using drug eluting paclitaxel-coated balloon catheters with the latest generation of
      drug eluting stents releasing everolimus. Primary endpoint of our study is late lumen loss,
      because it represents accurate angiographic parameter predicting the need for repeat
      revascularisation and thus the clinical benefit for the patient.
