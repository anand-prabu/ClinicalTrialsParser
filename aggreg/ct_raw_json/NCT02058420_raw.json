            "textblock": "Osteoporosis (severe bone loss) is a bone disease with bone fragility and an increased\n      chance for bone fractures. Women are 4 times more likely to have osteoporosis than men\n      because there is no estrogen protection after menopause and women in general have lighter\n      and thinner bones. Recent studies have indicated tocotrienols (one kind of vitamin E)\n      supplement may be good for the bone health in postmenopausal women. However, no study has\n      ever been done the role of tocotrienols in bone health in postmenopausal women. Our\n      long-term goal is to develop a new strategy featuring a dietary supplement (i.e.,\n      tocotrienols) for slowing down bone loss in postmenopausal women. The purpose of the study\n      is to examine the effect of 12-week tocotrienols on bone measurements in postmenopausal\n      women.  Investigators plan to recruit postmenopausal women using flyers, non-solicited\n      e-mail system, campus announcement, local radio, newspapers, and TV scripts. We plan to\n      enroll approximately 200 women to obtain 78 qualified women at the start of the study. After\n      screening, qualified participants will be matched by body weight and age, and then randomly\n      assigned to no tocotrienols, low tocotrienols, or high tocotrienols group. The outcome\n      measures will be assessed at baseline, after 6, and after 12 weeks. Bone-related\n      measurements will be recorded using blood and urine samples. Investigators will monitor\n      safety of subjects after 6 and after 12 weeks. Food intake, physical activity, and quality\n      of life will be assessed at baseline and 12 weeks. All data will be analyzed statistically."
