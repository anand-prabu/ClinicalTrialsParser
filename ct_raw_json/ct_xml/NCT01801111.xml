  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label, non-randomized, multicenter phase I/II study will evaluate the safety and
      efficacy of RO5424802 in patients with non-small cell lung cancer who have ALK mutation and
      failed crizotinib treatment. In Part 1, cohorts of patients will receive escalating doses of
      RO5424802 orally twice daily. In Part 2, patients will receive the recommended phase II dose
      of RO5424802 as determined in Part 1. Treatment will continue in Part 1 and Part 2 on the
      same dose until disease progression. In Part 3, following disease progression, patients
      without EGFR mutation will be offered continued treatment with RO5424802, patients with EGFR
      mutations will be offered a combination of RO5424802 and Tarceva (erlotinib).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Receipt of any other ALK inhibitors in addition to crizotinib

          -  Receipt of any prior cytotoxic chemotherapy for ALK-positive NSCLC within 4 weeks
             prior to Day 1. Patients who received crizotinib or any other tyrosine kinase
             inhibitors need to have a minimum 2-week washout period before the first dose

          -  Active uncontrolled infectious diseases requiring treatment

          -  NCI CTCAE (version 4.03) Grade 3 or higher toxicities due to prior therapy that have
             not shown improvement and are considered to interfere with current study medication

          -  History of organ transplant

          -  Co-administration of anti-cancer therapies other than those administered in this
             study

          -  Baseline QTc &gt; 470 ms or baseline symptomatic bradycardia &lt; 45 beats per minute

          -  Known HIV positivity or AIDS-related illness

          -  History of significant drug-related allergy (such as anaphylaxis)

          -  Any clinically significant concomitant disease or condition that could interfere
             with, or for which treatment might interfere with, the conduct of the study, or
             absorption of oral medications, or that would, in the opinion of the principal
             investigator, pose an unacceptable risk to the subject in the study
