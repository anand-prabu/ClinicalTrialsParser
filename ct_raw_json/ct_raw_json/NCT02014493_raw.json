            "textblock": "Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) is used to treat preterm infants with an immature\n      respiratory center and having respiratory distress. CPAP requires intensive care monitoring\n      and special qualified staff. Continuous positive pressure makes a constant noise around the\n      child and can lead to an uncomfortable environment.The fixture of the binasal prongs can\n      cause nasal trauma after to tight attachment.Minimizing the time on CPAP is considered\n      important for the child.\n\n      Recently High-Flow Nasal Cannula (HFNC) has become widely used in modern newborn intensive\n      care units.HFNC is considered to be easy to apply and a more comfortable respiratory support\n      for the preterm infant with mild and moderate respiratory distress. HFNC gives warm humified\n      air with high flow through a nasal cannulae. HFNC is used as part of withdrawal from\n      intensive respiratory support, to prevent respiratory distress and as a respiratory support\n      after extubation.\n\n      There is still uncertainty about safety and effectiveness of HFNC. The aim of this study is\n      to investigate the preterm infants respiratory effort by measuring electrical activity in\n      diaphragm (Edi max and Edi min), respiratory parameters and a clinical observation using a\n      scoring system inspired by Silverman- Andersen retraction score. It is expected that\n      measured electrical activity in the diaphragm, measured respiratory parameters combined with\n      bedside observations provide applicable knowledge about preterm infants respiratory effort\n      in transition from CPAP to HFNC."
