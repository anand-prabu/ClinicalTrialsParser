            "textblock": "Meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) is a common condition that causes the secretion from\n      meibomian glands in the eyelids to become blocked. Normally, the secretion helps to maintain\n      a healthy tear film. In MGD, the tear film becomes unstable and often causes dry eye\n      symptoms. Treatments often involve gently warming the eyelids to melt this blockage which\n      prevents tears from spreading over the eye. Although there has been some research on\n      application of heat with warm moist flannels, the Eye Bags potentially offers a simpler and\n      more effective method of applying heat to the eyelids. This study will test the efficiency\n      of these eyelid warming devices over a period of two weeks use in one eye compared to the\n      other non-treated eye."
