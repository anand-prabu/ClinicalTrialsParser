If it can be demonstrated that treatment via telepsychiatry\n      is as effective as in-person treatment, then many individuals with psychiatric illness will\n      have easy access to psychiatric care, even if they live in geographically remote areas.\n\n      Objectives:\n\n      The major goal of this study was to determine whether treatment of depressive disorders via\n      telepsychiatry is as effective as in-person treatment.  In addition, this study was designed\n      to determine if depressed patients are as compliant and as satisfied with telepsychiatry as\n      with in-person treatment.  Another goal was to compare the cost and cost-effectiveness of\n      remote treatment via telepsychiatry to in-person treatment.\n\n      Methods:\n\n      In this randomized controlled trial, veterans who presented with depression to any of three\n      VA Maryland Health Care facilities with a SCID-IV depression diagnosis and a Hamilton Rating\n      Scale for Depression (Ham-D) score of 16 or above were eligible for participation.  Eligible\n      veterans were randomized to either \"in-person\" treatment or \"remote\" treatment.  Treatment\n      occurred over six months and consisted of psychotropic medication and psycho-education\n      concerning the disease, medications, and side effects.  The major outcome variables included\n      changes in Ham-D depression ratings and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) self-reported\n      depression ratings.\n\n      Status:\n\n      Completed."
