Patients are stratified according to age\n      (8-12 vs 13-20) and treatment (current vs previous). Patients are randomized to one of two\n      arms of the study. Arm I (Reliability): Patients will complete the same questionnaire two\n      weeks apart. (age 13-20 stratum closed as of 7/14/00) Arm II (Validity): Patients will\n      complete a study questionnaire plus a Child Health Questionnaire. Patients between ages 8-12\n      are interviewed and patients between ages 13-20 complete a written questionnaire.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 716 patients (416 for arm I (208 for 8-12 age group and 208\n      for 13-20 age group) and 300 for arm II (150 for 8-12 age group and 150 for 13-20 age\n      group)) will be accrued for this study."
