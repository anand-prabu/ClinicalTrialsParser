  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main goal of this project is to compare two different approaches to reducing levels of
      nicotine in cigarettes: an immediate reduction in nicotine content in cigarettes to
      non-addictive levels or a gradual reduction in nicotine content in cigarettes to
      non-addictive levels.  These two approaches will then be contrasted to a group that
      continues to smoke cigarettes with nicotine content similar to conventional cigarettes.
