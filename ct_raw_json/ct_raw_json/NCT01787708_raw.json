Mucocutaneous lesions develop secondary to\n      selective destruction of melanocytes. The etiology of vitiligo is largely unknown but more\n      likely to be multifactorial. There are several theories on the pathogenesis of vitiligo\n      including mainly the autoimmune, neurohormonal, and autocytotoxic theories. The autoimmune\n      hypothesis has the strongest evidence with alteration mainly in the cellular immune\n      response.\n\n      There are many treatment modalities available for vitiligo, however, none of them cure the\n      disease. These include different topical treatments, phototherapy, surgical therapy, and\n      depigmentation therapy. Visible red light has been shown to stimulates melanocyte migration\n      and proliferation resulting in repigmentation of vitiligo patches. However, there are only a\n      few studies published on the efficacy of red light in vitiligo. The investigators plan on\n      conducting a prospective single-blind randomized clinical trial to assess efficacy of red\n      light in the treatment of vitiligo.\n\n      Study Objective To evaluate the potential for red light to induce repigmentation within\n      vitiligo patches."
