Adolescents and parents assigned to the FFT-V condition will receive a Verizon netbook laptop computer equipped with the Microsoft Windows 7 operating system, webcam, and VTC software for use in the family home. The VTC software is designed to stream live video between therapists and participants, to record video, and to store recorded videos as digital mpeg files. All family sessions will take place via video teleconference."

In the proposed investigation, FFT-V will be compared with FFT\n      administered face-to-face in the family home as well as to a services-as-usual (SAU)\n      condition. The overarching objective of the study is to examine the degree to which an\n      empirically based model of substance abuse treatment such as FFT can be effectively\n      administered via video teleconferencing to adolescents and families living in rural and\n      remote areas who would be otherwise unlikely to access treatment. The specific aims of the\n      proposed study are to (1) evaluate the efficacy of FFT-V compared to FFT and SAU in reducing\n      adolescent drug use, HIV risk behavior, delinquency, and recidivism, (2) evaluate the\n      efficacy of FFT-V compared to FFT in establishing functional levels of therapeutic alliance\n      formation, treatment attendance, retention, and satisfaction with treatment, (3) evaluate\n      the efficacy of FFT-V compared to FFT and SAU in impacting core mechanisms of change in\n      adolescent behavior including improved levels of family functioning and adolescent\n      association with substance using peers, and (4) conduct a preliminary cost-effectiveness\n      analysis to derive initial estimates of the relative costs of each treatment modality per\n      outcome unit."

            "textblock": "It has been well documented that only about 10% of adolescents with clinically diagnosable\n      substance use problems receive treatment in any given year. One of the major contributing\n      factors to chronic levels of unmet need for treatment among this population is the\n      unavailability and inaccessibility of treatment services. Service accessibility is\n      particularly limited in rural areas. To address problems of service availability and\n      accessibility in rural areas, the use of video teleconferencing technology to provide direct\n      services has emerged within the fields of medicine and psychiatry in particular. The use of\n      such technology to enhance the delivery of behavioral psychotherapy is beginning to emerge\n      as well. A handful of primarily small-scale pilot and feasibility studies indicate that\n      psychotherapy interventions administered using video teleconferencing technology may be as\n      effective as traditional face-to-face interventions. Few randomized clinical trials of\n      telepsychotherapy have been conducted to date, however, and virtually none have examined\n      video teleconferencing interventions for any type of child or adolescent behavioral problem\n      including substance abuse. The proposed study is intended to address the need for research\n      evaluating the application of video teleconferencing technology as a means of service\n      delivery for substance abusing adolescents and their families living in rural areas.\n      Specifically, this study will examine the efficacy of Functional Family Therapy administered\n      by video teleconference (FFT-V) in the homes of substance abusing adolescents. FFT-V will be\n      compared with FFT administered face-to-face in the family home as well as to\n      services-as-usual (SAU) coordinated through the Juvenile Services Division (JSD) of the\n      State of New Mexico Children, Youth, and Families Department (CYFD). FFT, based on more than\n      30 years of research, is an established EBT for adolescent substance abuse and related\n      problem behaviors such as HIV risk and delinquency. Moreover, FFT is one of few\n      evidence-based therapies shown to be effective for rural families. The study will be\n      conducted in the homes of participating adolescents and parents living in rural communities\n      located between 30 and 50 miles from the Center for Family and Adolescent Research (CFAR) in\n      Albuquerque, NM. One hundred and twenty youth will be referred to the study by Children\n      Youth and Family Department juvenile probation officers within two rural counties in New\n      Mexico, Sandoval and Valencia, which are adjacent to the town of Albuquerque which is\n      located in Bernalillo County.  Adolescent participants meeting diagnostic criteria for\n      substance abuse or dependence, along with the participating parent, will be randomly\n      assigned to the FFT, FFT-V, or SAU conditions. Four assessments of all participants in all\n      three conditions will occur at: pre-treatment, 4-, 8-, and 12 months after treatment\n      initiation. Outcome analyses will examine adolescent substance abuse, HIV risk behavior,\n      delinquency, and recidivism, family functioning, and adolescent association with substance\n      abusing peers. The study will also examine clinical process variables known to impact\n      treatment efficacy (e.g., therapeutic alliance formation, treatment motivation, and\n      retention). The overarching objective of the study is to examine the degree to which an\n      empirically based model of substance abuse treatment such as FFT can be effectively\n      administered via video teleconferencing to adolescents and families living in rural and\n      remote areas and thus have less access to treatment."

Days spent in a restrictive environment will be excluded from the baseline assessment period.
