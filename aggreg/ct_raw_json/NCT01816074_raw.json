In terms of improved parenting, we hypothesize that some mothers may respond well\n      to LDX or BPT alone and therefore may not require multi-modal treatment, whereas others may\n      benefit most from multi-modal treatment"

Our primary outcome measure for the child will be whether child ADHD symptoms on\n      the Conners Parent and Teacher Rating Scales decreased at the completion of the study.  Our\n      secondary outcome measure will be whether there was a need for medication for the child over\n      the course of the study. The primary outcome for the mother will be the Conners Adult ADHD\n      Rating Scale (CAARS) Attention Scale and the Clinical Global Impression-Severity scale\n      (CGI-S)."
