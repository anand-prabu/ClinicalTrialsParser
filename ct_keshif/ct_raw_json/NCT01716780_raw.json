At baseline questionnaires are\n      completed on level of pain, type of pain, quality of life and anxiety/depression.\n      Information is also collected on the analgesia they've used in the past month and basic\n      health economics (GP/hospital visits related to pain management and treatment).\n\n      Follow up in the trial is for 3 months and consists of questionnaires as above and further\n      collection of information on analgesic usage and health economics."
