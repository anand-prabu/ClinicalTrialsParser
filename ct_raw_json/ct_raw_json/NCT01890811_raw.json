            "textblock": "Weight loss commonly occurs in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), negatively\n      influencing their quality of life, treatment response and survival. Loss of muscle protein\n      is generally a central component of weight loss in CKD patients but patients also have\n      reductions in fat mass and bone density, independent of the severity of the disease state.\n      Attempts to reverse weight and muscle loss in CKD and improve nutritional status by\n      nutritional supplementation have been unsuccessful and there are currently no approved\n      therapies.\n\n      Purpose of this study is to provide detailed insight in disease related gut function by\n      obtaining information on gut permeability, digestion and absorption of glucose, fat and\n      protein in CKD patients compared to matched healthy controls. Additionally, to examine\n      whether protein and amino acid metabolism is disturbed in CKD patients compared to healthy\n      controls. This will provide required information that will lead to implement new strategies\n      to develop optimal nutritional regimen in order to enhance nutritional status, quality of\n      life and survival in relation to kidney disease."

Subjects will also\n      receive a mixture of amino acids that are made a little heavier than normal, called stable\n      isotopes. This stable isotopes is used to investigate protein behavior in the body (protein\n      kinetics). Blood (100-120 ml in total) and urine samples will be collected over 7.5 hours."
