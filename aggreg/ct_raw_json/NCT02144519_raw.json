The\n      investigators objective here is two fold. First, the investigators will test the\n      effectiveness of two promising strategies designed to 1) increase the amount of PA children\n      accumulate while attending an ASP and 2) promote changes in the nutritional quality of the\n      snacks served. This represents a fundamental step in establishing practice-based guidelines\n      (best practices) for the uptake and achievement of public health policy goals (CA and\n      Harvard). Second, the investigators will examine the barriers and facilitators to\n      implementing these strategies. The expected outcome of this study is evidence supporting\n      best practices for ASPs to employ to meet policy goals."
