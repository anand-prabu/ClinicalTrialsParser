This disease, due to its morbidity and mortality, poses a significant public\n      health problem in France. Apart from the involvement of bacterial factors and those\n      involving the permeability of the epithelial barrier, it is now well recognized that several\n      factors are associated with genetic predisposition in some of these patients. Among these\n      factors, the Nod2 mutations were first identified. Studies concerning the presence of these\n      mutations and the severity of disease results were sometimes conflicting. Very recently, new\n      interesting mutations in genes involved in autophagy were found with greater frequency in\n      patients with Crohn's disease. These mutations observed in Atg16 and IRGM genes. It has been\n      particularly shown on large patient cohorts,the IRGM polymorphism was associated with a\n      progressive disease, with histological severity scores. One of the severity criteria of\n      Crohn's disease is the early recurrence observed in some patients after surgical resection\n      of the injured segment. Predictive factors for such recurrence after surgery are not known\n      or not."
