In Sweden, about 3700 persons are diagnosed every year.\n      About one fifth of the patients are eligible for surgery.\n\n      Patients undergoing thoracic surgery suffer from pain and low health related quality of life\n      after surgery.\n\n      In Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom, pre- and postoperative physiotherapy is\n      routinely provided for patients undergoing thoracic surgery, but the effects have not been\n      thoroughly investigated. The scientific evidence of the effect of physiotherapy in\n      connection with lung surgery is limited. The treatment typically consists of early\n      mobilisation, breathing exercises and exercises for the shoulders. Reeve et al has shown\n      that a postoperative shoulder exercise program can improve function and decrease pain after\n      thoracotomy. Breathing exercises has not been found effective in reducing the rate of\n      postoperative pulmonary complications after thoracic surgery.\n\n      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of in-hospital physiotherapy\n      treatment, for patients undergoing thoracic surgery, on physical activity, health related\n      quality of life, pain and lung function."
