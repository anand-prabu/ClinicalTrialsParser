        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Healthy children between 12 months and 15 months old who were born with an estimated
             gestational age ≥ 37 weeks;

          2. Parent(s)/legal guardian(s) have given written informed consent after the nature of
             the study has been explained;

          3. Available for all the visits and complying with the requirements of the protocol
             (e.g., completion of the Diary Cards, availability for study visits / safety phone
             calls);

          4. In good health as determined by the outcome of medical history, physical examination
             and clinical judgment of the investigator.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Previous confirmed or suspected disease caused by N. meningitidis.

          2. Previously exposed to clinically proven meningococcal disease or clinical bacterial
             meningitis without further microbiologic characterization, i.e. possible
             meningococcal disease.

          3. Previously immunized with a meningococcal vaccine or vaccine containing meningococcal
             antigen(s) (licensed or investigational).

          4. Received within 90 days prior to enrollment or are expected to receive during the
             study period any investigational or non-registered product (drug or vaccine).

          5. Received or planning to receive any vaccines within 14 days before and 30 days after
             administration of the study vaccine (Exceptions: Injectable influenza vaccine may be
             administered up to 14 days prior to study vaccination and at least 14 days after
             study vaccination).

          6. Major congenital defect or a serious chronic disease.

          7. History of any anaphylaxis, severe vaccine reactions, or allergy to any vaccine
             components including diphtheria toxoid (CRM197) or tetanus toxoid (TT) and latex.

          8. Requiring chronic administration (defined as more than 14 days) of immunosuppressants
             or other immune-modifying drugs within six months prior to the study vaccination.
             (For corticosteroids, this means prednisone, or equivalent, ≥ 0.5 mg/kg/day. Inhaled
             and topical steroids are allowed).

          9. Receipt of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within six months prior to study
             vaccination or who have administration planned during the study period.

         10. Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, based on
             medical history and physical examination.

         11. Any bleeding disorder which is considered as a contraindication to intramuscular
             injection.

         12. Moderate or severe acute infection and/or fever (defined as temperature 38°C) within
             3 days prior to enrollment.

         13. Systemic antibiotic treatment within 7 days prior to enrollment.
