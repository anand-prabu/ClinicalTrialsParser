  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To purpose of this study is to determine if treatment with SVF (Stromal Vascular Fraction)
      has an effect on pain and inflammation associated with Osteoarthritis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective non-randomized, clinical study of 30 patients to determine safety and
      treatment potential of A3(Adult Autologous Adipose) SVF for the pain and inflammation
      associated with Osteoarthritis.

      Patients will be treated for Osteoarthritis due to degeneration or chronic injury.  They
      will be given autologous SVF extract derived by the A3 method mixed with activated platelets
      from a PRP(platelet rich plasma) preparation as direct injections to the effected joints.
      Outcomes will be tracked with WOMAC (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis
      Index), AUSCAN(Australian Hand Osteoarthritis Index) scores, and a general blood panel in
      order to evaluate systemic effects.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with indication of Osteoarthritis.  Can be from degeneration or chronic
             injury.

          -  Patients range from 15-90 years of age.

          -  Female patients not pregnant or lactating.

          -  Patients with a history of or current corticosteroid therapy will only be eligible if
             use is suspended from 1 month prior to cell therapy.

          -  Patients must be able to comply with treatment plan, laboratory tests and periodic
             interviews.

          -  Patients with adequate renal function, creatinine ≤ 1.5 mg/dl.

          -  Patients with adequate blood coagulation activity, PT(INR) &lt; 1.5, APTT &lt;1.5×control.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of cancer within 5 years prior to screening, except for cutaneous basal
             cell or squamous cell cancer resolved by excision.

          -  Signs and symptoms of clinically significant cardiac disease.

          -  Diagnosis of a transient ischemic attack in the 6 months prior to screening,

          -  Known allergy to anesthetic or any other components of study.

          -  Patients infected with hepatitis B, C or HIV.

          -  Patients with Body Mass Index (BMI) &gt; 39kg/m2 .
