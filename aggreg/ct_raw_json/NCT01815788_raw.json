Nevertheless, a lot of mild and moderate impaired\n      hearing people don't want to buy and wear all day a real hearing aid.\n\n      The goal of our study is to evaluate the benefit of such a device for mild and moderate\n      presbycusis patient 60 years of age and older, with no previous hearing aid."
