  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a post-marketing case-controlled study of the effectiveness of a quadrivalent live
      attenuated influenza vaccine (Q/LAIV/FluMist® Quadrivalent) versus Inactivated Influenza
      Vaccine (IIV) and No Vaccine in subjects 2-17 years of age.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This post-marketing study will enroll approximately 5,200 subjects 2-17 years of age who are
      seeking care in an outpatient setting for febrile acute respiratory illness.  This study
      will begin in the fall of 2013 and will be completed after 4 influenza seasons (i.e.after
      the 2016-2017 influenza season).  No investigational product will be administered in this
      study.  A nasal swab will be obtained and tested for the presence of influenza virus and
      other viral pathogens. This study will be conducted at 4 sites in the United States of
      America.  The duration of study participation for each subject is one day.

    <description>Vaccine Effectiveness is defined as 100 x (1-odds ratio), where the odds ratio is the odds of exposures (Q/LAIV versus Inactivated Influenza Vaccine or no vaccine) among laboratory confirmed cases of flu versus controls. Effectiveness will be monitored by flu season, class of age and by influenza strain.</description>
