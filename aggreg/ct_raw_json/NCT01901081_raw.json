Tiny (2.5 mm by 16 mm)\n      Implantable Myoelectric Sensors (IMES) will be implanted into the residual forearm muscles\n      of three transradial amputee subjects.  These devices wirelessly transmit electrical muscle\n      signals to an electromechanical prosthetic wrist and hand.\n\n      Following a two-week recovery from implantation of six to eight IMES into residual forearm\n      muscles, subjects will initiate seven months of training.  Subjects first train for\n      approximately a month using a bench-top IMES system.  When they receive their custom-fit\n      IMES Prosthesis (including electromechanical wrist and hand) subjects initiate six months of\n      additional training.  Subjects will then be given the option to use the IMES Prosthesis for\n      another sixteen months.  The usability and functionality of the prosthetic system will be\n      evaluated throughout the study."
