  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, investigators will evaluated the long-term efficacy and safety (two years) of
      Tacrolimus-Rituximab (RTX) therapy compared to Methylprednisolone-Cyclophosphamide (CYC)
      therapy in patients with primary Membranous Nephropathy (MN).

      PRINCIPAL OBJECTIVE To evaluate  whether sequential therapy with tacrolimus for 9 months (6
      months of full therapy and 3 months of tapering doses) followed by a dose of RTX leads to a
      greater increase in the proportion of primary MN patients with complete remission (CR),
      defined as a reduction of proteinuria since baseline level to a value equal or lower than
      0.5 g/24 h proteinuria plus stable renal function measured as estimated glomerular
      filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 60 ml/min/1.73m2, and the proportion of patients with partial
      remission (PR), defined as a reduction of proteinuria since baseline level to a value less
      than 3.5 g/24 h and 50% lower than baseline proteinuria plus stable renal function (eGFR ≥
      60 ml/min/1.73m2), when compared with patients receiving cyclical treatment with
      corticosteroids and CYC for 6 months. This will be assessed after 24 months.

      Phase of the trial: and design: Phase III study, open label, randomized, and active
      controlled trial.

      This study will have 3 stages: screening and recruitment of patients for 18 months,
      treatment period for six months in corticosteroids plus CYC group and 9 months in
      Tacrolimus-RTX group, and finally post-treatment follow-up period until to complete 24
      months of follow-up since initial treatment.

      This study will compare the standard therapy for primary MN patients with nephrotic range
      proteinuria  (active control of steroids plus CYC) with a novel sequential therapy of
      tacrolimus and RTX, an approach of potential high efficacy, low toxicity and more acceptable
      safety profile.

      PRIMARY AND SECONDARY ENDPOINTS/OUTCOME MEASURES

      Primary end-point:

      The proportion of patients reaching CR defined as a reduction of proteinuria since baseline
      level to a value equal or lower than 0.5 g/24 h proteinuria plus stable renal function (eGFR
      ≥ 60 ml/min/1.73m2) or PR defined as a reduction of proteinuria since baseline level to a
      value less than 3.5 g/24 h and 50% lower than baseline proteinuria plus stable renal
      function (eGFR ≥ 60 ml/min/1.73m2) at 24 months of study treatment.

      Secondary end-points

        -  The proportion of patients with Limited response (LR) defined as a reduction of
           proteinuria since baseline level &gt; 50% but to a value &gt; 3.5g/24 h. at 12, 18 and 24
           months of study treatment..

        -  The number of patients with an increase ≥ 50% of serum creatinine (SCr) from baseline
           at 12, 18 and 24 months (end of the follow-up).

        -  The time of renal survival (status free of increase ≥ 50% of baseline SCr) in both arms
           overall after the study.

        -  The proportion of patients with preserved renal function (estimated GFR ≥ 60 ml/min) in
           both treatment arms after the treatment period.

        -  The proportion of patients with relapse (defines as the reappearance of proteinuria &gt;
           3.5 gr/24h and at least 50% increase over the lowest baseline value in at least three
           consecutive visits in those patients who previously presented a PR or CR) and the time
           to relapse after the treatment period.

        -  Serum levels of anti-phospholipase A2 receptor antibodies (anti-PLA2R), before of
           treatment and at 12, and 24 months of study, in both treatment arms.

        -  Serum immune cells (CD4+ and CD8 T cells and CD19+ B cells) before of treatment, and
           after 12, and 24 months of study in both arms.

        -  The proportion of patient with drug-related adverse events and serious adverse events.
