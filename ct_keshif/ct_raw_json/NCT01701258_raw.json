            "textblock": "Severe childhood adversity, including childhood sexual abuse (CSA) explains 32-44% of\n      psychiatric disorders and is associated with substantially increased risks for depression\n      and substance abuse later in life. However, 20-40% of adults with a history of CSA report\n      little to no consequences. The neurobiological underpinnings associated with adaptive\n      (resilience) and maladaptive consequences of CSA remain largely unknown. The goal of this\n      study is to investigate brain pathways within adult females (with a history of CSA that\n      occurred between the ages of 5-9) with and without a current diagnosis of major depressive\n      disorder (MDD). We hypothesize that the CSA/MDD participants will be characterized by (1)\n      reduced reward responsiveness and prefrontal cortex activity, but increased cortisol levels,\n      (2) reduced dopamine activity, and (3) reduced dopamine transporter binding. The\n      over-arching purpose of the study is to (1) identify individuals at risk for psychopathology\n      and maladaptive behavior, (2) prevent re-victimization, and (3) develop more targeted\n      therapeutic interventions.\n\n      This study involves 4 sessions, described below.\n\n      Session 1 (SCID Session) The first session takes place at the Center for Depression,\n      Anxiety, and Stress Research (CDASR) or Neuroimaging Center (both at McLean Hospital) and\n      involves consenting, a clinical evaluation, a series of questionnaires, and a medical\n      assessment.\n\n      Session 2 or 3 (fMRI Session) The third session takes place at the Neuroimaging Center.\n      Using a double-blind design, participants will be administered either amisulpride (50 mg) or\n      placebo. Participants will complete the Monetary Incentive Delay (MID) task during\n      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and the Probabilistic Stimulus Selection Task\n      (PSST) afterwards.\n\n      Session 2 or 3 (PET Session) This session takes place at Massachusetts General Hospital. 9\n      mCi of [11C] altropane will be injected by a trained nuclear medicine technician and\n      positron emission tomography (PET) scanning will begin. Prior to the PET scan, a blood serum\n      pregnancy test will be administered for females.\n\n      Session 4 (ERP Session) The fourth session takes place at the CDASR and involves an\n      electroencephalography (EEG) recording, the Probabilistic Reward Task (PRT), and collecting\n      saliva samples to assess cortisol levels."
