  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite early goal-directed maintenance of normal macrocirculation, the reduction of 60-day
      mortality of patients with severe sepsis and septic shock remained unsatisfied (56.9% to
      44.3%). One of the major causes of high mortality is microcirculatory dysfunction. Delayed
      diagnosis and treatment of microcirculatory dysfunction may cause tissue hypoperfusion and
      resulted in multiple organ dysfunction and death. Dexmedetomidine is a highly selective
      Î±2-adrenoreceptor agonist which exhibits sedative and analgesic effects. Recent studies
      suggest that dexmedetomidine also has anti-coagulation and anti-inflammatory effects, and it
      can reduce the mortality of endotoxemic rats and patients with severe sepsis. The
      investigators will conduct two animal studies and one clinical trial to investigate the
      effect of dexmedetomidine on microcirculatory dysfunction and organ injury in rat with
      endotoxemia and patients with severe sepsis and septic shock.

      Sixty patients with severe sepsis and septic shock will be enrolled and randomized to
      control group or dexmedetomidine group. In the control group, the patients will be treated
      according to the clinical practice guideline. If sedation is required, non-dexmedetomidine
      sedative agents will be used. In the dexmedetomidine group, the patients will be treated
      according to the clinical practice guideline, and they will also receive continuous infusion
      of dexmedetomidine (infusion rate ranged from 0.1 to 0.7 mcg/kg/h) for 24 hours as needed.
      The sublingual microcirculation and serum level of Endocan will be examined at preset time
      points up to 24 hours. The vital signs, hemodynamic parameters, and survival of 28-day and
      90-day will be recorded and analyzed.
