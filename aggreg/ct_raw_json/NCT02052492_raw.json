            "textblock": "Activated macrophages, present in excess during natural inflammatory responses, bear the\n      potential to kill and eradicate cancer cells. Macrophage activation has been demonstrated to\n      require the serum-borne vitamin D binding protein (known as Gc protein), as well as B and T\n      lymphocytes. However, in various cancer patients the Gc protein is deglycosylated by serum\n      \u03b1-N-acetyl galactosaminidase (Nagalase) secreted from cancer cells. This deglycosylated Gc\n      protein, lacking the N-acetylgalactosamine monosaccharide, cannot be converted to its form\n      of Macrophage Activating Factor, leading to immunosuppression rather than Macrophage\n      activation against cancer cells.\n\n      Efranat has developed cancer immunotherapy based on Macrophage Activating Factor produced\n      from natural Gc protein extracted from FDA approved healthy human plasma.\n\n      In this phase I study, the treatment is given as Intramuscular, once-weekly injection of\n      GcMAF, for two courses, while each course is comprised of 4 injections.\n\n      The investigational treatment is expected to enhance immune response, thereby, improve\n      patient's well being, quality of life and disease control.\n\n      Primary objectives:\n\n        1. To determine the safety and tolerability of GcMAF and to define the Maximal Tolerated\n           Dose (MTD)\n\n        2. To identify the Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) of GcMAF\n\n      Secondary objectives:\n\n        1. To determine the 'Recommended Phase 2 Dose' (RP2D) based on MTD data, immunological and\n           pharmacodynamic markers.\n\n        2. To explore the preliminary efficacy of GcMAF in advanced solid tumors, considering the\n           'Immune-related Response Criteria' (irRC), the 'Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid\n           Tumors' (RECIST) and blood levels of tumor-related markers known to reflect tumor\n           burden.\n\n      Exploratory objectives:\n\n        1. To assess levels of immune-related factors in peripheral blood, reflecting induced\n           immunological activities.\n\n        2. To immunohistochemically assess and compare tumor derived tissue samples Pre and post\n           treatment. To analyze the infiltration of different population of cells into the tumor\n           bed."

Each course will consist of 4 injections with one week intervals (total: 8 weeks\n      of treatment).\n\n      Dose escalation will only proceed in the absence of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) during\n      course 1. For this purpose, each cohort will only begin its first course of GcMAF when the\n      cohort preceding it has successfully completed its first 4-week treatment course without any\n      signs of DLT. During this first course, should 1/3 patients experience DLT, dose escalation\n      for the next cohort will not be authorized; the next cohort will receive the same dose as\n      the one preceding it. If 2 patients or more of all patients treated with a given dose\n      develop DLT, dose escalation will be halted and no more patients will be treated at the DLT\n      dose. The value of MTD will be defined as the GcMAF dose below the dose at which DLT was\n      seen for  at least 2 subjects. Upon determination of the MTD, an additional cohort will be\n      opened (confirmatory cohort) and treated with two courses of that dose.\n\n      Part 2:\n\n      Once MTD is established, or, when the last cohort completes its first course of treatment\n      without an established MTD, an additional cohort will be opened in order to treat up to\n      additional subjects with a selected dose of GcMAF already confirmed to be safe in part 1 of\n      the study.\n\n      Continued treatment after completion of course 2 will be as per the investigator's\n      discretion. Patient follow-up will continue for 12 months after start of treatment (Day 1).\n      Patients for whom progressive disease (PD) is observed prior to completion of those two\n      courses will be followed up only until PD."
