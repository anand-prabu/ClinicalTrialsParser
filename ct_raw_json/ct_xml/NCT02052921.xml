  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With the possibility of pathological complete response in surgical specimens, some authors
      have proposed non-operative management of the patient group, when re-staged after
      neoadjuvant treatment, have complete clinical response. So far, this approach remains
      discussed in the literature, and there are still many uncertainties that patients with
      clinical complete response after chemoradiotherapy in fact no detectable viable tumor and
      may be omitted of radical surgical treatment. It is a still investigational approach and
      actually gained space even for patients with very high or who refuse surgery after all
      clarifications surgical risk.

      Hypothesis: The preservation of the rectum in patients with adenocarcinoma of the middle and
      distal rectum (up to 10 cm) reaching clinical complete response after neoadjuvant
      chemoradiotherapy have similar rate of the rectal cancer recurrence than patients who
      underwent surgical rectal resection.

      This will be a prospective, randomized, open label phase II  of surgical resection versus
      conservative treatment (observation) in patients with mid and distal rectal cancer who
      achieved complete after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy combined with clinical response.

      The main objective of this study is to assess whether conservative approach is similar to
      rectosigmoidectomy with complete mesorectal excision or amputation abdminoperineal the
      rectum in patients with complete clinical response after neoadjuvant therapy combined
      chemoradiotherapy.

      Patient Selection: To be eligible patients who have neoadjuvant prior histologic diagnosis
      of rectal adenocarcinoma, tumors located within 10 cm from the anal verge, a complete
      clinical response after treatment with chemoradiotherapy for rectal tumors staged clinical
      and radiological T3-4 N0 M0 or T (any) N + M0, absence of colorectal synchronous tumors.

      Treatment: Eligible patients will be randomized 1:1 to resection of the rectum or notice.
      The period for randomization of patients will be 12 weeks after the last dose of
      radiotherapy / chemotherapy, so that we can properly assess the antitumor response as
      described above. After randomization, patients in the surgical group will undergo resection
      of the rectum with complete excision of mesorectal within 2 weeks after randomization.
