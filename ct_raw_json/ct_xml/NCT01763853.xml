  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The need for fluid resuscitation (FR) in ICU patients with acute respiratory distress
      syndrome (ARDS) is common. Indeed, relative or absolute hypovolemia is a common phenomenon
      that the intensivist must recognize early and treat promptly. Fluid challenge may have
      adverse side effects associated with fluid administration. The diffusion within the
      interstitial space may favor edema formation and cause cardiac dysfunction by volume
      overload. Edema formation is global and may specifically alter pulmonary alveolar epithelial
      integrity, leading to enhanced alveolar edema and impaired gas exchange.

      Currently, two types of fluids are frequently used, crystalloids and Hydroxyethyl starches.
      Hydroxyethyl starches have the theoretical advantage of causing greater volume expansion.

      We hypothesized that a fluid resuscitation therapy with hydroxyethyl starch generates less
      pulmonary edema than a fluid resuscitation therapy with crystalloids.

      The aim of our study is to compare alveolar fluid clearance, as a marker of alveolar edema
      fluid resorption, in 2 groups of patients: those treated with hydroxyethyl starch and those
      treated with crystalloid.

      The main objective of our prospective double blind, randomized, controlled trial is to
      compare the rate of alveolar fluid clearance, a marker of alveolar edema fluid resorption,
      in 2 groups of patients with ARDS and suffering from hypovolemia: those treated with
      hydroxyethyl starch and those treated with crystalloid (fluid challenge of 7 mL/kg over 15
      minutes, that can be repeated 3 times if hypovolemia persists).

      The evolution of respiratory and hemodynamic parameters, as measured by transpulmonary
      thermodilution (extra-vascular lung water, pulmonary vascular permeability index, cardiac
      output, global enddiastolic volume), plasma osmolality, plasma oncotic pressure and plasma
      levels of brain natriuretic peptid (BNP) will be studied one hour and 3 hours after after
      fluid resuscitation in the two groups. In order to evaluate alveolar epithelial dysfunction
      in patients receiving either hydroxyethyl starch or crystalloid, plasma and alveolar levels
      of sRAGE (the soluble form of the receptor for advanced glycation endproducts) will be
      measured by ELISA. Lung aeration and fluid-induced derecruitment will be evaluated with an
      electrical impedance tomograph (PulmoVista®500, Dräger).
