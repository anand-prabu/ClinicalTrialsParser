The aspergillosis strains will be stored in 10 % glycerol\n      broth at -80 \u00b0C. The in vitro antifungal susceptibility test of aspergillosis strains to\n      voriconazole will be performed in the Centre for Medical Mycology and Mycoses, First\n      Hospital, Peking University, and the performance will be according to the Clinical and\n      Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) standard M38-A2 microdilution methods.\n\n      Serum galactomannan (GM) test will be performed twice per week for the first two weeks. A\n      double-sandwich ELISA GM assay was used. A cut-off of optical density index (ODI) >0.5 was\n      taken as positive.\n\n      Voriconazole serum levels will be measured on day 4, day 7, day 10, and day 14 (all trough\n      levels). In brief, quantitative analysis of voriconazole was performed using\n      high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry.\n\n      Genotyping of CYP2C19 will be performed using 3 ml of peripheral blood sampled into EDTA\n      (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) tubes at day 4. Genomic DNA was extracted from blood\n      leukocytes with the use of a DNA extraction kit. Genotyping was confirmed by polymerase\n      chain reaction (PCR)-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis. Individuals\n      can be divided into three groups according to the CYP2C19 genotype. Those who inherit two\n      mutant CYP2C19 alleles (*2 and/or *3) have a reduced capacity to metabolize CYP2C19\n      substrates and are defined as poor metabolizers (PMs). Individuals who are homozygous\n      (*1/*1) for wild-type CYP2C19*1 or 1 wild-type allele and 1 CY\u00acP2C19*17 have efficient\n      enzymes to metabolize CYP2C19 substrates and are defined as extensive metabolizers (EMs).\n      Subjects who are heterozygous (*1/*2, *1/*3) for wild-type CYP2C19*1 are defined as\n      intermediate metabolizers (IMs)"
