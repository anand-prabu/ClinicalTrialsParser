    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies whether unilateral group D retinoblastoma, or
      retinoblastoma affecting one eye that has spread to the inner jelly like part of the eye,
      can be treated with a new technique for delivering chemotherapy directly into the blood
      vessel that supplies the affected eye. This new technique is called intra-arterial
      injection. This may give children with unilateral retinoblastoma a lower chance of needing
      surgery to remove the eye and reduce the amount of treatment side effects.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To study the feasibility of delivering melphalan directly into the ophthalmic artery in
      children with newly diagnosed unilateral group D retinoblastoma, who would otherwise be
      considered for enucleation.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the ocular salvage rate after treatment with intra-arterial melphalan in
      children with newly diagnosed unilateral retinoblastoma with group D disease.

      II. To evaluate the toxicities and adverse events associated with delivering multiple doses
      of intra-arterial chemotherapy.

      III. To evaluate vision outcomes in children treated with intra-arterial chemotherapy.

      IV. To monitor the rate of the development of metastatic disease while on protocol therapy.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the effects of intra-arterial therapy on the histopathology of eyes
      enucleated for progression.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive melphalan intra-arterially (IA) on day 1. Treatment repeats every 28 days
      for up to 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year,
      every 4 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 1 year, and then periodically for 2 years.
