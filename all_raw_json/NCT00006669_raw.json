Drugs used\n      in chemotherapy use different ways to kill cancer cells. Combining monoclonal antibody\n      therapy with chemotherapy may kill more cancer cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of rituximab followed by combination\n      chemotherapy in treating patients who have refractory or recurrent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma."

Determine the response rate in patients with refractory or recurrent CD20+\n      intermediate grade B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with rituximab followed by\n      etoposide, vincristine, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and prednisone (EPOCH). II. Determine\n      the toxicity of the regimen in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive rituximab IV over 4-10 hours on day 1\n      followed by etoposide, vincristine, and doxorubicin IV continuously on days 4-7,\n      cyclophosphamide IV over 5-30 minutes on day 8 and oral prednisone on days 4-8. Patients\n      also receive sargramostim (GM-CSF) subcutaneously beginning on day 9 until blood counts\n      recover. Treatment repeats every 21 days for a maximum of 8 courses in the absence of\n      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 30 patients will be accrued for this study."
