We conducted a prospective, long-term,\n      follow-up study to assess the incidence of symptomatic CTPH in consecutive patients with an\n      acute episode of pulmonary embolism but without prior venous thromboembolism. Patients with\n      unexplained persistent dyspnea during follow-up underwent transthoracic echocardiography\n      and, if supportive findings were present, ventilation-perfusion lung scanning and pulmonary\n      angiography. CTPH was considered to be present if systolic and mean pulmonary-artery\n      pressures exceeded 40 mm Hg and 25 mm Hg, respectively; pulmonary-capillary wedge pressure\n      was normal; and there was angiographic evidence of disease."
