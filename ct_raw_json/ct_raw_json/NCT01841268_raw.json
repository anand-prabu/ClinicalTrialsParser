This is an observational study with no intervention. Procedures: At\n      enrollment, 2 weeks and 4 weeks of age, skin lipids will be collected using three methods.\n      First two small pieces of blotting paper (2 cm x 2 cm) will be placed on the infant's skin,\n      one on the left side of the abdomen just above the umbilicus and one on the left inner\n      thigh. The blotting paper will be left in place for 15 seconds and then removed. Second, two\n      adhesive discs will be placed on the skin, one just below the umbilicus and one on the right\n      inner thigh. The discs will be left in place for 30 seconds and then removed. Third, two\n      areas of skin, one on the right side of the abdomen just above the umbilicus and the other\n      on the inner right thigh, will be gently swabbed with sterile cotton swabs (one for each\n      location). The intent is to remove a thin layer of oil/lipid from the skin upon removal of\n      the paper or the adhesive disc or with swabbing without disrupting the skin surface (similar\n      to taking a fingerprint). Blood specimens will be obtained three times, each time 1 ml :\n      once at enrollment, at 2 weeks and the last one at 4 weeks of age, to generate a plasma\n      lipoprotein profile and size distribution (HDL, LDL, VLDL, total cholesterol). For infants\n      that are fed expressed human milk, we will also obtain a sample of mother's milk for\n      analysis of lipid profile (about 2 ml)."
