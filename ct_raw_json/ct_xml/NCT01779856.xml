  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to estimate the proportion of hemodialysis patients
      experiencing clinically significant cardiac arrhythmias over a 6-month period using
      continuous cardiac monitoring with an implanted Medtronic Reveal XT device.

    <description>Events defined as clinically significant for the objective include: episodes of ventricular tachycardia (VT) greater than or equal to 130 beats per minute (BPM), episodes of bradycardia indicated by a recorded heart rate less than or equal to 40 BPM, instances of asystole lasting at least three seconds, or any symptomatic event, indicated by patient use of the Reveal XT Patient Assistant, where review of the stored ECG shows an arrhythmia considered clinically significant in the judgement of the study site cardiologist.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  21 years of age or older and is willing to be implanted with the Reveal XT

          -  Currently on hemodialysis at least three times per week OR has an estimated
             glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of &lt; 15 mL/min/1.73m^2 and is expected to begin
             hemodialysis within 2 months.

          -  Subject is willing and able to comply with the protocol

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Currently enrolled in an interventional study that may interfere with the Monitoring
             in Dialysis protocol

          -  Not suitable for Reveal XT implantation

          -  Has an existing hemodialysis catheter that may interfere with the Reveal XT
             implantation site

          -  Has a recent infection

          -  Is currently on hemodialysis with a hemoglobin &lt; 10 g/dL

          -  Has end-stage liver failure or has had thoracic surgery within the past 6 months

          -  Has an existing pacemaker, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) or cardiac
             resynchronization device

          -  Is scheduled for renal transplantation or will likely be transplanted within 6 months

          -  Is currently on home hemodialysis
