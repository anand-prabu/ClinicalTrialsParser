    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine if real time transmission of vital signs, ECG and
      chat communication between the prehospital ambulances and the emergency department has  an
      effect on patient mortality, ICU admission, hospitalization time, time to doctor, time to
      treatment and time to diagnostics
