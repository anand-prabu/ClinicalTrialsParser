  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background and aims: Ultrasound-guided (USG) nerve blocks of the sciatic nerve (popliteal
      level = PL) and the saphenous nerve (mid-femoral level = MFL) provides analgesia following
      leg surgery. Traditionally two separate injections are performed. The aim was to describe a
      novel, faster USG block combination requiring only one skin penetration to block the sciatic
      and saphenous nerves; i.e. the SPEDI block = Single PEnetration Dual Injection.

      Methods: A randomized, controlled and double-blinded trial. Following ethics committee
      approval 60 patients will be randomized to the administration of an USG SPEDI block compared
      to two separate USG blocks of the saphenous (MFL) and sciatic (PL) nerves. Blocks will be
      performed after induction of general anaesthesia. Outcome measures will be performance time
      (primary outcome measure), Post-Anaesthesia Care Unit pain scores (VAS scores 0-10), block
      difficulty level (easy, middle, difficult), opioid consumption (in the PACU),
      serum-ropivacaine pharmacokinetics (blood sample 0-180 minutes). Both block combinations
      will be evaluated by MR imaging (MRI).

      Hypothesis: The USG SPEDI block combination is expected to be performed significantly faster
      without moving the leg, and achieve successful perioperative pain management. The SPEDI
      block may find important use in the emergency setting.

    <measure>Performance time (seconds and minutes). Time measurement from the time the ultrasound transducer is placed on the skin and until the needle is taken out of the body.</measure>
    <time_frame>The measurement (seconds and minutes) will take place in the operating room. This will normally be within a time frame of 1 minute to 10 minutes.</time_frame>

    <description>The time measurement is done with a normal clock - measuring seconds and minutes.</description>

    <measure>Pain score (VAS score 0-10).</measure>
    <time_frame>When the patient are evaluated in the recovery unit upon arrival and when the patient is discharged from the recovery unit. This means from time 0 hours (arrival in the PACU) and normally until 2 hours after arrival in the PACU.</time_frame>

    <description>Sensory dermatome testing is done with cold ethanol on skin test. All dermatomes on the leg and foot are tested, and there is a comparison of the outcome between the operated leg and the not-operated leg.</description>
