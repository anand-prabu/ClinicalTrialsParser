            "textblock": "INTRODUCTION\n\n      Shoulder surgery is associated with severe postoperative pain and continuous interscalene\n      brachial plexus blocks can control this pain. Compared to single-shot injections, continuous\n      interscalene blocks can increase patient satisfaction, decrease narcotic requirements, which\n      then decreases postoperative nausea and vomiting , improve quality of sleep and decrease\n      hospital  length of stay .\n\n      The concept of continuous peripheral nerve blocks at home (CPNBH) with disposable pumps\n      began in 1998 in Sweden. The authors chose 0.125% bupivacaine for interscalene catheters and\n      their choice was not based on any evidence in the literature, but rather \"because this\n      concentration was already available at the institution for epidural infusions\" (personal\n      communication, Dr. Narinder Rawal, January 2013). Two years later, as ropivacaine became\n      more widely available, others chose to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 0.2% ropivacaine\n      for continuous interscalene infusions. Again, the choice of this specific concentration was\n      not evidence-based, but rather \"because the company made it in this concentration\" (personal\n      communication, Dr. Stephen Klein, January 2013). To date, published reviews show that most\n      studies use either of those formulations, yet there have been no studies comparing the\n      effects of these two drugs and concentrations, particularly on pain relief and on major side\n      effects of CPNBH.\n\n      One of those major side effects is ipsilateral phrenic nerve paresis. This is because\n      blockade of the brachial plexus at the interscalene groove with a single large-volume\n      injection causes diaphragmatic hemiparesis in 100% of patients9,10. This incidence is\n      decreased to 20% with a continuous infusion of a dilute solution11, where 9% of patients\n      have a subjective feeling of shortness of breath12. An ideal infusate in CPNBH would control\n      postoperative pain and have minimal effects on the phrenic nerve.\n\n      Ropivacaine has been shown to have blockade properties that differ from bupivacaine;\n      specifically, ropivacaine seems to preferentially block sensory nerve fibers, while weakly\n      blocking motor fibers13. It is not known whether this translates into a more attenuated\n      block of the phrenic nerve with ropivacaine. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to\n      evaluate the effects of continuous interscalene peripheral nerve blocks with 0.125%\n      bupivacaine versus 0.2% ropivacaine, comparing their effect on pain relief and respiratory\n      function. The primary hypothesis is that respiratory function is more affected by\n      bupivacaine than ropivacaine, with equal effects on pain relief.\n\n      METHODS\n\n      Patients who were scheduled for moderately to severely painful unilateral shoulder surgery\n      who agreed to continuous interscalene catheter placement were enrolled in the study and gave\n      written consent.\n\n      All patients underwent baseline studies, which included ultrasonic evaluation of\n      diaphragmatic excursion and bedside spirometry. All were placed in a 45-degree upright\n      position on a hospital stretcher. Assessment of the range of motion of both hemidiaphragms\n      was performed with a curvilinear low frequency ultrasound probe  The probe was placed\n      subcostaly in the mid-axillary line, angled 45 degrees cephalad on both sides, using the\n      liver on the right and the spleen on the left as acoustic windows. If there was difficulty\n      in obtaining a satisfactory image (frequently the case on the left side), the probe was\n      moved laterally toward the anterior axillary line until the diaphragm was visualized. Range\n      of motion of the diaphragm with normal respiration was assessed visually to exclude any\n      pre-existing diaphragmatic motion abnormalities, followed by sigh and sniff tests. During\n      the 'sniff test', movement of the diaphragm was evaluated from the resting expiratory\n      position during quick inspirations of air taken through the nose. During the 'sigh test',\n      the range of diaphragmatic motion from the resting expiratory position to deep inspiration\n      was measured. The normal caudad movement of the diaphragm was recorded with the distance\n      traveled in centimeters. Each measurement was performed 3 times and the best value was\n      recorded. A mark was placed on the patients' skin where measurements were taken, to\n      ascertain that the diaphragm was assessed from the same site during the follow-up visit.\n\n      Bedside spirometry was performed for each patient, again in a 45-degree upright position in\n      a hospital stretcher. After instructing the patient, forced expiratory volume at 1 second\n      (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC) and peak expiratory flow (PEF) were measured three\n      times, and the best measurement was recorded.\n\n      Following this, with standard noninvasive monitoring and oxygen via nasal cannula, all\n      patients had interscalene catheter placement with midazolam sedation (up to 5 mg). All\n      catheters were placed using and nerve. After draping the area and sheathing the ultrasound\n      probe (SiteRite; Bard Access Systems, Salt Lake City, UT), a local anesthetic skin wheal was\n      placed and a 17-gauge Tuohy insulated needle was inserted in-plane with a posterior\n      approach, through the middle scalene muscle. The prevertebral fascial plane was punctured\n      and the needle tip was placed in the area of connective tissue between the C5 and C6 nerve\n      roots. A 19-gauge stimulating catheter was then inserted through the needle and attached to\n      the nerve stimulator, set at a current of 0.48 mA, 100 microsecond pulse duration and 2 Hz\n      frequency. The nerve stimulator settings were kept constant throughout the procedure. With\n      ultrasound visualization and muscle twitches of the upper arm (biceps, triceps or deltoid),\n      the catheter was threaded 5-6 cm beyond the needle tip. If stimulation was lost during\n      threading, the catheter was gently withdrawn, the needle was moved slightly and the catheter\n      was threaded again with ultrasound visualization and visible muscle twitching. If this was\n      not possible after five minutes (from the first catheter threading), the patient was removed\n      from the study. Once the catheter was threaded successfully, the needle and catheter stylet\n      were removed and the catheter was withdrawn until the skin marking was 2-3 cm beyond the\n      needle depth. The nerve stimulator was reattached to the catheter to verify the presence of\n      a muscle twitch at 0.48mA, and a 5 ml volume of 1.5% lidocaine with epinephrine 1:200,000\n      was injected under direct ultrasound vision, confirming local anesthetic spread.\n\n      Prior to transport into the operating room and after negative aspiration, all catheters were\n      injected with 30 ml plain mepivacaine 1.5%, followed by an assessment of the quality of the\n      sensory and motor block. A general anesthetic was administered with propofol induction and\n      maintenance with vecuronium and sevoflurane. No opioids or additional benzodiazepines were\n      given. Three hours after the initial injection, whether patients were in the operating room\n      or in the Post Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU), an additional 10 ml plain mepivacaine 1.5% was\n      given through the catheter. Upon arrival to PACU, pain control was assessed (on a numerical\n      scale from 0 to 10), catheter and dressing integrity were verified and patients were\n      randomized by the pharmacists, using a computer-generated randomization table, to receive a\n      disposable pump (On-Q CB004, I Flow Corporation, Lake Forrest, CA) containing 400 ml of 0.2%\n      ropivacaine or 0.125% bupivacaine and set at a rate of 6 ml/hr. Except for the pharmacist,\n      all other personnel were blinded to the content of the pumps.\n\n      The following day (20-28 hours after discharge), patients returned to the hospital and were\n      asked about their highest pain level (on a numerical scale from 0 to 10) since surgery and\n      the number of pain pills taken since discharge, difficulty breathing, the amount of numbness\n      in the hand, and any problems with the catheter or the pump. The catheter sites were\n      examined and when necessary, the dressing was reinforced. After this, patients underwent\n      pulmonary testing, again on a stretcher in a 45-degree upright position. Repeat\n      ultrasonographic evaluation of diaphragmatic excursion (sniff and sigh tests) and bedside\n      spirometry were performed. For the ultrasonographic evaluation, the previously marked sites\n      were used for 3 measurements, recording the best effort. If on the sigh and/or sniff test a\n      caudad movement of the hemidiaphragm was seen, the distance was measured, recorded and\n      assigned a positive value (+). If paradoxical cephalad movement of the diaphragm was\n      observed, the distance was given a negative value (-). Following completion of the\n      ultrasonographic evaluation, spirometry was performed. Again FEV1, FVC and PEF were measured\n      and the best of 3 attempts was recorded. Patients were sent home with CPNBH for an\n      additional two days. Per routine, an anesthesiologist called them every day to assess their\n      pain level, shortness of breath, numbness, and integrity of the catheter site.\n\n      Statistical Analysis Determining the study size was allowing for a 15% difference in forced\n      expiratory volume at 1 second (FEV1) between the two. A non-inferiority power analysis was\n      chosen to obtain an alpha error probability of 0.05 and a 1 minus beta error probability of\n      0.8. A sample size of 30 patients (15 per group) was chosen to give the study sufficient\n      power. A T-test (unmatched pairs) was used to compare continuous data between the two\n      groups. If data had a non-normal distribution, a non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA was\n      used to examine differences between means. Categorical data was expressed as mean + standard\n      error. Statistical significance was set at a p-value \u2264 0.05, two-tailed.\n\n      RESULTS\n\n      Of the 38 enrolled patients, one was removed because of prolonged attempts at catheter\n      placement and one was removed because of suboptimal pain control from the initial bolus, as\n      assessed immediately prior to induction. Six patients were excluded after catheter placement\n      and after randomization, for the following reasons: Hoarseness and ptosis (1); Inadvertent\n      intraoperative opioids (1); Did not return to the hospital on the first postoperative day\n      for reassessment (4). The 30 remaining patients were included in the\n\n      .Pulmonary function values decreased in both groups: the primary variable, FEV1 decreased\n      22.4% with bupivacaine, 29.4% with ropivacaine (p 0.25). FVC was decreased 23.1% with\n      bupivacaine, 18.4% with ropivacaine (p 0.51); and PEF was decreased 23.9% with bupivacaine,\n      30.4% with ropivacaine (p 0.28). On the blocked side, patients in the ropivacaine group had\n      an average 75.5% decrease in diaphragmatic excursion on the sigh test, compared to 81.4% in\n      the bupivacaine group (p= 0.66). Sniff test diaphragmatic excursion decreased by 62.8% in\n      the ropivacaine group and 78.5% in the bupivacaine group (p =0.42). There was a compensatory\n      increase in diaphragmatic excursion on the nonsurgical side, with a sigh test increase by\n      15% in the ropivacaine group and 12.3% in the bupivacaine group (p =0.77), and a sniff test\n      increase by 7.3% in the ropivacaine group and 69.5% in the bupivacaine group (p <0.01). More\n      patients in the ropivacaine group had a paradoxical (cephalad during inspiration)\n      diaphragmatic excursion. The only statistically significant difference was the percent\n      change in the excursion of the contralateral hemidiaphragm with the sniff test. This finding\n      was felt to be operator error, because of the difficulty measuring minimal changes during\n      the dynamic movement of ultrasonography. Pain scores and oral opioid requirements were\n      similar in both groups. There were no patient complaints of shortness of breath.\n\n      All CPNBH infusions were discontinued uneventfully at home by the patients on the second or\n      third postoperative day. Three months after the study, all patients were contacted and all\n      denied any residual tingling, hypo/hyperesthesia or any new sensorimotor deficit.\n\n      DISCUSSION\n\n      This study showed no difference in pain control or respiratory function between interscalene\n      CPNBH with 0.125% bupivacaine and 0.2% ropivacaine. These are the most commonly used\n      formulations for CPNBH. To date, there had been no evidence that they were equipotent in\n      their use in peripheral nerve block infusions.\n\n      To avoid the confounding factor of residual numbness from the surgical day, mepivacaine 1.5%\n      was chosen as the initial bolus, because of its short duration of action. The continuous\n      infusion of local anesthetic was set at a fixed rate of 6 ml/hr since this had been the\n      customary rate used by the investigators for over 3,000 CPNBH procedures at this\n      institution. The rate was fixed to avoid any patient manipulations of the drip rate during\n      the study period. This was done despite evidence that patient-controlled infusion rates\n      improve pain control17. However, after the postoperative pulmonary testing was performed,\n      patients were allowed to adjust the rate. Of note is that most patients (28 out of 30) chose\n      to leave the rate at 6 ml/hr.\n\n      Opiates were intentionally avoided in the immediate perioperative period, as they can cause\n      a dose-dependent ventilatory depression. Borgeat et al21 compared ventilatory and phrenic\n      nerve function in patients receiving either a continuous interscalene catheter or an\n      intravenous morphine pump for postoperative analgesia after shoulder arthroscopy. There was\n      no statistical difference between the 2 groups for all pulmonary parameters studied, which\n      were equally diminished in both groups. In the present study, patients used equal amounts of\n      oral oxycodone at home, so the contribution of this opioid to their postoperative pulmonary\n      dysfunction would have been the same in both groups.\n\n      There have been very few studies comparing 0.125% bupivacaine and 0.2% ropivacaine, all with\n      a small number of subjects. One study hypothesized that 0.2% ropivacaine would cause less\n      motor blockade after epidural injections for chronic low back pain. With 18 patients per\n      group, this study found no difference.  There are only two studies comparing the effects of\n      interscalene blocks with ropivacaine and bupivacaine on diaphragmatic and pulmonary\n      function. Both were with single-shot injections of concentrations that were higher (0.33%\n      and 0.5% respectively) than those used in continuous infusions. With a total of 34 patients\n      divided in two groups, Altintas et al. showed that diaphragmatic paresis and decreased\n      pulmonary function were more significant in the bupivacaine group. With 15 patients per\n      group, Hortense et al.  found that pulmonary function was worse in the ropivacaine group at\n      30 minutes but not at 4 or 6 hours.\n\n      CONCLUSION:\n\n      In conclusion, this study showed no difference in respiratory dysfunction or opioid\n      requirements on the first postoperative day between interscalene continuous peripheral nerve\n      blocks at home with 0.125% bupivacaine and 0.2% ropivacaine. Even though ropivacaine has\n      been found to be motor-sparing when compared to bupivacaine, this study showed that it does\n      not cause less hemidiaphragmatic paresis.  There is a need for a more ideal infusate, one\n      that controls pain but causes a less significant decrease in pulmonary function. Perhaps a\n      study is in order, where a lower concentration of ropivacaine is used along with an adjuvant\n      or a combination of adjuvants, hoping to find that ideal infusate."
