All subjects have the same dietary\n      protocol. At baseline, week 12  the  levels of AMH,Follicular Stimulating Hormone (FSH),\n      Lutienizing Hormone(LH),Prolactin (PRL), androgens, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG),\n      glucose, and insulin were measured and Free Androgen Index (FAI) and Insulin Resistance (IR)\n      indices is calculated.  The laboratory tests are determined by radioimmunoassay in the\n      Laboratory of Endocrinology of Royan institute. AMH is measured in duplicate using an\n      ultrasensitive ELISA kit (AMH-ELIZA Kit; Beckman Coulter, Marseilles, France) according to\n      manufacturer instructions. All measurements are performed using a single kit and at the same\n      time in the Laboratory of clinical Immunology of Royan institute.\n\n      Data collection will be performed by using questionnaire to be filled as per the available\n      records and laboratory results. Data analysis will be done through descriptive and\n      perceptive statistical methods."
