  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This three-site randomized controlled trial compares the effectiveness and
      cost-effectiveness of a group-administered behavioral treatment program to no treatment.
      Women with stress, urgency, or mixed urinary incontinence will be recruited and screened
      centrally, evaluated clinically at each of three study sites, and random assigned to one of
      two treatment arms:  1. Group behavioral treatment or 2. No treatment.  Group treatment
      modalities have the potential to reach a larger population of older women with urinary
      incontinence, not only in the traditional medical settings, but also in community settings.
      The investigators hypothesize that group behavioral treatment will be more effective than no
      treatment.  The investigators hypothesize that the group treatment will be cost-effective
      compared to no treatment.
