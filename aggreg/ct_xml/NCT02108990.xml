  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent research has identified heightened sensitivity to social rejection as a core feature
      of BPD. Rejection sensitivity can trigger the aggressive, impulsive, and self-injurious
      behaviors characteristic of the disorder.

      Therefore targeting therapy towards the reduction of rejection sensitivity may improve the
      low rates of effectiveness of current pharmacological and behavioral therapies. Therefore,
      this proposal tests a theoretically-based pharmacological approach that specifically targets
      the heightened sensitivity to rejection experienced by BPD patients.

      In prior research with normal controls, it was shown that chronic treatment with the
      physical pain-killer acetaminophen (e.g. Tylenol) reduced both neural responses to social
      rejection (using fMRI) as well as self-reported feelings of rejection in a daily diary
      study.

      It is the aim of this research project to determine if the over-the-counter analgesic,
      acetaminophen (active ingredient in Tylenol), can reduce symptoms and behaviors in BPD
      patients. The goal of this proposal is to use an open-label design to determine if
      acetaminophen improves symptoms in BPD patients.

    <description>The importance of these measures will be to assess how rejected, aggressive, and social participants have been in order to determine if acetaminophen affects these proclivities. Participants will report on: hurt feelings, rejection, affect, aggressive feelings, impulsive behaviors, alcohol use, sleep, social interactions, perceived stress, self-esteem</description>
