Patients are stratified according to diagnosis (breast\n      vs prostate cancer), initial \"pain worst\" score (4-6 vs 7 or higher), and participating\n      institution. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive standard pain management.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive educational intervention (booklets, audiotapes, and\n           videotapes) and behavioral skills training (including a schedule of practice relaxation\n           sessions) in addition to standard pain management. Patients receive a follow-up phone\n           call within 48-72 hours of intervention to review pain status.\n\n      Patients on both arms undergo pain and psychological assessments on days 1 and 15.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 96 patients (48 per arm) will be accrued for this study."
