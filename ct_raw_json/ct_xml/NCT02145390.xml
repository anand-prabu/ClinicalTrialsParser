    <description>The following will be performed by the participating urologist:
cystoscopic evaluation
bimanual examination under anesthesia,
as thorough as possible a transurethral resection (TUR) of the bladder tumor,
and a biopsy of the prostatic urethra including both mucosa and stroma using a resection loop.</description>

    <description>All patients will receive the neoadjuvant course of chemotherapy.  This regimen will begin within 8 weeks following the TURBT and cystoscopic evaluation by the urologic surgeon.  Ideally, treatment should start within 8 weeks and on a Monday.
Neoadjuvant chemotherapy: Cisplatin (70 mg/m2) will be administered as a sixty-minute infusion (+/- 10 minutes) on day 1 (outpatient regimen) or day 2 (inpatient regimen) of each 21-day cycle, for four cycles. Cisplatin therapy will begin within 8 weeks following the TURBT &amp; Cystocopy
Concurrent Chemotherapy w/Radiation: Cisplatin (35 mg/m2) will be administered as a 60 minute infusion (+/- 10 minutes) starting on day 1 of radiation, and on days 8,15,22,29.</description>

    <description>All patients will receive the neoadjuvant course of chemotherapy.  This regimen will begin within 8 weeks following the TURBT and cystoscopic evaluation by the urologic surgeon.  Ideally, treatment should start within 8 weeks and on a Monday.
Neoadjuvant chemotherapy: Gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2) will be administered intravenously over 30-60 minutes (preferably 30 minutes) on Days 1 and 8 of each 21-day cycle, for four cycles.</description>

    <intervention_type>Radiation</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy</intervention_name>
    <description>All patients will receive 25 daily fractions (5 weeks) of radiation therapy for  5 days a week (Monday to Friday) except on weekends or holidays, when remaining fractions will be added to the end of treatment.  Radiation therapy will be started within 6 weeks following the neoadjuvant chemotherapy.  The overall schema is for IMRT based radiation to the entire bladder, prostate (in men) and the pelvic lymph nodes.  The pelvic lymph nodes will receive 45 Gy in 25 fractions at 1.8 Gy per fraction.  The whole bladder and prostate will receive 50 Gy in 25 fractions at 2.0 Gy per fraction.  The tumor boost area will be defined as the area of bladder involved by tumor based on TURBT, CT imaging, and lipiodol injection at time of cystoscopy, and will receive 60-65 Gy in 25 fractions at 2.4-2.6 Gy per day.  Final boost dose will be determined at the discretion of the treating physician based on normal tissue exposure and volume.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Pathologically proven diagnosis of primary carcinoma of the bladder(transitional cell
             cancer). Must be operable patients with muscularis propria invasion and AJCC clinical
             stages T2-4a, N0 or N+, M0.  Patients with prostatic urethra involvement with
             transitional cell cancer (TCC) are eligible if it is completely resected and the
             patient has no evidence of stromal invasion of the prostate.

          -  Patients must be able to tolerate systemic chemotherapy combined with pelvic
             radiation therapy and radical cystectomy

          -  Zubrod Performance Status of ≤1.

          -  Age ≥18.

          -  CBC/differential obtained no more than 8 weeks prior to enrollment on study, with
             adequate bone marrow function defined as follows:

               -  WBC ≥ 4000/ml

               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1,800 cells/mm

               -  Platelets ≥100,000 cells/mm

               -  Hemoglobin ≥ 10.0 mg/dl (Note: the use of transfusion or other intervention to
                  achieve this level is acceptable)

          -  Serum bilirubin of 2.0mg or less;

          -  Serum creatinine of 1.5mg or less;  creatinine clearance of 60ml/min or greater no
             more than 8 weeks prior to enrollment (Note: calculated creatinine clearance is
             permissible, using Cockcroft-Gault formula.  If the creatinine clearance is greater
             than 60ml/min, then a serum creatinine of up to 1.8mg is allowable at the discretion
             of the principal investigator.)

          -  Patients must be willing and able to provide study-specific informed consent prior to
             study entry

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Tumor related untreated active hydronephrosis

          -  Evidence of distant metastases.

          -  A prior or concurrent malignancy of any other site or histology unless the patient
             has been disease free for greater than or equal to five years except for non-melanoma
             skin cancer and/or stage T1a prostate cancer or carcinoma in situ of the uterine
             cervix

          -  Patients that are not candidates for radical cystectomy (T4b disease are considered
             unresectable)

          -  Pregnancy or women of childbearing potential [not post-menopausal or permanently
             sterilized (e.g. tubal occlusion, hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy)] and men who
             are sexually active and not willing/able to use medically acceptable forms of
             contraception; this exclusion is necessary because the treatment involved in this
             study may be significantly teratogenic

          -  Severe active co-morbidity:

               -  Unstable angina and/or congestive heart failure requiring hospitalization within
                  the last 6 months

               -  Acute bacterial or fungal infection requiring intravenous antibiotics at the
                  time of registration

               -  Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease exacerbation or other respiratory illness
                  requiring hospitalization or precluding study therapy at the time of enrollment

               -  History of hepatic insufficiency resulting in clinical jaundice and/or
                  coagulation defects (Note: laboratory tests for liver function and coagulation
                  parameters are not required for enrollment into this protocol)

               -  Known diagnosis of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) based upon current
                  CDC definition (Note: HIV testing is not required for enrollment into this
                  protocol).  The need to exclude patients with AIDS from this protocol is
                  necessary because the treatments involved in this protocol may be significantly
                  immunosuppressive.

               -  As determined by the investigator or principal investigator
