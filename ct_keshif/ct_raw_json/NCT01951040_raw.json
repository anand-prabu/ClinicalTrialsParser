Data were collected by\n      review of clinical records and interviews with the mothers (particularly to record\n      breast-feeding type and duration). Patients were referred to the hospital for a\n      semi-structured interview in which data were collected for type and duration of feeding.\n      Clinical records were used as information sources for obstetric variables.
