This\n      improvement was significantly higher in the patient training intervention group (P=0.008).\n      After adjustment for education level, the score of quality of life in patient training\n      intervention group had a higher improvement, but the difference between the two groups was\n      not significant (P = 0.1).\n\n      Conclusions:\n\n      This study showed the important role of training and the patients' educational level on\n      better treatments. The appropriate training in the patient could create a change in the\n      treatment process and has a better effect on quality of life."
