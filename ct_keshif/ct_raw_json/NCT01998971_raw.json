Approximately 48 patients (12 per backbone treatment) will be\n      enrolled in this study. The study will consist of screening, treatment, and follow-up\n      phases. Treatment will extend to either the planned treatment duration for a maximum of 1\n      year, or until disease progression. Follow-up will continue until the study ends\n      (approximately 15 months after the last patient receives the first dose of daratumumab).\n      Serial pharmacokinetic (study of what a drug does to the body) blood samples will be\n      collected.
