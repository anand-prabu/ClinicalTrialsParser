This will be determined at\n             the discretion of the PI.\n\n          -  Patients may not be taking any concomitant drugs that are contraindicated based on\n             the drug-interaction table.\n\n          -  Concurrent treatment with warfarin (coumadin) is allowed, but close monitoring of the\n             PT/INR is recommended.\n\n          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active\n             severe infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris,\n             clinically significant or symptomatic cardiac arrhythmia, other malignancies\n             requiring therapy or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit\n             compliance with study requirements.\n\n          -  Pregnant women or women who are breastfeeding are excluded from this study because\n             capecitabine is a pregnancy category D drug and is known to pass to the infant in\n             breastmilk.\n\n          -  Patients with known deficiency of the dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) enzyme.\n\n          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic\n             composition to capecitabine."
