  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the technical feasibility of using fine needle aspiration (FNA) of
      liver tissue to obtain MK-7009 liver pharmacokinetic (PK) data, working towards identifying
      a minimally invasive, reproducible platform to measure liver PK. The study will be done in 2
      parts. In Part 1, participants will be randomized to one of five FNA/core needle biopsy
      (CNB) time-point collection sequences. In Part 2, participants will be randomized to one of
      two possible doses of MK-7009 and will be assigned to one of five FNA/CNB time-point
      collection sequences; participants in Part 2 will also receive background therapy with
      pegylated interferon alpha-2b (Peg-IFN alpha-2b) and ribavirin (RBV).
