  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine biomarkers of exposure to Harmful and Potentially
      Harmful Constituents (HPHCs) in Cigarette Smoke and cardiovascular-related biomarkers in
      smokers and non smokers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Since Japanese mortality associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD)  is lower than that in
      the USA although Japan is one of the top four tobacco consuming countries, this study aims
      to determine biomarkers of both level of exposure and CVD-related biological effects in
      Japanese smokers compared to non-smokers.

      Biomarkers of Exposure (BoExp) include 2-naphthylamine (2-NA), 4-aminobiphenyl (4-ABP),
      4-(methylnitrosaminoi)-1-(3-pyridil)-1-butanone (NNK), carbon monoxide (CO), nicotine,
      pyrene and 0-toluidine (o-TOL). CVD-related biomarkers include white blood cell (WBC) count,
      high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and homocysteine in plasma; complemented with
      urinary 8-epi-prostaglandin F2α (8-epi-PGF2α), plasma malondialdehyde (MDA), urinary
      11-DTXB2, plasma fibrinogen, high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, triglycerides, sICAM-1,
      sVCAM-1 and von Willebrand Factor.
