Adult patients attending the medical\n      outpatients department or one of the chronic disease clubs will be approached and invited to\n      consider taking part in the study. Interested individuals will have the opportunity to ask\n      trained research staff questions about the study and their participation. Information about\n      the study will be available in English, isi-Xhosa, and Afrikaans.  Individuals interested in\n      participating will be asked a series of screening questions to assess their eligibility for\n      inclusion in the study and will have their blood pressure measured as per the study\n      protocol. Eligible participants who decline to participate will be asked for permission to\n      access their clinical record to extract basic details (age, gender, medication, recent blood\n      pressure). Copies of Participant Information Leaflets and posters in English can be found in\n      Appendix B. Translated copies are available upon request.\n\n      Informed consent procedures:\n\n      Eligible individuals who agree to participate will be asked to complete a consent form. A\n      copy of the completed form will be given to participants as part of their trial information\n      pack. Copies of consent to participate forms in English can be found in Appendix B.\n      Translated copies are available upon request.\n\n      Study assessments:\n\n        -  Baseline We will ask standard questions about health and medical history, and measure\n           blood pressure, weight and height. Any necessary blood tests will be done as per clinic\n           protocols. A trained research assistant will review participant's clinical records.\n\n        -  6 months Participant contact details (particularly participant's primary\n           mobile-telephone number) will be checked and if necessary up-dated and blood pressure\n           will be measured.\n\n        -  12 months A trained research assistant will administer a final set of questionnaires,\n           measure participant's blood pressure according to the trial protocol, and repeat basic\n           clinical measurements including anthropometry. Clinical records will be reviewed to\n           capture intervening clinical events and changes in medical management. Participants who\n           do not attend the 12 month follow-up clinic appointment will be followed up, and if\n           cause for non-attendance is hospital admission or death, then hospital records or death\n           certificate data will be obtained.\n\n      End of the study:\n\n      The end of study is the date of the final 12-month follow-up clinic visit of the last\n      participant. After this time study participants will be asked if they would like to receive\n      SMS-text messages as per the provincial department of health protocol if it exists.\n\n      Privacy and confidentiality:\n\n      Participant's contact details (cellular phone number, address, etc), these will only be\n      available to name senior research staff involved in the study. Details will not be shared\n      with the clinic staff or with any other service provider unless permission to do so is\n      expressly given by the participant once the study has concluded.  Data will be captured\n      using a combination of electronic data capture and paper case-report forms (CRFs). CRFs will\n      be entered onto the trial database on the day of collection. The trial database will include\n      checks for logic and consistency to be resolved by the local investigators. Data will be\n      stored on a computer with individually assigned passwords and individually assigned levels\n      of access. The trial database will include a full audit trail of any changes made.\n      Randomisation codes will be separately stored and accessible only by the trial statistician.\n      No personal data will be included in the trial database and participants will be\n      identifiable only by a unique study number. All essential documents will be retained in a\n      trial master file. Trial documentation will be archived and stored for seven years.\n\n      Potential for harm:\n\n      The measurements we propose to take including blood pressure, height, weight, and waist\n      circumference are very safe and are regularly used in routine clinical care. We will be\n      taking participant's blood pressure a few more times than is usually done in the clinic\n      which could cause some discomfort. The potential for harm to patients as a result of the\n      trial intervention is judged as low. The University maintains Public Liability and\n      Professional Liability insurance which will operate in this respect.\n\n      Potential benefits to individual participants:\n\n      All study participants will receive SMS-text messages which they may find beneficial.\n      Participants will have their blood pressure accurately measured on at least three occasions.\n\n      Rewards:\n\n      This study is not providing any rewards or compensation to participants. Study participants\n      are not provided cell-phones or network airtime credit, however receiving SMS-texts or phone\n      calls or sending please call me messages to the study are free.\n\n      Study funding:\n\n      This study is funded as part of a programme grant from the Wellcome Trust and EPSRC (Grant\n      Number DFR RDV0).\n\n      Pilot and preparatory work prior to the starting the StAR* study:\n\n      The protocol also includes brief summaries of preparatory and pilot work that will be\n      carried out to optimise the trial design and procedures prior to beginning the StAR* study\n      (these \"StAR* study development phase projects\" can be found in section 11 of the study\n      protocol)."
