At baseline, the prescreened subjects will present to the clinical site for\n      baseline examinations (oral tissue assessment, extrinsic tooth stain assessment). Subjects\n      will brush with water, then floss, have an oral exam and tooth stain assessment. Subjects\n      will be randomly assigned to one of three groups using a randomized code provided by the\n      sponsor:\n\n        -  Negative Control - Brushing twice daily with an ADA - Accepted fluoride-containing\n           dentifrice (Colgate\u00ae Cavity Protection).\n\n        -  Brushing twice daily with an ADA - Accepted fluoride-containing dentifrice (Colgate\u00ae\n           Cavity Protection) followed by rinsing twice daily with 10 ml for 60 seconds with an\n           investigative peroxide and fluoride containing mouth rinse\n\n        -  Brushing twice daily with an ADA - Accepted fluoride-containing dentifrice (Colgate\u00ae\n           Cavity Protection) followed by rinsing twice daily with 15 ml for 60 seconds with\n           Crest\u00ae 3D White Multi-Care Whitening Rinse, Glamorous White, Fresh Mint\n\n      Immediately after randomization, subjects will begin use of their assigned test treatment.\n      The site staff will supervise the first rinse treatment, and rinse treatments occurring on\n      examination days. The negative control group will not have supervised brushing at the clinic\n      to avoid the possibility of changing their usual brushing habits. All home use will be\n      unsupervised and following label instructions. Subjects will be required to maintain a diary\n      card to document twice-daily product use by recording their assigned oral care routine. For\n      Clinic Visit 3, 4, and 5, subjects will be instructed to not use the treatment rinse in the\n      morning prior to their clinic visit, because that treatment rinse will be supervised during\n      their clinic visit. Subjects may brush as normal in the morning prior to these clinic\n      visits.\n\n      During the study, subjects will follow their usual interdental cleaning (e.g. flossing) and\n      dietary habits. Subjects will not be allowed to use any other unassigned oral care products\n      (mouth rinse, dentifrice, or other tooth whitening products), or have their teeth\n      professionally polished, bleached, or whitened by a dentist or hygienist.\n\n      Examinations for oral hard/soft tissue assessment and extrinsic tooth stain after the\n      subject brushes with water and floss will be repeated at Clinic Visits 3, 4, and 5, which\n      are on Days 4, 8 and 15 post baseline (i.e., after 3, 7, and 14 days of product use).\n      Compliance will be evaluated at Visits 3, 4, and 5 by weighing residual volumes of returned\n      mouth rinses and by reviewing the subject diary. Subjects will receive the ADA-Accepted\n      fluoride containing dentifrice and a soft bristled toothbrush at their baseline visit.\n\n      During the course of the study, subjects may use an interdental cleaning device to remove\n      impacted food between the teeth and may continue using an interdental cleaning device\n      regularly if it is part of their usual oral care regimen."
