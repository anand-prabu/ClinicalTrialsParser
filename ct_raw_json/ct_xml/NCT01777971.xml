  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ascites is the accumulation of fluid within the peritoneal cavity of the abdomen.  It is a
      frequent complication of cirrhosis that is associated with significant morbidity and poor
      quality of life.  Large-volume ascites has been associated with impaired pulmonary function.
       In a previous study, the presence and severity of ascites were determined to be significant
      determinants of fatigue.

      In this study, we will determine whether large-volume ascites contributes to fatigue by
      assessing the response to drainage of ascites by means of a procedure called large-volume
      paracentesis.  We hypothesize that treatment of ascites with a single large-volume
      paracentesis leads to decreased fatigue and improved quality of life and that this
      improvement is associated with improved sleep pattern.

      20 patients with cirrhosis with refractory ascites requiring regular drainage of ascites
      fluid by large-volume paracenteses will be recruited for the study.  All patients will
      undergo a complete clinical and physical examination for liver function, including blood
      tests.  Hepatic encephalopathy, a change in mental status associated with liver dysfunction,
      will be assessed by obtaining historical data and by means of simple bedside
      neuropsychological examinations.

      Study visits will take place on two consecutive days, with each visit lasting approximately
      2-3 hours.  Immediately prior to a large-volume paracentesis, patients will complete
      standardized questionnaires for fatigue severity, quality of life, quality of sleep, and a
      physical assessment of fatigue by means of a 6-minute walk test.  Repeat evaluations will be
      performed 1 day after the procedure.  Statistical analysis will then be performed to
      determine the effect of the paracentesis on the various clinical assessments.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects with cirrhosis (based on clinical, laboratory, radiologic evaluation, and liver
        biopsy, when available) with diuretic-resistant refractory ascites, based on International
        Ascites Club criteria.[2,31] Specific criteria used for inclusion will be subjects with
        ascites that cannot be stabilized despite intensive diuretic therapy (e.g., 400 mg of
        spironolactone with 160 mg of furosemide per day) and dietary sodium restriction (90 mmol
        of sodium per day) with reappearance of grade 2 or 3 ascites within 4 weeks of
        mobilization (defined as decrease of ascites at least to grade 1). All subjects must
        provide separate written consent to undergo a large-volume paracentesis.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects will not be eligible for the study if they: (1) have been hospitalized in the
        previous 1 month for gastrointestinal bleeding, infection, or renal failure; (2) are
        unable to independently ambulate or have had unstable angina or myocardial infarction
        within the previous 1 month, as these are contraindications to participating in the
        6-minute walk test; (3) are unable to participate in neuropsychological tests or
        questionnaires; (4) are receiving interferon therapy; (5) have a history of alcohol abuse
        within the previous 6 months; (6) have a diagnosis of a primary neurologic disorder or
        uncontrolled psychiatric disorder; or (7) are receiving psychotropic medications such as
        benzodiazepines and anti-epileptic drugs.
