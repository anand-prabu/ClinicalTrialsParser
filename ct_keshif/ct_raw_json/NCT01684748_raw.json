            "textblock": "Overweight and obesity, which afflicts ~65% of the U.S. population and more than 1 billion\n      people worldwide, increases the risk of developing hypertension. Activation of the renin\n      angiotensin system (RAS) is an important mechanism by which obesity leads to hypertension.\n      In addition to its vasoconstricting and sodium retaining actions, angiotensin II also has\n      potent pro-inflammatory actions including macrophage infiltration and expression of\n      proinflammatory cytokines in target tissues. Adipose tissue and skeletal muscle appear to be\n      a key sites for the generation of proinflammatory cytokines. Although angiotensin II\n      receptor blockade reduces inflammation in many tissues, the effects on adipose tissue and\n      skeletal muscle in humans are not clear. Importantly, the chronic low grade inflammatory\n      state that accompanies obesity complicates hypertension by contributing to insulin\n      resistance and accelerating cardiovascular disease. Therefore, the general aim of the\n      present proposal will be to determine the influence of angiotensin II receptor blockade on\n      adipose tissue and skeletal muscle inflammation and its relation to improvements in insulin\n      sensitivity, if observed, in obese hypertensive humans.  To address these aims, 44 obese\n      (BMI>30 kg/m2) hypertensive (BP>140 systolic and/or 90 diastolic) individuals (age=50-65\n      years) will be randomized to receive 8 weeks of either the angiotensin II receptor\n      antagonist, olmesartan medoxidil, or no treatment in a crossover manner. Subcutaneous\n      adipose tissue and skeletal muscle biopsies will be obtained and insulin sensitivity\n      (intravenous glucose tolerance tests) will be assessed at baseline and following 8 weeks of\n      each intervention. A two week washout period will separate the interventions."
