      papillary thyroid cancer, benign thyroid nodules, and in normal females without thyroid
      disease.

        Females with no prior history of thyroid disease and not on thyroid medications.

        Active recruitment will be for normal controls only. They will be age and weight/height
        matched to females with prior diagnosis of thyroid cancer or thyroid nodules who are
        already part of another study.
