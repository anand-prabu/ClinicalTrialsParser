      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety and biodistribution of [I-124]-CPD-1028
      Injection in cancer patients with solid tumours.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to 18 adult participants will be enrolled in this Phase 1a study to evaluate the safety
      and biodistribution of [I-124]-CPD-1028 Injection in patients with Insulin-like Growth
      Factor-1R (IGF-1R) upregulated solid tumours. All eligible subjects who have given written
      informed consent and qualify based on the study's inclusion/exclusion criteria will be
      enrolled in the study. Each enrolled subject will take part in six visits consisting of a
      screening visit, an Investigational Product administration visit, 3 assessment visits
      involving 2-3 Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography (PET/CT) scans, and a
      follow-up safety telephone call. At Visit 2, subjects will start a course of treatment to
      protect the thyroid from radioactivity and may receive a pre-targeting dose of an additional
      investigational agent, CPD-1061.

    <description>The safety of [I-124]-CPD-1028 Injection will be assessed for up to 30 days post injection by measuring the occurrence of adverse events and changes from baseline in physical examination, clinical laboratory parameters, electrocardiogram recordings, and vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature, respiratory rate and oxygen saturation).</description>

    <description>Biodistribution data will be assessed by quantitative analysis of imaging scans taken 2-3 days and 5-7 days post injection by (1) measuring tumour uptake and background tissue levels in selected regions of interest on whole body images and (2) determining if suitable quantitative imaging metrics can be identified.</description>

    <description>A single intravenous dose of [I-124]-CPD-1028 Injection will be given at Visit 2 (within 21 days of screening Visit 1), and may be followed by whole body PET/CT imaging approximately 3 hours post-injection.  PET/CT imaging will occur at Visit 3 (2-3 days after Visit 2) and Visit 4 (5-7 days after Visit 2). PET/CT imaging may also occur at Visit 5 (16-18 days after Visit 2).  Visit 6 (28 +/- 2 days after Visit 2) is a follow-up telephone call for a post-treatment safety assessment. At Visits 2-5, whole body biodistribution and tumour uptake will be assessed.  At all visits, safety will be assessed.</description>

The decision to use CPD-1061 and the dose amount is based on an adaptive design and is dependent on interim reviews of imaging data.</description>
