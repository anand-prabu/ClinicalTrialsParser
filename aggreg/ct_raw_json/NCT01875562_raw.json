            "textblock": "Cervical radiculopathy is a distinct consideration in the evaluation of any patients who\n      have neck pain and may be defined simply as an abnormality of a nerve root which originates\n      in the cervical spine. The initial approach to the management of cervical spondylopathic\n      radiculopathy is nearly the same as that of nonspecific neck or back pain that can be found\n      in most patients. Conservative treatments include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs\n      (NSAIDs), narcotics, muscle relaxants, physical therapy and transcutaneous electrical nerve\n      stimulation (TENS). The main objectives of conservative treatments are to relieve pain,\n      improve function and improve health-related quality of life. However, these treatments for\n      cervical radiculopathy are limited by their modest effectiveness. Surgical treatment for\n      cervical disc disease is indicated when symptoms are refractory to conservative treatments\n      and neurological symptoms are progressive. In terms of pharmacotherapy, there is generally\n      no randomized, placebo-controlled trial available comparing standard nonsurgical treatment.\n      Therefore, care plans should be designed principally based on accumulated experience, the\n      services available locally, and the respective preferences of patients. Treatment plans are\n      developed to alleviate pain, improve function, and prevent recurrences.\n\n      As a complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), herbal medicines have the potential to\n      avoid the adverse effects of medications and surgery.According to the basic theory of\n      traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), the obstruction of Qi flow and blood circulation in the\n      neck area caused by pathogenic factors, such as \"Feng\"(wind), \"Han\"(cold), \"Shi\"(dampness),\n      invading the neck induces cervical degenerative disc diseases which are the cause of\n      cervical radiculopathy. According to the four traditional methods of diagnosis -observation,\n      listening, interrogation, and pulse-taking, TCM doctors can analyze the specific pathogenic\n      factors which cause neck pain. Accordingly they can then prescribe herbal formulae based on\n      the effect and the main indications according to the principles of Chinese medicine. Natural\n      substances, including herbal medicines, have been used to promote healing and alleviate neck\n      pain in western countries. Previous studies have demonstrated that some active substances in\n      herbal medicine can promote Qi flow and blood circulation to alleviate pain."
