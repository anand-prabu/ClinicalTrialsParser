Antimicrobial concentrations determined in ELF and\n      alveolar macrophages represent an ideal estimate of concentrations at the site of infection\n      and can be accessed via bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL).  However sampling of antimicrobial\n      concentrations via BAL is not routine in clinical practice due to its complex methodology\n      and poor patient tolerability. This study will evaluate intrapulmonary and plasma\n      pharmacokinetics of GSK2140944 after single IV dose in adult healthy volunteers. This is a\n      Phase I, open-label study to evaluate plasma and pulmonary pharmacokinetics following\n      intravenous administration of GSK2140944 in healthy adult participants. Part A will evaluate\n      the single dose PK profiles.  Part B is optional and will only be conducted if necessary.\n      Each part will consist of a maximum of 6 cohorts.  In Part A, only 4 of the 6 cohorts will\n      be dosed initially; cohorts 5 and 6 are optional and will only be dosed if additional\n      time-points are necessary to adequately model the pulmonary pharmacokinetic profile."
