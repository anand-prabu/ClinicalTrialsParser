The study is designed to afford a\n      first time in humans (FTiH) safety and immunogenicity assessment of three TDENV-PIV vaccine\n      candidates, each formulated with a different adjuvant: either aluminum hydroxide, AS01E or\n      AS03B (adjuvants used in GSK Biologicals' hepatitis B candidate vaccine, malaria candidate\n      vaccine and pandemic flu vaccine, respectively). Each vaccine candidate will contain 1 \u00b5g of\n      purified virus antigen per each of the four DENV types. Additionally, the study will\n      evaluate an alum adjuvanted TDENV-PIV vaccine candidate containing 4 \u00b5g of purified virus\n      antigen per each of the four DENV types. The control group will receive a saline placebo.\n      All experimental vaccinations will be administered according to a 2-dose schedule, 28 days\n      apart. There is a parallel FTiH study that is conducted in the United States in a\n      dengue-naive population using the same investigational vaccines."
