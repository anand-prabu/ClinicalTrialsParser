Participants will receive treatment focusing on the\n      semantic features of common objects (e.g., that birds can fly). The study will examine how\n      naming and other language abilities change in response to treatment, as well as how the\n      brain changes, as measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and other techniques.\n\n      Spelling/Writing Impairments (Dysgraphia):\n\n      At Johns Hopkins University, the lab of Dr. Brenda Rapp will investigate the neurobiology of\n      language recovery in individuals with dysgraphia (spelling/writing impairments) resulting\n      from a stroke. In this study, treatment will focus on improving spelling ability. The study\n      will examine how spelling and other language abilities change in response to treatment, as\n      well as how the brain changes, as measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and other\n      techniques.\n\n      Deficits in Sentence Comprehension & Production:\n\n      Dr. Cynthia Thompson's lab at Northwestern University will investigate language recovery in\n      individuals with deficits in sentence production and comprehension. Treatment focuses on\n      production and comprehension of complex sentences. At baseline (week 0) and after the\n      treatment period (at week 12), participants take part in language, eye-tracking, and MRI\n      testing, in order to learn how the processing of language, as well as brain function,\n      changes as a result of treatment."
