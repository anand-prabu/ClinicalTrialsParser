Although there is still some\n      concern about the use of mesh in clean-contaminated or contaminated surgery, based in our\n      experimental studies, we plan to use a mesh in the primary closure of abdominal incision to\n      prevent incisional hernias.\n\n      The investigators propose a clinical trial to assess a model to prevent the incisional\n      hernia after laparotomy to treat colorectal carcinoma is scheduled. A simple randomization\n      is scheduled: in the intervention group a prefascial large-pore low-weight 5 cm wide\n      polypropylene mesh is fixed covering the midline closure; in the control group a\n      conventional closure with a running suture of long-term absorbable material with a\n      suture/wound length ratio 4:1. The sample size was calculated with an estimated incidence of\n      ventral hernia of 25% in the control group and 10% in the intervention group, 0,05 alfa and\n      a 0,15 beta error. The main goal is the appearance of a ventral hernia after 24 months of\n      follow-up. Other outcomes are wound complications and morbidity. Exclusion criteria are\n      adult patients with a previous ventral hernia, estimated survival of less than 6 months or\n      hemodynamic instability during surgery.\n\n      The diagnosis of ventral hernia will be assessed by clinical exploration on 3,6,12,18 and 24\n      months and abdominal CT controls at 6,12, and 24 months. The study will be statistically\n      evaluated with SPSS 18.0."
