HASTIER will evaluate\n      therapeutic response with imaging outcome measures for recanalization and reperfusion. Key\n      scientific objectives include the evaluation of hypothermia on benchmark recanalization and\n      reperfusion rates in 120 cases of middle cerebral artery (MCA) stroke. Recanalization will\n      be measured with Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) score change from baseline-36\n      hour CT/MRI angiography. Reperfusion will be measured with Tmax > 6s lesion volume change\n      from baseline-36 hour CT/MRI perfusion imaging. Secondary outcomes will be measured with\n      serial changes in permeability abnormalities derived from CT/MRI perfusion imaging,\n      hemorrhagic transformation, and infarct growth from baseline-36 hours. Correlation of these\n      imaging parameters with clinical outcomes will provide insight to accelerate research during\n      these translational steps in hypothermia treatment for acute ischemic stroke."
