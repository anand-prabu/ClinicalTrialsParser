    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, dose-ranging study of the vitamin D analog DP001 in patients with
      end-stage renal disease (ESRD).  The primary goals of this 4-week Phase 2A study are to
      identify an appropriate starting dose of DP001 to be used in subsequent studies in this
      population and for evaluation of pharmacokinetics of DP001 in ESRD patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vitamin D hormone or analogs, when bound to the vitamin D receptor, suppress PTH synthesis
      by binding to a negative regulatory element in the promoter of the PTH gene, and have been
      used successfully in the clinic to reduce elevated PTH levels in dialysis patients and other
      CKD patients.  DP001 is a highly potent vitamin D compound.

      In two clinical trials testing DP001 in postmenopausal women, oral DP001 reduced PTH levels
      in a dose-dependent manner, with a dose of 220 ng lowering PTH by at least 30% in a majority
      of patients following one or six months of daily dosing.

      This study is an open-label, dose-ranging study of DP001 in ESRD patients with secondary
      hyperparathyroidism.  Cohorts of up to 6 patients will be enrolled and administered oral
      DP001 at 110 ng three times per week for four weeks.  Laboratory data from each cohort will
      be assessed and used to determine a dose for the next cohort.  Up to 5 dose-ranging cohorts
      will be studied, with the goal of identifying an appropriate dose for a randomized,
      placebo-controlled study of oral DP001 for 12 weeks.  The data will also be used to select
      an appropriate dose for an additional cohort of 12 open-label patients in the current study
      in which the pharmacokinetics of DP001 following a single dose and after repeated doses will
      be studied.
