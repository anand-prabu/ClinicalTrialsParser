            "textblock": "In patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD), exercise induced limb ischemia\n      (claudication) which limits walking capacity. Symptoms are due to pain at hip and/or\n      buttock. Couple of origins may induce this pain such as vascular, cardiac, respiratory,\n      musculoskeletal, neurologic, hematologic etc. The rate of associated respiratory pathology\n      to patients with lower extremity artery disease (LEAD) is around 15%. The intolerance to\n      walk could be link to an exercise hypoxia which appears with lower limb pain with or without\n      associated dyspnea. The exercise hypoxemia becomes a diagnostic for an intermittent vascular\n      claudication. Tests which are performed to diagnose an intermittent claudication are the\n      Ankle to Brachial Systolic pressure Index (ABI), the echo-Doppler of lower limb arteries and\n      the walking test on a treadmill associated to a measurement of the distal and chest\n      transcutaneous oxygen pressure (tcpO2).\n\n      Thus, the purpose of the present research is to determine the prevalence of  obstructive\n      sleep apnoea in patient with PAD."
