This\n      occurs as a result of destructive changes in an area of the brain responsible for making\n      dopamine, the basal ganglia.  Rhythmical muscular tremors, rigidity of movement, shuffling\n      footsteps, droopy posture, and a mask-like expression on the face characterize Parkinson's\n      disease.\n\n      Researchers believe that dextromethorphan may be able to safely modify psychomotor function\n      of patients with Parkinson's Disease."
