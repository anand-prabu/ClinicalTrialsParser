Within 1-2 weeks of surgery,\n      patients are vaccinated with irradiated autologous tumor cells and sargramostim (GM-CSF),\n      then receive GM-CSF alone intradermally at vaccination sites daily for 4 days. Patients are\n      revaccinated 2 weeks later.\n\n      Patients undergo peripheral blood mononuclear cell collection two weeks after the second\n      vaccination. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells are stimulated with anti-CD3 monoclonal\n      antibody (OKT3) and interleukin-2, producing activated T lymphocytes. The activated T\n      lymphocytes are infused IV over 1-6 hours followed by 5 doses of interleukin-2 IV every\n      other day over 10 days. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or\n      unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Patients may receive one additional course of immunotherapy as above.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, then every 6 months thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients will be accrued for this study."
