The assessment items are not individually adjusted to each patient and\n      his/her subjective symptoms, the collected data is rarely used in clinical practice, and\n      decision-support for the physician is not possible.\n\n      Although the body of evidence is accumulating regarding the benefits of computerised symptom\n      assessment in cancer patients, there is still insufficient knowledge of the impact of\n      computerised assessment tools on the management of cancer pain and other cancer related\n      symptoms.\n\n      The COMBAT study aims to investigate if a computer based assessment of cancer related\n      symptoms, and a computerized decision support can improve treatment of pain and other\n      symptoms in cancer patients.\n\n      This is an open, comparative study with a sequential design with two consecutive study\n      periods, the non-intervention period and the intervention period.\n\n      The computer-based clinical decision support system will utilize the following data to\n      generate one or several treatment options:\n\n        1. Data from self assessment of cancer related symptoms\n\n        2. Data from relevant variables reported by the physician\n\n        3. Revisited guidelines on treatment of cancer pain"
