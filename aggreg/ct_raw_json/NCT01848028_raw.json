            "textblock": "Background: Treatment of moderate to severe Psoriasis (Pso) and Psoriasis-Arthritis (PsA) is\n      largely confined to systemic therapy in Germany. Systemic therapy includes conventional\n      systemic therapy (e.g. fumaric acids, methotrexate, ciclosporin A) and biological treatment\n      (e.g. adalimumab, etanercept). While short- and middle-term efficacy of most systemic\n      treatments has been shown in clinical studies (and is incorporated in international\n      guidelines), knowledge about long-term outcomes, optimal treatment and effectiveness under\n      real-world conditions is still missing. PsoBest, the German registry on the treatment of\n      moderate to severe Pso and PsA started in 2008 and documents the long-term course of\n      patients being administered any biologic or conventional systemic antipsoriatic drug\n      authorized in Germany for the first time.\n\n      Objectives: Observation and analysis of the following outcomes of treatment with systemic\n      antipsoriatics:\n\n        1. Effectiveness in clinical practice (\"real world\")\n\n        2. Benefits and needs on the patients' side\n\n        3. Effectiveness in a long-term course over years\n\n        4. Optimal maintenance dosages\n\n        5. Safety and side-effects profile under routine conditions\n\n        6. Use in case of and effect on co-morbidity\n\n        7. Reliable predictors of response\n\n        8. Benefit and effectiveness of possible combination therapies or alternating use of\n           biologics and systemic therapies\n\n      Methods: The registry evaluates the long-term course of 3,500 patients with Pso and PsA\n      treated with systemic antipsoriatics.The registry started for seven treatment arms: Fumaric\n      acid, methotrexate, ciclosporin A, efalizumab, etanercept, infliximab and adalimumab. While\n      efalizumab was withdrawn from the market, ustekinumab was included after authorization.\n      Patients are included at first initiation of a given treatment and will remain in the\n      registry for 5 years, regardless of subsequent therapy. Nationwide, dermatologic practices\n      and hospital ambulances with expertise in systemic and biologic treatment consecutively\n      enrol patients. Follow-ups will be every 3 to 6 months, comprising patient and treatment\n      characteristics, clinical parameters, patient-defined benefit, quality of life and adverse\n      events. Standardized questionnaires will be addressed to the patient and to the\n      dermatologist 12 times at the dermatologic centres. In interim intervals, patients are\n      directly contacted another 9 times by mail. PsoBest is member of the ENCePP network of\n      psoriasis-registries (www.psonet.eu)."
