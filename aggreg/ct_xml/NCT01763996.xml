      The purpose of this study is to assess the affect of febuxostat on coronary artery flow in
      patients with coronary artery disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called febuxostat. Febuxostat is being tested to
      treat people who have angina. This study will look at the heart and blood flow of people who
      take febuxostat.

      The study will enroll approximately 30 patients. Participants will be randomly assigned (by
      chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the two treatment groups—which will remain
      undisclosed to the patient and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent
      medical need):

        -  Sequence 1: 6 weeks febuxostat followed by 6 weeks of placebo.

        -  Sequence 2:  6 week placebo followed by 6 weeks of febuxostat

      All participants will be asked to take one capsule at the same time each day throughout the
      study. All participants will be asked to record any time they have angina symptoms during
      the study.

      This single-center trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall time to
      participate in this study is 16 weeks. Participants will make 7 visits to the clinic.
