  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety and effectiveness of belatacept (NulojixÂ®)
      in preventing antibody formation in patients with chronic failing kidney transplants. This
      study is a randomized study of first-time kidney transplant patients who have worsening
      kidney function and biopsy proven grade 2 or 3 interstitial fibrosis/tubular atrophy
      (IF/TA).  Patients must be eligible to get a second transplant. They must have completed or
      be actively undergoing evaluation for re-listing for a second transplant.  Patients will be
      randomized to either convert to belatacept or continue on calcineurin inhibitor-based
      therapy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Signed Written Informed Consent

          -  The subject is a first-time kidney transplant recipient (non-Human Leukocyte Antigen
             (HLA) identical donor) with impaired renal allograft function (estimated glomerular
             filtration rate (GFR)&lt;35)

          -  a decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of &gt; 20% over the 12 months prior to
             enrollment

          -  &gt; 1 year post-transplant

          -  The subject must be a re-transplant candidate

          -  The subject must have biopsy proven grade II or III interstitial fibrosis/tubular
             atrophy (IF/TA)

          -  On a maintenance immunosuppressive regimen that includes calcineurin inhibitor (CNI)
             (tacrolimus or cyclosporine), mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) at a dose of at least 1
             gm/day +/- prednisone

          -  Men and women, ages 18 to 65.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with any prior solid organ (e.g., heart, liver, pancreas) or cell (e.g.,
             islet, bone marrow) transplant other than their first renal allograft

          -  Subjects who have a recent history (within 1 year) of biopsy proven acute rejection

          -  Subjects who have a living donor identified for re-transplant within 3 months

          -  Subjects with a history of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease

          -  Subjects at risk for tuberculosis (TB)

             skin cancer(s) Physical and Laboratory Test Findings

          -  Subjects with a positive polyoma BK virus serum polymerase chain reaction (PCR) at
             the time of enrollment

          -  Subjects with a mammogram that is suspicious for malignancy and in whom the
             possibility of malignancy cannot be reasonably excluded following additional
             clinical, laboratory, or other diagnostic evaluations.

          -  Subjects who have difficult intravenous access or other reasons that would likely
             preclude the ability to receive long-term intravenous infusions

          -  Hypersensitivity to any medications that will be used in the protocol

          -  Subjects who have used any investigational drug within the 30 days prior to
             anticipated enrollment

          -  Subjects currently receiving belatacept or mammalian target of rapamycin (mTor)
             inhibitors as part of their maintenance immunosuppressive regimen

          -  Prisoners, or subjects who are involuntarily incarcerated.

          -  Subjects who are compulsorily detained for treatment of either a psychiatric or
             physical (eg, infectious disease) illness.
