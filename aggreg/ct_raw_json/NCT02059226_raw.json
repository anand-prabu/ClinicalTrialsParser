            "textblock": "Anxiety is a common mental health problem for Canadian youth. Anxiety that is diagnosed as a\n      disorder and serious enough to require treatment affects up to 10% of all youth by the age\n      of 16. Anxiety disorders can have serious negative effects on a young person's personal\n      relationships, school performance, and family life. These disorders may not be discovered by\n      youth, parents and health care providers. Even if anxiety disorders are discovered, youth\n      may not get the right therapy. Anxious youth can become sick if their anxiety is not treated\n      properly.\n\n      Many youth go to a hospital emergency department when they are sick, for help with their\n      anxiety. This is called a crisis. In Alberta, the investigators studied these crisis visits\n      and found that most anxious youth get counseling and referral for follow-up care. However,\n      the wait time can be 29 to 40 days before youth see a doctor for follow-up care. During this\n      wait, many youth need to return to the emergency department for more crisis care. The\n      investigators see a need to create a treatment so that anxious youth do not have to wait for\n      care. This treatment would help them after an emergency department visit.\n\n      The investigators team will carry out research to test Breathe, their new Internet-based\n      treatment for youth with anxiety problems. Youth can use this treatment from home after\n      their emergency department visit. Breathe will include information materials and\n      personalized homework assignments to help anxious youth learn ways to manage anxiety.\n\n      This study is a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) with two groups, an\n      Internet-delivered cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) experimental group (Breathe) and a\n      resource webpage (control group; considered treatment as usual for youth waiting for\n      services). The investigators will evaluate several methodological processes and outcomes\n      through the following objectives:\n\n        1. To evaluate the change in youths' anxiety (primary outcome) from pre- to post-\n           intervention.\n\n        2. To estimate recruitment and retention rates for a full-scale RCT.\n\n        3. To estimate a sample size for a full-scale RCT.\n\n        4. To define the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) for the primary outcome\n           measure.\n\n        5. To measure intervention acceptability.\n\n        6. To determine the use of co-interventions during the trial.\n\n        7. To conduct a preliminary economic analysis."
