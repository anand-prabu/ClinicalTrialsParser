Carnitine is often given to\n      adults and children with kidney failure who receive chronic dialysis three times a week,\n      however there is no published information on how carnitine affects children receiving\n      continuous dialysis (CRRT). We hypothesize that children receiving CRRT quickly become\n      deficient in carnitine because it is continuously removed during dialysis. The aim of this\n      study to determine if giving daily carnitine to children on CRRT will help improve their\n      cardiac function, as assessed by echocardiography, in comparison to a control group."
