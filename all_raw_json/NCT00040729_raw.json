Results are then\n      analyzed for a possible association between UGT1A1 genotypic variation and susceptibility to\n      flavopiridol.\n\n      Patients do not receive the results of the genetic testing, and the results do not influence\n      the type or duration of treatment.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study."
