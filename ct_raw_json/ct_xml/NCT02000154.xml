    <textblock>
      This is an extension study study to investigate long term safety of SyB L-1101 when
      administered intravenously every 4 weeks to the patients who have completed 8 cycles in the
      study 2011005 whose purpose is to investigate tolerability of SyB L-1101 when administered
      intravenously in patients with recurrent/relapsed or refractory myelodysplastic syndrome.
      Antitumor effects will also be investigated in this study.

The treatment period of 28 days (3 days of administration + 25 days of observation) constitutes 1 cycle. The dose at cycle 8 in the study 2011005 will be the dose (if needed, the dose can be reduced) at the first cycle in this study (cycle 9). From cycle 10 on, the dose of SyB L-1101 will be reduced, delayed, or discontinued according to adverse events and results of observation at the previous cycle.</description>
