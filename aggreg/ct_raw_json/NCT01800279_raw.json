In the second and third items, patients indicate the number of days in which they disrupt their daily activity due to pain, or otherwise the days they find improvement. The impact caused by the symptoms of fibromyalgia in the physical and mental health of the patients was measured by the Spanish version of the Impact of Fibromyalgia Questionnaire. The FIQ assesses the following dimensions: feeling good, physical function, missing work and work capacity, physical, psychological and social components and global wellness. Also, it includes six visual analog scales for assessing fatigue, pain, stiffness, morning tiredness, anxiety and depression.",

In the correction of this questionnaire, seven scores are obtained which inform us of the components of sleep quality:  subjective quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, the use of hypnotic medication, and daytime dysfunction. Each of these components receives a discrete score which can range from 0 to 3. A score of 0 indicates that there are no problems in this respect, and a score of 3 indicates serious problems at that level. The sum of the scores in each partial component generates a total score, which can range from 0 to 21.",

Its content emphasizes more the cognitive component of depression, and the symptoms of this area represent about 50% of the total score of the questionnaire, with symptoms of somatic / vegetative. In the second block, of the 21 items, 15 refer to eco-cognitive symptoms, and the remaining 6 to somatic-vegetative symptoms. Each item has four response alternatives listed from low to high severity, assessing the severity / intensity of the symptom. The range of the score is 0-63 points. The aim of this questionnaire is to quantify the symptoms, not provide a diagnosis. The breakpoints usually accepted to graduate the intensity/severity are the followings:\nNo Depression: 0-9 points.\nMild depression: 10-18 points\nModerate Depression: 19-29 points\nSevere depression: \u2265 30 points",
