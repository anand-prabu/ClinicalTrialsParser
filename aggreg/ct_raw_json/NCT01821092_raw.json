It seems that the\n      creation of a biologic width affects peri-implant bone loss to a significant extent and that\n      platform switching is effective when the mucosal thickness allows the establishment of an\n      horizontal biologic width.\n\n      A new implant with an hybrid surface (T3) has been recently launched by Biomet 3i.Aim of the\n      present study will be to evaluate the degree of 3D marginal bone remodelling around T3\n      Prevail implants.\n\n      MATERIALS & METHODS:\n\n      40 consecutive adult patients, requiring the insertion of dental implants in the aesthetic\n      area (from second premolar to second premolar) will be enrolled in the study. At the time of\n      surgery, a full thickness flap will be elevated, the implant bed will be prepared according\n      to the manufacturer's instruction and the implants will be then seated into the bone.\n      Implants can be placed both with a single-stage or two-stage procedure. Implants inserted\n      with a two-stage procedure will be re-opened after a submerged period of three months.\n\n      T0 corresponds to the time of implant insertion, T1 to the time of healing abutment's\n      connection (T0=T1 for single stage implants), and T2 corresponds to 1-year follow-up from\n      healing abutment's connection.\n\n      It is supposed that the creation of the biological width starts with the healing abutment's\n      connection.\n\n      CBCT scans  will be taken immediately after abutment connection (T1) and 1-year after  (T2).\n      The midsagittal cut of each implant will be identified, and measurements will be made at\n      predetermined levels.
