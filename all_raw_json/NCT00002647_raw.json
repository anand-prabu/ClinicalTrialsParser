Patients are stratified according to tumor\n      location (posterior fossa tumors vs all other brain tumors).\n\n      Patients receive benzoporphyrin monoacid ring A (BPD-MA) IV preoperatively. Approximately 3\n      hours after BPD-MA administration, patients undergo craniotomy with photoillumination of the\n      tumor. Patients with tumors greater than 2 cm in diameter also undergo gross tumor\n      resection.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of BPD-MA until the maximum tolerated dose\n      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose immediately preceding that at which 2 of\n      3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Three additional patients are\n      treated at the MTD.\n\n      Patients are followed at 4 and 6 weeks, every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 1\n      year, and then annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A minimum of 24 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years."
