The difference of electricity used in upper limb\n      or lower limb stimulation may lead to different effect.\n\n      Study design: Stratified randomized parallel control study, comparing Biceps, Quadriceps\n      electric muscle stimulation vs. non-stimulation group.\n\n      Participant: adult patients with severe sepsis and acute respiratory failure requiring\n      mechanical ventilation.\n\n      Intervention: daily stimulation of bilateral Biceps or Quadriceps by programmed electric\n      devices 32 minutes, 5 days/week\n\n      Outcome:\n\n        1. Primary outcome: Ventilator-dependent days\n\n        2. Secondary outcome: change of hand drip muscle\n           power/interleukin-1b/interleukin-6/interleukin-8/TNF-alpha"

Muscle weakness was found in 70-100% patients with severe sepsis and septic shock\n      because of critical-illness induced polyneuropathy and myopathy. Previous study revealed\n      electric muscle stimulation (EMS) could reduce such muscle weakness and mechanical\n      ventilator-dependent days.\n\n      Hypothesis: different electricity may be needed for minimal contraction of upper or lower\n      limb because of their muscle size. Induced muscle contraction may lead to myokine secretion\n      and beneficial metabolic and anti-inflammatory effect. Stimulation on Quadriceps may be\n      better than on Biceps.\n\n      Participant: adult(older than 20 years-old) patients with severe sepsis.septic shock and\n      acute respiratory failure post mechanical ventilation.\n\n      Design: Stratified ( gender and age >50 years-old) Randomized parallel 3 arms  study.\n\n      Intervention: Daily stimulation of Biceps of Quadriceps after third days in intensive care\n      unit. Programmed electric stimulation device ( HELEX 573 model, strength aggressive. mode,\n      45-55Hz 32 minutes per day, voltage 30-70mA)"
