After a large polyp is removed it is known that there is a\n      20% chance that a small recurrence of polyp occurs at the site of removal can occur within 5\n      months of the polyp being removed. This in theory will burn off tiny polyp tissue, which is\n      usually not visible to the naked eye. This additional treatment may possibly reduce the risk\n      of polyp recurrence."
