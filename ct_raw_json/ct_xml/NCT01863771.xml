  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate safety and effectiveness of golimumab in Japanese
      participants with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind (neither physician nor participant knows the treatment that the
      participant receives), placebo-controlled (study in which an inactive substance is given to
      one group of participants, while the study medication is given to another group),
      multicenter (study conducted at multiple sites), 2-arm (two groups), parallel-group (each
      group of participants will be treated at the same time), randomized-withdrawal (participants
      receiving study medication for a specified time will be later randomized to receive either
      study medication or placebo.) study, including an open-label (all people know the identity
      of the intervention) induction phase. Approximately 200 participants will participate in
      this study. This study will consist of an induction phase, a maintenance phase, and a
      follow-up phase. During the induction phase (lasting 6 weeks) participants will receive 200
      mg subcutaneous (SC) (under the skin) golimumab at Week 0 and 100 mg SC golimumab at Week 2.
      During the maintenance phase (up to Week 52) all participants who show a clinical response
      (measure of therapeutic effect of study medication) to golimumab during the induction phase
      will be randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to receive either SC administration of placebo
      (Group 1) or 100 mg golimumab (Group 2) every 4 weeks from Week 0 to Week 52. Participants
      who do not show clinical response to golimumab will also receive 100 mg SC administration of
      golimumab until Week 4 and if, by Week 8 of the maintenance phase, these participant's
      disease activity does not appear to be improving, participants will be discontinued from
      further study medication administration and will be followed up for safety evaluations 16
      weeks after the last administration of study medication. However, if disease activity of
      these participants improves at Week 8, they will continue to receive golimumab (100 mg every
      4 weeks) through Week 52 of the maintenance phase. The follow-up phase will be of 16 weeks
      duration. During this study, any participant who have a clinical response during the
      induction phase but lose clinical response at any time will be eligible for dose adjustment
      only once as follows: 1) participants receiving placebo (Group 1) will receive golimumab 100
      mg; 2) participants receiving golimumab 100 mg (Group 2) will continue to receive golimumab
      100 mg. Safety evaluations will include assessment of adverse events, laboratory
      measurements, antinuclear antibodies/anti-double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid antibodies,
      and vital signs. The maximum study duration for a participant will be 68 weeks.

    <time_frame>Up to week 54</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The Mayo score is the primary tool for assessing ulcerative colitis activity. The Mayo score consists of 4 subscores (stool frequency, rectal bleeding, findings of endoscopy, and physician's global assessment) which range from 0 to 3. The Mayo score is calculated as the sum of these 4 subscores and can range between 0 and 12. A score of 3 to 5 points indicates mildly active disease; a score of 6 to 10 indicates moderately active disease; and a score of 11 to 12 indicates severe disease.</description>

    <time_frame>Week 30 and 54</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The IBDQ is a 32-item questionnaire used to assess quality of life in participants with inflammatory bowel diseases. Each question has graded responses from 1 (worst situation) to 7 (best situation). Total score ranges from 32 (worst) to 224 (best). Higher scores indicate better quality of life.</description>

    <time_frame>Week 30 and 54</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The EQ-5D includes single item measures of: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each item is coded using 3-levels (1 = no problems; 2 = some problems; 3 = severe problems). The instrument includes a global rating of current health using a visual analog scale (VAS) ranging from 0 (worst imaginable) to 100 (best imaginable).</description>

    <description>Mucosal healing is defined as an endoscopy subscore of 0 or 1, where 0 indicates normal or inactive disease and 1 indicates mild disease (erythema, decreased vascular pattern, mild friability). Endoscopy subscore is one of the 4 subscores of the Mayo score.</description>

Participants who have a clinical response in the induction phase and are randomly allocated to golimumab in the maintenance phase will receive 100 mg SC every 4 weeks through Week 52. Participants who do not have a clinical response in the induction phase will receive 100 mg of golimumab SC at Week 4 and will continue with 100 mg of golimumab SC every 4 weeks through Week 52 only if a response is obtained by Week 8.</description>
