            "textblock": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is one of the most common inflammatory diseases in the general\n      population and many cardiovascular diseases (valvular, myocardial, pericardial, coronary\n      disease, stroke, heart failure etc.) have already been described in this disease. Large\n      epidemiological studies have also demonstrated a higher degree of severity of\n      atherosclerotic vascular disease in RA patients, to such a degree that several authors have\n      highlighted the fact that, in the final analysis, the prognosis of RA is rather determined\n      by the severity of atherosclerotic lesions.\n\n      By reducing RA-related systemic inflammation, it can therefore be hypothesized that 24 weeks\n      of anti-TNF therapy would improve arterial endothelial function and large artery stiffness.\n\n      The proposed study will assess the effects of adalimumab therapy on these parameters. A\n      group of 26 RA patients will be recruited from a rheumatologists association of the French\n      PACA region (CONCERTO association). This study will be non invasive and will comprise:\n\n        -  in vivo study of endothelial function by measuring the post-ischaemic dilatation by 2D\n           ultrasound;\n\n        -  study of large artery stiffness by pulse wave velocity determined by aplannation\n           tonometry;\n\n        -  study of central pulse pressure;\n\n        -  evaluation of atherosclerosis-related parameters such as intima-media thickness.\n\n      The results obtained should provide a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in\n      RA-related vascular disease and the effects of anti-TNF therapy.\n\n      In view of the high prevalence of RA, this study could potentially interest the medical\n      community as a whole and could be largely diffused."
