  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is hypothesized that a progressive simulated learning strategy will result in better
      global clinical performance (e.g., technical, communication) and transfer of endoscopic
      skill, as compared with a high-fidelity simulation strategy.

    <measure>Change in JAG/DOPS Expert Assessment scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-intervention, Post-intervention at one week</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The JAG/DOPS tool includes ratings of the following domains: (i) assessment, consent and communication; (ii) safety and sedation; (iii) endoscopic skills during insertion and withdrawal; and, (iv) diagnostic and therapeutic ability. The tool will be used to assess participants before and after the intervention at a time of one week. A change in these ratings before and after intervention is the primary outcome.</description>

    <time_frame>Pre-intervention, Post-intervention at one week</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Computer generated performance data will be collected from the VR simulator, including (1) completion of procedure, (2) depth of insertion, (3) absence of perforation, (4) time to cecum, (5) simulated pain scores, (6) volume of insufflated air, (7) overall length of insertion, (8) percentage of time without discomfort, and (9) percentage of mucosa seen. These will be assessed before and after the intervention at a time of one week.</description>

    <description>Global clinical performance will be evaluated using the IPPI global rating scale, which assesses 11 dimensions on seven-point Likert scales. The tool will be used to assess participants before and after the intervention at a time of one week.</description>

    <description>The progressive learning group will undertake 6 hours of interactive small-group didactic sessions, interlaced with up to 6 hours of self-directed instruction initially on the low-fidelity box simulator, with feedback provided one-on-one by an expert academic endoscopist. Participants in the progressive learning group can switch to the high-fidelity simulator at their discretion, but cannot return to the low-fidelity simulator. On the high fidelity VR simulator they can progress through six modules each in colonoscopy and endoscopic polypectomy in a self-directed fashion, with one-on-one feedback by an expert academic endoscopist. The endoscopy instructor will demonstrate techniques, answer questions and provide feedback. The entirety of this will be delivered over two days.</description>

    <description>The high-fidelity group will undertake 6 hours of interactive small-group didactic and hands-on sessions on the theory of colonoscopy, led by an expert academic gastroenterologist. The sessions will be interlaced with up to six hours of self-directed instruction on the high-fidelity VR simulator. Six task-specific modules of increasing difficulty in colonoscopy and colonoscopic polypectomy will be taught solely on the VR simulator with one-on-one feedback from an expert academic endoscopist. The endoscopy instructor will demonstrate techniques, answer questions and provide feedback as necessary. The entirety of this will be delivered over two days.</description>
