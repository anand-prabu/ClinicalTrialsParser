Endomicroscopy is a technique for obtaining histology-like images from\n      inside the human body in real-time. Total objections are 311 patients.\n\n      Specific research topics are as below.\n\n        1. Diagnosis and classification of colon polyps through pCLE\n\n        2. Evaluation of the depth of invasion of colorectal cancer or lateral growth type tumor\n           through the pCLE\n\n        3. Differential diagnosis of colorectal submucosal tumor through the pCLE\n\n        4. Differential diagnosis of ileocecal ulcers through the pCLE\n\n      The study will be conducted to measure sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, amphoteric\n      predict of pCLE diagnosis, and calculate the agreement of prediction compared to the\n      pathological findings of lesions  Check diagnostic agreement of technical phrases which are\n      derived, the matching degree between observers, and will develope a new classification\n      method based on this."
