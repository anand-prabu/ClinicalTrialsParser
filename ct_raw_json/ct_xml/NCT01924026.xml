  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phenylketonuria is a genetic disorder known to cause severe reduction in intelligence and
      deficits in cognitive function; it is associated with an elevated level of Phenylalanine
      (Phe) in blood.  Newborn screening and early treatment with restricted protein diet
      supplemented by a formula of amino-acids will preserve intelligence. In those with the
      severe form treated from birth, some deficits that affect higher functions of the brain are
      seen. Given this, there is disagreement about how milder forms of this disease should be
      managed and what level of Phe is safe to be left untreated.  We seek to assess whether
      higher levels, between 360 and 600µmol/L, are safe with respect to preservation of
      intelligence and higher cognitive functions.

      The following personal/medical information will be collected and reviewed:

        -  Evaluation of current and past medical history, including psychological treatment such
           as medication and counseling/therapy.

        -  Mutational analysis for each MHP subject

        -  Detailed history of educational, employment, relationship, and socioeconomic
           status/achievements as a measure of successful transition to adulthood

        -  Diet history, including past treatment with medical food or Sapropterin (Kuvan) for
           pre-conceptual and pregnancy Phe management

        -  All available untreated Phe levels, including newborn screening results (where
           possible) will be collated to calculate lifetime mean Phe level. Age at collections
           will be recorded separately for each MHP subjects to ensure inclusion of Phe levels
           beyond infancy

      The following clinical investigations will be administered:

        -  Measurement of Phe and Tyr after an overnight fast, via blood spot using tandem mass
           spectrometry analysis. Blood spot collection will be done at the same time of day for
           all subjects.

        -  Physical exam, height and weight measurements

        -  Food Frequency Questionnaire assessment to estimate typical daily intake of natural
           protein.

        -  Self-Report Questionnaires:

             -  Brief-A

             -  Beck Anxiety Inventory

             -  Beck Depression Inventory

             -  Quality of Life questionnaire

        -  Neuropsychological Tests assessed by a trained psychologist:

             -  Wechsler-IV IQ test (Canadian Version)

             -  CANTAB

                  -  Choice Reaction Time (CRT)

                  -  Rapid Visual Information Processing (RVP)

                  -  Spatial Span (SSP)

                  -  Spatial Working Memory (SWM)

                  -  Stockings of Cambridge (SOC)

      An informant BRIEF-A report will be completed for each subject. To ensure consistency in
      rating, the same informant will be used where possible for the MHP subject and their sibling
      control (i.e. parents). These questionnaires will be mailed to the informants and returned
      to the study site via FedEx.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or Female, ≥ 18 years

          -  Confirmed to have MHP with at least three Phe levels during lifetime of above
             360µmol/L and below 600µmol/L, including newborn screening levels (available since
             1968 by either bacterial inhibition, enzymatic or tandem mass spectrometry
             methodology) and via mutation analysis. Those with occasional levels above 600µmol/L
             will not be excluded provided the majority of available levels fall within the
             360-600µmol/L range.
