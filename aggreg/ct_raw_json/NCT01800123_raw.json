Clinical scores, vital\n      signs or lactatemia have failed to prove good predictive value.\n\n      The main acute self poisoning complication is decreased consciousness level with consequent\n      increased risk of hypoxemia and aspiration pneumonitis.\n\n      Several clinical studies have recently shown that EtCO2 monitoring can be valuable in\n      procedural sedation in the emergency department. It is able to predict hypoxemia before any\n      SaO2 decrease and any complications related to these procedures.\n\n      We therefore hypothesized that EtCO2 could help in acute self poisoning patients' monitoring\n      in the ED."
