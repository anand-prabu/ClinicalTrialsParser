Determine whether topical tretinoin reduces the number of viral genome copies\n      of human papilloma virus (HPV) per cell and inhibits HPV E6/E7 gene expression in patients\n      with cervical dysplasia. II. Determine the dose of tretinoin for use in a definitive trial\n      that produces the best overall modulation of these biomarkers.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to\n      cervical intraepithelial neoplasia classification (II vs III). Patients are randomized to 1\n      of 4 arms. Arm I: Patients receive low-dose tretinoin topically via cervical cap and\n      polyurethane ether foam sponge changed daily for 4 days. Arm II: Patients receive\n      intermediate-dose tretinoin as in arm I. Arm III: Patients receive high-dose tretinoin as in\n      arm I. Arm IV: Patients receive placebo topically as in arm I therapy. Patients are followed\n      for 6 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 180 patients (45 per arm) will be accrued for this study."
