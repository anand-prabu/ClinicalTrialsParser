  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Occurrence of inhibitors to coagulation factor VIII is diagnosed in ~30% patients with
      haemophilia A. Presence of inhibitor with a titre &gt;5 BU/ml requires the use of by-passing
      agents: recombinant activated Factor VIIa concentrate (rFVIIa) and/or activated prothrombin
      complex concentrate (APCC). Similarly, haemorrhagic complications in patients with acquired
      haemophilia and inhibitor titre &gt;5 BU/ml should be treated with by-passing agents.

      Response to treatment with by-passing agents is patient-specific, and can vary in the same
      patient during subsequent bleedings. Some patients have good response to both products,
      however in other patients a better bleeding control is provided by one of the mentioned
      above agents (APCC or rFVIIa). There are clinical situations when severe bleedings requires
      an alternate use of both these agents.

      Traditional methods of laboratory tests used post-treatment in patients with haemophilia
      without inhibitors are useless in the presence of inhibitor. Laboratory monitoring of
      therapy with by-passing agents is possible with the use of global tests for the coagulation
      process assessment, which are as follows: thrombin generation assay (TGA) and
      thromboelastometry (TEM).

      Several studies revealed that TGA allows a monitoring of therapy with by-passing agents in
      patients with haemophilia A and inhibitor - the choice of the most effective treatment
      option - agent type and its dose, as well as laboratory assessment of treatment efficacy.

      Up to date, laboratory tests assessing the efficacy of by-passing agents in patients with
      acquired haemophilia were not conducted.

      In Factor VIII or IX deficiency conditions, fibrin's fibres generated by thrombin are
      morphologically thicker, and blood clots have increased susceptibility to fibrinolytic
      enzymes. Blood clot stability may be assessed with the use of thromboelastometry (TEM). We
      can hypothesize that simultaneous use of TGA and TEM methods may allow for an assessment of
      patient's individual response to therapy with by-passing agents. Clinical significance of
      the minimal dose of APCC and rFVIIa, needed to TGA and TEM normalization, requires further
      studies.

      Tests' purpose: Examination of the hypothesis that simultaneous use of thrombin generation
      assay (TGA) and thromboelastometry (TEM) may facilitate the choice of optimal therapy with
      by-passing agents and laboratory monitoring of  efficacy of those agents in patients with
      acquired haemophilia or haemophilia A with inhibitor.

    <description>This is non-inverventional study as the protocol will not assign specific treatment to the particular subjects of the study. Patients will be treated with APCC or rFVIIa based on the experience of the study site. Patients are prescribed a treatment according to their physician's judgement or local clinical practice. This is observation of the everyday clinical practise on site.</description>
