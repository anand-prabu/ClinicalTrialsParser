  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (blood levels) and
      pharmacodynamics (the action or effects a drug has on the body) of canagliflozin in children
      and adolescents with type 2 diabetes mellitus aged 10 to 17 years (inclusive).  Other
      purposes are to investigate safety and assess the ease of swallowing the tablets.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The participants who meet the eligibility criteria, will receive a single dose of placebo
      (an inactive substance that is compared with a drug to test whether the drug has a real
      effect in a clinical trial) and this will be followed by baseline 24 hour pharmacodynamic
      assessments. On the next morning participants will receive the first canagliflozin dose and
      will be discharged home to continue canagliflozin treatment for 13 additional days. There
      will be 2 treatment groups (8 participants in each): the first group will receive
      canagliflozin 100 mg daily, the second group will receive either canagliflozin 300 mg or
      canagliflozin 50 mg daily. The canagliflozin dose for the second treatment group will be
      determined after the sponsor has evaluated the results from the first 5 participants. On day
      14 of treatment the participants will be admitted again for 24 hour pharmacokinetic and
      pharmacodynamics assessments. The participants will continue to take their normal dose and
      schedule of metformin during the entire study. The total duration of the study is
      approximately 50 days.
