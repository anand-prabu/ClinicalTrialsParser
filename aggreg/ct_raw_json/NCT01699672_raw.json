Furthermore, all patients will be given written\n      information.\n\n      Better-informed patients may be more motivated and may contact health care personnel earlier\n      than other patients when they develop side effects. This may reduce the risk of serious\n      treatment-related complications and increase the chances of patients completing the planned\n      treatment. But none have compared to what extent an organization like Vardesenteret improves\n      the patients' knowledge and whether patients are more satisfied with these methods for\n      informing them. Results from studies on the influence of patient anxiety and distress on\n      patient's abilities to perceive information are conflicting.Two large groups of relatively\n      homogenous cancer patients are patients with lower-stage breast cancer patients who are\n      eligible for adjuvant chemotherapy and patients with localized prostate cancer eligible for\n      curative radiotherapy."
