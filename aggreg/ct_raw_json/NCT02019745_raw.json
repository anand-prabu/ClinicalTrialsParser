While there is a large body of evidence supporting the notion that\n      exposure to CS causes significant changes in host defense responses, which may be linked to\n      permanent changes in epithelial cells at the genomic level, it is not known whether new and\n      emerging tobacco products have similar or distinct effects.\n\n      Using live attenuated influenza virus (LAIV) inoculation in human volunteers, this study\n      will compare influenza-induced responses in non-smokers (NS), cigarette smokers (CS), hookah\n      smokers (HS), and Little Cigar smokers (LCS) in vivo. This will be done by analyzing nasal\n      viral titers, antiviral defense responses, inflammatory mediator production, and markers of\n      immune responses for LAIV-induced responses between the different groups of volunteers."

We are aware\n      that many current smokers are poly-tobacco product users (i.e. smoke cigarettes in addition\n      to non-cigarette products), which could be confounding our observations. This will be\n      controlled for by having potential volunteers complete a smoking diary and provide daily\n      urine samples for 1 week prior to enrolling in the study. Based on this diary, subjects will\n      be grouped as CS (cigarettes only), HS (hookah smokers and smoking less than \u00bd pack of\n      cigarettes per week), and LCS (Little Cigar Smokers and smoking less than \u00bd pack of\n      cigarettes per week). Individuals with mixed exposures that exceed those described above\n      (i.e. smoking more than \u00bd pack of cigarettes per week in addition to smoking hookah or\n      Little Cigars) will be excluded from the studies. Potential subjects will then complete a\n      questionnaire regarding their smoking history, and will undergo urine collection for\n      measurement of cotinine for 7 consecutive days. Subjects will be assigned to the different\n      groups as followed: Group NS (no routine exposure to tobacco smoke, and average log10 urine\n      cotinine/creatinine ratio < 1.0), Group CS (active cigarette smoker and log10 urine\n      cotinine/creatinine ratio > 4), Group HS (active routine hookah smokers and average log10\n      urine cotinine/creatinine ratio 1-4), or Group LCS (active routine Little Cigars smoker and\n      average log10 urine cotinine/creatinine ratio 1-4).\n\n      Study protocol outline:\n\n      Screening visit (2-4 weeks prior to Day 0): Obtain informed consent, history (including\n      smoke exposure questionnaire), physical examination, vital signs, blood draw (for\n      anti-influenza antibody titer, HIV and T cell stimulation with flu antigen), urine (for\n      cotinine), nasal lavage (NL, for differential cell count, viral culture and antigen\n      detection, cytokine panel), nasal epithelial biopsy (NBx) #1, pregnancy test for females of\n      child bearing potential. In addition, smokers will undergo spirometry.\n\n      Subjects will return to the research lab daily the for the week prior to D0 to provide a\n      urine sample for cotinine. Subjects will given a daily smoking/exposure diary during this\n      time to continue throughout the study.\n\n      Day 0 (Monday): Obtain vital signs, NL, urine. Administer FluMist\n\n      Day 1 (Tuesday): Obtain vital signs, NL, urine, NBx #2 at Day 1 or Day 2 (single naris)\n\n      Day 2 (Wednesday): Obtain vital signs, NL, urine, and possibly NBx #2\n\n      Day 3 (Thursday): Obtain vital signs, NL, urine\n\n      Day 4 (Friday): Obtain vital signs, NL, urine, blood draw, NBx # 3 (single\n      naris-contralateral to naris used for Day 1 or Day 2 sample)\n\n      Day 9 +/- 1 day (Tues-Thursday): Obtain vital signs, NL, urine\n\n      Day 21 +/- 7 days: Obtain vital signs, blood draw, collect completed smoking/exposure diary"
