      This phase II clinical trial studies how well ERC1671 plus Granulocyte-macrophage
      colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) plus Cyclophosphamide with Bevacizumab works compared to
      Placebo Injection plus Placebo Pill with Bevacizumab in treating patients with
      recurrent/progressive, bevacizumab naïve glioblastoma multiforme and gliosarcoma (WHO grade
      IV malignant gliomas, GBM).

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      The primary objective of the study is to determine the 6-month progression free survival
      probability of patients with recurrent, bevacizumab naïve glioblastoma multiforme treated
      with ERC1671 in combination with GM-CSF and cyclophosphamide plus bevacizumab as compared
      with patients receiving bevacizumab plus placebo controls.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

        1. To evaluate radiographic response, progression free survival and overall survival of
           patients with recurrent malignant glioma treated with the ERC1671 regimen plus
           bevacizumab

        2. To evaluate safety and tolerability of ERC1671 plus bevacizumab among patients with
           recurrent glioblastoma.

        3. To characterize of the immune response to ERC1671 vaccination in adult patients with
           relapsed glioblastoma.  The patient's immune response evaluation will include cytotoxic
           T lymphocytes (CTL) (cluster of differentiation 3+ (CD3+)/cluster of differentiation 8+
           (CD8)+) and Treg (cluster of differentiation 3+/cluster of differentiation 4+
           (CD4+)/cluster of differentiation 25+ )CD25+/cluster of differentiation 127low
           (CD127low)) populations. Cytokine analyses should initially be limited to interferon
           (IFN)-ɣ, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin (IL)-6).

      If this study demonstrates that the combination regimen of ERC1671 in combination with
      bevacizumab is associated with encouraging anti-tumor activity among patients with recurrent
      glioblastoma multiforme, further assessment of this regimen in a phase III study will be
      considered.

      OUTLINE: This is a blinded Phase II study of ERC1671 in combination with bevacizumab in
      patients with relapsed, bevacizumab naive glioblastoma. The patients who will be randomized
      (in a 1:1 ratio) to receive either ERC 1671 in combination with GM-CSF and cyclophosphamide
      or a placebo control, in combination with bevacizumab. The study will be double blinded.

      ERC1671/GM-CSF will be intradermally administered, while cyclophosphamide is orally
      administered. GM-CSF dose is 250 µg/m² and cyclophosphamide dose is 50 mg/day. Bevacizumab
      is administered as standard of care at 10 mg/kg.

      The treatment cycles will be 28 days long.
