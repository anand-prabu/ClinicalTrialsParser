They will\n      complete two screening visits within a one-week period, and if enrolled will then have their\n      strength tested monthly for three months before beginning therapy with Coenzyme Q10.  Once\n      Coenzyme Q10 therapy is started, participants will have their strength tested monthly for\n      six months.  Following the six month treatment period, participants will be given the option\n      to remain on Coenzyme Q10 until the study is completed."

Diagnosis of DMD confirmed by at least one the following:\n\n               -  Positive X-linked family history for typical Duchenne muscular dystrophy in\n                  older male relatives (onset by age 5 yr., wheelchair-bound by age 12 yr.)  OR\n\n               -  Dystrophin immunofluorescence and/or immunoblot showing complete dystrophin\n                  deficiency, and clinical picture consistent with typical Duchenne dystrophy OR\n\n               -  Gene deletion test positive (missing one or more exons) in the central rod\n                  domain (exons 25-60) of dystrophin, where reading frame can be predicted as\n                  `out-of-frame', and clinical picture consistent with typical Duchenne dystrophy.\n\n          4. On Glucocorticosteroids: Children must be on a steady dose of prednisone or\n             deflazacort, on any schedule (Daily, alternate days, 10 days on, 10 days off or twice\n             a week), for the last 6 months before starting the clinical trial. Dose of steroid or\n             schedule cannot be altered during the study.\n\n          5. Evidence of muscle weakness by MRC score or clinical functional evaluation\n\n          6. Ability to provide reproducible repeat QMT bicep score within 10% of first assessment\n             score.\n\n          7. Ability to swallow tablets\n\n        Subject Exclusion Criteria\n\n          1. Failure to achieve one or more of the diagnostic inclusion criteria cited above.\n\n          2. Symptomatic DMD carrier\n\n          3. Previous (6 months or less) or current use of Coenzyme Q10 (for DMD or any other\n             disease)\n\n          4. Use of carnitine, other amino acids, creatine, glutamine, or any herbal medicines\n             within the last 3 months.\n\n          5. History of significant concomitant illness or significant impairment of renal or\n             hepatic function."
