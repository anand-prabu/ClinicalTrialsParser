Although, population studies have revealed that a mild to moderate intake\n      of red wine reduces cardiovascular disease risk in humans, clinical studies that evaluate\n      the potential heart benefits of resveratrol in patients with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy\n      have not been previously reported. Accordingly, this research is being done because it will\n      fill this deficiency in the information available in the literature and establish the\n      clinical benefits of resveratrol in patients with this type of heart disease."

After randomization, the two groups of subjects will be followed up in exactly\n      the same way, and the only differences between the care they receive will be those intrinsic\n      to the treatment being compared.
