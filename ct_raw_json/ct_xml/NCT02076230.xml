    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, Phase 1, two-center trial to evaluate the mass balance and metabolite
      profile of carbon 14 [14C]-labeled TH-302 (Label 1 and Label 2) followed by subsequent
      treatment with unlabeled TH-302 in cancer subjects with locally advanced or metastatic solid
      tumors.
