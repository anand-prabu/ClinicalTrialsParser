  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the
      effectiveness of an investigational drug, which is cisplatin in this trial, to learn how
      well it works in treating a specific cancer. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that cisplatin is still
      being studied for use in this setting and that research doctors are trying to find out more
      about it-in this case, how effective cisplatin is for treating breast cancer in BRCA
      mutation carriers. It also means that the FDA has not yet approved cisplatin for your type
      of cancer. Cisplatin has been approved by the FDA for treatment of other cancers.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate cisplatin, a chemotherapy drug that has been shown
      to be active in the treatment of women with breast cancer and a BRCA mutation. In this
      study, we are comparing cisplatin to the standard chemotherapy, doxorubicin and
      cyclophosphamide (&quot;AC&quot;) that you might receive if you did not participate in this study.

  <detailed_description>

      If screening tests show that you are eligible to participate in the research study you will
      begin study treatment. You will undergo a research biopsy so the study team can obtain
      tissue samples. This will be used for biomarker research and will help your doctors to
      better understand your disease, how the drug is working in your body, and may help to
      identify which people may benefit most from platinum or from adriamycin/cytoxan in the
      future.

      Because no one knows which of the study options is best, you will be &quot;randomized&quot; to receive
      either cisplatin or doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (&quot;AC&quot;) chemotherapy prior to removal of
      your breast cancer. Chemotherapy administered before the removal of the cancer is known as
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy.  Randomization means that you are put into a group by chance. It
      is like flipping a coin. Neither you nor the research doctor will choose what group you will
      be in. You will have an equal chance of being placed in either group.

      If you are randomized to receive cisplatin you will receive cisplatin once every three weeks
      for a total of four doses. You will be given cisplatin by vein (IV) on the first day of each
      treatment cycle. The cisplatin infusion can take between 1 to 2 hours. Before and after
      receiving cisplatin, you will receive fluid hydration by vein, and you will also be given
      medicine to help prevent side effects such as nausea. The total time of the infusion of
      cisplatin and the additional fluid and medications will take about 6 hours. After you
      receive cisplatin, you will be asked to drink about 12 eight ounce glasses of fluid per day,
      especially 2 or 3 days after therapy. The study treatment will stop if you have serious side
      effects or if the tumor grows despite receiving cisplatin chemotherapy.

      If you are randomized to &quot;AC&quot; chemotherapy you will receive both doxorubicin and
      cyclophosphamide once every 2 or 3 weeks for a total of four doses by vein on the first day
      of each treatment cycle. The interval between chemotherapy will be decided by your research
      doctor. If you receive the chemotherapy every two weeks, you will also receive a
      subcutaneous injection the day after chemotherapy. This injection contains a medicine that
      contains a growth factor that will boost your immune system in order to allow your body to
      be ready for chemotherapy in two weeks. The study treatment will be stopped if you have
      serious side effects or if the tumor grows despite the doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide
      chemotherapy.

      At the beginning of each treatment cycle you will have a physical exam (including weight and
      vital signs) and you will be asked general questions about your health and any medications
      you may be taking, as well as specific questions about any side effects you may be
      experiencing while receiving study treatment. Prior to each cycle of chemotherapy, you will
      have standard blood tests to check your blood counts. If you are receiving cisplatin your
      kidney function and body salts will also be checked prior to each chemotherapy cycle. In
      addition, 7-10 days after chemotherapy your blood will be drawn to look at your blood cell
      count to determine your risk of infection; if you have received cisplatin, your kidney
      function and blood electrolytes will also be evaluated. The blood draw performed 7-10 days
      after chemotherapy can be done in the hospital where you received your chemotherapy or
      closer to home. About 1 tablespoon of blood will be drawn for these tests.

      Surgery to remove your tumor will occur within six weeks after the last dose of
      chemotherapy. Your surgery will be performed by your surgeon, as part of the standard care
      for your disease.

      Your treating physician or nurse practitioner will examine you to assess your tumor each
      time you receive chemotherapy. A measurement of your tumor will be performed on the first
      day of each treatment cycle as part of your physical exam. After the slides of your initial
      breast cancer biopsy have been reviewed at your hospital, these slides and your tumor block
      will be sent to the study pathologist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. Likewise,
      after chemotherapy, your breast cancer will be removed by lumpectomy or mastectomy. After
      these slides are reviewed at your hospital, they will also be sent with the tumor block to
      the study pathologist so that the response of your tumor to the study treatment can be
      assessed. After these slides are reviewed, they will be returned to the hospital at which
      the biopsy and surgery were performed.

      Decisions about whether you will receive more chemotherapy after your surgery is up to your
      treating physicians. If you receive chemotherapy, the choice of chemotherapy is also up to
      your doctors. Decisions about post-operative chemotherapy are not part of this study.

    <description>Pretreatment tumor biopsies will be analyzed using genome wide SNP profiling to determine number of regions of telomeric allelic imbalance (NtAI) and chromosome 15q26 copy number, and chromosome 8q22 copy number.  Tumor sections will be examined for gene amplifications, losses and NtAI in tumors. Gene expression profiling will be performed to determine intrinsic subtype (basal-like, claudin-low, etc.) and to measure biomarker genes including BLM and FANCI associated with cisplatin sensitivity or LAPTM4B and YWHAZ associated with anthracycline resistance. Exploratory analysis will be performed to seek new measures of therapy response using the data from DNA copy number and gene expression profiles.  In addition, we will plan to perform whole exome and possibly whole genome sequencing of tumors to identify potential modifiers of response to therapy.</description>
