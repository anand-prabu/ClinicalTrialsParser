  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to quantify changes in ankle and knee motion and force
      resulting from five progressive modifications to the anterior-posterior trim lines of
      thermoformed ankle-foot orthoses (AFO). It is hypothesized that the AFO with the most
      anterior trim line will prevent the most plantar flexion during loading response (the first
      10% of the gait cycle)and prevent the most dorsiflexion at terminal stance (from 30 to 50%
      of the gait cycle) as compared to the non-device condition. This will be evidenced by the
      sagittal plane ankle motion and ground reaction force magnitude and location during loading
      response and terminal stance. Additionally, the angular velocity of knee flexion will
      increase during these same periods.  By contrast, as the trim lines are moved more posterior
      this will result in lowering the effective stiffness of the device which will result in
      progressive increases in dorsiflexion and allow increasing amounts of knee flexion during
      terminal stance.
