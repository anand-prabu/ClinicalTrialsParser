The rate of cerebral palsy (CP) in extremely premature infants is approximately\n      20%.  Magnesium sulfate, the most commonly used drug in the US to stop premature labor, may\n      prevent CP. This trial tests whether magnesium sulfate given to a woman in labor with a\n      premature fetus (24 to 31 weeks out of 40) will reduce the rate of death or moderate to\n      severe CP in the children at 2 years.  The children receive ultrasounds of their brains as\n      infants and attend three follow-up visits over two years to assess their health and\n      development."

            "textblock": "The prevalence of cerebral palsy is increasing as the survival rate of extremely premature\n      infants is improving.  Studies have suggested an apparent association between maternal\n      magnesium sulfate administration and a reduced risk of cerebral palsy.  Other studies have\n      suggested a possible association between magnesium sulfate and a reduction in neonatal\n      cranial ultrasound abnormalities which may be markers for subsequent development of cerebral\n      palsy.\n\n      This multicenter trial tests whether prophylactic magnesium sulfate given to women, for whom\n      preterm delivery is imminent, reduces the risk of death or moderate to severe cerebral palsy\n      in their children.  Women presenting from 24.0 to 31.6 weeks gestation with advanced preterm\n      labor or premature rupture of the membranes (pPROM) and no recent exposure to magnesium\n      sulfate are randomized to receive either intravenous magnesium sulfate or masked study drug\n      placebo.  The study drug is administered as a 6 gram loading dose followed by a 2 gram/hour\n      infusion (or equivalent rate for placebo).  If after 12 hours, delivery has not occurred and\n      is not anticipated, the infusion is stopped.  No other parenteral tocolytics other than the\n      IV medication may be used.  Retreatment with study medication is given any time labor recurs\n      or delivery is anticipated until gestational age is > 34.0 wks.  Standard clinical\n      management and therapy is to be maintained for all study patients. Patients are assessed for\n      signs of intolerance to the study medications and maternal data are collected up to hospital\n      discharge.  A sample of venous blood is collected and neonatal cranial ultrasounds are\n      performed.  Up to three follow-up visits are scheduled over two years where certified\n      examiners, masked to study group assignment, collect physical and neurological data,\n      including a modified Gross Motor Function Classification Scale. The Bayley Scales of Infant\n      Development is also administered.  Cranial ultrasounds are reviewed centrally.\n\n      The primary outcome is a composite outcome of death or moderate to severe cerebral palsy.\n      Secondary outcomes include maternal infectious morbidity, pulmonary edema and placental\n      abruption, neonatal stillbirth and death, intraventricular hemorrhage, periventricular\n      leukomalacia, neonatal infectious and noninfectious morbidity."
