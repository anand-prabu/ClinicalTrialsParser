Therefore, the purpose of\n      this study is to identify the possibilities and limitations of an enhanced trunk marker set\n      for the measurement of spine dynamics during gait in adolescents with and without structural\n      spine deformities.\n\n      It has been hypothesized that the enhance trunk marker set:\n\n        1. is a valid method for the measurement of spine deformations in the sagittal, frontal\n           and indirectly transverse planes.\n\n        2. is an applicable and reliable method for the measurement of spine dynamics during gait\n           in healthy adolescents and in patients with structural deformities such as seen in\n           scoliosis.\n\n        3. is sensitive enough to distinguish the spinal movement pattern during gait measured in\n           scoliosis patients from the one measured in healthy adolescents.\n\n      To verify the hypotheses, the following measurements will be carried out:\n\n        -  Biplanar radiographs (a-p and lateral) with radio-opaque markers in scoliosis patients.\n\n        -  Instrumented gait analysis with a standard full body marker set and the enhanced trunk\n           marker set in scoliosis patients and healthy controls."
