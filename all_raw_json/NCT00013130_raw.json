As part of this process, greater emphasis is being placed on measurement\n      of outcomes, and in particular, functional outcomes and satisfaction as reported by\n      patients.\n\n      Objectives:\n\n      ACQUIP was designed to determine whether quality and outcomes of health care improve when\n      primary care providers have access to regular assessments of their patients' health and\n      function along with routine clinical data and information about clinical guidelines.\n\n      Methods:\n\n      This study was a randomized trial conducted at the General Internal Medicine Clinics of\n      seven VA facilities. Each participating GIMC is organized into discrete firms staffed by\n      different groups of providers who care for different patients.  One randomly selected firm\n      received the intervention and one served as control.  Patients who made at least one GIMC\n      visit in the last year were eligible to participate.  Patients were surveyed    at baseline\n      to determine active medical problems.  Subsequent mailings included a general evaluation of\n      health status (SF-36), a satisfaction questionnaire and, as appropriate, one of six\n      condition-specific questionnaires:  the Seattle Angina Questionnaire, the Seattle\n      Obstructive Lung Disease Questionnaire, the Hopkins Symptom Checklist (depression), and\n      questionnaires regarding diabetes, drinking, and hypertension.  Clinical/utilization data\n      were downloaded weekly from VISTA and supplemented with data from Austin.  The intervention\n      consisted of multi-faceted reports to patients' primary care providers (at the time of\n      patient visits) showing trended physiologic and health status data and guideline-derived\n      recommendations.  Clinicians also received periodical reports displaying trends in the\n      health status and satisfaction of their patients compared with their clinic as a whole.\n      Reports were supplemented by training on QI and health status measures.\n\n      Status:\n\n      Data collection was completed on April 1, 2000.  Analysis of trial results will be completed\n      January, 2001."
