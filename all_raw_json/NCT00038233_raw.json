The trial focuses on patients with\n      asymptomatic and indolent disease who do not require immediate chemotherapy.  We intend to\n      treat asymptomatic patients with an initial dose of   200 mg each evening, increasing to a\n      maximum of  800 mg.\n\n      Thalidomide  is  supplied as  50 mg capsules to be taken by mouth. The initial dose will be\n      200 mg  at bedtime daily  for 14 days (days 1-14), followed by  an increase to 400 mg  daily\n      for 14 days (days 15-28), 600 mg daily for 14 days (days 29-42), up to  a maximum  800 mg\n      (days 43-completion) daily  provided there are no side effects.\n\n      Patients who experience significant toxicity (grade 2 or more) at any time during therapy\n      will receive a lower dose after treatment is interrupted for at least 2 days.\n\n      Once a maximum tolerated dose has been reached free of side effects, that dose will be\n      continued for  a total of  3 months  from institution of therapy before  definition of\n      response or  resistance.   Only patients who have received at least 200 mg/d for at least 2\n      months will be considered evaluable for response.   For patients in remission, treatment\n      will be continued  at  the maximum dose free of side effects until relapse. Selected\n      patients <55 years of age  who achieve remission may be eligible for stem cell transplant\n      (SCT) in which case thalidomide will be discontinued prior to SCT.\n\n      Patients must be willing to return for evaluation every 4 weeks since thalidomide may only\n      be prescribed for 28 day intervals."
