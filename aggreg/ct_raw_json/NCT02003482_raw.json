It is\n      possible for these dosimetric changes could occur in either those patients who undergo\n      resection or not. In this study those patients who have undergone a resection will be\n      stratified separately for analysis, however, this study is not powered to detect a\n      difference between the two groups.  The rational for stratification into an operated group\n      of patients is that these patients will also lose weight in treatment and will provide us a\n      detection of the magnitude of change in dose caused by weight loss independent of tumor\n      shrinkage."
