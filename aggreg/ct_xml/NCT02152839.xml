  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Maintenance of body's skeletal muscle is key to a healthy older age.  However, as we age we
      lose on average 1-2% of our muscle each year.  In order to slow this loss we need to
      understand fully the mechanisms regulating muscle mass with ageing. In this project we aim
      to determine these mechanisms using a new novel technique of 'heavy' water ingestion, which
      will allow us to measure multiple aspects of skeletal muscle mass control during normal
      everyday activities in young and old individuals over a period of 6 weeks.  We will also
      determine the influence of resistance exercise training during this period in offsetting
      declines in muscle with ageing using this method
