            "textblock": "BACKGROUND:\n\n      Arterial hypertension and high blood pressure (HBP) are major risk factors for\n      cardiovascular disease (CVD) and stroke; they are also risk factors for lowered cognitive\n      functioning. Except for diabetes, there have been comparatively few studies of other common\n      risk factors, particularly with regard to interrelationships among risk factors which may\n      adversely affect cognitive ability.\n\n      DESIGN NARRATIVE:\n\n      The study examines associations between cognitive functioning and three cardiovascular risk\n      factors: 1) high blood pressure; 2)  high total plasma homocysteine (tHcy), and 3) ApoE e4\n      genotype. These associations are examined cross-sectionally as well as longitudinally, using\n      data collected at a follow-up visit of members of a cohort that has been followed for the\n      past 18-19 years. Longitudinal data are used to examine both current and change in cognitive\n      functioning. Some analyses are prospective (e.g., high blood pressure and change in\n      cognitive functioning), while others are cross-sectional (e.g., ApoE e4 and current\n      cognitive functioning) or retrospective (e.g., tHcy and change in cognitive functioning).\n      Structural equation models are used to examine cross-sectional data in elucidating a\n      general theoretical model. Two-stage growth curve analyses and survival analyses are\n      appropriate methods for analyzing the longitudinal data. The study includes a very\n      comprehensive set of measures that have already been collected or will be collected during\n      the follow-up visit. All potential confounders of the association between the three target\n      predictor variables and the various domains of cognitive functioning appear to have been\n      included in this design."
