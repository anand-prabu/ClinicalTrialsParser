  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to investigate whether breast density measured by a
      safe, painless imaging method (called Diffuse Optical Spectroscopic Imaging - DOSI) can
      detect the decrease of breast density in subjects who receive tamoxifen when compared to
      patients who do not receive any drug.  If decreased density can be reliably detected, it may
      help determine which subjects will benefit by taking tamoxifen or other chemoprevention
      drugs.

    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to develop a safe, painless imaging method to measure the change
      in breast density caused by hormonal chemotherapy treatments such as tamoxifen.  For many
      patients with breast cancer, chemoprevention drugs (such as tamoxifen) can reduce the risk
      of recurrence.  However, tamoxifen can also cause serious side effects such as blood clots
      and an increased risk of uterine cancer.  Patients would benefit from an individualized
      method of determining whether the chemoprevention is working.  Recent studies have shown
      that a course of tamoxifen is more effective at reducing risk in women who exhibit &gt;10%
      reduction in breast density compared to women who had little or no density change.  The
      study suggests that breast density is a predictor of the effectiveness of tamoxifen. We
      propose to use an imaging method that uses safe visible and near-infrared light to measure
      breast tissue called diffuse optical spectroscopic imaging.  Diffuse optical spectroscopic
      imaging allows patients to be followed through treatment with a cost-effective, bedside,
      handheld scanning probe.  In this study, we will examine whether diffuse optical
      spectroscopic imaging is sensitive to the density changes induced by tamoxifen as a
      preventative hormonal chemotherapy agent.  MRI will be used as the standard for comparison.
      We expect to discover that after 12-18 months, women on tamoxifen treatment will show a
      significant reduction in breast density compared to women not taking tamoxifen, and this
      change can be monitored using DOSI alone. If validated, our method could be used to
      determine if tamoxifen treatment is working in an individual patient and could guide doctors
      about the decision to end and/or switch to a different treatment. In addition, a validated
      index of density that can be obtained using an inexpensive, risk-free bedside technology
      could be applied to the challenging problem of measuring individual risk of breast cancer in
      the broader population.
