Standard of care is establishing bloodflow through the coronary vessels\n      using thrombus aspiration catheter, and securing the result by using a metallic drug eluting\n      stent. New kinds of non-metallic bioresorbable stents are now available. They have however\n      challenges in structural strength.\n\n      The investigators want to compare the new bioresorbable scaffold with traditional metallic\n      stents in this setting in a prospective, randomized, non-blinded, single center study in 120\n      patients. The investigators will use a new imaging technique, optical coherence tomography,\n      to evaluate the results after 12 months.\n\n      The investigators also want to see if modern multislice computed tomography can give useful\n      information in the follow-up of stented coronary arteries after 12 and 24 months."
