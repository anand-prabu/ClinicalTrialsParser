  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dental implants are used for replacing missing teeth. Placing dental implants is limited by
      the presence of adequate bone volume permitting their anchorage. In order to solve this
      problem several bone augmentation procedures have been developed. In principle the missing
      bone is taken from a donor site (for example the hip), transplanted where needed and then
      implants are placed. Sometimes, major bone grafting operations have to be undertaken under
      general anaesthesia requiring patients to be hospitalised for a few days. Some degree of
      morbidity related to the donor site must be expected, though more recently bone substitutes
      are used to minimize morbidity, and 2 to 3 surgical interventions may be needed before the
      implants can be functionally used. Sometimes patients have to wait more than 1 year before a
      prosthesis can be fixed to the implants and the total cost of the treatment is high. At the
      beginning of the 1990s a long screwshaped implant was developed by Professor PI Br√•nemark as
      an alternative to bone augmentation procedures: the zygomatic implant. Zygomatic implants
      are generally inserted through the palate to engage the body of the cheek bone. One to three
      zygomatic implants can be inserted through the posterior palate to engage the body of each
      cheek bone. The potential main advantages of zygomatic implants could be that bone grafting
      may not be needed and a fixed prosthesis could be fitted the same day of their placement.
      Despite that zygomatic implants have been used for more than 20 years, their effectiveness
      has never been compared with conventional dental implants in augmented maxillae. The aim of
      the project is to compare the longtermclinical outcome of fullarch upper jaw bridges
      supported by zygomatic implants versus conventional implants placed in augmented bone in the
      palate.
