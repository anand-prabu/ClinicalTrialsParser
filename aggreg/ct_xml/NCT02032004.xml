    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine whether transendocardial delivery of
      allogeneic human bone marrow-derived MPCs (CEP-41750) is effective in the treatment of
      chronic heart failure due to LV systolic dysfunction.

             least 6 months

          -  The patient is on stable, optimally tolerated dosages of HF therapies including
             beta-blockers (approved for country-specific usage), angiotensin-converting enzyme
             (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs), and/or aldosterone
             antagonists, without change in dose for at least 1 month before study intervention

          -  The patient is on a stable, outpatient, oral diuretic dosing regimen in which the
             patient remains clinically stable during screening.
