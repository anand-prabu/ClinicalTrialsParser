Only the Study Eye will undergo transplantation. The\n      adult bone marrow stem cells will be administered into the vitreous cavity through a\n      standard surgical approach.\n\n      Moxifloxacin 300 mg(once per day ) will be administered orally to all subjects for a period\n      of five days ( 2 days pre and post operatively) .\n\n      Subjects will be monitored frequently for a total of one year after adult bone marrow stem\n      cells cell injection ."
