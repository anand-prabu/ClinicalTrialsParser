Defects range\n      from the minor and easily treated with an excellent functional prognosis, to those that are\n      complex and often associated with a poor functional prognosis. Despite the better knowledge\n      of the anatomy and physiology and the improvement of surgical management after birth, fecal\n      and urinary incontinence can occur, due mainly to deficient nerve supply. A few studies and\n      clinical practice have shown that disease-specific problems of ARM have an effect on somatic\n      function, mental health and psychosocial functioning.\n\n      The assessment of quality of life requires a self-report questionnaire composed of items\n      related to physical, emotional and social functioning, and disease-related symptoms. A\n      specific ARM questionnaire, the HAQL, was developed by a Dutch team and published in 2001.\n      Associated with generic questionnaire, it allowed quality of life assessment in Dutch\n      population.\n\n      The quality of life of such patients is largely unknown in this larger country. The aim of\n      the investigators study is to propose specific (HAQL translated from Dutch to French) and\n      generic questionnaires to the patients registered in the national database, correlated to\n      their anatomical and functional status.\n\n      A better understanding of such correlations should allow improvements in their medical and\n      social management."
