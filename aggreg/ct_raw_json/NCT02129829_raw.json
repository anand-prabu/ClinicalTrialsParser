It aims to evaluate a number of steps\n      required to successfully treat patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection to prevent\n      cirrhosis and liver cancer. The first step is to determine whether screening for hepatitis B\n      using a point of care test is feasible and effective. The second is to monitor linkage from\n      screening into care. The third is to evaluate cheap non-invasive assessments to determine\n      the need for treatment. The fourth is to determine what proportion of patients meet\n      treatment eligibility criteria. The fifth step is to establish a treatment cohort which can\n      be used to measure adherence to therapy and avoidance of HBV related complications. A\n      parallel untreated cohort will be established to determine whether treatment criteria are\n      relevant in this West African setting by monitoring for complications of HBV infection."

A\n      point-of-care test based on the detection of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) in a\n      finger-prick blood sample will be used for screening. Subjects with a positive test will be\n      given a hospital appointment for full clinical assessment.\n\n      Efficacy Evaluations (Part 2 only) Detection of liver cancer - Surveillance for liver cancer\n      will be made using ultrasound and serum AFP every 6 months on all subjects. In some centres\n      further imaging will be available.\n\n      Liver cancer will be diagnosed according to the following criteria:\n\n        -  Liver mass with typical features of hepatocellular carcinoma on two imaging modalities\n           (ultrasound, bubble ultrasound or CT), or\n\n        -  liver mass on ultrasound and AFP > 400 iu/ml or\n\n        -  histological or cytological confirmation of diagnosis.\n\n      Viral Load - viral load will be measure on EDTA plasma samples using an in-house real-time\n      PCR assay verified for accuracy against commercial assays every 6 months.\n\n      Safety Evaluations (Part 2 only) Liver function tests, serum phosphate and renal function\n      will be tested every 6 months\n\n      Evaluation of treatment guidelines Subjects who do not meet the EASL treatment criteria at\n      baseline will be enrolled in the observational study with surveillance for liver cancer\n      every 6 months\n\n      Detection of viral resistance Viral load monitoring of patients in the treatment study every\n      6 months will be used to detect possible virological resistance. A rise in viral load from\n      nadir values or reappearance of detectable viraemia in patients who had achieved\n      undetectable viral load will be investigated for emergence of viral sequence variants and\n      for adherence to therapy"
