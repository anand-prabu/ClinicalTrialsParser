The investigators hypothesize that the Treatment group will show higher\n      diagnostic accuracy than the Control condition: Participants receiving the cognitive\n      de-biasing intervention will be less likely to commit faulty heuristics and race/ethnicity\n      bias. Secondary aims include soliciting feedback about whether the skills were useful when\n      diagnosing the vignettes, and whether skills and cases seem clinically realistic."

All\n      participants receive a 5 minute pre-recorded presentation about mood disorders, then read\n      several case vignettes and respond to questions regarding judgments about probable diagnoses\n      and next clinical actions.\n\n      Study administration is Web-based via a secure portal. After answering questions to confirm\n      eligibility and provide informed consent, participants will complete a background\n      questionnaire. The Web software, Qualtrics, will randomize participants to watch a brief\n      presentation on mood disorders (i.e., Control condition) versus the same presentation on\n      mood disorders combined with the intervention (i.e., Treatment condition). The intervention\n      is a 20-minute training on decision-making errors and cognitive de-biasing strategies.\n\n      Next, all participants review four clinical vignettes. Using only four vignettes reduces\n      participant burden and maximizes response rate. Qualtrics presents the case vignettes in\n      random orders.\n\n      After completing the last vignette and corresponding questions, participants in the\n      treatment condition rate their experience of the intervention. These questions address the\n      secondary study aims: (a) how participants will use these new techniques in their clinical\n      practice; and, (b) how the investigators can tailor the intervention to make it even more\n      user-friendly and appealing to clinical audiences."
