            "textblock": "It's well-known that the long-term outcome of adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) lags\n      far behind that of pediatric ALL,associated with different molecular cytogenetics make-up\n      and treatment strategies. In search of an optimal regimen for pediatric ALL, comprehensive\n      series of clinical trials of intensive chemotherapies have been conducted and lead to\n      80%-90% long-term survival.  At the same time, pediatric-inspired chemotherapy protocol aslo\n      yielded a charming result of 50-60% 3-year EFS in adolescent and young adult. In comparison\n      with the leading role of intensive chemotherapy in pediatric ALL,  allogeneic hematopoietic\n      stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) plays an important role in treatment strategy of adult\n      ALL. According to the state-of-art understanding of ALL, total therapy of ALL should consist\n      of molecular-cytogenetics classification at diagnosis, minimal residual disease (MRD)\n      monitoring and redefining risk classification during treatment, pediatric-inspired\n      chemotherapy with high-dose Methotrexate/L-asparaginase during consolidation\n      therapy,furthermore,risk/MRD-adapted allo-HSCT for high-risk and refractory/relapsed ALL.In\n      pre-pediatric-inspired protocol era, allo-HSCT still represents the major role for improving\n      the outcome of adult ALL, especially for high-risk and refractory/relapsed ALL. It's\n      established that graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect was weak in ALL and patient shows poor\n      response for donor-lymphocyte infusion (DLI). Intensified conditioning regimen allo-HSCT is\n      based on a hypothesis of that intensifying condition with less-used drugs could overcome\n      resistance,reduce tumor burden, and most importantly, spare  enough time for slow-growing\n      GVL effect following immune reconstitution to finally get rid of MRD and control the\n      disease. Our previous trial of HDE-ALL-2011 (NCT01457040) have confirmed the role of\n      intensified conditioning allo-HSCT in adult ALL, resulting in significantly improved OS and\n      EFS in comparison with previous standard TBI/CY2 conditioning regimen(data not yet\n      published). But at the same time, FA-TBI/CY2-VP16 conditioning regimen was associated with\n      high transplantation-related mortality (TRM), which might be attributed to excessive\n      suppression on both bone marrow and immune. TT-ALL-HIE-2013, substituting FA with\n      idarubicin, is aimed at maintaining anti-tumor effect with less cross-resistance and immune\n      suppression and reducing TRM."
