  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute, randomized, placebo controlled, double blind, postprandial crossover study in male
      subjects. 4 intervention arms consisting of control, orange juice, whole orange, and
      processed whole orange to determine the effect of the interventions on the primary measure
      of flow mediated dilatation (FMD) and additional biomarkers of health.  The study will also
      identify and quantify the main micronutrients and phytochemicals in each of the products and
      will identify and quantify the main micronutrients and phytochemicals and their metabolites
      in the subjects' plasma and/or urine. A subset of the study population (n=24) will be
      invited to participate in an additional arm of the main study which is summarised below.
