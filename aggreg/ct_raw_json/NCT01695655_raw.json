During these\n      visits slit lamp biomicroscopy will be used to study CN patterns, and take slit lamp\n      photographs if there is any neovascularization detected, permitting us to develop algorithms\n      of CN characteristics that are predictive for corneal allograft rejection and failure.  The\n      corneal tissue removed during these patients' surgeries will be evaluated\n      histopathologically to identify inflammation and neovascularization to confirm and compare\n      to what is seen clinically. There will be two short questionnaires conducted at each visit\n      to assess stress levels."
