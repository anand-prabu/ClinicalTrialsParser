            "textblock": "In previous studies we demonstrated that endogenous opioids (inhibitory neuropeptides)\n      modulate the perception of breathing difficulty in patients with chronic obstructive\n      pulmonary disease (COPD) (ERJ 2009;33:771; J COPD 2011;8:160).  Recently, we found that\n      antagonism of substance P (an excitatory neuropeptide) with aprepitant did not affect the\n      perception of breathing difficulty.   However, after administration of aprepitant, blood\n      levels of both substance P(+ 54 \u00b1 39%) and beta-endorphin (+ 27 \u00b1 17%) increased\n      significantly.  As these blood levels reflect cellular/tissue activity, we postulated that\n      the concomitant release of excitatory (substance P) and inhibitory (beta-endorphin)\n      neuropeptides had opposing effects (counterbalanced each other) on the perception of\n      breathing difficulty.\n\n      The objective of the present study is to further examine the possible role of substance P on\n      the perception of breathlessness.  We propose to administer oral aprepitant and oral placebo\n      in a randomized clinical trial in patients with COPD.  However, four hours after patients\n      take these medications, intravenous naloxone will be administered in order to block the\n      effects of endogenous opioids (beta-endorphin) on opioid receptors.  Five minutes later,\n      patients will breathe thru a tube with fine wire mesh to provoke breathing difficulty, and\n      then provide ratings of the intensity and unpleasantness of breathlessness every minute.\n\n      The two competing hypothesis of the study are:\n\n        1. if breathlessness ratings with aprepitant/naloxone = placebo/naloxone, then substance P\n           has no       effect on perception of breathing difficulty;\n\n        2. if breathlessness ratings with aprepitant/naloxone \u2260 placebo/naloxone, then substance P\n           has an effect on perception of breathing difficulty."
