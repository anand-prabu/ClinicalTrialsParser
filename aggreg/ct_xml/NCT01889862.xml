  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The BMN 165 clinical development program has been designed to demonstrate the safety and
      efficacy of BMN 165 in reducing blood Phe concentrations in adults with PKU.

      Study BMN 165-302 is a Phase 3, 3 Part/4 armed, Randomized, Double-Blind,
      Placebo-Controlled, Discontinuation Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Self
      Administered Subcutaneous Injections of BMN 165 by Adults With PKU.

      In contrast to BMN study 165-301 (currently recruiting) which is open to adults who are
      naive to BMN165, this study is open only to adults who have been exposed to BMN165 in a
      previous study.

      Study BMN 165-302 is a three-part, Phase 3 study.

      Part 1 is an open-label run-in period designed to stabilize the dosing regimen of subjects
      who enroll from a previous BMN 165 study.

      Part 2 is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, four-arm, discontinuation study designed to
      compare the blood Phe concentrations of subjects who continue administration with BMN 165
      versus those of subjects who temporarily receive placebo.

      Part 3 is a long-term, open-label extension study designed to evaluate the long-term
      efficacy and safety of BMN 165 and to provide long-term access to BMN 165 (no placebo).
