Patients are\n      randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral neoadjuvant celecoxib twice daily.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral neoadjuvant placebo twice daily. Treatment in both arms\n           continues for at least 4 weeks followed by prostatectomy.\n\n      Patients are followed within 1 month and then at 3 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60-70 patients (at least 30 per arm) will be accrued for this\n      study."
