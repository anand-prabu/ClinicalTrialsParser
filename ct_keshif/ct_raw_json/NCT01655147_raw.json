The study consists of\n      a screening phase, an open-label treatment phase, and a follow up phase. The screening phase\n      will be within 14 days before the first study medication administration. The treatment phase\n      will consist of 2 treatment periods, Period 1: a single oral dose of abiraterone acetate\n      tablets, and Period 2: a daily oral dose of rifampicin capsules alongwith a single oral dose\n      of abiraterone acetate tablets. The 2 periods will be separated by a washout period of at\n      least 7 days. Blood sample collection for pharmacokinetic assessments will be done for\n      determination of abiraterone and rifampicin concentrations. The follow up phase will be of\n      14 days. Safety evaluations for adverse events, clinical laboratory tests,\n      electrocardiogram, vital signs, and physical examinations will be monitored throughout the\n      study. The total study duration will be approximately 31 days."
