    <textblock>

      commonly used clinical approaches for best PEEP determination, with PEEP guided by the ARDS
      network algorithm.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The determination of optimal level of Positive End Expiratory Pressure (PEEP) in patients
      with acute hypoxemic respiratory pressure remains elusive and controversial.

      Several approaches with different algorithms exist. Among them, Low PEEP algorithm approach
      and High PEEP algorithm approach. These approaches are characterized by a generalized
      application of certain level of PEEP according to a predefined algorithm. However, these
      algorithms fail to account for inter-individual variations between patients with different
      diseases and with different severities of the same underlying process.    Therefore, we
      advocate for an individualized application of PEEP. Whereby, PEEP will be determined
      individually for each patient based on familiar and well established physiological
      parameters.

    <description>Set Positive End Expiratory Pressure (PEEP) at 25 cmH2O with fixed driving pressure that will result in delivery of a fixed Tidal Volume (TV) of 6ml/kg Ideal Body Weight (IBW). fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) is set to 60%.
Then decrease PEEP in steps of 4 cmH2O every 10 min until PEEP of 5 cm H2O is reached. In each step static compliance of respiratory system and lung compliance will be measured along with arterial blood gas (ABGs), and hemodynamic parameters such as cardiac output and mixed venous O2 saturation. Best or optimal PEEP will be defined as the PEEP below which PaO2 /FIO2 falls by at least 20%. If at least 20% Partial Oxygen tension (PaO2) PaO2 /FIO2 decrement is not obtained, then PEEP that will result in the highest PaO2 will be selected.</description>

    <description>In this group assessment begins with measuring intrinsic PEEP by an expiratory hold. Thereafter, plateau pressures will be recorded after a 0.5-sec inspiratory pause.
Applied PEEP will be increased by steps of 4 cm H2O, after each incremental step the patient will be observed for 10 minutes to allow for lung unit recruitment and equilibration. Plateau pressure will be measured after each incremental step of PEEP. Applied PEEP will be increased sequentially by 4 cm H2O increments until peak inspiratory pressure of 50 cm H2O, or plateau pressure of 40 cm H2O reached, or hypotension  or decrease of 20% in cardiac output is observed.</description>

    <description>Upon patient recruitment Esophageal balloon will be inserted and esophageal / pleural pressure will be measured. Thereafter, Inspiratory pressures and PEEP will be adjusted according to well established criteria. Inspiratory pressure and PEEP will be adjusted to achieve the best lung compliance possible while not exceeding transpulmonary end Inspiratory pressure of 25 to 30 cm H2O, and at the same time maintaining a positive transpulmonary end expiratory pressure of not more than 5 cm H2O.</description>
