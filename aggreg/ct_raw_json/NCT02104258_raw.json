            "textblock": "Background and rationale:\n\n      Acute hamstring muscle strain injuries represent the most prevalent non-contact muscle\n      injury reported in sports. Despite the high prevalence and a rapidly expanding body of\n      literature investigating hamstring muscle strain injuries, [1] occurrence and re-injury\n      rates have not improved over the last three decades [2]. Therefore, rehabilitation and\n      secondary prevention are of particular concern, and the primary objective of all\n      rehabilitation protocols is to return an athlete to pre-injury level as soon as possible\n      with a minimal risk of injury recurrence.There is still a lack of consensus and clinical\n      research regarding the effectiveness of various rehabilitation protocols for acute hamstring\n      injuries in athletes participating in sports with high sprinting demands [3,4]. To our\n      knowledge, there are no prospective, randomised trials investigating the effect of different\n      rehabilitation protocols in a Middle-Eastern athletic population. Eccentric strength\n      training has shown to reduce the risk of both new acute hamstring injuries as well as\n      re-injuries [5,6], whereas hamstring exercises being performed at longer muscle-tendon\n      length, preferentially mimicking movements occuring simultaneously at both the knee and hip\n      are reported to be more effective than a protocol containing conventional exercises [7], and\n      are suggested to be a key strategy in the management of hamstring injuries. However, the\n      preventive effect related to the eccentric training remains unclear and is still debated and\n      the optimal intensity of eccentric training in rehabilitation of acute hamstring strain\n      injuries and prevention of re-injuries is yet unknown [8].\n\n      The primary objective in this study is therefore to compare the effect of two rehabilitation\n      protocols after acute hamstring muscle strain injuries on the time to return to sports (RTS)\n      and the rate of re-injuries in male athletes in a prospective single-site randomized\n      controlled trial.\n\n      The investigators aim to include 90 male athletes with clinical signs and MRI abnormalities\n      consistent with an acute hamstring muscle strain injury. The injured athletes will be\n      randomised into one of two different rehabilitation protocols with unlike emphasis on\n      eccentric exercises."
