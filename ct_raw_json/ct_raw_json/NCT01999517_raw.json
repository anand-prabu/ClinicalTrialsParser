Iodinated contrast is\n      used during coronary angiography to see the coronary arteries. It has been shown that\n      exposure to this agent may cause kidney injury. CIN usually goes away on its own but in some\n      high risk patients it progresses into renal failure.\n\n      This research study offers a new possible option to prevent CIN. We propose that if\n      intravenous nitroglycerin is given before the procedure it may lower the chances of\n      developing contrast-induced nephropathy."
