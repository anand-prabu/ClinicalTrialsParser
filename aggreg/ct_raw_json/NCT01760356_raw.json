This will be able\n      to explain the variability of the response observed, and correlated with rejection episodes\n      or drug adverse effects.\n\n      As an approach to pharmacodynamic monitoring of calcineurin it has been proposed to measure\n      indirectly calcineurin activity in peripheral blood lymphocytes, through the measure of the\n      Nuclear Factor of activated T Cells nuclear translocation inhibition, the intracytosolic\n      expression of interleukin 2, and the expression of activation markers as CD25 in T\n      lymphocytes.\n\n      Once the biomarkers selected can be validated, it is expected to contribute to a better\n      understanding of the steps associated with lymphocyte activation and response resulting from\n      exposure of calcineurin, fine-tune the levels of these immunosuppressants, and alert in\n      prematurely about a possible episode of rejection and / or occurrence of side effects -\n      immediate or delayed - as a result of immunosuppressive therapy.\n\n      The study on healthy volunteers, would help to determine the baseline for these patients.\n\n      Tracking patients from inclusion on the transplant waiting list, will reveal the profile of\n      the patient prior to initiating chronic treatment and closely monitor the evolution of the\n      changes that occur at the molecular level, so as to warn clinicians on the basis of the\n      evidence, to act accordingly."

Each member, shall belong to them\n      once consented to participate in the study and has been found to meet the inclusion criteria\n      of the study.\n\n      Once the information stage was completed, and after obtaining signed informed consent, each\n      volunteer was evaluated to ensure that he meets all inclusion criteria and none of the\n      exclusion ones. From this instance proceed the sampling plan.\n\n      Considering potential dropouts or withdrawals during the study, the intention is to recruit\n      an additional 10% to compensate for the cohorts, as they allow.\n\n      The study design does not suppose applying masking methods, since it is an open study.\n\n      All data required in the registration forms will be recorded, however in case of persistent\n      failure, will be properly documented the reasons for the absence. Each instance will merit a\n      particular analysis, dated and signed.\n\n      Models will be used to estimate the impact of bias due to potential missing data, and if\n      applicable will be complemented with a sensibility analysis.SPSS and ACCESS are the proposed\n      softwares to carry out this type of analysis.\n\n      The loading of data will be conducted electronically. The data will be validated according\n      to the data management plan, jointly defined by the principal investigator and the\n      methodologist, in charge of the data managing and the statistics.

Continuous variables\n      will be expressed as mean and standard deviation or median and 25th and 75th percentiles,\n      minimum and maximum. Variables developed over time will be presented by Kaplan-Meier curves.\n\n      The variables will be compared between groups according to the patient's original listing\n      (intention to treat). They will be calculated and presented the estimated relative risks and\n      their effect with 95% confidence intervals.\n\n      For comparison of categorical variables, it will be used the Chi-square test or Fisher's\n      exact test as appropriate.\n\n      For comparison of continuous variables, it will be used the test \"t\" of Student.\n\n      For variables that develop with time, they will be represented by Kaplan-Meier curves and\n      compared using the \"log-rank\" test. Their relative risk with 95% confidence interval will be\n      calculated.\n\n      To identify variables associated with different responses multivariate linear analysis,\n      logistic or Cox proportional will be used.\n\n      All analyzes will be performed with hypothesis testing and a 2-tailed significance level of\n      5%.\n\n      The program used will be R.\n\n      We have established standard operating procedures to describe blood collection instances,\n      biological fluids sampling circuit, evaluation of the candidates to include in the study,\n      verification of the inclusion criteria, monitoring of patients during the study, record of\n      undesirable events and report of adverse drug reactions, terminating tracking."
