The absent\n      saliva can cause increase of dental caries and decays.\n\n      Until now, there is no effective treatment that  increases the amount of saliva and the\n      patients  have low improvements with cholinergic drugs such as pilocarpine and cevimeline.\n      These drugs can cause unpleasant collateral effects."
