  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will compare treatment with DermACELL to conventional care in diabetic foot ulcers
      (DFU) and venous stasis ulcers (VSU).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to demonstrate the effectiveness of DermACELL in the treatment of
      chronic wounds of the lower extremities.  DermACELL will be compared to conventional care in
      both subjects with diabetic foot ulcers (DFU) and subjects with venous stasis ulcers (VSU).
      In addition, DermACELL will be compared to an active comparator, GraftJacket, in subjects
      with diabetic foot ulcers.

      DermACELL and GraftJacket are both made from donated human skin (dermis).  These products
      have been processed so that cells are removed and bacteria and viruses are destroyed.  This
      processing provided a supporting structure, an acellular dermal matrix, into which cells can
      migrate and divide during the wound healing process.

    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The primary outcome is the comparison of the proportion of chronic wounds treated with DermACELL and treated with conventional care that have achieved 100% re-epithelialization without dressing or drainage requirements at 12 weeks.  Wound closure is defined as first observation of 100% re-epithelialization without drainage or dressing requirements and complete wound closure is defined as 100% re-epithelialization without dressing or drainage requirements confirmed at two consecutive study visits 2 weeks apart.</description>

    <measure>Proportion of wounds closed at 12 weeks and weekly thereafter for up to 24 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The proportion of subjects with closed wounds at 12 weeks and weekly thereafter will be compared in subjects treated with DermACELL, GraftJacket (Diabetic foot ulcer subjects only) and conventional care wound management.  A comparison of the proportion of subjects who received a second application of acellular dermal matrix will be made between the DermACELL and GraftJacket arms in those subjects with diabetic foot ulcers.</description>
