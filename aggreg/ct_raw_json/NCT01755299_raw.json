The definitive efficacy and potency of the\n      products is unknown due to the lack of evidence-based clinical reports. It is suspected that\n      the efficacy related to these products is due to the caffeine content, which was reported as\n      138 mg per 2-ounce bottle in an online caffeine content chart. The purpose of this\n      randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, four way crossover study is to evaluate the\n      efficacy of \"5-hour Energy\"\u00ae, \"5-Hour Energy Decaf\"\u00ae, caffeine, and placebo for perceived\n      energy and wakefulness."
