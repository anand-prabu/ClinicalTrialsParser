    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, randomized, double-blinded trial involving adult patients
      diagnosed with Myofascial Pain Syndromes (MPS). The purpose of this research study is to
      compare if there is a therapeutic difference between trigger point injections of normal
      saline and conventional drug mix (local anesthesic + steroid) in treating MPS. In
      particular, we will find out about the pain level and duration before and after injection.

      This study is a prospective, randomized, double-blinded trial involving adult patients
      diagnosed with Myofascial Pain Syndromes (MPS). The purpose of this research study is to
      compare if there is a therapeutic difference between trigger point injections of normal
      saline and conventional drug mix (lidocaine+ triamcinolone acetonide) in treating MPS. In
      particular, we will find out about the pain level and duration before and after injection.
      Enrolled patients will be randomly assigned to receive trigger point injection that contains
      either saline (arm one) or conventional drug mix (arm two) to treat their muscle pain. Upon
      discharge, patients will receive instructions for regular active muscle stretching as a plan
      to restore their muscle functions. Patients will be asked about their pain level before and
      after treatment. In addition, patients will be followed up two weeks after treatment to find
      out about their pain status and treatment satisfaction. Currently, there is no standard
      protocol or studies in the emergency department for treating patients with MPS. The results
      from this study can potentially improve pain management in the emergency department.
