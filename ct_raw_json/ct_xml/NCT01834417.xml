  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Analysis of stored seat-pressures in SCI patients during a 4-week use of an on-board device.
      During this period, patients write in an agenda noteworthy events that could occur while
      they're using their wheelchair. A control is done every week and the device can be changed
      until it is returned at the end of the study period.

      -  inclusion visit : recovery of the signed  informed-consent form, clinical examination,
           skin control, seat-pressures control, device 9-position control, delivery of the agenda
           for noteworthy events

        -  3 follow-up visits : noteworthy events check, skin control, cushioncloth control,
           device 9-position control

        -  return visit : device return, agenda return, skin control, seat-pressures control
