Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of irinotecan administered in\n      combination with paclitaxel in patients with metastatic or recurrent malignancies. II.\n      Evaluate the toxicity and safety of this combination regimen in this patient population.\n      III. Determine the pharmacokinetic profile of irinotecan in combination with paclitaxel on a\n      weekly schedule and if the sequence of administration influences irinotecan pharmacokinetics\n      in these patients. IV. Determine pharmacodynamic models of irinotecan and its SN-38 and\n      SN-38G metabolites when administered in this weekly combination schedule.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of irinotecan. Patients receive irinotecan IV\n      concurrently with paclitaxel IV weekly. Patients demonstrating stable disease or partial or\n      complete clinical response continue with treatment as long as dose limiting toxicities are\n      not observed and adequate performance status is maintained. Cohorts of 3 patients receive\n      escalating doses of irinotecan until the maximum tolerated dose is determined or 150 mg/m2\n      is reached.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 36 patients will be accrued for this study."
