  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be an open-label, single agent, multi-institutional phase Ib/II study of ACY-1215
      for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory lymphoid malignancies.  The target
      population will include patients with histologically confirmed relapsed or refractory
      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or Hodgkin's lymphoma, with an expansion cohort of patients with
      mantle cell lymphoma.

      The phase Ib will be conducted to determine the safety and tolerability of two dosing
      schedules of ACY-1215 monotherapy in patients with lymphoid malignancies.  Patients will be
      accrued simultaneously to two dose cohorts (Arm A and Arm B) of ACY1215.  Selection into
      each cohort will occur by alternation.  All patients will take the prescribed dose of
      ACY1215 orally for 28 consecutive days.  Patients enrolled into Arm A will take ACY1215 160
      mg daily (QD), whereas patients enrolled into Arm B will take ACY1215 160 mg twice daily
      (BID). ACY-1215 will be supplied as a liquid for oral administration (PO).  Each dose will
      be administered at least 1 hour after ingestion of food followed by at least 4 ounces of
      water.  Patients will be instructed not to ingest food or other oral medication for at least
      2 hours after each ACY-1215 dose. Frequency in phase II will be determined based on Phase Ib
      results.
