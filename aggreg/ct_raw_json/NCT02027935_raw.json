Researchers also want to learn\n      if this combination can help to control metastatic melanoma.\n\n      CD8+T cells are a type of white blood cell.  Researchers grow the T cells in the laboratory,\n      and they are designed to find melanoma cancer cells and may kill them.\n\n      Ipilimumab and aldesleukin are designed to increase the immune system's ability to fight\n      cancer.\n\n      Cyclophosphamide will be used at a very low dose to weaken the body's natural defense\n      against the T-cell transplant, so that the transplanted T-cells have a chance to grow and\n      multiply."

If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will be given standard drugs to help\n      decrease the risk of side effects.  You may ask the study staff for information about how\n      the drug is given and its risks.\n\n      On Day 0, you will receive the CD8+ T cells by vein over about 30-60 minutes.  You will stay\n      in the hospital overnight after the dose.\n\n      Starting within 6 hours after the CD8+T cell infusion and then 2 times a day after that for\n      14 days, you will give aldesleukin as an injection into your skin around your abdomen.  You\n      will be taught how to give yourself these injections.\n\n      On Days 1, 22, 43, and 64, you will receive ipilimumab by vein over about 90 minutes.\n\n      Study Visits:\n\n      Within 2-4 weeks before you receive the CD8+ T cells:\n\n        -  You will have a physical exam.\n\n        -  Blood (about 5\u00bd tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, immune system tests, and\n           tests on how long the T-cells survive in your body.\n\n        -  You will have a computed tomography (CT) scan or x-rays to check the status of the\n           disease.\n\n      On Day -2:\n\n        -  You will have a physical exam.\n\n        -  Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests.  This routine blood draw\n           will include a pregnancy test if you can become pregnant.  To continue your\n           participation in this study, you cannot be pregnant.\n\n      On Days 0, 7, 14, 22, 28, 35, 43, 49, 56, 64, 70, 77, 84, 112, and 140:\n\n        -  You will have a physical exam.\n\n        -  Blood (about 5\u00bd tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, immune system tests, and\n           tests on how long the T-cells survive in your body.\n\n        -  Between Day 35 and 42 and again between Day 77 and 84, you will have a CT scan or\n           x-rays to check the status of the disease.\n\n      On Day 3, blood (about 5\u00bd tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, immune system tests,\n      and tests on how long the T-cells survive in your body.\n\n      If the doctor thinks it is needed to confirm the status of the disease, blood (about 1\u00bd\n      tablespoons) will be drawn every 3-6 months for up to 3 years.\n\n      The study tests may be repeated or you may have additional tests performed anytime the\n      doctor thinks it is needed.\n\n      Some of the study tests may be done at your local clinic if you cannot return to MD\n      Anderson.  The study staff will discuss this with you.\n\n      Length of Treatment:\n\n      The treatment portion of the study will last until Day 64.  You will no longer be able to\n      take the study drugs if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you\n      are unable to follow study directions.\n\n      Your participation on the study will be over after the follow-up.\n\n      End-of-Study Visit:\n\n      At Day 168:\n\n        -  You will have a physical exam.\n\n        -  Blood (about 5\u00bd tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, immune system tests, and\n           tests on how long the T-cells survive in your body.\n\n      Follow-Up:\n\n      Every 3 months after Day 84, unless the disease gets worse or you start another cancer\n      therapy, you will have a CT scan or x-rays to check the status of the disease.  Every 3\n      months for up to 5 years, the study staff will call you or ask your doctor how you are\n      doing.  If you are called, the calls should last about 10-15 minutes.\n\n      If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will return to the clinic every 4-6 weeks or as often\n      as the doctor thinks is needed.  Blood (about 5\u00bd tablespoons) will be drawn for routine\n      tests, immune system tests, and tests on how long the T-cells survive in your body.\n\n      This is an investigational study.  CD8+T cells are not FDA approved or commercially\n      available.  They are currently being used for research purposes only. Cyclophosphamide,\n      ipilimumab, and aldesleukin are FDA approved and commercially available for the way they are\n      being used in this study.\n\n      Up to 30 participants will be enrolled in this multicenter study.  Up to 20 will take part\n      at MD Anderson."
