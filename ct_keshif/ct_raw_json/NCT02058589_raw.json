 Subject who has received an ABO compatible allogeneic renal transplant.\n\n          -  Subject receiving maintenance immunosuppressive therapy for the prevention of\n             allograft rejection for a minimum of one month (30 days) prior to the first\n             vaccination.\n\n          -  Subject without an episode of allograft rejection over the previous three months (90\n             days) prior to the first vaccination.\n\n          -  Subject with stable renal function (less than 20% variability between last two\n             creatinine measurements or GFR calculated).\n\n          -  Subject not less than 4 months (120 days) and not more than 18 months (540 days)\n             after allograft transplantation at the time of the first vaccination.\n\n          -  Subjects with multiple dialysis options (peritoneal and/or more than one anatomical\n             access site for haemodialysis) in the event acute or chronic dialysis is needed.\n\n          -  Female subjects of non-childbearing potential may be enrolled in the study.\n\n          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential may be enrolled in the study, if the\n             subject:\n\n               -  has practiced adequate contraception for 30 days prior to vaccination, and\n\n               -  has a negative pregnancy test on the day of the first vaccination, and\n\n               -  has agreed to continue adequate contraception during the primary treatment\n                  period and for 2 months after completion of the vaccination series.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  Any primary kidney disease with a high incidence of recurrent primary kidney disease.\n\n          -  Evidence of recurrent primary kidney disease within the current allograft.\n\n          -  Previous allograft loss secondary to recurrent primary kidney disease.\n\n               -  Multiple kidney transplants are allowed if the reason for a previous allograft's\n                  loss is not recurrent primary kidney disease.\n\n          -  More than one organ transplanted (i.e. kidney-liver or kidney-other organ(s)\n             transplanted).\n\n          -  History of events that, in the opinion of the investigator, may put subject at\n             increased risk for chronic allograft dysfunction (e.g. delayed graft function,\n             peri-operative complications).\n\n          -  Histologic reports of chronic allograft injury (e.g. transplant glomerulopathy,\n             arteriopathy, C4d deposition).\n\n          -  Evidence of significant proteinuria in the opinion of the investigator.\n\n          -  Unknown panel reactive antibody score (PRA or cPRA) at the time of transplant.\n\n          -  Any autoimmune or potential immune-mediated disease including primary kidney disease.\n\n          -  Use of anti-CD20 or other B-cell monoclonal antibody agents (e.g., rituximab) as\n             induction and/or maintenance immunosuppressive therapy for the prevention of\n             allograft rejection.\n\n          -  Use of any investigational or non-registered product other than the study vaccine\n             within 30 days preceding the first dose of study vaccine/placebo, or planned use\n             during the study period.\n\n          -  Concurrent or planned participation in another clinical study, at any time during the\n             study period, which has exposed or will expose the subject to an investigational or a\n             non-registered product\n\n          -  Administration or planned administration of a live vaccine within 30 days prior to\n             the first dose of study vaccine and ending 30 days after the last dose of study\n             vaccine, or, administration or planned administration of a non-replicating vaccine\n             within 8 days prior to or within 14 days after either dose of study vaccine.\n\n          -  Planned administration during the study of a varicella or HZ vaccine other than the\n             study vaccine.\n\n          -  Previous vaccination against HZ or varicella within the 12 months preceding the first\n             dose of study vaccine/placebo.\n\n          -  Occurrence of varicella or HZ per clinical history, within the 12 months preceding\n             the first dose of study vaccine/placebo.\n\n          -  Failure to fully complete the 7-day pre-vaccination diary card distributed at the\n             Pre-vaccination visit.\n\n          -  Evidence or high suspicion, in the opinion of the investigator, of noncompliance or\n             nonadherence to use of induction and/or maintenance immunosuppressive therapies.\n\n          -  Any confirmed or suspected HIV, primary immunodeficiency disease, disseminated or\n             untreated malignancy, or systemic infection.\n\n          -  History of any reaction or hypersensitivity likely to be exacerbated by any component\n             of the vaccine or study material and equipment.\n\n          -  Any condition which, in the judgment of the investigator, would make intramuscular\n             injection unsafe.\n\n          -  Any other condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, might interfere with\n             the evaluations required by the study.\n\n          -  Acute disease and/or fever at the time of vaccination.\n\n               -  Fever is defined as temperature \u2265 37.5\u00b0C /99.5\u00b0F by oral route. The preferred\n                  route for recording temperature in this study will be oral.\n\n               -  Subjects with a minor illness (such as mild diarrhoea, mild upper respiratory\n                  infection) without fever may be enrolled at the discretion of the investigator.\n\n          -  Pregnant or lactating female.\n\n          -  Female planning to become pregnant or planning to discontinue contraceptive\n             precautions (if of childbearing potential) before Month 3."
