Fasting blood and urine samples\n      will be collected, together with standard biomeasures and information about medical history\n      and prescribing history.  Participants in Responders Arm will be contacted by telephone\n      approximately 3 months after starting their new second/third-line agent to review their\n      current medication and blood glucose level.  If a 3 month HbA1c has not been collected as\n      part of routine clinical care, the research team will arrange this.  Participants will be\n      asked to return for a blood and urine test approximately 6 months after their new treatment\n      was started.  This visit will be brought forward should the participant advise they are\n      about to further change their treatment, to enable their samples to be collected in advance\n      of their proposed treatment change.\n\n      All study documentation and sample materials will be distributed to sites from the\n      Coordinating Centre.  Sites will be expected to process and freeze samples and send them to\n      the Chief Investigator's Central Laboratory where they will be analysed for genetic factors,\n      glycaemic markers and other markers related to drug response.\n\n      POST-PILOT Phase (Jan 2015 - Oct 2017) Subject to feasibility, interim analysis and\n      continuation of funding from Medical Research Council (MRC), this study will continue for\n      another 3 years."
