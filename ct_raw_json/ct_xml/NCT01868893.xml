      This is a multicenter, open-label, single-arm, expanded access treatment study designed to
      provide obinutuzumab to patients with previously untreated CLL in combination with
      chlorambucil and to evaluate the safety and efficacy of obinutuzumab administered in
      combination with chlorambucil. This study will enroll patients with previously untreated
      CD20-positive CLL requiring treatment according to the IWCLL guidelines (Hallek et al 2008),
      as assessed by the investigator.

             other infection (excluding fungal infections of nail beds) or any major episode of
             infection requiring treatment with IV antibiotics or hospitalization (related to the
             completion of the course of antibiotics) within 4 weeks before the start of Cycle 1

          -  Major surgery (within 4 weeks prior to the start of Cycle 1), other than for
