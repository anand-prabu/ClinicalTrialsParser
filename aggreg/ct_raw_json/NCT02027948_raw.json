Eligible patients must be age \u2265 65 years old. While all patients with esophageal cancer may benefit from this intervention, we wish to target the most vulnerable population (older patients who are at highest risk of malnutrition) in this pilot study."

The questions will allow them to assess the nutritional status and make appropriate\n      referrals. If the patients are having swallowing problems or losing weight, the researchers\n      want to address the nutritional problems early in the course of their treatment."

The initial assessment will be measurements of height, weight, & baseline weight loss. Patients will receive chemotherapy & radiation as per standard practice at MSKCC, which is induction chemotherapy for approximately 3 weeks, followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy. A commonly used regimen is weekly carboplatin (AUC 2) with paclitaxel (50 mg/m2) & radiation consisting of 5040 cGy over 28 fractions. Patients in this study will undergo assessments at three time points (at baseline, after induction chemotherapy, & post-treatment.) At baseline, all patients will complete the functional assessment, dysphagia scale, & Mini- Nutritional Assessment (MNA).  According to the  baseline MNA score, patients will be categorized as \"normal nutrition,\" \"at risk for malnutrition,\" or \"malnourished\" & receive the appropriate intervention.",
