    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and tolerability of an herbal
      de-pigmenting regimen applied to one side of the face compared with hydroquinone applied to
      the other side of the face in treating mottled hyperpigmentation and melasma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This clinical study is being conducted in order to evaluate the effectiveness and
      tolerability of a de-pigmenting regimen when used by subjects with mild to severe mottled
      hyperpigmentation and melasma. Efficacy will be assessed using visual grading, device
      measurements and digital photography. Tolerance and safety will be evaluated by grading for
      objective and subjective signs of irritation, and the incidence and severity of adverse
      events. Efficacy and tolerance of this product are compared to that of Hydroquinone, which
      is applied to one side of the subject's face while the herbal de-pigmenting regimen is
      applied to the other side of the face.

      The two product pigmentation reducing herbal regimen is based on the novel concept of
      inhibiting all 14 major and the 3 branch steps in the melanin cascade.
