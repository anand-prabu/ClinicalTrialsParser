These effects\n      may improve the rates of complete aneurysm occlusion and enhance the durability of the\n      coiling treatment. The eCLIPs\u2122 device manufactured by Evasc Medical Systems Corp. has a high\n      density 'leaf' which is implanted across the bifurcation aneurysm neck and anchored in one\n      of the branch arteries of the bifurcation and may provide improved bifurcation aneurysm\n      treatment by allowing for a higher packing density of embolic coils implanted behind the\n      eCLIPs\u2122 device and the eCLIPs\u2122 device in combination with embolic coils may reduce the\n      recurrence/retreatment rate by increasing the rate of complete aneurysm occlusion."
