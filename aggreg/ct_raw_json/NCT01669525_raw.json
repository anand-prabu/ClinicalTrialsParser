Placental\n      dysfunction is believed to be a driving factor in a variety of adverse obstetric outcomes,\n      including fetal growth restriction and preeclampsia. Advances in 3D ultrasound have allowed\n      for measurement of placental volumes during pregnancy. It may be that quantitative\n      assessment of early placental growth can help identify pregnancies at risk for adverse\n      outcome. Furthermore, various novel serum analytes have been proposed as predictors of\n      adverse outcome. The investigators seek to prospectively measure placental volume and\n      diameter at 11-14 weeks and 18-24 weeks to determine if placental growth can predict adverse\n      outcome. In addition, the investigators seek to investigate the relationship between\n      placental growth and serum levels of various biomarkers to see if improved detection of\n      adverse outcome can be achieved."
