Arm II:  Patients receive\n      a tapering regimen of prednisone tablets administered every other day for 2 years in the\n      absence of unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Arm III:  Patients receive fish oil capsules daily for 2 years. Patients may also receive\n      enalapril for hypertension. Patients are followed every 3 months for 3 years after\n      treatment."
