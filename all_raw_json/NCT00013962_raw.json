            "textblock": "The Williams syndrome is a disease in which supravalvular aortic stenosis, an elfin facies,\n      mental retardation and other congenital defects are sometimes associated with abnormal\n      vitamin D and calcium metabolism.  Whereas some patients have been reported to show\n      increased sensitivity to vitamin D or an exaggerated response of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D\n      {25(OH)D} to administration of vitamin D and to have hypercalcemia caused by increased\n      circulating 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D{1,25(OH)2D} in infancy and early childhood, most\n      patients have normal calcium metabolism and normal values for circulating 25(OH)D and\n      1,25(OH)2D.  We propose to carry out further studies of vitamin D metabolism to elucidate\n      the mechanism(s) for abnormal vitamin D metabolism.  We will determine the response of serum\n      1,25(OH)2D to administration of 1,25(OH)2D3.  Measurement of the 1,25(OH)2D in the patients\n      compared to normal subjects will be the primary outcome."
