      The purpose of this study is to identify and screen potential subjects for preliminary
      eligibility to participate in a malaria related clinical trial conducted at the Malaria
      Clinical Trials Center (MCTC) or one of our partnering sites.

    <textblock>
      This is a continuous study enrolling approximately 350 participants per year to establish
      preliminary eligibility for participation in ongoing or future Malaria Clinical Trials
      Center (MCTC) clinical research studies.  Data collected may be used to support preliminary
      eligibility for a current or future MCTC clinical research study.

      In order to maximize efficiency of the screening process potential participants who contact
      the site will be pre-screened using an IRB-approved screening form.

      Potential participants who contact the site may be asked to come in for an in-person
      screening visit. They will be given a consent form to read and sign if they should choose to
      participate in the screening process. If they have any questions during this process
      research staff will be available. This visit includes an in-depth medical history review,
      travel history, physical exam, blood draw, electrocardiogram test (ECG), and a urine test.

      The MCTC at Seattle Biomedical Research Institute (Seattle BioMed) is an innovative
      translational research center uniquely focused on bringing new malaria solutions to the
      world. The MCTC is one of only four centers in the world capable of testing malaria vaccine
      or drug candidates in human clinical trials by the well-established malaria human challenge
      model. In this type of study volunteers are given a test vaccine or drug and then
      &quot;challenged&quot; to see if a person gets malaria by the bite of infected mosquitoes.  This is
      the most reliable way to see if a possible vaccine or drug is working.  If you get malaria,
      you will be treated and cured with common FDA-approved drugs effective against malaria.
      Studies like this have been safely conducted at other sites in the U.S. for the last 20
      years.
