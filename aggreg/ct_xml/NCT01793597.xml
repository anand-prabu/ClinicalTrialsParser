  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients who have a heart attack are regularly treated with either clopidogrel or
      ticagrelor.  In a large clinical trial, treatment with ticagrelor before coronary bypass
      surgery (CABG) was associated with a lower risk of death than treatment with clopidogrel.
      The reason for this difference cannot be explained on the basis of the study.  One possible
      explanation is that the reversible binding of ticagrelor is advantageous because when new
      platelets are released, they are inhibited by the drug.  Because clopidogrel binds
      irreversibly it cannot redistribute.  The investigators will recruit patients who are
      scheduled for surgery after an acute coronary syndrome who have been treated with either
      ticagrelor or clopidogrel.  After the patient provides informed consent, the investigators
      will review their medical record,record information and on the day after surgery the
      investigators will take one sample of blood.  That blood will be analyzed for evidence of
      platelet activation (platelet microparticles, and platelet-leukocyte aggregates), the
      reactivity of young platelets, and the concentration of inflammatory cytokines.  The
      investigators hypothesize that the evidence of platelet activation (platelet microparticles
      and platelet-leukocyte aggregates) and the reactivity of young platelets will be less in
      patients who have been treated previously with ticagrelor.
