      A subject was treated under compassionate use provisions under this study with facilitating
      cell therapy (FCRx) product manufactured using the CliniMACS (Miltenyi Biotec) device,
      rather than the Max Sep (Baxter) device.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients must have a confirmed diagnosis of inherited metabolic disorder / inborn
             error of metabolism. Diagnosis should be confirmed by appropriate test(s) (enzyme
             and/or mutation analysis) before study entry. Patients must not be eligible for
             myeloablative chemotherapy as a preparative regimen for transplant due to age,
             co-morbidities or organ dysfunction.

             Inborn errors of metabolism / Inherited Metabolic Disorders (IMD) eligible for this
             Compassionate Use Provision include Metachromatic Leukodystrophy (MLD)

          2. Patients must be ≥ 3 years of age

          3. Patients must have Lansky or Karnofsky performance status ≥40

          4. Patients must have adequate function of other organ systems as measured by:

               -  Creatinine &lt; 2.0 mg/dl and creatinine clearance ≥60 cc/min/1.73m2.  Newborns
                  must have a creatinine clearance &gt; 25 cc/min.  For babies &lt; 3 months of age, the
                  raw value on glomerular filtration rate (GFR) must be &gt; 1 cc/kg/min.

               -  Hepatic transaminases (ALT/AST) ≤4 x normal, bilirubin &lt;2.0mg/dl

               -  Normal cardiac function by echocardiogram or radionuclide scan (ejection
                  fraction or shortening fraction &gt;80% of normal value for age)

               -  Pulmonary function tests demonstrating forced expiratory volume at one second
                  (FEV1) of &gt;50% of predicted for age.  If child is too young for pulmonary
                  function tests (PFTs), crying vital capacity result of &gt;50% of normal value for
                  age or resting pulse oximeter &gt;85% on room air or clearance by pulmonologist
                  will be required.

          5. Patient must have a related donor [identical or mismatched for 1, 2 or 3
             histocompatibility leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A, -B or -DR loci].

          6. Patient, and parent, or legal guardian must have given written informed consent
             according to FDA guidelines.

          7. Patients must have a minimum life expectancy of at least 6 months.

          8. Female patients of childbearing potential cannot be pregnant or
             lactating/breast-feeding and must be either surgically sterile, postmenopausal (no
             menses for the previous 12 months), or must be practicing an effective method of
             birth control as determined by the investigator (e.g., oral contraceptives, double
             barrier methods, hormonal injectable or implanted contraceptives, tubal ligation, or
             partner with vasectomy).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with uncontrolled seizures, apnea, evidence of recurrent or uncontrolled
             aspiration, or need for chronic mechanical ventilation.

          -  Patients with allogeneic stem cell transplant with cytoreductive therapy in the past
             6 months.

          -  Subjects must not have had previous radiation therapy that would preclude total body
             irradiation (TBI) (as determined by radiation therapist)

          -  Uncontrolled infection or severe concomitant diseases, which in the judgment of the
             Principal Investigator, could not tolerate reduced intensity transplantation.

          -  Severe impairment of functional performance as evidenced by a Karnofsky (patients &gt;16
             years old) or Lansky (children &lt;16 years old) score &lt;40%

          -  Subjects with a positive human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody test result

          -  Subjects who are pregnant, as indicated by a positive serum human chorionic
             gonadotropin (HCG) test

          -  Subjects whose only donor is pregnant at the time of intended transplant

          -  Subjects of childbearing potential who are not practicing adequate contraception as
             defined by the investigator at the site

          -  Jehovah's witness

          -  Patients that have any comorbid condition which, in the view of the Principal
             Investigators, renders the patient at too high a risk from treatment complications
             and regimen related morbidity/mortality.

          -  Lack of related donors
