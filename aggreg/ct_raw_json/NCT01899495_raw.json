            "textblock": "Previous studies have demonstrated that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the\n      sodium-bicarbonate co-transporter gene (SLC4A5) are associated with hypertension. We tested\n      the hypothesis that SNPs in SLC4A5 are associated with salt sensitivity of blood pressure in\n      185 whites consuming an isocaloric constant diet with a randomized order of 7 days of low\n      sodium (Na+) and 7 days of high Na+ intake. Salt sensitivity was defined as a \u22657-mm Hg\n      increase in mean arterial pressure during a randomized transition between low and high Na+\n      diet.\n\n      A total of 35 polymorphisms in 17 candidate genes were assayed, 25 of which were tested for\n      association. Association analyses with salt sensitivity revealed 3 variants that associated\n      with salt sensitivity. Of these, 2 SNPs in SLC4A5 (rs7571842 and rs10177833) demonstrated\n      highly significant results and large effects sizes, using logistic regression. These 2 SNPs\n      had P values of 1.0\u00d710\u22124 and 3.1\u00d710\u22124 with odds ratios of 0.221 and 0.221 in unadjusted\n      regression models, respectively, with the G allele at both sites conferring protection.\n      These SNPs remained significant after adjusting for body mass index and age (P=8.9\u00d710\u22125 and\n      2.6\u00d710\u22124 and odds ratios 0.210 and 0.286, respectively). Furthermore, the association of\n      these SNPs with salt sensitivity was replicated in a second hypertensive population.\n      Meta-analysis demonstrated significant associations of both SNPs with salt sensitivity\n      (rs7571842 [P=1.2\u00d710\u22125]; rs1017783 [P=1.1\u00d710\u22124]).\n\n      In conclusion, SLC4A5 variants are strongly associated with salt sensitivity of blood\n      pressure in 2 separate white populations."
