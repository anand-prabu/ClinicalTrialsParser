Evaluate time-to-progression,\n      survival, and toxic effects associated with irinotecan given weekly for 4 weeks every 6\n      weeks in this patient population.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients receive a 90 minute continuous infusion of irinotecan on days 1, 8, 15,\n      and 22 for 4 weeks, followed by a 2 week rest period. Courses of treatment are repeated\n      every 42 days. Patients continue treatment in the absence of disease progression or\n      unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, then every 6 months\n      for the next 4 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 22-40 patients will be accrued for this study over 2-4\n      years."
