  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neurobehavioral function and quality of life are compromised in many patients with
      mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) disorders.  The long-term goals of this research are to: 1) more
      accurately inform patients/parents regarding potential neurobehavioral outcomes; 2) develop
      sensitive measures of disease progression and central nervous system (CNS) treatment
      outcome; and 3) help clinical researchers develop direct treatments for specific brain
      structures/functions. The investigators hypothesize that specific and localized neuroimaging
      and neuropsychological findings and their relationship will be distinct for each MPS
      disorder.  It is further hypothesized that without treatment, functions will decline and
      structure will change over time in a predictable fashion, and will be related to locus of
      abnormality and stage of disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS diseases) are lysosomal disorders (inborn errors of
      metabolism) that progressively affect most organ systems in the body, usually beginning in
      childhood.  Recent treatment advances have produced amelioration of some of these
      malfunctions, but notably brain and bone have been difficult to effectively treat.  This
      research addresses the brain abnormalities in the MPS disorders, about which little is
      known.

      The objectives of this research are:

        1. to identify abnormalities of central nervous system (CNS) structure and function as
           well as to measure quality-of-life (QOL) in both treated and untreated MPS patients
           over time. The investigators will accomplish this through longitudinal studies of
           enrolled patients in designated centers in North America.

        2. to develop quantitative measurements of change, including direct measurement of
           neuropsychological function; surrogate MRI markers; and biomarkers to measure stage of
           disease and treatment outcomes.

        3. to examine the degree to which independent variables have an impact on both functional
           and structural outcome.  Independent variables may include, but are not limited to: age
           at first treatment, severity of disease, types of medical abnormalities, nature of
           genetic mutation, medical events, and sensory abnormalities.

        4. to examine how treatments such as Enzyme Replacement Therapy (ERT), Hematopoietic Cell
           Transplant (HCT), substrate reduction, and other palliative and rehabilitative
           therapies differentially affect CNS structure and function, as well as the subject's
           quality of life.
