It focuses on improving the speed and accuracy with which users identify and locate visual information using a divided attention format.  Over time, the difficulty and complexity of each task is systematically increased as users attain specified performance criteria.  Difficulty is increased by reducing visual stimuli duration, adding visual distracters, increasing similarity between target and distracter stimuli, and presenting visual targets over a broader spatial expanse."

Boatload of Crosswords was chosen for this study because it is computerized, it is very popular and easy to use, and many older adults enjoy doing crossword puzzles.  Boatload of Crosswords, however, does not improve speed of processing because it does not focus on central discrimination and peripheral target location.  Indeed, Boatload of Crosswords is not designed to train on any aspect of cognitive ability associated with visual speed of processing."

The investigators hypothesize that similar benefits will accrue to residents\n      in AL settings.\n\n      To evaluate this the investigators will use a two-arm, parallel, randomized controlled trial\n      (RCT) comparing Road Tour training to attention control using computerized crossword puzzles\n      among 300 adults 55 years old or older who reside in 15-30 AL settings that are partnering\n      with the investigators.\n\n      The investigators hypothesize that Road Tour participants will have improved cognitive\n      processing speed, lower levels of depressive symptoms, lower likelihood of the onset of\n      clinical depression, less anxiety, lower levels of pain symptoms, and better health-related\n      quality of life.  These outcomes will be assessed at baseline, post-training, six months,\n      and one year."

            "textblock": "Late-life depression is a large, escalating public health problem that often interacts with\n      other health conditions and leads to spiraling disability that simultaneously threatens\n      independence and health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and increases health care costs.\n      Depression affects 24% of older adults in AL settings, but rates of recognition and\n      treatment are low and underscore the need for alternative depression prevention and\n      treatment methods in AL.  A novel and promising intervention is a computerized cognitive\n      training program known as Road Tour, which has shown serendipitous benefits for reducing\n      depression symptoms and the onset of suspected clinical depression consistent with Beck's\n      model of cognitive depression.  As a self-directed, user-friendly \"game\", Road Tour\n      overcomes common attitudinal and resource-related barriers that impede treatment in AL\n      settings, and holds considerable promise for interrupting the potential downward spiral of\n      depression-related disability for 1 million AL elders.\n\n      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of Road Tour on processing speed,\n      depressive symptoms and suspected clinical depression, and depression-related comorbidities\n      among AL residents in Iowa.  The investigators will use a two-arm, parallel, RCT comparing\n      Road Tour training to attention control using computerized crossword puzzles among 300\n      adults 55 years old or older.  The investigators will actively engage 15-30 AL settings and\n      their associated facilities as study partners who implement the training at their sites and\n      assist with the evaluation process.  The investigators will help each AL setting develop\n      AL-specific recruitment and enrollment protocols, educate AL staff about the study, and\n      oversee computerized training by participating residents, as well as their family members\n      and AL staff.\n\n      The investigators' three specific aims are to:  (1) establish the effect of Road Tour on\n      improving cognitive processing speed in AL; (2) evaluate the effect of Road Tour on reducing\n      depressive symptoms and the risk of onset of suspected clinical depression in AL; and, (3)\n      evaluate the effect of Road Tour on the depression-related health outcomes of anxiety, pain,\n      and HRQoL in AL.\n\n      Participants will receive 10 hours of computerized training over 5-6 weeks, and 4 hours of\n      booster training at months 5 and 11, for a total of 18 hours of training. Outcomes are\n      changes in the Useful Field of View (UFOV) test for speed of processing (Aim 1), changes in\n      the 12-item Centers for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale (CESD-12) and the 9-item\n      Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) for depressive symptoms and suspected clinical\n      depression (Aim 2), and changes in the Short Form 36-item Health-Related Quality of Life\n      (HRQoL) Questionnaire (SF-36) for HRQoL, the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) for pain, and 7-item\n      Generalized Anxiety Disorder questionnaire (GAD-7) for anxiety (Aim 3).  Data will be\n      collected using telephone interviews at baseline, post-training (6-8 weeks), and at 26-weeks\n      and 52-weeks. Linear mixed effect models that adjust for the clustering within AL settings\n      will be used with main effects specified for treatment group and time, as well as their\n      two-way interaction.  This study is the first step in evaluating depression-related outcomes\n      of using Road Tour in AL settings."
