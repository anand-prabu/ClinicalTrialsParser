      This clinical trial is a dose block-randomized, double-blinded, placebo controlled, single
      ascending dose, food interaction study. AEs, PE, Vital signs, ECGs and clinical lab tests
      will  be assessed to evaluate the safety and tolerability, and blood and urine will be
      collected to evaluate the pharmacokinetic parameters.

      This single ascending dose, food interaction study will be conducted with the KD101 dose of
      200, 600, 1000 and 1400 mg. After evaluating the safety and pharmacokinetic parameters in
      the single dose KD101 group of 200mg, next higher dose of KD101 will be administered and
      evaluated and food interaction will be evaluated in the KD101 group of 600mg.
