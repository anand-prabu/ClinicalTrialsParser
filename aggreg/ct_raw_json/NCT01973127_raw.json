This relapse is mainly caused by a high level of\n      (uncontrollable) craving towards alcohol. This aspect of addiction is with the existing\n      options hard to treat, there is a great need of new successful treatment modalities. rTMS is\n      a FDA approved treatment method for depression. Recently some small scale studies have shown\n      promising results on rTMS in the treatment of addiction. In this study the investigators\n      focus on alcohol addiction since it is the addiction with the highest morbidity and\n      mortality in the Netherlands."
