      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of veliparib when given together
      with floxuridine in treating patients with metastatic epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal
      cavity, or fallopian tube cancer. Veliparib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking
      some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as floxuridine,
      work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by
      stopping them from dividing. Giving veliparib together with floxuridine may kill more tumor
      cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose of the combination of ABT-888 (veliparib) and
      intraperitoneal (IP) floxuridine in adult patients with advanced ovarian, primary peritoneal
      or fallopian tube cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the adverse event profile associated with this treatment combination.

      II. To assess for preliminary evidence of efficacy, such as tumor responses, of the
      treatment combination.

      III. To assess progression free survival (PFS) in the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) cohort.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the pharmacokinetic profile of ABT-888 and floxuridine when given in combination.

      II. Assess whether the presence of mutations in the homologous recombination pathway or loss
      of expression of non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) components correlates with response to
      floxuridine + ABT-888.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of veliparib.

      Patients receive veliparib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-10 and floxuridine IP on
      days 3-5. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3 months.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal or fallopian tube
             malignancy that is metastatic and for which standard curative measures do not exist

          -  Disease confined to the intraperitoneal and retroperitoneal cavity; note: nodal
             disease below the diaphragm, implants adherent to the surface of the liver or
             intrahepatic lesions will not be exclusionary; patients remain eligible if all
             intrahepatic tumor is debulked at the time of the intraperitoneal catheter placement

          -  EXPANSION PHASE ONLY: Evaluable or measurable disease with the largest nodule
             measuring less than 5 cm in greatest dimension by radiographic imaging after
             debulking procedure

          -  Candidate for and willingness to have a surgically placed intraperitoneal catheter
             and tissue acquisition at the time of port placement; note: if an intraperitoneal
             catheter is already in place, a tumor biopsy will still be required; a guided
             core-needle biopsy is sufficient in these cases

          -  Able to swallow and absorb the medication

          -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;= 1500/mm^3

          -  Platelets (PLT) &gt;= 100,000/mm^3

          -  Creatinine =&lt; 1.5 x institutional ULN

          -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) =&lt; 3 x
             institutional ULN

          -  Hemoglobin (Hgb) &gt; 9.0 mg/dl

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) 0, 1, or 2

          -  Ability to provide informed written consent

          -  Life expectancy &gt;= 12 weeks

          -  Women of childbearing potential only: negative pregnancy test done =&lt; 7 days prior to
             registration

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known standard therapy for the patient's disease that is potentially curative or
             definitely capable of extending life expectancy; note: patients with recurrent
             platinum-sensitive ovarian, primary peritoneal or fallopian tube will be allowed, if
             the investigator believes the study treatment is a better alternative to initiation
             platinum-based chemotherapy, such as patients with a prior platinum allergy or low
             volume disease for whom platinum-based therapy is deferred until a later date

          -  More than 4 prior chemotherapy regimens; note: repeat use of regimens count as 1

             the debulking procedure

          -  Any of the following:

               -  Nursing women

          -  Immunocompromised patients (other than that related to the use of corticosteroids)
             with the exception of patients known to be human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
             positive and have a cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) count &gt; 400 and do not require
             antiretroviral therapy

          -  Receiving any other investigational agent that would be considered a treatment for
             the primary neoplasm

          -  Other active malignancy =&lt; 1 year prior to registration
