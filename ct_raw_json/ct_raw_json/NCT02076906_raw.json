            "textblock": "Magnetic Resonance (MR)-guided high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is an innovative\n      technique that allows for non-invasive thermal ablation of tissue.  Advantages over\n      conventional local tumor control such as surgery, radiation, or radiofrequency are that\n      MR-HIFU is completely non-invasive, non-ionizing, and enables ablation of large tumor\n      volumes with avoidance of adjacent tissue injury.  This study will evaluate the safety and\n      feasibility of MR-HIFU ablative therapy in children with refractory or relapsed solid tumors\n      that are located in bone or soft tissue in close proximity to bone.  Children \u2264 21 years of\n      age with refractory or relapsed solid tumors with measurable target lesions that are located\n      in bone or soft tissue in close proximity to bone are eligible.  Tolerability will be\n      defined during the 28 days following MR-HIFU ablation.  Patients will continue to be\n      followed for tumor response and secondary outcomes for up to one year post ablation\n      treatment."
