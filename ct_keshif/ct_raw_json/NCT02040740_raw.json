            "textblock": "An identified hormone linking bone and kidney function is Fibroblast Growth Factor-23\n      (FGF23).  Data on the variation of FGF23 levels for bone and mineral metabolism in children\n      are scarce.  Currently it is assumed that meeting mineral requirements for the skeleton\n      serves the body's overall needs.  However, it is not clear as to whether this is true,\n      particularly with growth.   The contribution of dietary factors directly linked with the\n      bone/kidney axis through measurement of intake (via 24hr recall) and kidney nutrient\n      clearance (via serum and urinary analysis) will be included in investigations.  Findings\n      will serve as a springboard for delineating more specific mechanisms by which these systems\n      become disordered and are influenced by diet.  It is expected that adequacy of nutrients\n      known to have a central role in bone function will optimize the hormonal milieu through\n      crosstalk with the kidney.\n\n      This effort will allow ongoing investigation in detecting and treating disturbances in\n      mineral metabolism related to kidney disease, specifically in the pediatric population and\n      broaden the understanding of kidney disease itself, as well as that of chronic diseases in\n      which kidney health is of importance, such as diabetes and osteoporosis.  Findings of this\n      research may stress the importance of achieving dietary adequacy essential for establishing\n      optimal body composition trajectories, particularly puberty."
