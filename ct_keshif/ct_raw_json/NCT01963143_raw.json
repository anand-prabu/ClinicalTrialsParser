Isolated deficiency of a single IgG subclass or of\n             specific antibodies without hypogammaglobulinemia per se, does not qualify for\n             inclusion.\n\n          3. The subject is currently receiving a licensed IGIV (or investigational stage III,\n             IIIb IGIV) at a dose that has not changed by \u00b1 50% of the mean dose for at least\n             three months before study entry and is between 300 and 800 mg/kg/infusion. The\n             infusion interval must be either every 21 or every 28 days.\n\n          4. The subject must have a trough level \u2265 6 g/L (600 mg/dL). At least one documented\n             trough level must be available from the three months before Screening.\n\n          5. The subject must have documentation from the last three consecutive routine IGIV\n             infusions for the following, before the first infusion in this study: dose of IGIV,\n             treatment intervals, and trade name (or identity) of the IGIV treatment.\n\n          6. Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative result on an HCG\n             (human chorionic gonadotropin) based pregnancy test at Screening.\n\n          7. Females who are or become sexually active must practice contraception using a method\n             of proven reliability for the study duration.\n\n          8. The subject is willing to comply with all aspects of the protocol for the duration of\n             the study.\n\n          9. The subject has signed an informed consent form and assent form (if applicable).\n\n        Exclusion criteria:\n\n          1. The subject has a history of any severe anaphylactic reaction to blood or any blood\n             derived product.\n\n          2.

The subject has cellular or innate impaired immunity (i.e. only subjects with humoral\n             impaired immunity may be included).\n\n          4. The subject has evidence of an active infection at the time of enrolment.\n\n          5. The subject has previously completed or withdrawn from this study.\n\n          6. The subject is currently receiving, or has received, any investigational agent other\n             than an IGIV within the prior three months.\n\n          7. The subject is pregnant or is nursing.\n\n          8. The subject has positive results for any of the following at Screening:\n\n               -  Serological test for HIV 1 and 2, HCV, or HBsAg\n\n               -  NAT (Nucleic acid amplification technique)for HCV\n\n               -  NAT for HIV\n\n          9.

The subject is known to abuse alcohol, opiates, psychotropic agents, or other\n             chemicals or drugs, or has done so within the past 12 months.\n\n         12. The subject has a history of deep vein thrombosis or thrombotic complications of IGIV\n             therapy.\n\n         13. The subject suffers from any acute or chronic medical condition (e.g. renal disease\n             or predisposing conditions for renal disease, coronary artery disease, or protein\n             losing state) that the Investigator feels may interfere with the conduct of the\n             study.\n\n         14. The subject has an acquired immunodeficiency condition such as chronic lymphocytic\n             leukemia, lymphoma, multiple myeloma, or chronic or recurrent neutropenia (absolute\n             neutrophil count < 1 \u00d7 109/L).\n\n         15. The subject is receiving the following medication:\n\n               -  Steroids (long term daily, \u2265 0.15 mg of prednisone equivalent/kg/day).\n                  Requirement for short or intermittent courses of steroids would not exclude a\n                  subject.\n\n               -  Immunosuppressive drugs\n\n               -  Immunomodulatory drugs\n\n         16.
