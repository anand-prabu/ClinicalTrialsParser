NIR\n      imaging will be acquired during these maneuvers and fluorescent structures and/or foci will\n      be anatomically defined by the surgeons.\n\n      The operation will be then continued as usual but each anatomical piece will be controlled\n      \"ex vivo\" for its fluorescent character or not. All fluorescent foci on these anatomical\n      pieces will be identified as such by a mark and/or by a \"suture\".\n\n      If lymph nodes were suspected to be metastatic (for instance on the basis of the PET-CT with\n      18F-DG performed before surgery), they will be searched, (optionally controlled in vivo for\n      their visibility using NIR camera)and dissected."
