Combining more than one drug and using drugs in different ways\n      may kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy in treating\n      pediatric patients with stage III or stage IV non-Hodgkin's lymphoma."

Assess the feasibility of treating all histologic subgroups of pediatric\n      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma on one protocol, with the addition of asparaginase during the\n      induction and consolidation phases for diffuse lymphoblastic lymphoma and T-cell, large\n      noncleaved cell diffuse lymphoma. II. Assess whether intensification of cyclophosphamide\n      during induction therapy will achieve a complete response rate of 95% in 1 to 1.5 months for\n      all histologies. III. Assess whether achieving remission induction in 1 month, administering\n      cytarabine/methotrexate by continuous infusion during consolidation therapy, and increasing\n      the number of intrathecal methotrexate injections throughout protocol therapy decreases\n      central nervous system relapse in these patients. IV. Assess whether a 5-year\n      recurrence-free survival of 85% is achievable for all histologies on this protocol. V.\n      Assess whether duration of maintenance chemotherapy may be stratified by stage and histology\n      of disease to avoid unnecessarily prolonged chemotherapy.\n\n      OUTLINE: The following acronyms are used: ARA-C Cytarabine, NSC-63878 ASP Asparaginase,\n      NSC-109229 CF Leucovorin, NSC-3590 CTX Cyclophosphamide, NSC-26271 DM Dexamethasone,\n      NSC-34521 DNR Daunorubicin, NSC-82151 G-CSF Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor,\n      NSC-614629 LBL Lymphoblastic Lymphoma LCALKi1B Large Cell Anaplastic B-cell Lymphoma\n      LCALKi1T Large Cell Anaplastic T-cell Lymphoma LCL Large Cell Lymphoma Mesna Mercaptoethane\n      Sulfonate, NSC-113891 MTX Methotrexate, NSC-740 TMP-SMX Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole VCR\n      Vincristine, NSC-67574 VP-16 Etoposide, NSC-141540 Induction: 2-Drug Combination Systemic\n      Chemotherapy plus Single-Agent Intrathecal Chemotherapy followed by 2- or 3-Drug Combination\n      Systemic Chemotherapy plus Single-Agent Intrathecal Chemotherapy.
