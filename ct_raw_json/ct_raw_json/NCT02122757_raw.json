Such habituation deficit can be shown in the visual cortex by the study of\n      visual evoked potentials (VEP) and it is possibly explained by a reduction in the cortical\n      pre-activation level due to thalamo-cortical dysrhythmia. In healthy subjects and in\n      migraineurs between attacks, anodal tDCS increases VEP habituation and 1st block amplitude.\n      In a proof-of-concept trial, the investigators have shown in 10 episodic migraine without\n      aura patients that 2 weekly 15-minute sessions for 8 weeks of anodal tDCS over the visual\n      cortex significantly decreased attack frequency, migraine days, attack duration and acute\n      medication intake for more than 4 weeks after the last treatment session.\n\n      This randomized trial was designed to prove the preventive effect in episodic migraine of\n      anodal tDCS over the visual cortex compared to sham stimulation."
