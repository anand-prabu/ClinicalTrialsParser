      -  Patients will be recruited after a written informed consent from the legal
           representative or relative.

        -  Adverse events will be coded using Medical dictionary for Regulatory Activities
           (MedDRA).

        -  Descriptive statistics will be used for the safety and efficacy variables.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male and female patients â‰¥18 years of age diagnosed with VAP , i.e., pneumonia that
             arises more than 96 hours after endotracheal intubation documented or suspected to be
             due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa

          2. Respiratory specimen suitable for culture and Gram stain collected before starting
             the treatment

          3. Written Informed consent from the patient's legally acceptable representative or a
             relative

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with known hypersensitivity to fluoroquinolones, carbapenems, cephalosporin,
             penicillin (beta-lactam antibiotics) or aminoglycoside antibiotics (i.e. all
             available SoC antibiotics); patients with a clinically significant history of drug
             allergies and history of anaphylactic reaction and patients with active allergic
             conditions at the time of screening

          2. Known or suspected pulmonary conditions which are likely to interfere with the
             therapeutic response or might have additional impact on pharmacokinetics

          3. Patients with Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score &gt;25

          4. Presence of septic shock at the time of evaluation for study entry

          5. History of lung transplant

          6. Patients with known HIV infection with CD4+ (cluster of differentiation 4) cell count
             &lt; 200/mm3

          7. Concomitant morbidity of such severity that the patient is likely to die or present
             with serious medical conditions within 7 days of study entry

          8. Patients who are currently enrolled in, or have not yet completed at least 30 days
             since ending another investigational device or drug trial or are receiving other
             investigational agent
