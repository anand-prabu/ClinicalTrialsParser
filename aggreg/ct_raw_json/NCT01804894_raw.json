It is thought clinically, that those who do best\n      at these tests will perform the best in their sport and/or be the least likely to get\n      injured. The converse is also thought to be true. The objective of this study is to\n      administer field tests to athletes at the beginning of each season and then follow athletes\n      over several years, tracking their injuries and their performance statistics. In this way,\n      the investigators can determine if the clinical supposition is true and that the results of\n      field tests are associated with injury or performance"
