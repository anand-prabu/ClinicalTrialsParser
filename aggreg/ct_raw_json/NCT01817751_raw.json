The combination of sorafenib and valproic acid is\n      predicated on the basis that sorafenib activity is enhanced by HDAC inhibition. The addition\n      of sildenafil is based on its ability to block ABCB1 and ABCG2 drug efflux pumps. As the\n      ABCG2 transporter is the primary transporter involved in the efflux of sorafenib at the BBB,\n      blocking its action is predicted to increase the concentration of sorafenib in the brain."
