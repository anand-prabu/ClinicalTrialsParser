To determine the proportion of patients with biochemically-recurrent prostate cancer (PC)\n      in whom imaging with whole body (WB)/axial MRI and F-18 NaF (fluorine F 18 sodium fluoride)\n      PET/CT results in detection of metastatic disease not visualized on CT scan and bone scan.\n\n      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. To estimate the percent of eligible patients with negative, indeterminate and positive CT\n      scan/bone scan and targeted X-rays if done.\n\n      II. To determine the proportion of patients with biochemically-recurrent PC in whom\n      recurrence in the prostate bed can be visualized using MRI in the absence of detection using\n      CT scan.\n\n      III. To correlate the presence of metastatic disease detected using WB/axial MRI and/or F-18\n      NaF PET/CT with the 6-year predicted probability of progression-free survival based on the\n      Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center salvage radiation therapy (RT) PC nomogram, and with\n      prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level at baseline.\n\n      IV. To compare the role of axial MRI of the spine to WB/axial MRI with respect to their\n      ability to identify sites of disease.\n\n      OUTLINE:\n\n      Patients first undergo CT scan and bone scan. Patients with negative results from the CT and\n      bone scans then undergo WB MRI scan using diffusion-weighted MRI, axial MRI scan using\n      3-Tesla MRI, and fluorine F 18 sodium fluoride PET/CT scan.\n\n      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 4-6 months and periodically until\n      week 52."
