      The purpose of the study is to identify lifestyle factors associated with PCOS and
      understand how diet and activity levels impact features of PCOS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is an endocrine disorder that affects 6-12% of
      reproductive-aged women within the general population. There has been evidence to suggest
      women whom present with obesity and/or insulin resistance are at higher risk for developing
      PCOS. This condition is associated with negative health implications. Women with PCOS women
      are at increased risk for developing type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular
      disease compared to age- and weight- matched controls, indicating PCOS may increase an
      individual's susceptibility for chronic disease.

      Current research has failed to thoroughly examine the relationships between dietary intake,
      energy expenditure and PCOS.  The purpose of this proposed study is to identify lifestyle
      factors associated with PCOS. Through dietary intake and energy expenditure data, the
      researchers plan to examine potential lifestyle differences between PCOS and healthy women,
      as well as between BMI classifications within women with PCOS.  The Research Team will also
      be able to evaluate the diet quality according to the USDA Dietary Guidelines for Americans
      of all women included in the study. The Research Team is also interested in the
      relationships between biological markers and lifestyle endpoints in women with and without
      PCOS. Previous literature has shown there are biological marker differences between those
      with and without PCOS. By examining these relationships, researchers may further understand
      whether PCOS status is associated with lifestyle parameters.

      To accomplish these objectives, 80 women (40 women with PCOS, 40 women without PCOS) will be
      included in this study. Participants will be between 18 and 38 years, with BMI ≥ 18.5 kg/m2
      and will not have use of oral contraceptives within the last three months. Women will be
      included in the PCOS group if they have a confirmed PCOS diagnosis from their primary care
      provider. Participants will complete a food frequency questionnaire and physical activity
      questionnaire. A researcher may also provide participants with an accelerometer to wear for
      a week. Ultrasound scans of the ovaries will be assessed for the total number and size of
      follicles using both two- and three-dimensional imaging techniques. Participants will have
      blood samples collected determine LH, FSH, estrogens, and progesterone levels. The following
      metabolic parameters will be assessed: (1) 75-gram oral glucose tolerance test to
      characterize glucose and insulin dynamics at 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes post-glucose
      ingestion; (2) dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan to quantify body fat and lean muscle
      distribution; (3) vitals and anthropometry assessment to measure waist and hip
      circumference, height, weight, blood pressure, and heart rate, and (4) fasting blood tests
      to detect androgens (i.e., total testosterone, androstenedione, free androgen index) and
      serum markers of metabolic syndrome (i.e., lipids and hemoglobin A1C).
