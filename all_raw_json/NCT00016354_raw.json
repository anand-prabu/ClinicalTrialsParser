Courses repeat every 4 weeks in\n      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of BPU until the maximum tolerated dose\n      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6\n      patients experience a dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, 12 additional\n      patients are accrued and treated with BPU as above to confirm the MTD.\n\n      Patients are followed for 30 days.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 18-24 patients will be accrued for this study."
