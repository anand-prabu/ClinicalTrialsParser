RRSO after completion of childbearing is recommended\n      for prevention of ovarian and breast cancer in women with BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations and standard\n      of care for women with some forms of hormone-responsive cancer. Knowledge regarding the\n      impact of this procedure, with or without chemotherapy, and subsequent hypogonadism on brain\n      health is less than adequate. Premenopausal women who undergo an acute surgical menopause\n      are at greater risk for verbal memory decline and executive function (EF) complaints, but as\n      of yet, we cannot predict who is going to experience these adverse sequelae, nor do we have\n      targeted prevention or treatment strategies other than hormone therapy, which is not an\n      option in many cases and not always effective. An idealized sample as women who are planning\n      for a RRSO will undergo brain imaging and behavioral assessments pre- and post-surgery as\n      well as pre-/post-treatment with E2 or the psychostimulant, lisdexamphetamine (LDX;\n      Vyvanse\u00ae)."
