  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Randomized controlled trial testing the efficacy of a text messaging intervention in a low
      income, low health literacy group of Latino patients.  Project Dulce 2.0 (PD 2.0) will
      address barriers to participation in health education classes, increasing adherence to
      treatment and medications and improving diabetes self management behaviors and skills.   Two
      community clinic organizations that provide services to a large proportion of Latino
      patients with type 2 diabetes will participate to randomize 200 patients into one of 2 arms:
      standard diabetes management care (control) only or text messaging and standard care.
      Comparisons between groups will evaluate clinical, behavioral and psychosocial outcomes.

      Intervention: Standard Care and Text Messaging.  All participants will receive standard
      diabetes care provided by primary care providers at the clinic.  Of the 100 that are
      randomized to the intervention arm will be given instructions on how the text messaging
      component will be addressed throughout the duration of the study.
