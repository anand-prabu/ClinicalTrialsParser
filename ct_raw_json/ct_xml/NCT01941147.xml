  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is great interest in the development of novel therapies for acute ischemic stroke
      because, to date, the thrombolysis is the only approved treatment. Recent evidence suggests
      that extremely low frequency magnetic fields (ELF-MF) could be an alternative approach for
      acute ischemic stroke therapy because of their effects on the main mechanisms of  brain
      ischemic damage and regeneration.The main purpose of this open label, one arm, dose
      escalation study is the validation of ELF-MF stimulation as non-invasive, safe and effective
      tool to promote recovery in acute ischemic stroke patients Nine patients will be treated
      daily for 5 consecutive days, starting within 48 h from the onset of stroke. Three dose
      cohorts of three patients each, will be stimulated with pulsed ELF-MF (75 Hz, 1,8 mT) at
      increasing daily exposure (45, 120, 240 min).The primary outcome (safety endpoint) will be
      evaluated by the incidence of adverse events and mortality  throughout the stimulation
      period and the 1-year follow-up. Secondary outcomes will consist in change from baseline in
      clinical and radiological scores.
