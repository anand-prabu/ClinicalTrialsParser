  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is deÔ¨Åned as the recurrence of psychological and physical
      symptoms in the luteal phase, which remit in the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle
      [1].PMS will be prospectively diagnosed using the Royal college of Obstetricians and
      Gynecologists (RCOG) recommended daily record of severity of problems (DRSP) . Women will be
      asked to fill the diary for 2 months, only women with 30% increase in the DRSP score in the
      week before menses in both months will be diagnosed as having PMS.

      Women with PMS will be invited to participate in the study.The invitation will include a
      clear full explanation of the study and patients will provide written consents. All patients
      consenting to participate will be included in the trial.

      Yasmin, Calver and Placebo will be enclosed in similar jars which will be numbered using a
      computer generated random table. Women will be asked to choose a sealed envelope, each
      envelope will contain the number allocated to the jar and special instructions on how to use
      the medication. Yasmin will be taken once daily for 21 days starting from the 2nd day of
      menstruation, Calver and placebo will be taken continuously. Neither the patients nor the
      physician will be aware of the drug used. Patients will be categorized in 3 groups: group1
      who will receive Yasmin cyclically for 3 months (Yasmin, schering, cairo, Egypt), group 2
      who will receive Calver continuously for 3 months (Calver, Marcryl/Vertex, Cairo Egypt),
      group 3 who will receive placebo continuously for 3 months and will act as a control group.
