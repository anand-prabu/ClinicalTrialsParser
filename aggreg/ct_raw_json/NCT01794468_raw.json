MedTech DBF monitor, based on the hot-wire\n      principle of thermal balance of a heater cooled by a moving medium, via a skin probe placed\n      on the anterior chest wall. Sensitivity was evaluated by visual inspection during active\n      states, either induced, e.g. fluid administration, or spontaneous, e.g. altered\n      hemodynamics. Specificity was evaluated during stable states (minimal fluctuations of MAP\n      and no active interventions applied or required). Data are expressed in terms of standard\n      deviation (SD) and of the difference (SDD) between the MAP and each of the tested methods."
