Combining methotrexate with vinblastine may be effective\n      treatment for neurofibromatosis type 1 associated with progressive plexiform neurofibromas.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy in treating\n      patients who have neurofibromatosis type 1 associated with progressive plexiform\n      neurofibromas."
