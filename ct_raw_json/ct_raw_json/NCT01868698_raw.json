One of the main risk factors for the development\n      of DAP is  diabetes mellitus due to its relation to the process of atherogenesis. Thus, the\n      objective of this study is to evaluate the effects of three treatment modalities for PAD on\n      the blood flow velocity. It is a crossover study. Fifteen women with diabetes receive three\n      types of treatment, the order defined according draw: high voltage electrical stimulation,\n      shortwave diathermy and kinesiotherapy. The blood flow of the lower limb will be assessed by\n      Doppler ultrasound. The hypothesis of this study is that physical therapy resources increase\n      the circulation of the lower limb."
