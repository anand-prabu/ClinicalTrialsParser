CTCs have also\n      been shown to be valuable as predictive markers following treatment and there is increasing\n      interest in using CTCs as 'liquid biopsies' that can help to inform treatment decisions. CTC\n      analysis has the benefit of being relatively non- invasive and quick compared with a\n      conventional CT scan and is therefore an attractive method of monitoring the tumour\n      throughout the treatment period.\n\n      The purpose of this study is to assess the clinical value that enumeration will have in\n      predicting the clinical symptomatic response and progression free survival in patients\n      receiving Somatuline Autogel for functioning midgut NETs over a one year period."

Non childbearing potential is defined as being post-menopause for at\n             least 1 year, surgical sterilisation or hysterectomy at least three months before the\n             start of the study.\n\n          -  The patient has abnormal baseline findings, any other medical condition(s) or\n             laboratory findings that, in the opinion of the Investigator, might jeopardise the\n             patient's safety or decrease the chance of obtaining satisfactory data needed to\n             achieve the objective(s) of the study."
