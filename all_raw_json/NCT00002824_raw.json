Assess the response to a stereotactically administered recombinant adenovirus\n      vector carrying the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene (H5.010RSVTK) followed by\n      intravenous ganciclovir in patients with recurrent malignant glioma. II. Estimate the\n      maximum tolerated dose of H5.010RSVTK in these patients. III. Describe the toxic effects of\n      H5.010RSVTK. IV. Assess the efficiency of gene transfer and duration of transgene expression\n      in these patients. V. Assess quantitative and qualitative glucose metabolic activity of\n      tumoral sites by positron emission tomography. VI. Analyze the immunologic response to\n      adenovirus transduction in these patients. VII. Determine the benefit and toxicity of\n      multiple doses of H5.010RSVTK in patients with resectable tumors.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose-finding study. All patients receive stereotactically injected\n      H5.010RSVTK (a recombinant adenovirus vector containing the herpes simplex virus thymidine\n      kinase gene). Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of H5.010RSVTK until the\n      maximum tolerated dose is reached. Ganciclovir is then given on the third post-injection\n      day. Patients with unresectable tumors receive ganciclovir for 14 consecutive days. Patients\n      with resectable tumors receive ganciclovir for 7 consecutive days before undergoing\n      craniotomy with optimal debulking and injection of a second dose of the adenovirus vector\n      followed by ganciclovir for 14 more days. Patients are followed monthly for survival.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18 patients (9 with resectable tumors and 9 with unresectable\n      tumors) will be entered over 3 years."
