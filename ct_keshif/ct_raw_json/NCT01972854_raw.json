Contact Lens Wearers Only: Manifest refraction must be stable between two consecutive\n             visits which occur at least 7 days apart. A stable refraction is one in which the\n             manifest refraction spherical equivalent and the average K (Km) on the Pentacam taken\n             at the first visit do not differ by more than 0.75 D from the respective measurements\n             taken at the second exam. A contact lens wearer is defined as someone who has worn\n             contact lenses in the eye to be treated in the last 30 days.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          1.

Eyes which are aphakic;\n\n          8. Eyes which are pseudophakic and do not have a UV blocking lens implanted;\n\n          9. Previous ocular condition (other than refractive error) in the eye to be treated that\n             may predispose the eye for future complications. For example:\n\n               1. History or evidence of active or inactive corneal disease (e.g., herpes simplex\n                  keratitis, herpes zoster keratitis, corneal melt, recurrent corneal erosion\n                  syndrome, corneal dystrophy, etc.);\n\n               2.

A history of delayed epithelial healing in the eye to be treated;\n\n         11. Subjects with nystagmus or any other condition that would prevent a steady gaze\n             during the treatment or other diagnostic tests;\n\n         12. Subjects with a current condition that, in the investigator's opinion, would\n             interfere with or prolong epithelial healing;\n\n         13. Taking supplements containing Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) within 1 week of the\n             cross-linking treatment;\n\n         14. A history of previous corneal crosslinking treatment in the eye to be treated;\n\n         15. The subject should not have participated in any investigational drug or device study\n             within 30 days of screening or be concurrently enrolled in another investigational\n             drug or device study.\n\n         16. The Investigator may exclude or discontinue any subject for any sound medical reason."
