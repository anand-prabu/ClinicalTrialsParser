      This open-label study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of RoActemra/Actemra
      (tocilizumab) as monotherapy or in combination with methotrexate or other non-biologic
      DMARDs in patients with severe rheumatoid arthritis and an inadequate response to an
      anti-tumour necrosis factor (anti-TNF) agent. Patients will receive RoActemra/Actemra 162 mg
      subcutaneously weekly for 52 weeks.
