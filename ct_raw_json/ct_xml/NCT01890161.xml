  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is the first study in human patients with asthma that the sponsor is conducting in
      order to evaluate if there are signals that the investigational medication, AXP1275, may be
      a safe and effective treatment for asthma.  The results of this study may help the sponsor
      to design additional studies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This 2-way, randomized, double-blind crossover study in subjects with mild to moderate
      atopic asthma is designed to compare the responses to allergen and methacholine challenges
      within the same subject after approximately 2 weeks of treatment with AXP1275 50 mg or
      placebo.  A total of 20 subjects with asthma with a dual (early and late) asthmatic response
      to an inhaled aeroallergen will be randomized to 1 of 2 treatment sequences (placebo then
      AXP1275 or AXP1275 then placebo) in a double-blind fashion to receive either oral AXP1275 or
      matching placebo, once-daily, for 14 days.  The washout period between the 2 treatment
      periods will be 14 to 21 days.

      A post-treatment follow-up visit will occur 14 ± 3 days after completion of the second
      treatment period.

             test, and is either surgically sterile (hysterectomy, bilateral ovariectomy, or
             bilateral tubal ligation), or if a female of childbearing potential, agrees to comply
             with required contraceptive measures.

          5. History of episodic wheeze and shortness of breath with a prebronchodilator FEV1 ≥70%
             of predicted at screening.

             aeroallergen at screening.

          8. Screening inhalational allergen challenge response demonstrating that the subject
             experiences both an early asthmatic response (EAR) and a late asthmatic response
             (LAR).

          9. Methacholine PC20 ≤16 mg/mL at screening.

          9. Use of theophylline-containing agents (any type) and long-acting β2-agonists

             cannabinoids, barbiturates, or benzodiazepines) or cotinine.

         11. Positive for hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C virus, or human
             immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 1/2.

         12. Has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational product
             within 30 days prior to screening, or 5 elimination half lives of the investigational
             product, whichever is longer.

         13. Has had significant blood loss (&gt;500 mL) or donation of blood within 2 months prior
             to screening visit 1.

         14. History of being unable to tolerate or complete methacholine or allergen challenge
             tests.
