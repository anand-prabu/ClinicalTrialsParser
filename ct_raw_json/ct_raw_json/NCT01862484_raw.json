In addition children will undergo functional magnetic\n      resonance imaging (fMRI) at baseline and again at 5 weeks.  Children will perform a flanker\n      task known to engage the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and the anterior cingulate\n      cortex (ACC) during attention tasks.  The children will also perform will look at pictures\n      of appealing and unappealing food and rate whether they would like to eat it or not. This\n      task is known to activate the ventral striatum (VS) (reward processing).  A secondary\n      hypothesis is whether children on the restricted diet will show changes in activity and\n      connectivity of areas (DLPFC, ACC, VS) relative to those on the Ruse diet."
