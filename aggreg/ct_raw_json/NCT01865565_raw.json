This is a prospective,\n      multicenter, open, observational study in evaluation of safety and efficacy of imatinib\n      compared with that of historical data for locally unresectable advanced GIST without\n      metastasis. The study will include an up to 28-day screening period, followed by receiving\n      imatinib mesylate (400 mg/day) for at least 6-12 months and followed up for 3 years after\n      surgery."
