For this purpose,\n      pregnant women who are considered high risk for preterm labor and were diagnosed with\n      abnormal vaginal flora will be randomly treated either with clindamycin or metronidazole.\n      Eradication of the abnormal flora and adverse effects will be monitored and compared"
