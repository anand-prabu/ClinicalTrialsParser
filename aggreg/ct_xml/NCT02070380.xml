      This study aims at a comparison between MultiHance at a dose of 0.1 mmol/kg and 0.05 mmol/kg
      and Dotarem at a dose of 0.1 mmol/kg in brain tumor patients to show superiority of
      MultiHance.

          -  Diagnostic testing, such as CT or previous MRI examinations; or

          -  Have had recent brain surgery and are to be evaluated for recurrence

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Are pregnant or lactating females.  Exclude the possibility of pregnancy:

          -  By testing on site at the institution within 24 hours prior to the start of each
             investigational product administration; or

          -  By history (i.e., tubal ligation or hysterectomy); or

          -  Post menopausal with a minimum of 1 year without menses

          -  Have any known allergy to one or more of the ingredients in the investigational

             York Heart Association)

          -  Have suffered a stroke within a year

          -  Have received or are scheduled to receive any other contrast medium in the 24 hours
             preceding through the 24 hours following Exam 1, and in the 24 hours preceding
             through the 24 hours following Exam 2

          -  Have received or are scheduled to receive an investigational compound and/or medical
             device within 30 days before admission into the present study, through the 24 hours
             post-administration of the second investigational product

          -  Have moderate-to-severe renal impairment, defined as Glomerular Filtration Rate
             (GFR)/estimated GFR &lt; 45 mL/min

          -  Have been previously entered into this study

             examination or between the two examinations

          -  Initiation of steroid therapy between the two examinations

          -  Radiosurgery between the two examinations
