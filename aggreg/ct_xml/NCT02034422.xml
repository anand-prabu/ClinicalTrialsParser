  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypertension affects 37% of the Veteran population, making it the most common medical
      condition treated by the VA Health Care System. Physical activity is the first line of
      defense in the treatment and management of hypertension. However, individuals with
      hypertension have impaired muscle blood flow and exhibit exaggerated increases in blood
      pressure during exercise (exercise pressor reflex or EPR) leading to exercise intolerance
      and increased risk of stroke and heart attack. The cause of these impairments is not known,
      but it is highly likely that free radical production and the subsequent increase in
      oxidative stress plays a significant role. Two aims are proposed; Aim 1 will identify the
      physiological consequences of elevated oxidative stress in hypertension, and Aim 2 will
      utilize an antioxidant treatment to ameliorate the effects of an exaggerated EPR allowing
      the safe performance of a clinical exercise rehabilitation program which will then, itself,
      attenuate the EPR and reduce hypertension.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nearly 37% of all Veterans are clinically hypertensive, making hypertension the most common
      medical condition in the VA Health Care System. Importantly, of the 67 million Americans
      diagnosed with hypertension less than half are being effectively treated for their
      condition. Hypertension constitutes a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease and when
      left untreated leads to the development of heart failure, coronary heart disease, peripheral
      artery disease, stroke, and renal disease. Exercise and regular physical activity are
      considered the cornerstones of prevention and management of hypertension. However,
      individuals with hypertension exhibit exercise intolerance characterized by impaired
      skeletal muscle blood flow and heightened afferent fiber sensitivity leading to an
      exaggerated or greater than normal physiologic increase in blood pressure during exercise
      (i.e. exercise pressor reflex or EPR). This imbalance between the beneficial effects of
      exercise and exercise intolerance creates an interesting paradox, the causes and
      consequences of which are poorly understood. The etiology of hypertension is undoubtedly
      complex, however a common denominator in this condition, elevated oxidative stress, may
      contribute to impaired muscle blood flow and heightened skeletal muscle afferent feedback
      leading to the exaggerated EPR. Previous work from our laboratory and others suggests that
      elevated oxidative stress associated with aging impairs muscle blood flow. Additionally,
      free radicals, the initiators of oxidative stress, can directly stimulate skeletal muscle
      afferent fibers leading to the exaggerated EPR. Importantly, the role of oxidative stress in
      regulating muscle blood flow and afferent fiber function in human hypertension has not been
      determined. Preliminary studies support a significant role of oxidative stress in impairing
      muscle blood flow and contributing to the exaggerated EPR in hypertension. With this
      information as context two aims are proposed that will systematically identify the
      consequences of elevated oxidative stress in hypertension. Specific Aim 1 will determine the
      consequences of oxidative stress by examining how elevated free radicals contribute to
      heightened skeletal muscle afferent feedback and impaired muscle blood flow during exercise
      in hypertension leading to the exaggerated EPR. Additionally, vascular endothelial cells
      collected from an antecubital vein will provide novel insight regarding the endothelium as
      potential source of elevated oxidative stress in hypertension. Specific Aim 2 will determine
      the effectiveness of combined antioxidant therapy and exercise rehabilitation in the
      treatment of hypertension. The overall goal of this proposal is to provide novel information
      regarding the role of oxidative stress as a critical regulator of cardiovascular and
      hemodynamic responses to exercise in hypertension. By identifying potential causes and
      consequences of oxidative stress, important insight will be gained facilitating the
      development of novel approaches and therapeutic strategies for the treatment of
      hypertension. Importantly, the practical applications tested in these studies (i.e.
      antioxidant treatment and combined exercise rehabilitation) are designed to identify and
      document effective countermeasures to aid in the treatment and management of hypertension
      allowing for the safe performance of exercise in a large number of Veterans.

    <description>Specific Aim 1: Determine the consequences of oxidative stress on skeletal muscle afferent feedback and muscle blood flow during exercise in hypertension. Hypothesis: Afferent feedback sensitivity, determined by passive leg movement (isolation of mechanoreceptor sensitivity) and post exercise circulatory occlusion (isolation of metaboreceptor sensitivity) will be greater in hypertension leading to the exaggerated EPR. Muscle blood flow, assessed by Doppler ultrasound during multiple exercise intensities, will be impaired in hypertension leading to exercise intolerance. Reductions in oxidative stress, achieved by an oral antioxidant treatment (Vitamins C, E and alpha lipoic acid), will reduce afferent fiber sensitivity and improve muscle blood flow in hypertension. Additionally, venous endothelial cells will express elevated markers of oxidative stress providing novel evidence that the vascular endothelium contributes to the greater oxidative stress in hypertension.</description>

Hypothesis: Acute antioxidant treatment administered prior to exercise in hypertensive patients will ameliorate the exaggerated EPR resulting in a normal and safe blood pressure response to exercise-based rehabilitation. This two-pronged approach (antioxidants and exercise training) will result in a safely achieved reduction in skeletal muscle afferent feedback facilitating improved exercise tolerance, improved muscle blood flow and ultimately reduced cardiovascular risk in this population.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        A total of 72 middle-aged (40 - 60 years of age) healthy and hypertensive men and women
        will participate in these protocols after providing written informed consent. We aim to
        include a 1 to 1 ratio of females and males in each group. Individuals diagnosed or
        presenting with stage 1 and stage 2 hypertension (range 140/90 to 179/109 mmHg, according
        to the seventh report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection,
        Evaluation, and Treatment of High BP) may be eligible for this study. Blood pressure
        status will be assessed in triplicate in the laboratory during the medical exam and during
        a 24 hour period using ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. Both methods must confer
        hypertension for study enrollment. Other than hypertension, all hypertensive patients will
        be otherwise healthy and free of overt disease as assessed by: a) medical history; b)
        standard blood chemistries (chem. 7 panel), c) ECG at rest; d) limb vascular examination
        (ankle-brachial BP index &gt; 0.9); e) resting BP &gt; 140/90 mmHg; and f) skinfold % body fat
        assessment. Subjects will have a body mass index (BMI) between 19 and 30 and have plasma
        glucose concentrations &lt; 7.0 mmol/L under fasting conditions and &lt; 11.1 mmol/L at 120
        minutes of an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), as defined by the American Diabetes
        Association. To reduce heterogeneity of the hypertensive subjects while maintaining a
        &quot;real world&quot; approach the following classes of drugs will be allowed; diuretics,
        angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and angiotensin II receptor blockers
        (ARB).  Healthy normotensive subjects will be matched to their hypertensive counterparts
        and will be free from overt cardiovascular disease according to the criteria described
        above.

        Inclusion/Exclusion criteria with specific reference to the exaggerated exercise pressor
        reflex:

        Hypertensive subjects must exhibit a 10 mmHg or greater increase in MAP at 25% of their
        workrate maximum during knee extension exercise to be included in this study. Established
        criteria defining a cut off for an &quot;exaggerated&quot; exercise pressor reflex does not exist.
        Therefore, we have set our operational definition at a 10 mmHg or greater increase in MAP
        during 25% of workrate maximum knee extensor exercise. This 10 mmHg increase in MAP was
        chosen as this value closely matches our preliminary data (Figure 1) and previous reports
        while concomitantly corresponding to an increase in BP that is at least 2 standard
        deviations greater than the normotensive response (i.e. 6   2 (SD) mmHg increase in MAP at
        25% of their workrate maximum). The magnitude of the exercise-induced increase in MAP will
        be determined during preliminary testing. It should be noted that the magnitude of the
        pressor response is graded in relation to exercise intensity, therefore, by establishing
        an inclusion criterion of 10 mmHg at 25% of workrate maximum, the lowest intensity to be
        used in the proposed studies, we have set a conservative standard for study enrollment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Candidates demonstrating dyslipidemia based on the National Cholesterol Education Program
        Guidelines of plasma total cholesterol &gt; 240 mg/dl with LDL-cholesterol &gt; 160 mg/dl will
        be excluded from participation. Hypertensive patients receiving dual or monotherapy
        treatment for hypertension may be included.

        Less frequently prescribed classes of drugs for hypertension (beta blockers, aldosterone
        receptor blocker, centrally acting sympatholytics, calcium channel blocker, direct
        vasodilators, renin inhibitors, and alpha blockers) will be excluded. Additionally,
        subjects reporting a history of myocardial infarction, unstable cardiac ischemia, recent
        cardiac catheterization, carotid artery disease, transient ischemic attack will be
        excluded.

        Participants must have no orthopedic limitations that would prohibit them from
        knee-extensor exercise or aerobic activity including cycle ergometry or treadmill
        exercise. Due to the age requirement of
