  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Additional micronutrient supplementation is required due to the changes in the
      gastrointestinal anatomy and physiology following bariatric surgery along with decreased
      dietary intake and rapid weight loss. Good adherence to post-operative vitamins is essential
      to maintain healthy vitamin levels in the body following bariatric surgery. The hypothesis
      of this study is that patients receiving a weekly survey intervention will have better
      adherence to post-operative vitamins than a control group not receiving the survey.
