There is an urgent need for less toxic and more easily manageable\n      compounds to treat this fatal disease.\n\n      Fexinidazole is a 2-5-nitroimidazole, formulated for oral administration, which has been\n      shown to possess in vitro and in vivo activity against both T. b. rhodesiense and T. b.\n      gambiense parasites.\n\n      Predicted CSF concentrations reached target levels after repeated dosing.
