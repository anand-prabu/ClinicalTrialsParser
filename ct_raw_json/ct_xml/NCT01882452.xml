  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Depression involves the tendency to recall overgeneral personal memories, a phenomenon which
      has been linked to numerous adverse psychological outcomes. The purpose of this study is to
      investigate whether a group-based Memory Specificity Training (MEST) programme improves
      outcomes in depression, and how this compares to an education and support control group. The
      primary aim is to examine whether MEST, which involves repeated practice retrieving specific
      autobiographical memories reduces depressive symptoms immediately post-treatment, and
      whether this is maintained 3 months after treatment. The secondary objective of this trial
      is to examine the role of hypothesised cognitive processes (ie., rumination, executive
      control, cognitive avoidance) which may underlie improvements in depression and memory.

    <description>This intervention is a manualised, structured treatment delivered over 5 x 60 minute sessions to groups of 5-8 individuals. This treatment involves repeated practice of retrieving specific autobiographical memories in response to positive, negative and neutral cue words. There is a single psychoeducation component in the first session about memory difficulties common in depression which provides the rationale for this treatment. The training is supplemented by weekly homework practice.</description>

    <description>The education-and-support comparison condition is matched with the experimental arm for length and format (ie., 5 x 60 minute weekly sessions in groups of 5-8 individuals). Groups receive a single psychoeducation component where information about depression is provided. This is followed by non-directive support where participants are encouraged to raise different kinds of events that occur each week for discussion in the group. The sessions are supplemented by a homework diary where participants will be invited to note down an event that occurs each day, which may be positive, negative, or benign and non-emotional in nature. This material will provide the basis for discussion in the weekly group meetings.</description>
