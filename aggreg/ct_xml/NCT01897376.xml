      The purpose of this study is to determine if there is a difference between Pfannenstiel and
      midline vertical skin incision at time of cesarean section in preventing wound complications
      in the morbidly obese patient. This is a comparative effectiveness study of two
      commonly-used skin incisions. The investigators plan to enroll morbidly obese obstetrical
      patients upon admission and randomize them to one of the above incision types in the
      operating room. The investigators will follow them for 6 weeks post-op to evaluate for wound
      complications. There is minimal risk to the participant as both incision types are
      acceptable in current obstetrical practice. There is no direct benefit to the patient.

      Currently, there is no level I evidence to support either Pfannenstiel or midline vertical
      skin incision in the prevention of wound complications in the obese patient undergoing
      cesarean section.  Therefore, current practice is for the surgeon to make the decision based
      on preference and weighing theoretic risks. Therefore, there is clinical equipoise. Cesarean
      section is a very common procedure, with a national rate of 32% of all live births in 2007.
      Not only does obesity increase the expectant mother's risk of a cesarean section, it is also
      a well recognized risk factor for wound complication. The cesarean wound complication rate
      in the morbidly obese population at the University Of Texas at Houston - Memorial Hermann
      Hospital Texas Medical Center in 2011 was roughly twenty times as high as the normal weight
      population, 28% compared to 1.4%. Results from this study could be extrapolated in the
      future to affect lower post-operative morbidity, higher patient satisfaction, less
      antibiotic use, shorter hospital stay, and overall lower health care costs.
