Determine the nature and degree of toxicity of this regimen in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE:\n\n      Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 90 minutes on days 1 and 8, docetaxel IV over 1 hour on\n      day 8, and filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) on days 9-15 or pegfilgrastim SC on day 9\n      only. Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable\n      toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then\n      annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 19-51 patients will be accrued for this study within 10-24\n      months."
