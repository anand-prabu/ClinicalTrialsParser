      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the impact of implementing a &quot;Serious Illness
      Communication Checklist&quot; to guide patient/family-clinician discussions and planning about
      end-of-life care decisions. The goal of the intervention is to improve achievement of
      patient care priorities and peacefulness at the end of life for patients with serious and
      life-threatening illness and their families. We hypothesize that patients whose physician is
      trained to use and adheres to the elements of the Serious Illness Communication Checklist
      will demonstrate enhanced consistency between documented key priorities and care received,
      and will experience greater peace in the final month of life; similarly, their families will
      experience higher satisfaction with care.

    <description>Patients whose physician is trained to use and adheres to the SICC will receive care that is more consistent with their key life priorities during the last week and the last 3 months of life than patients whose physician is not trained to use the SICC.  Goal consistent care will be measured by comparing patient identified goals to chart review and family report.</description>

    <description>Patients whose physician is trained to use and adheres to the SICC will be more likely to report being at peace in the final 3 months of life than patients whose physician is not trained to use the SICC. Being at peace will be measured by the PEACE scale, a 13-item validated questionnaire in cancer patients.</description>

    <description>Initial Training: The initial training program for clinicians randomized into the intervention arm will be 2.5 hours.  The project will be introduced and the Serious Illness Communication Checklist shared. The training session will include a brief didactic session on &quot;Challenges in discussing advance care planning/values and goals&quot; and practice using the SICC.
Ongoing Coaching: Ongoing group coaching will be available from project directors for routine and difficult patient encounters.
&quot;Real-Time&quot; Feedback: We will also provide &quot;in the moment&quot; individual coaching for clinicians. Clinicians will be able to contact an email inbox to request coaching/debriefing on a challenging case; one of the investigators will respond within 24-48 hours for urgent or distressing cases (up to 72 hours on weekends). In-the-moment coaching will be by telephone or in person.</description>
