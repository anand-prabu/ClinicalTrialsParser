As in the biomarker study, UF\n      athletes on teams with higher incidences of sports related concussion; men's football,\n      women's soccer, and women's lacrosse will be offered enrollment.\n\n      Longitudinal examinations will allow identification and quantification of concussive DTI\n      findings as comparisons can be made to the individual athlete's baseline data.  This will\n      provide valuable correlation of imaging findings with severity of clinical symptoms at the\n      time of injury and also with timing of return to play."
