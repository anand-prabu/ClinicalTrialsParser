  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is (1) to assess the incidence of suspected drug allergies in a
      pediatric hospital and the proportion in which these reactions are confirmed to be allergic;
      (2) to evaluate the diagnostic values of the different allergy tests available; (3) to
      investigate the pathophysiology of drug allergies, particularly by investigating the role of
      viruses, and by performing HLA typing and a gene expression profile both in the acute phase
      of the reaction and 2 months later.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participation will be proposed to any children (0 to 16 years) receiving one or
             several drug(s) and developing one of the following clinical manifestations:
             urticaria, maculopapular rash, bullous eruption, flush, anaphylaxis, serum
             sickness-like disease, SJS, TEN, DRESS or fever linked to drug intake.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients will be excluded if the symptoms occur more than 72 hours after any
             treatment was stopped or if the symptoms are clearly linked to another cause
             (measles, rubeola, roseola, varicella, fifth disease, Gianotti-Crosti syndrome,
             scarlet fever, Gibert's pityriasis or food allergy).
