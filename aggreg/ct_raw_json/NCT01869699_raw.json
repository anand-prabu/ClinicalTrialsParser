            "textblock": "The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of intravenous acetaminophen to placebo\n      on body temperature and hemodynamic (heart rate and blood pressure) responses in febrile\n      critically ill adult patients.\n\n      There are limited data to explain the variable and unpredictable antipyretic and hemodynamic\n      response to acetaminophen in febrile ICU patients.  The complex pathophysiology of\n      critically ill patients, co-morbid conditions, the effect of multiple pharmacologic and\n      non-pharmacologic care interventions, and/or the potential interferences with absorption of\n      enteral or rectal formulations may be related to variations in the antipyretic response to\n      acetaminophen.  It is necessary for clinicians to have a better understanding of the therapy\n      response and potential adverse effects of this commonly administered medication, especially\n      the recently available IV formulation, in critically ill patients.  Further research of the\n      antipyretic response to acetaminophen in critically ill patients is warranted to inform\n      evidence-based practice guidelines for fever management. Further randomized,\n      placebo-controlled studies of hemodynamic responses to IV acetaminophen are also warranted.\n\n      Primary Hypothesis:\n\n      There is a significant reduction in time-weighted average core body temperature over 4 hours\n      after administration of IV acetaminophen compared to placebo in febrile critically ill\n      patients.\n\n      Secondary Hypotheses:\n\n        1. There is a significant reduction in time-weighted average heart rate over 4 hours after\n           administration of IV acetaminophen compared to placebo in febrile critically ill\n           patients.\n\n        2. There is a significant reduction in time-weighted mean arterial pressure over 4 hours\n           after administration of IV acetaminophen compared to placebo in febrile critically ill\n           patients.\n\n      Adult patients with fever (\u2265 38.3\u00baCentigrade/101\u00baFarenheit) in the intensive care unit will\n      be screened for eligibility and enrolled after informed consent. Patients will be randomized\n      to receive IV acetaminophen 1 gram or normal saline 100 mLs. Body temperature, heart rate,\n      and blood pressure will be measured at baseline and during the 4 hours post study drug\n      administration."

Core body temperature will be measured using a zero-heat flow\n      thermometry system (non-invasive, small disk on forehead). Patients will be monitored and\n      data collected during the 4-hour post study drug administration period.  A rescue protocol\n      will be implemented if the temperature reaches \u2265 40 \u00baC during the study period and includes\n      notification of primary team provider by the nurse and the pharmacist will contact them to\n      inform the provider of study group (acetaminophen or placebo).
