            "textblock": "Although metformin is not directly nephrotoxic, it has been postulated that can impair\n      gluconeogenesis from lactate, which may lead to lactate accumulation under circumstances\n      such as acute renal failure. In diabetic patients receiving metformin, this condition can be\n      encountered in the setting of acute renal failure following contrast media administration,\n      during coronary angiography i.e. contrast-induced nephropathy. As a result, it has been a\n      part of routine clinical practice to discontinue metformin before angiography to prevent\n      metformin-associated lactic acidosis (MALA). However, there is no general consensus\n      regarding the incidence of MALA and evidence for such intervention is poor. On the other\n      hand, discontinuation of metformin can be associated with detrimental effects on glycemic\n      control and thereby may increase cardiovascular risk in diabetic patients undergoing\n      percutaneous coronary interventions. Consequently, questions have been raised recently\n      regarding the routine discontinuation of metformin, in low-risk patients undergoing coronary\n      angiography.\n\n      The present study was designed to assess the role of metformin in lactate production in a\n      group of diabetic patients with normal renal function; and to address the questions about\n      significance of routine discontinuation of metformin in low risk patients undergoing\n      coronary angiography.\n\n      Iodixanol will be the only contrast media in all patients, because of its low\n      nephrotoxicity. Serum blood urea nitrogen and creatinin; as well as arterial blood gases\n      will be evaluated prior to angiography, and repeated 24 and 48 hours after the procedure.\n      Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is calculated using Cockcroft-Gault formula {GFR= 0.85 (for\n      women)}.\n\n      Contrast-induced acute kidney injury is defined as a 25-50% or 0.3-0.5 mg/dl net increase in\n      creatinine concentration compared to the baseline values. Metformin-associated lactic\n      acidosis (MALA) is defined as an arterial pH (potential of hydrogen)<7.35 and plasma lactate\n      concentration >5 mmol\u2044L. In the M (-) group metformin will re-started 48 hours after\n      angiography, albeit in the absence of evidence of lactic acidosis and GFR of >60 mL/min per\n      1.73 m2.\n\n      A written informed consent is taken from all participants and institutional review board has\n      already  approved the trial."
