  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In less developed countries, 1/3 of under-2-year old children are stunted (short stature for
      age).  This early childhood stunting causes about one-fifth of all under-5-y child deaths in
      developing countries and, because brain development mirrors linear growth, leads to
      long-term cognitive deficits, fewer years and poorer performance in school, lower adult
      economic productivity, and a higher risk that their children will also be stunted,
      perpetuating the problem into future generations. The growth failure causing stunting occurs
      during pregnancy and the first two years after birth; after age 2 there is little or no
      recovery.  Improving the diets of young children can reduce stunting, though, at best, only
      by about one-third.  Frequent diarrheal illness has also been implicated.  However, the
      effect of diarrhea on permanent stunting is relatively small, maybe because children grow at
      &quot;catch-up&quot; rates between illness episodes. The study will test the hypothesis that a major
      cause of child stunting and anemia is environmental enteropathy (EE), an asymptomatic
      condition of the small intestine caused by exposure to poor environmental sanitation.
      Environmental enteropathy is extremely common among people living in developing countries.
      During Environmental enteropathy, nutrient absorption is reduced and intestinal wall &quot;leaks&quot;
      allowing large numbers of bacteria into the blood stream which causes chronic low-grade
      infection.  We hypothesize that children with Environmental enteropathy use much of the
      nutrients they eat to fight these chronic low-grade infections, using less nutrients from
      their diet for growing.

      The Sanitation Hygiene Infant Nutrition Efficacy (&quot;SHINE&quot;) study will test the effects of
      two packages of interventions:  1) improved water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) and 2)
      improved infant nutrition (IN) on child stunting  and anemia in the first 18 months of life.
       The study will be conducted in rural Zimbabwe where WASH is poor, food insecurity high, and
      where about 15% of pregnant women are infected with HIV.  The study will enroll 4,800 women
      early in pregnancy and follow them and their infants until 18 months after delivery. The
      study will be a cluster-randomized controlled trial:  two entire districts in central
      Zimbabwe have been divided into 212 geographic areas, each of about 100 households.  The
      areas will be randomly allocated (that is, assigned by according to chance like the flip of
      a coin) to one of four interventions:

        1. Improved WASH (a ventilated pit latrine, hand washing facilities with soap, drinking
           water treatment, and health lessons to adopt improved hygiene behaviors)

        2. Improved Infant Nutrition (health lessons on best infant feeding practices and a
           nutritional supplement to be fed daily to babies from 6 to 18 months).

        3. Improved WASH and Infant Nutrition (both interventions)

        4. Standard of Care

      All women living in the two districts who become pregnant during the recruitment period of
      the study will be invited to enroll.  They will receive one of the 4 packages of
      interventions according to the area where they live.  Health lessons will be given by
      Village Health Workers.  Latrines and hand washing facilities will be constructed by
      building teams managed by Oxfam, a non-government organization active in WASH in Zimbabwe.
      Mothers will be followed up by research nurses at 7 months gestation, and at 1, 3, 6, 12,
      and 18 months after delivery. Primary outcomes are infant height and hemoglobin at 18 months
      of age.

      In a sub-sample of 1600 mothers and babies the investigators will also collect samples of
      stool and blood and conduct a special sugar absorption test collecting urine.  These samples
      will be tested for factors of Environmental Enteropathy (EE) - factors that indicate the
      health of the intestinal wall.  The investigators will also ask these mothers to record all
      diarrhea, respiratory infection, and fever illnesses that the child has between 1 month and
      18 months of age.  This sub-study will investigate whether improved WASH reduces EE and
      whether reduced environmental enteropathy is, in turn associated with improved growth and
      reduced anemia.

      Since the mothers enrolled in SHINE will have lived in unsanitary living conditions
      throughout their lives, it is anticipated that most will have some degree of EE themselves.
      It is hypothesized that resulting chronic inflammation contributes to adverse birth
      outcomes.  This question will be investigated through an observational design.  For all
      mothers enrolled in SHINE, the sugar absorption test described above will be conducted and
      specimens of urine, stool and blood collected and archived at the 10-12 week gestation visit
      for later assessment of EE indicators.  The association of severity of EE with risk of
      adverse birth outcomes (low birth length and weight; miscarriage, stillbirth, and premature
      delivery) will be assessed.

        a Village Health Worker, who have a negative pregnancy test followed by a positive
        pregnancy test.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Women residing in the study districts who were already pregnant when trial
             recruitment begins

          -  Women who are &gt;14 weeks gestation at the time of enrollment

          -  Women residing in the study districts who become pregnant during the enrollment
