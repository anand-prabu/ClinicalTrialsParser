      Primary Objective:

      To evaluate one, two and three year survival of patients treated with resection plus
      neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy versus resection plus neoadjuvant chemo radiotherapy.

      Secondary Objective(s):

      To evaluate the effect of both neoadjuvant regimens on clinical and pathological response
      rate (in particular relief of dysphagia, improvement in health related quality of life
      (HRQL), endoscopic regression, and CT-PET evidence of tumour response), tumour regression
      grade, node-positivity, post-operative pathology, disease-free survival, time to treatment
      failure, toxicity, post-operative complications and Health Related Quality of Life (HRQL).

      Exploratory Objective(s):

      Translational Research: The collection of blood and tissue samples for storage in the bio
      bank for future research.

      Indication:

      Patients with cT2-3 N0-1 M0 adenocarcinoma of the oesophagus or junction, based on clinical,
      CT-PET, and EUS staging, will be randomised to the MAGIC chemotherapy regimen versus the
      CROSS neoadjuvant chemo radiation protocol prior to surgery. Patients will be randomised to
      either Arm A (MAGIC regimen of chemotherapy only and surgery) or Arm B (CROSS protocol:
      chemotherapy with radiation therapy and surgery as per multimodal protocol).

      Eligible patients will be randomised in a 1:1 fashion between the MAGIC regimen or the CROSS
      protocol.

      Exploratory Study- Translational Research :

      All patients enrolled in this trial, will be invited to consent to having some of their
      tissue and blood taken for use in future research studies. Following consent from the
      patient, tissue biopsy of tumour and/or normal oesophageal tissue will be obtained for
      research at the same time as that biopsied for histological diagnosis. In addition, tumour
      and/or normal tissue will also be obtained following surgical resection. Patient blood
      samples will also be obtained, both before and during treatment. The identification of both
      tumour and circulating biomarkers will increase knowledge of the molecular mechanism(s)
      underlying treatment response in oesophageal cancer and may facilitate the identification of
      biomarkers predicting patient response to treatment.

    <description>Arm B consists of the CROSS protocol, which includes a combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy prior to surgery. The patient will receive 5 weeks of radiation therapy and 5 weekly cycles of chemotherapy. The radiation will generally commence on the 1st day of treatment and will run for 5 weeks as follows: days 1-5, days 8-12, days 15-19, days 22-26 and days 29-31 inclusive. The chemotherapy and radiotherapy will run concurrently over a 5-week period. Chemotherapy is given by intravenous infusion on days 1, 8, 15, 22 and 29.</description>
