      Background

      Present treatment strategies for trigger finger when conservative management including
      steroid injection was failed include percutaneous or open A1 pulley release, but some people
      showed prolonged swelling and delay of complete healing.

      We aimed to test the hypothesis that an improved outcome can be achieved by employing
      steroid injection simultaneously with percutaneous release compared with conventional
      percutaneous release alone

      Methods

      We designed a double-blind, randomized controlled trial.

      Inclusion criteria is the patient who has symptom of trigger finger warranted surgical
      release after sufficient time of conservative treatment.

      Exclusion criteria are as follow: 1) multiple fingers at presentation; 2) Rheumatoid
      arthritis patients; 3) Pregnant or lactating patients; 4) Younger than 18 years old; 5)
      Previous surgery history of finger 6); the patients who got steroid injection more than 4
      time previously; 7) coagulation abnormality including usage of anti-thrombotic agent.

      After power analysis by a statistician, total 40 patients would be required for each group
      (percutaneous alone group versus percutaneous alone + steroid injection group).

      The surgery will be performed by outpatients clinic basis with local injection. Additional
      steroid injection will be given to half of patients after allocation with randomized
      selection by permutaed block randomization.

      Primary outcome measure is mean fall in pain visual analogue scale (pVAS) and secondary
      outcome will be proportion of patients with good response (defined as &quot;Perfect&quot; or &quot;much
      better&quot; as reported by patients).

      Follow-up will be conducted 3 weeks and 3 month after index procedure
