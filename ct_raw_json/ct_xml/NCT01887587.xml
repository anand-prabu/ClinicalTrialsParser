    <textblock>
      This is a phase I study of vincristine, doxorubicin, PEG asparaginase and dexamethasone
      (modified VXLD) plus MLN9708 in adults with relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic
      leukemia/lymphoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this phase I study, escalating doses of MLN9708 will be combined with a fixed dose mVXLD
      regimen. MLN 9708 will be administered on day 1, 8, and 15. If the patient experiences a DLT
      the dose of MLN maybe reduced to the next dose level on day 8 or day 15 in that patient. DLT
      would be any grade 3 or more toxicity which is thought to be probably or definitely related
      to MLN9708. Three patients will be treated per dose level unless dose limiting toxicity
      (DLT) is observed.  The starting dose of MLN9708 will be 2.3 mg orally on days 1, 8 and 15.
      If toxicity is seen at this level then dose may be reduced to 1.5 mg (dose level -1) .  If
      no DLT is seen in the first 3 patients, the dose will be increased to 3 mg and then to 4 mg
      orally on days 1, 8 and 15 in a classic 3 +3 phase I design. We will not attempt to increase
      the dose beyond 4 mg orally which, if achieved with acceptable toxicity, would be accepted
      as the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). 0 of 3 DLTs would allow escalation to the next dose
      level. 1 of 3 DLTs will require expanding to six patients; 1 of 6 DLTs will allow escalation
      again. 2 DLTs will require dose de-escalation.  The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) will be the
      highest dose administered at which no more than 1 DLT was observed. All patients will be
      evaluated for hematopoetic stem cell transplantation. If patients achieve CR and are
      eligible for HSCT, they will proceed to HSCT. If they are not eligible, no donor is
      identified or if HSCT will be delayed, and the patient has achieved benefit, then treatment
      maybe repeated at the discretion of the investigator. A total of 9-18 patients will be
      enrolled on the study. The study duration would be about 2 years.
