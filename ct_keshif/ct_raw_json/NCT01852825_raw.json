In Part 1 of the\n      study healthy participants undergo nasal allergen challenge (NAC) with house dust mite (HDM)\n      extract in order to verify the operational performance of NAC and associated sample\n      collection methods. Part 2, the main study,  is a placebo controlled, double blind study of\n      participants with HDM-induced allergic rhinitis or rhinoconjunctivitis. The primary\n      hypotheses are that the changes from baseline in post-allergen challenge HDM-specific\n      Immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) and Immunoglobulin E blocking factor (IgE-BF) are greater after\n      treatment with MK-8237 than after treatment with placebo."
