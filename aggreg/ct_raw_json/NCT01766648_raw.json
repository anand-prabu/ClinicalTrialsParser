(Bhandari et\n      al, data in press)\n\n      Secondary outcome measurements will include patient-reported quality of life and CT\n      quantification of fracture callus volume.\n\n      Quality of life will be measured with the Short-Form 36 Version 2 (SF-36) instrument at all\n      follow-up intervals.\n\n      A CT scan of the fracture site will be performed at the 3 month follow-up.  Using a\n      quantitative protocol the volume of callus will be measured and the extent of cortical\n      bridging will be assessed.\n\n      Additional secondary outcomes include radiographic and patient-important complications.\n      These will include adverse events, delayed union (>6 months), non union (failure for\n      fracture healing to progress on serial x-rays between 6 and 9 months), malalignment (>5\n      degrees), hardware failure, infection, and reoperation.
