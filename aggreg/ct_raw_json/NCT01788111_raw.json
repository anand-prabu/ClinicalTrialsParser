The project has a biological approach assessing\n      the supporting and stabilizing muscles (multifidus) in pilots with chronic back and neck\n      ailments. Pilots with low back problems are invited to a controlled intervention trial to\n      investigate whether one can achieve improved spinal health with a rigid training r\u00e9gime.\n      Primary trial outcome is improved neck and back multifidus muscles pathology and function as\n      assessed by the extent of fat infiltration -as visualized on MRI - and the volume and\n      ability of the lumbar multifidus muscles to contract as shown with ultrasound.  The\n      perceived effect on spinal health with sick leave frequency is also evaluated."
