A number of novel predictors will be assessed in 128 YLS. Predictors\n      will include individual differences (IDs) in EEG, reward sensitivity, attentional\n      performance, and mood during abstinence and in response to standardized and to self-selected\n      acute nicotine doses (ANIC), as well as genetically influenced affective traits, and smoking\n      history. The associations of a compelling genetic functional variant polymorphism,\n      rs16969968, in the alpha5 nicotinic receptor subunit will also be related to smoking\n      progression and the novel predictors. The study is expected to provide insights into IDs in\n      mechanisms and predictors that contribute to smoking trajectories in YLS and thereby lead to\n      targeted pharmacotherapy and behavioral interventions for at-risk YLS."
