  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Iron metabolism may undergo changes during exercise, with reductions in classical iron
      status markers due to a variety of postulated mechanism which include hemodilution,
      increased iron loss, hemolysis and increased iron storage in muscles. Furthermore, it has
      been reported that vigorous training increases hepcidin, a central regulatory peptide in
      iron metabolism. This increase has been ascribed to the presence of subclinical
      inflammation. Increased hepcidin levels may reduce iron bioavailability and iron
      incorporation in erythrocytes.

      Twenty healthy men subjects will be recruited as subjects for this study. Subjects should be
      generally healthy, with no history of blood donation in the last 6 months, should weigh less
      than 85 Kg, and not take iron supplements and/or multivitamin supplements. Subjects should
      have familiarity to sports and running, but not currently (i.e. in the past 3 months)
      training for more than 1h per week on average.

      The aim of this study is to measure an iron bioavailability during a resting and an exercise
      phase lasting approx. 14 days with training sessions on alternate days. Subjects will
      participate in both restign and exercising protocols and act as their own controls during
      the study. Iron bioavailability will be measured via the incorporation of stable isotopic
      labels 14 days after administration. To control for changes in blood volume during the
      course of the study, blood volume of the participating subjects will be measured before and
      after the exercise phase with the CO-rebreathing method.

      Measurement of iron bioavailability and iron incorporation in a resting and exercising phase
      will allow determine if the increased level of hepcidin seen in in exercise will induce a
      lower iron bioavailability and iron incorporation during exercise.
