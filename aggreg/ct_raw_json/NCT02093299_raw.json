These patients may have an increased risk for less effect of the treatment\n      and therefore a higher risk for a new stroke.\n\n      The investigators want to investigate if clopidogrel non-responders have a clinically\n      increased risk of a new stroke by following the patients for two years. With this study the\n      investigators aim to ensure that all patients get the best prophylactic treatment and reduce\n      the risk of early death and dependency of others."
