    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>This is considered an Exploratory Measure. Cortisol has  been explored as a potential biomarker of well-being; lower levels of salivary cortisol have been associated with higher levels of psychological well-being. Recently, reliable and valid methods for measuring long-term cortisol secretion through hair samples have been developed and are being used as biomarkers of chronic stress in multiple medical conditions.</description>
