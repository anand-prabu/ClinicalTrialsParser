It is associated with abnormal angiogenesis and autosomal dominant inheritance,\n      leading to telangiectasias and arteriovenous fistulae. More than 95% of patients are\n      concerned by epistaxis (nosebleeds). These events are spontaneous, repeated, irregular, both\n      diurnal and nocturnal, a source of anemia, disabling and very socially embarrassing.\n\n      Anti-angiogenic treatments, including bevacizumab, are a new therapeutic option in HHT.\n\n      The aim of this study is to evaluate 3 months after the end of the treatment the efficacy on\n      the duration of the nosebleeds with 3 different doses (25, 50 and 75 mg) of bevacizumab\n      administered as a nasal spray in a repeated manner (3 administrations) in patients with\n      Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia complicated by nosebleeds.\n\n      This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, seamless phase II/III study is to be\n      carried out on 4 groups of 20 patients for first step and 2 groups of 20 to 40 patients for\n      second step"
