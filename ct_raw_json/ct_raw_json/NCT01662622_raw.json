Cisatracurium 0.15mg kg-1 was administered after loss of the lash re\ufb02ex, then ventilated manually until the amplitude of T1 decreased to 0. Intubation was performed and switched to mechanical ventilation with a fresh gas flow 2L min-1. Gas concentrations were analysed using a gas analyser.The end-tidal concentration of carbon dioxide was maintained at 4.7kPa; an esophageal temperature probe was inserted and a warming unit was used if necessary to maintain normothermia (35.5\u00b0-38.5\u00b0). The surgical incision was performed at least 30min after tracheal intubation. When arterial blood pressure (MAP) decrease exceeding 20% of baseline values. Phenylephrine 0.1mg was administered intravenously if necessary to maintained MAP and recorded."
