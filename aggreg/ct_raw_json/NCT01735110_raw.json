A recent meta-analysis indicated that TRI has\n      advantages in reducing major bleeding and ischemic events compared to transfemoral\n      intervention (TFI) after the percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). However, no clinical\n      trial has yet shown statistical equivalence in terms of long-term efficacy of TRI compared\n      with TFI for the treatment of complex coronary lesions, which is simply due to limited\n      numbers of subjects enrolled. The purpose of PREPARE trial is to evaluate the long-term\n      safety and efficacy of TRI versus TFI for PCI in patients with left main (LM) and/or\n      three-vessel coronary artery disease."
