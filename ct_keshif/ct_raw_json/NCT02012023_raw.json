            "textblock": "After low anterior resection(LAR), in the LI group, the operation method was done as\n      surgeons all known. In the CTI group, a double row of concentric purse-string sutures were\n      placed in the ileum wall using 3-0 absorbable suture. The diameters of the purse-string\n      rings were about 10 mm and 20 mm, respectively. The investigators then made a small incision\n      within the inner purse-string and inserted the trachea cannula into the proximal end of the\n      ileum. The inner purse-string suture then was tied, followed by the outer purse-string\n      suture. The outer purse string should capsulate the inner purse string to prevent leakage.\n      Normal saline was injected into the air bag until the ileum wall. The investigators will\n      test the pressure of airbag, and control the pressure of airbag from 30-40cmHg. The\n      investigators then pulled the cannula out through the abdominal wall. The incision site in\n      the ileum was approximated to the inner abdominal wall and extraperitonized by fixing the\n      mobilized ileum wall around the cannula to the inner abdominal wall. This was accomplished\n      using 3-4 interrupted sutures.\n\n      In the LI group, patients accepted reversal operation at least 3 months after operation if\n      operation condition permission.\n\n      In the CTI group, the tube will be removed after 3-4 weeks. If anastomotic leakage occurred,\n      the investigators will test the airbag pressure and keep the pressure during 30-40cmHg.\n      Because with time went on, the ileum will dilated , the airbag pressure will go down, then\n      the feces may go through the airbag plane and flow into colon and the tube ileostomy will\n      lose its defunctioning effect.When the investigators control the airbag pressure, we can\n      control the defunctioning effect of tube stomy. So it is called controllable tube ileostomy.\n      The investigators will keep the tube until the anastomotic leakage was cured."
