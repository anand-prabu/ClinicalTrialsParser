            "textblock": "Congestive heart failure is a common disorder in which the heart cannot pump enough blood to\n      meet the needs of the rest of the body.  Poor sodium handling by the kidneys is a damaging\n      effect of heart failure, and it leads to symptoms of congestion such as shortness of breath\n      or ankle swelling.  Recent studies suggest that reducing  the nerve activity to a kidney\n      could reduce sodium retention and blood pressure. An improvement in the way the kidneys\n      handle sodium may reduce disease progression and decrease symptoms for heart failure\n      patients."
