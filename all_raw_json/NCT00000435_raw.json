Studies have shown\n      that immune cells in the joints of people in the early stages of RA react strongly against\n      dnaJ peptides from bacteria. These immune cells may also cross-react with human dnaJ\n      peptides in the joints to cause inflammation. dnaJ may help RA by \"re-educating\" the immune\n      system and dampening the abnormal inflammatory immune response in RA.\n\n      This study will last 7 months. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either dnaJ\n      or placebo by mouth. At screening, participants will have medical history, physical, and\n      medication assessment. At screening, at 6 study visits every month after the start of\n      treatment, and at 1 month follow-up, participants will have a joint exam, blood and urine\n      collection, and will fill out a questionnaire about their condition."
