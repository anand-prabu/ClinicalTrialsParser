Patients are stratified\n      according to age (18 to 49 vs 50 and over), current tamoxifen use (yes vs no), current\n      raloxifene use (yes vs no), duration of hot flash symptoms (less than 9 months vs 9 months\n      or more), and average frequency of hot flashes per day (2-3 vs 4-9 vs 10 or more). Patients\n      are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. (Arm II closed to accrual as of 1/22/03.)\n\n      All patients complete a daily questionnaire regarding number of hot flashes beginning on day\n      1 and continuing for 7 weeks.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral venlafaxine once daily for 6 weeks beginning on day 8.\n           After week 7, patients with satisfactory efficacy may continue venlafaxine for up to 6\n           months. Patients with unsatisfactory efficacy may cross over to arm III.\n\n        -  Arm II (closed to accrual as of 1/22/03): Patients receive medroxyprogesterone\n           intramuscularly (IM) on days 8, 22, and 36 for a total of 3 injections. After week 7,\n           patients with unsatisfactory efficacy may cross over to arm I.\n\n        -  Arm III: Patients receive medroxyprogesterone IM once on day 8. After week 7, patients\n           with unsatisfactory efficacy may cross over to arm I.\n\n      Patients are followed at months 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, and 12.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 220 patients (110 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this\n      study within 18 months.
