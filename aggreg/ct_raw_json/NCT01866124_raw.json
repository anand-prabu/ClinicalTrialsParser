The program will be targeted to economically vulnerable households\n      with children less than 1 year old at the time of inclusion and the cash distributed to\n      mothers. The transfers will be assimilated to unconditional ones, leading to beneficiaries'\n      self-determination on the use that will be made of cash. This study will be designed as a\n      two-arm cluster randomized intervention trial, based on randomization of rural villages of\n      the Tapoa province. One arm will receive the intervention and one will be a control arm.\n      The main outcomes will be the cumulative incidence of acute malnutrition (or wasting) and\n      the cost-effectiveness. Anthropometric measures (height, weight and MUAC) will be measured,\n      as well as indicators of dietary diversity, food security, health center frequentation,\n      families' expenses and morbidities. Questionnaires and 24-hour food recalls will also be\n      analyzed. Finally, based on a model theory framework built a priori, the pathways used by\n      the cash to have an effect on the prevention of under-nutrition will be assessed."

            "textblock": "At international level, the WHO formulated guidelines for the treatment of severe acute\n      malnutrition (or wasting) (WHO 1999, and more recently ACF 2011), and guidelines for\n      moderate acute malnutrition (or wasting) are in the process of formulation. In contrast,\n      surprisingly little is known on preventive schemes for acute malnutrition. In Haiti, Ruel et\n      al (2008) found that targeting nutrition interventions to prevent children from becoming\n      malnourished might be more effective than curative treatment to reduce child wasting. In\n      addition, recent preventive trials in humanitarian settings focused on the use of food-based\n      strategies, especially ready-to-use food (Isanaka, 2009; Hendricks, 2010; Parikh, 2010;\n      Imbad, 2011; Huybregts, 2012). However, it is well known that the causes of under-nutrition\n      are numerous and also relate to inadequate health and care practices, lack of food\n      diversification, food insecurity\u2026 Therefore, the MAM'Out research project aims at assessing\n      a context-adapted preventive approach, which is likely to influence several underlying\n      causes of under-nutrition and not based primarily on food supplementation. The objective is\n      to provide an evidence base for this alternative approach, in order that proven intervention\n      be taken into account for scale-up at policy-making levels."
