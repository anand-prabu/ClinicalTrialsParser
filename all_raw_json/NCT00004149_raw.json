Treatment continues as biweekly infusions for at least 14 additional weeks in the\n      absence of disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or excessive increase in serum\n      prostate-specific antigen.\n\n      Pain is assessed at baseline and then before each biweekly treatment.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 17-37 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-24\n      months."
