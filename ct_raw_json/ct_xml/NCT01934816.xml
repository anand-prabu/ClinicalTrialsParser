  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to examine the involvement of KATP channels on the microvascular actions of
      the incretin GLP-1 and its analogues in healthy individuals and to determine whether the
      acute oral administration of different KATP channel blockers which are oral medications for
      Type 2 diabetes such as Glibenclamide and Glimepiride differentially modulate the
      microvascular responses in these individuals.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In addition to the glucose lowering effect, incretin based therapies have also an effect on
      the vascular system. Previous animal work and initial human studies suggest that incretins
      may be cardioprotective and act as vasodilators through opening of KATP channels.

      Initial evidence suggests that beneficial vascular effects of incretin modifying agents may
      be nullified by the co-current treatment of the sulfonylurea (SU) drug glibenclamide. The
      investigators hypothesis is that the GLP-1 and SUs may have conflicting effects on the KATP
      channels and thus vascular function.

      Interestingly the vascular actions of GLP-1 were not modified by a different treatment SUs
      called glimepiride, thereby raising the possibility that SUs differentially modulating the
      vascular actions of GLP-1 though this remains controversial.
