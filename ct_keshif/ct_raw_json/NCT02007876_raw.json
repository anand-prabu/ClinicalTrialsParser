            "textblock": "Older and sicker patients are at increased risk of poor surgical outcomes, with more\n      complications, longer lengths of stay, more utilization of skilled nursing facilities,\n      increased mortality, and high costs when compared with younger and healthier patients\n      undergoing similar procedures.  In addition, more high-risk patients are having surgery, as\n      overall surgical volumes are predicted to increase up to 47% (from 2000 to 2020).  Within\n      this context, efforts to improve surgical quality among high-risk patients have become of\n      paramount importance and new proven strategies to improve surgical outcomes are needed.\n\n      Work by the PI Englesbe suggests that trunk muscle lean mass is strongly associated with\n      poor surgical outcomes, suggesting an independent link between muscle loss (sarcopenia) and\n      surgical outcome, even when controlling for comorbidity and functional impairment.\n      Furthermore, their work notes that trunk muscle mass declines rapidly in the peri-operative\n      period.  Whether exercise interventions can remediate this risk is unknown.  Few randomized\n      control trials exist that address whether pre-operative exercise interventions can alter\n      eventual post-operative outcomes, and none focus on training the trunk musculature in\n      abdominal surgery patients.   Further, trunk musculature is critical for mobilization and\n      several published trials (such as in an intensive care unit) suggest that early mobilization\n      is associated with improved outcomes. Thus, the link between reduction in muscle loss via\n      exercise and improved mobility in post-surgical patients remains to be proven but seems\n      promising.  Co-PI Alexander has extensive experience in studies of mobility task assessment\n      and enhancement in able and disabled adults.  Of particular relevance to the present\n      proposal are studies of rising from a bed (supine to sit) and from a chair (sit to stand)\n      and the improvement that can be noted, using a task-specific approach in older adults at\n      risk for mobility impairment.  His most recent funded investigations focus on home-based\n      mobility and physical activity enhancement.\n\n      We propose to pilot study a group of older adults undergoing midline laparotomy for\n      gastrointestinal malignancy and who participate in a mobility and activity training (MAT)\n      program.  MAT is designed to advance functional mobility and physical activity and spans the\n      pre-operative, inpatient, and post-operative period.  Patients undergoing abdominal surgery\n      will be randomized to MAT versus control usual care and evaluated at their first appointment\n      4 weeks preoperatively (baseline), immediately prior to surgery, on hospital discharge, and\n      6 weeks post operatively.  We hope to prove that abdominal surgery patients undergoing MAT\n      will show less decline and earlier recovery in functional activity, and trunk and thigh\n      muscle strength mass. This study is uniquely innovative in that it links functional activity\n      assessment and training and analysis of trunk morphomics (muscle mass) in exploring\n      mechanisms of post-operative recovery. Results from this pilot will be used to determine an\n      effect size for the recruitment of a larger cohort and to study key surgical outcomes,\n      including surgical complications, operative symptoms, hospital length of stay, and cost of\n      care.\n\n      Primary Aim 1: To determine the changes in extent of decline and in recovery of functional\n      activity, strength, and muscle mass resulting from activity training (MAT) Primary\n      hypothesis: Abdominal surgery patients randomized to MAT, as opposed to usual care controls\n      (UC) and compared to their baseline evaluation 4 weeks pre-operatively, will have reduced\n      loss of functional activity and reduced loss of muscle strength and mass in the trunk and\n      thigh 6 weeks post-operatively.\n\n      Secondary Aim 1: To determine the effects of individual MAT program segments provided\n      pre-operatively, in-hospital, and post-hospital discharge Secondary hypothesis:  Abdominal\n      surgery patients randomized to MAT, as opposed to UC, will have reduced loss of functional\n      activity and reduced loss of muscle strength and mass in the trunk and thigh when comparing\n      1) baseline versus surgical admission; 2)  surgical admission versus hospital discharge; and\n      3) hospital discharge versus post-operative follow-up at 6 weeks.\n\n      Exploratory Aim: To determine the effect of MAT on surgical complications, operative\n      symptoms, hospital length of stay and peri-operative cost.\n\n      Exploratory hypothesis: Abdominal surgery patients randomized to peri-operative MAT, as\n      opposed to UC, will have reduced surgical complications, fewer operative symptoms, shorter\n      hospital length of stay, and lower cost of care."
