Determine the overall survival in patients with unresectable stage III or IV\n      pancreatic adenocarcinoma treated with gemcitabine, cisplatin, and fluorouracil. II.\n      Determine the resectability rate with curative intent in patients with unresectable stage\n      III pancreatic adenocarcinoma treated with this regimen. III. Assess the tolerability and\n      toxicity of this treatment regimen in this patient population. IV. Evaluate this regimen in\n      terms of response rate, response duration, and overall time to disease progression in these\n      patients. V. Evaluate the quality of life in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15, followed by\n      cisplatin IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 15. Patients receive fluorouracil as a continuous\n      infusion on days 1-15. Courses repeat every 28 days. Quality of life is assessed every 28\n      days.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study."
