Over the past decade, less toxic agents such as the innovative targeted therapies, i.e.\n           erlotinib or gefitinib, have the potential to improve the effectiveness and keep a good\n           quality of life with a low toxicity\n\n        3. BIBW 2992, an aniline-quinazoline, is an EGFR and HER-2 irreversible inhibitor, and it\n           has activity against erlotinib-resistant isoforms having mutations in EGFR and HER-2\n\n        4. This molecule have shown benefits as a single agent in pre-treated patients who have\n           progressed despite platinum-based chemotherapy, with a minimal toxicity compared to\n           chemotherapy\n\n        5. BIBW 2992 is associated with adverse effects similar to those for erlotinib and\n           gefitinib, such as rash and diarrhea. These symptoms can reduce the quality of life in\n           patients and lead to inconsistent EGFR inhibitor dose administration\n\n        6. There is no a standard treatment for rash, but case reports have tried to demonstrate\n           the benefit obtained with alcohol-free emollients, sunscreen with titanium dioxide or\n           antibiotic (topic or oral) treatment such as clindamycin or doxycycline,\n           anti-inflammatory drugs such as steroids and isotretinoin in the treatment of these\n           cutaneous injuries.\n\n        7. In order to reduce the incidence and severity of cutaneous toxicities, we will compare\n           the prophylactic antibiotic treatment using tetracycline and general dermatological\n           recommendations versus using only dermatological recommendations, in patients\n           initiating the treatment with BIBW 2992"
