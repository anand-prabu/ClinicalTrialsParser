Determine the response rate,\n      progression free interval, and duration of survival of these patients when treated with this\n      regimen.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive bryostatin-1 IV over 1 hour and\n      cisplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment continues every 21 days in the absence of\n      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed until death.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 37 patients will be accrued for this study over 2-3 years."
