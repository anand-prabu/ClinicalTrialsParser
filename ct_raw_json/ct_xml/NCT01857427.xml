  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to build a well characterized cohort of patients that
      will be used to determine the genetic variants associated with OSA (obstructive sleep
      apnea)and its co-morbidities.

    <time_frame>The study procedures will take approximately 48 hours to finish since subjects will be asked to wear the equipment that records the ambulatory 24 hour blood pressure after the research visit. The research visit will last approximately 2 hours.</time_frame>

    <description>The primary objective of this study is to build a well characterized cohort of patients that will be used to determine the genetic variants associated with OSA and its co-morbidities. The purpose of building the cohort is to allow the performance of genome-wide association studies with a large sample of patients that have been well-characterized using standardized procedures.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To measure changes in inflammatory biomarkers, adipokines, and RNA molecules in OSA patients</measure>
    <time_frame>After the potential subject has agreed to participate and informed consent procedures have been initiated the subject will have blood drawn for subsequent DNA extraction.</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>This will be powered based on levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive (hsCRP) protein. The sample size for this study will be based on ANOVA analysis of hsCRP  in patients with different degrees of OSA severity (normal, mild, moderate, severe).  539 subjects will have a power of 80% to detect an effect size of 0.01 pg.mL-1 with an expected standard deviation of  0.05 pg.mL-1. The 539 subjects for this aim will be included in the patients enrolled in Aim 1, that is, these are not additional subjects to the 5000 patients that will be enrolled in Aim 1. These subjects will be enrolled consecutively and enrollment for this aim will be terminated when 539 subjects have been included.</description>
