  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This VA-based study will obtain feedback from healthcare workers via validated survey
      instrument on the comfort and tolerability of wearing current models of N95 respirators and
      novel respirator designs currently in development. Feedback will be collected in a step-wise
      manner to determine if novel designs meet the needs of healthcare workers. Results from this
      study will be used by the collaborating manufacturers to make changes to novel designs
      before placement into the marketplace.

    <textblock>
      This study aims to compare novel designs to products currently in the marketplace by
      comparing scores on a survey tool which measures comfort and tolerability of respiratory
      protective devices. Study participants will be healthcare workers who have experience
      wearing respiratory protective devices in their workplace. We will enroll up to 280
      participants in the study (160 pilot phase; 120 clinical phase), made up of physicians,
      nurses, nursing assistants and other healthcare employees who are currently covered under
      the respiratory protection program. Subjects will be screened to determine eligibility and
      must pass fit-testing on the respirator he/she is randomized to. Participants in the pilot
      phase of the study will wear the respirator while walking in the hall, while participants in
      the clinical trial phase will wear the respirator while performing a series of motions that
      simulate movements made by healthcare workers when performing patient care tasks.  There
      will be no contact with patients during participation in either phase of the study. Feedback
      via validated survey tool will be collected from all study participants on the comfort and
      tolerability of the respirator worn.

    <description>Subjects will answer questions concerning comfort of respirator utilizing a Likert scale instrument that has been validated to capture comfort and tolerability assessments. This is a single visit study; there is no follow-up. Comfort and tolerability measurements will be compared between new and standard respirator models.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  VA healthcare worker

          -  Has been fit-tested to a respirator in the last year

          -  Is able to pass fit-testing on the model of respirator he/she is randomized to

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Does not meet study inclusion criteria

          -  Is pregnant

          -  Has physical characteristics that may interfere with his/her ability to attain an
             adequate facial seal when fit-tested (e.g. growth of facial hair, facial scarring)

          -  Has any condition which could, in the opinion of the investigator, place the
             participant at risk or interfere with data integrity. This includes a previous
             reaction to inhalation of both the Bitrex or saccharin solution used during
             fit-testing procedures.
