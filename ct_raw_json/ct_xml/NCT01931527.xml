  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn more about what is the effect of uric acid on
      oxidative stress and on the way the body metabolizes sugar in obese people. Understanding
      this may lead to better diseases such as diabetes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It has been hypothesized that oxidative stress is involved in the pathogenesis of insulin
      resistance associated with obesity. Circulating uric acid (UA) is the body's major
      endogenous plasma antioxidant. Therefore, the investigators evaluated whether alterations in
      serum UA concentration affect: 1) systemic and skeletal muscle oxidative stress, 2) total
      antioxidant capacity, and 4) skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity during a
      hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp.

    <description>Uric acid will be reduced to 0 with a 30 minute infusion of a uricase (Elitek, Sanofi-Aventis). A hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp procedure in conjunction with stable isotope glucose tracer infusion will be used to measure skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity in obese subjects with high uric acid before and after uric acid reduction.</description>
