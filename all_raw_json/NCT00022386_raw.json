Determine the clinical\n      outcomes in these patients receiving this drug.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive epoetin alfa subcutaneously once\n      weekly for up to 24 weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. Quality of life is\n      assessed at baseline, at week 13, and at study completion.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 2,500 patients will be accrued for this study."
