  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to see if brighter lights will allow us to shorten the treatment
      time required to stabilize the eyes of patients with keratoconus or a bulging cornea.  The
      investigators will be comparing the therapeutic effects of two different higher brightnesses
      of ultra violet light on a riboflavin treated eye.  One light will be twice as bright as the
      other and the exposure time of these brighter lights to deliver equivalent energy to the
      cornea will be reduced from the standard 30 minutes to 10 and 5 minutes.  Riboflavin is
      vitamin B12 and the investigators are trying to determine if they can get an identical
      clinical effect when they use the brighter treatment lights for shorter times.  The
      investigators will also monitor the clinical effect and the status of the cornea to see if
      additional risks are associated with the brighter light.

    <description>To assess the hypothesis the higher irradiance produces the same pattern of change, we will measure the depth and intensity of the stromal changes using Optical Coherence Tomography. An identical pattern of depth and intensity o fstromal change in the cornea for both the low and high irradiances will demonstrate that the nature of the photochemical interaction is identical.  If, on the other hand, the higher irradiance creates a different effect as seen on the OCT, then the hypothesis of equivalence must be questioned.</description>

    <description>The device's light emitting diode (LED) is used to deliver a metered dose of UV-A light to a targeted treatment area for illuminating the cornea during corneal collagen cross-linking.
The aperture setting will be set at 10 mm, and the eye will be irradiated for 10 minutes for the high irradiance exposure of 9 mW/cm2.  During the exposure, instillation of riboflavin will continue (1 drop every 3 minutes).</description>

    <intervention_name>Riboflavin 0.1% ophthalmic solution</intervention_name>
    <description>The speculum is removed and one (1) drop of Riboflavin 0.1% ophthalmic solution will be instilled topically in the eye every 3 minutes for 30 minutes. At the end of the 30 minute riboflavin pre-treatment period, the eye will be examined to assure the presence of a yellow flare in the anterior chamber, indicating riboflavin saturation of the corneal tissue. If the yellow flare is not detected, riboflavin will continue to be instilled until the presence of the yellow flare in the anterior chamber is confirmed.
During UVA irradiation, instillation of riboflavin will be continued every 3 minutes. For a 30-minute pre-treatment and 30-minute irradiation, the total dose of riboflavin solution is approximately 32 drops, or 1.6 ml (1 drop = 0.05 ml; 1.6 mL = 1.6 mg riboflavin).</description>
