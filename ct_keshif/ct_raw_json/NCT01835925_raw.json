For example lung\n      adenocarcinomas with an EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) mutation can be targeted\n      with an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor achieve striking and durable responses and improved\n      survival. Another example is the identification of the echinoderm microtubule-associated\n      protein-like 4/anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene fusions which have led to significant\n      therapeutic gains in the small percentage of patients with lung adenocarcinoma whose cancers\n      exhibit this mutation. Specific mutations have been found in colon cancer and specific drugs\n      targeting these gene alterations are in development. As future therapeutic protocols\n      specific for these mutations are developed, patients who agree may be notified of their\n      eligibility for these studies.\n\n      The aims of this study are to link mutational analyses with clinical outcome. It is\n      recommended that patients receive 8 cycles of mFOLFOX6 (modified FOLFOX) and 50.4 Gy\n      radiation with concurrent fluoropyrimidine."
