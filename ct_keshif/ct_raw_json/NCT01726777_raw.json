            "textblock": "Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is an increasingly prevalent and serious condition whose risk appears\n      to be increased by low serum vitamin D concentrations.  Epidemiological studies show an\n      association between increased diabetes risk and low serum vitamin D and studies suggest that\n      vitamin D may protect against diabetes by reducing chronic inflammation and improving\n      insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion.  Although clinical studies show some of these\n      effects, no studies have been able to show that vitamin D supplementation reduces\n      post-prandial blood glucose, the most clinically relevant marker of diabetes and\n      dysglycemia.  Previously, the investigators showed that cheddar cheese and low-fat cheese\n      can be fortified with high levels of vitamin D3 (28,000IU/ 30g portion) and that, in this\n      form, it is at least as a effective as vitamin D3 supplements in raising serum vitamin D\n      concentrations.  Since post-prandial glucose is most sensitive to changes in insulin\n      sensitivity the main purpose of this study is to determine the effect of vitamin D\n      supplementation on oral glucose tolerance (ie. serum glucose 2h after 75g oral glucose) in\n      individuals who are at risk for developing T2D.  Secondary objective are to determine the\n      effect of vitamin D supplementation on insulin sensitivity, insulin secretion, inflammatory\n      markers, blood lipids and markers of safety including serum parathyroid hormone levels and\n      urinary calcium excretion."
