Chemotherapy uses different\n      ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Peripheral stem cell\n      transplantation may be able to replace immune cells that were destroyed by\n      radioimmunotherapy or chemotherapy used to kill tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of radioimmunotherapy with or without\n      doxorubicin plus peripheral stem cell transplantation in treating patients who have thyroid\n      cancer."

Determine the maximum tolerated dose and dose limiting toxicities of high\n      dose yttrium Y 90 monoclonal antibody MN-14 with or without doxorubicin plus peripheral\n      blood stem cell rescue in patients with medullary thyroid cancer. II. Correlate organ and\n      tumor dosimetry with toxicity and antitumor responses in these patients. III. Assess\n      response and duration of response in these patients after this treatment.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of yttrrium Y 90 monoclonal antibody MN-14\n      (90Y-MN-14). Patients are stratified by prior doxorubicin (yes vs no). Patients receive\n      filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SQ) on days -11 to -7 and undergo leukapheresis on days\n      -8 to -6. If an adequate number of CD34+ cells are not harvested, bone marrow is also\n      collected. Patients receive pretherapy targeting consisting of indium In 111 monoclonal\n      antibody MN-14 (In111-MN-14) on day 0. At least 1 confirmed tumor site must be targeted.\n      Patients receive 90Y-MN-14 IV over 30-45 minutes on day 7. Some patients also receive\n      doxorubicin IV on day 8. PBSC or bone marrow is reinfused on approximately day 7-14.\n      Patients also receive G-CSF SQ or IV until blood counts recover. Cohorts of 3-6 patients\n      receive escalating radiological doses of 90Y-MN-14 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is\n      determined. The MTD is defined as either the dose at which no more than 1 of 6 patients\n      experiences dose limiting toxicity or the threshold radiation doses to lungs, kidneys, and\n      liver. Patients are followed weekly for the first month, monthly for 3 months, then every 6\n      months for up to 5 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 30 patients will be accrued for each stratum of this study\n      within 3 years."
