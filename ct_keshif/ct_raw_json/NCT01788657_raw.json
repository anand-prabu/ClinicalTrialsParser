The condensed material consists of 30000\n      words and will be available as text files and on audio files. The standard material consists\n      of 60000 words and is only available as text files. Both groups will have the possibility of\n      e-mail contact with a personal therapist during the treatment.\n\n      Patients will be recruited within \u00d6rebro County by referrals and self-referrals. The goal is\n      to recruit between 200 and 300 patients during 2 years. The treatment time will be 10 weeks\n      and all patients will be assessed for depression at an interview with a psychologist. There\n      will also be interviews after treatment and one year after treatment. The most important\n      outcome will be depressive symptoms."
