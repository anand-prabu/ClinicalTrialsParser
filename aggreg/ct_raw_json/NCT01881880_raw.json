MRI is considered as the most sensible exam for this staging. However it\n      has a low specificity and it may result in extra testing and stress for the patient, add to\n      costs, and delay treatment. By contrast, Tomosynthesis is performed during the same time\n      than mammography and has a good specificity. Although this modality is very promising, it\n      has not been assessed in a population of consecutive patients.\n\n      Study objectives: To compare the diagnostic performance of preoperative bilateral Combo mode\n      (MG+Tomosynthesis) versus mammography among women with breast cancer for the detection of\n      additional multifocal, multicentric, and contralateral cancers."
