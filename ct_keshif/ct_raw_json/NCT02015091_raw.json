            "textblock": "Background:\n\n      - People bitten by mosquitoes carrying weakened malaria parasites could fight off the\n      disease if later exposed to normal malaria parasites. Scientists have discovered how to make\n      the weakened parasites, which can be injected by the PfSPZ vaccine. Researchers want to see\n      if people who receive the vaccine get malaria after being bitten in a controlled setting (a\n      controlled human malaria infection, CHMI).\n\n      Objective:\n\n      - To see if the PfSPZ malaria vaccine is safe and prevents malaria in a controlled setting.\n\n      Eligibility:\n\n      - Healthy adults 18   45 years old.\n\n      Design:\n\n        -  Participants will be screened with medical history, physical exam, blood and lab tests,\n           and EKG.\n\n        -  Participants will be split into 8 groups, to be in the study for 3   12 months.\n\n        -  Participants will receive 3   5 vaccinations, injected by a needle in an arm vein or\n           muscle.\n\n        -  Participants will keep a health diary and be contacted by phone.\n\n        -  For CHMI, a cup with mosquitoes carrying malaria is applied to participants    arm for\n           5 minutes. Five mosquitoes at a time are used, until 5 have bitten. Some groups will be\n           exposed to malaria more than once.\n\n        -  After CHMI, participants will visit the clinic very frequently (including daily visits\n           for 12 days)  for 28 days.\n\n        -  Blood will be drawn at most visits, from 1 to 20 tubes. Physical exam and medical\n           history may also be repeated\n\n        -  Participants who develop malaria will be treated immediately at the clinic. Standard\n           treatment takes 72 hours. Malaria symptoms may last up to 3 days."

This vaccine administered at 1.35 x 10(5) SPZ\n      per injection by the IV route on a schedule of 5 vaccinations was previously shown to confer\n      protection in all vaccinated subjects against Controlled Human Malaria Infections (CHMI)\n      performed shortly after last vaccination; however there was limited durability of protection\n      in a small number of subjects. in this study, 1.35 x 10(5) SPZ per injection by the IV route\n      will be given to substantiate the initial results with this dose for protection against\n      CHMI. In addition, 2.7 x 10(5) SPZ IV per injection on schedules of 3 to 5 vaccinations will\n      be evaluated for protection against CHMI conducted at 3 weeks and 24 weeks after completion\n      of vaccinations. Also, one group will receive 2.2 x 10(6) SPZ IM, with half of the amount\n      administered in each arm on a schedule with 4 vaccination time-points.\n\n      The primary objectives of the study are related to the safety and tolerability of\n      vaccinations by the IV and IM routes of administration and protection against Plasmodium\n      falciparum (Pf) challenge performed via a well-established CHMI procedure early (2-4 weeks)\n      after completing schedules of 3 to 5 vaccinations. The secondary objective is related to the\n      durability of protection at 20-26 weeks after the last vaccination and exploratory\n      objectives are related to the immunogenicity of the PfSPZ Vaccine and identifying potential\n      immune correlates of protection."
