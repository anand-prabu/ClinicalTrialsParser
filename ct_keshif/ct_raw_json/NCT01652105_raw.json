In the\n      United States, about 6 million people currently have a BMI of > 40 kg/m\u00b2 and another 10\n      million people have a BMI of > 35 kg/m\u00b2 with comorbidities. Worldwide, the incidence of\n      morbid obesity has doubled and about 300 million people are now obese. In the Netherlands\n      the prevalence is less disturbing but the incidence of morbid obesity is rising\n      progressively to 1.5% of the total population. At this moment surgical therapy is the only\n      treatment option for these patients that results in sufficient long-term weight loss.\n      Non-surgical approaches, like low energy diets and behavior modification, are not successful\n      in the long-term with respect to maintaining weight loss and decreasing obesity-related\n      comorbidities.\n\n      In order to increase weight loss and minimize complications a preoperative diet before\n      bariatric has been advocated. However, the usual VLCD's are poorly tolerated by patients. In\n      this study we aim to compare two preoperative diets in order to find the most suitable for\n      this patient population."
