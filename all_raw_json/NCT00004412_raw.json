Compare the efficacy of local care alone vs local care plus arginine\n      butyrate in terms of healing rate in patients with refractory sickle cell ulcers.\n\n      II.

Arm I: Patients receive arginine butyrate IV over 6-9 hours at night 5\n      days a week for 12 weeks, plus concurrent standard local therapy consisting of cleaning,\n      saline irrigation, and dressing changes as prescribed by each patient's physician.  Patients\n      who experience progressive healing receive arginine butyrate 3-4 times a week.  Arginine\n      butyrate treatment may be discontinued and reinstated following a single 2 week medical\n      complication.\n\n      Arm II: Patients receive standard local therapy only for 12 weeks. Patients randomized to\n      arm II may cross over to receive arginine butyrate if no or less than 25% healing is\n      observed after 12 weeks.\n\n      Patients whose ulcers have closed by at least 15% per course may receive 2 additional 8-week\n      courses of arginine butyrate therapy and are followed for 2 months after healing is\n      completed."
