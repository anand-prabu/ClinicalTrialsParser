            "textblock": "Study Drug Administration:\n\n      If you are found to be eligible for this study, you will begin the first cycle of treatment\n      with carfilzomib.  Each cycle is 28 days.\n\n      On Days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16 of Cycles 1-12:\n\n      -You will receive carfilzomib by vein over 30 minutes.  The first 2 doses you receive may be\n      lower than later doses.  This is to reduce the risk of an allergic reaction.\n\n      On Days 1, 2, 15, and 16 of Cycles 13 and beyond:\n\n      -You will receive carfilzomib by vein over 30 minutes.\n\n      You should drink at least 6-8 cups (8 ounces each) of fluid per day starting 2 days before\n      your first day of treatment and for as long as your doctor asks you to.  During Cycles 1 and\n      2, you will receive fluids by vein before and after your dose of carfilzomib.\n\n      Before you receive carfilzomib, you will be given standard drugs (such as allopurinol,\n      dexamethasone, antibiotics, anti-fungals, and/or anti-virals) to help decrease the risk of\n      side effects.  You may ask the study staff for information about how the drugs are given and\n      their risks.\n\n      When you receive the drugs during Cycle 1 and on Day 1 of Cycle 2, you will be monitored for\n      side effects for 1 hour after you receive the study drug.\n\n      Study Visits:\n\n      On Day 1 of all cycles:\n\n        -  You will have a physical exam.\n\n        -  You will have a neurological exam.\n\n        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.\n\n        -  If your doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a bone marrow biopsy and/or\n           aspiration to check the status of the disease.\n\n        -  If you are able to become pregnant, you will have a blood (about 1\u00bd tablespoons) or\n           urine pregnancy test.\n\n      On Days 2, 9, and 16 of all cycles:\n\n      -Your vital signs will be measured.\n\n      On Days 8 and 15 of all cycles:\n\n        -  You will have a physical exam.\n\n        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.\n\n        -  If you are able to become pregnant, you will have a blood (about 1\u00bd tablespoons) or\n           urine pregnancy test.\n\n      On Day 1 of Cycles 2, 4, 6, and so on up to Cycle 12, then every 3 cycles after that:\n\n        -  If the study doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a CT scan, MRI, PET scan, and/or\n           PET/CT scan to check the status of the disease.\n\n        -  If the study doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a gastrointestinal endoscopy or\n           colonoscopy.\n\n      Length of Study:\n\n      You may continue taking the study drug for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best\n      interest.  You will no longer be able to take the drug if the disease gets worse, if\n      intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.\n\n      Your participation on the study will be over once you have completed the long term follow-up\n      phone calls.\n\n      End-of-Treatment Visit:\n\n      Within about 30 days, after you finish taking the study drug you will return to the clinic\n      for the following tests and procedures:\n\n        -  You will have a physical exam.\n\n        -  You will have a neurological exam.\n\n        -  You will have an EKG to check your heart function.\n\n        -  Blood (about 3-5 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check the status\n           of the disease.\n\n        -  You will have a CT scan and/or x-ray to check the status of the disease.\n\n        -  You will have a PET/CT scan to check the status of the disease.\n\n        -  If your doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a bone marrow biopsy and/or\n           aspiration\n\n        -  If you doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a colonoscopy/gastrointestinal\n           endoscopy.\n\n        -  If you are able to become pregnant, you will have a blood (about 1\u00bd tablespoons) or\n           urine pregnancy test.\n\n      Long Term Follow-Up:\n\n      After your end-of-treatment visit, you will be called every 6 months for 1 year to see how\n      you are doing and to find out about any other treatments you have received since you stopped\n      study treatment.  These calls will take about 2-3 minutes.  In addition to the phone calls,\n      your medical records may be reviewed as well.\n\n      This is an investigational study.  Carfilzomib is FDA approved and commercially available\n      for the treatment of certain types of multiple myeloma.  This drug is investigational for\n      the treatment of MCL.\n\n      Up to 60 participants will be enrolled on this study.  All will be enrolled at MD Anderson."
