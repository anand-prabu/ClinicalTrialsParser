  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is frequently over-expressed in primary breast cancer. There is
      evidence that COX-2 inhibition exerts anti-tumor effects in breast cancer. To further
      determine the effect of COX-2 inhibition in primary breast cancer, we aimed at studying the
      changes in breast cancer tissues of patients treated with the selective COX-2 inhibitor
      celecoxib.

      In a single-centre double-blinded phase II study, breast cancer patients were randomised to
      receive either pre-operative celecoxib (400 mg) or placebo twice daily for two to three
      weeks. We collected fresh-frozen pre-surgical biopsies (before treatment) and surgical
      excision specimens (after treatment) to assess the tumor changes by use a cDNA microarray,
      which allows to study the genome-wide changes at the transcriptional level.
