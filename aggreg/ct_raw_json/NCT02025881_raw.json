A Bayesian approach will be used to analyse the EFS, assuming a cure model. We will\n      use three prior distributions of the EFS; (1) an enthusiastic prior distribution, (2) a\n      pessimistic prior distribution, and (3) a non-informative prior distribution. As the patient\n      outcomes in the trial will be recorded, the subsequent distribution of the outcome\n      probability under experimental treatment will be computed by applying Bayes' theorem, which\n      yields an estimated EFS probability with a 95% credibility interval (measure of Bayesian\n      precision). Two interim analyses are planned to monitor the efficacy data (early stopping\n      rules for futility or inefficacy).\n\n      The final analysis of efficacy will be made on an intention to treat basis, including all\n      recruited patients, 3 years after recruitment of the last patient.\n\n      Due to the uncertainty on the dose of cyclophosphamide that can be given in combination with\n      Busilvex for the last chemotherapy course in patients in complete response after\n      intensification chemotherapy treatment, a dose-finding subtrial will be performed to address\n      this issue (Phase I part). The dose escalation of cyclophosphamide will be performed using\n      the Continual Reassessment Method in a Bayesian framework."
