To assess changes in\n      cardiovascular risk, quality of life and lifestyles, secondarily. Methods: A randomized\n      clinical trial with a control group, of one year of follow-up, carried out in four MHC\n      Barcelona and Santa Coloma, and PCT of reference. The investigators studied patients aged 18\n      - 65 years old, diagnosed with schizophrenia, schizoaffective or bipolar disorder, with\n      antipsychotic medication and a low level of PA. 240 patients will be selected in each group\n      (difference to be detected in the BMI:> 1.89 kg/m2; common SD: 6.2, 30% loss). Intervention:\n      group educational PA program (basically walking) of 24 sessions over 12 weeks, and diet (8\n      sessions in the first 8 weeks) by nurses and specialists in PA. Key measurements: level of\n      PA (IPAQ questionnaire), physical examinations: BMI, waist circumference, blood pressure,\n      cardiovascular risk, quality of life (SF-36), smoking habits, dietary habits (PREDIMED\n      questionnaire), analytical parameters: cholesterol , triglycerides, blood glucose.\n      Evaluations will be masked and conducted at 0, 3, 6 and 12 months. Analysis of variance for\n      repeated measures to adjust for differences attributable to the effect of the intervention\n      for potential confounders: pharmacological treatment, care level of intervention and mental\n      state."
