The ideal case is to be\n      able to demonstrate a (near) complete recovery (\u226595 %) of the administered dose.\n\n      A good understanding of the metabolic pathway of the study drug is equally important.\n      Mass-balance data, together with metabolic profiles in excreta, are used to characterize the\n      biotransformation pathways of a drug and to help evaluate its drug-drug interaction\n      potential.\n\n      To this purpose, in this study, blood, urine, and feces are collected to investigate the\n      metabolic profile of GFT505, and plasma and urine are collected to investigate the\n      non-radioactive pharmacokinetics of GFT505 and its principle metabolite GFT1007. Other\n      metabolites will be investigated in plasma and urine according to the radioactivity results.\n      Non-radioactive pharmacokinetics of GFT505 and metabolites in feces will be investigated\n      according to the radioactivity results."
