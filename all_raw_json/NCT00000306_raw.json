All subjects will receive methadone.  For the treatment of cocaine\n      dependence, subjects will receive one of 2 doses of dextroamphetamine (15 or 30mg) or\n      placebo.  After 4 weeks of treatment the dose level of dextroamphetamine is doubled (30 or\n      60mg). This dose is maintained for 20 weeks; during which subjects attend twice weekly\n      visits to the clinic and receive weekly cognitive behavioral therapy.  Follow up evaluations\n      will be conducted out to 3 months post treatment.  Subjects will be assisted in transferring\n      to Houston area methadone clinics to maintain treatment for opiate dependence following\n      treatment completion."
