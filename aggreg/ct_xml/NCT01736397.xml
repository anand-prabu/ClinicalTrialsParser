    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if KRX-0502 (ferric citrate) is a safe and
      effective treatment for the management of serum phosphorus levels and iron deficiency in
      anemic chronic kidney disease (CKD) subjects not on dialysis.  Total length of treatment is
      approximately 12 weeks.

      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, three-period, multi-center clinical
      trial. Following a Screening and Qualification Period and a two-week Washout Period (for
      those subjects entering the study on a phosphate binder), eligible subjects will be
      randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either KRX-0502 (ferric citrate) or placebo for up to
      approximately 12 weeks. The purpose of this study is to determine if KRX-0502 (ferric
      citrate) is a safe and effective treatment for the management of serum phosphorus levels and
      iron deficiency in anemic CKD subjects not on dialysis.
