Therefore, the choice of treatment is determined by\n      availability and local expertise for each method. The variability of treatment options range\n      from anti-inflammatory medical treatment, sucralfate, short chain fatty acids, antioxidants\n      and hyperbaric oxygen  to such endoscopic and surgical treatments. Surgery is usually the\n      last therapeutic option due to the high morbidity and mortalityassociated. Various\n      endoscopic treatment modalities have been reported. Formalin topic is effective in up to 48%\n      of patients with chronic radiation proctitis.\n\n      The endoscopic treatment with argon plasma (APC) is low cost, easy to apply and\n      transportation, safe and effective in the treatment of rectal bleeding in patients with\n      chronic radiation proctitis. Currently, the APC is the preferred endoscopic modality.\n\n      Most studies on the use of APC in radiation proctitis showed benefit. The APC controls the\n      mild to moderate rectal bleeding in 80%  to 90% of cases and improves symptoms of urgency,\n      diarrhea and tenesmus in 60% to 75% of cases."
