Indeed, other\n      investigational drugs aiming at beta cells preservation have shown that patients who were\n      initially treated and maintained their initial beta-cell function, required continuation of\n      treatment or they lost the beta-cell function.\n\n      Therefore, in this extension study, patients who were previously treated with AAT and\n      maintained clinically significant beta-cell function are offered a continuation of\n      treatment, since they are likely to benefit from use of the medication.\n\n      The proposed study is aimed to assess the long term effect of AAT in subjects with type 1\n      diabetes mellitus: safety and tolerability of treatment, and effect on beta-cell function.\n\n      Subjects who have completed all visits of the 008 study will be offered to participate in\n      the extension study.\n\n      The study will be consist off two main arms as following:\n\n      Arm 1: Subjects who maintained peak stimulated C-peptide secretion \u2265 0.2 nmol/L will\n      continue treatment with AAT for up to 18 treatments according to the dosage group they were\n      allocated to in the 008 study.\n\n      Arm 2:\n\n      Subjects who have not maintained peak stimulated C-peptide secretion  \u2265 0.2nmol/L and\n      subjects with peak stimulated C -peptide secretion \u2265 0.2 nmol/L who are reluctant to receive\n      additional study drug.\n\n      Clinical follow up for all subjects in both arms will be for 3 years"
