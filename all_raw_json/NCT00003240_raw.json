Assess whether the addition of cisplatin-based chemotherapy to standard\n      treatment improves survival in patients with non-small cell lung cancer.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. Arm\n      I: Patients undergo primary surgery, radical radiotherapy, radiotherapy with surgery, or\n      best supportive care. Arm II: Patients undergo treatment as in arm I. Beginning within 10\n      weeks after surgery or radical radiotherapy or as soon as possible after diagnosis, patients\n      receive 1 of the following regimens: Regimen A: Patients receive cisplatin IV on day 1\n      followed by vindesine on days 1 and 8. Regimen B: Patients receive mitomycin, ifosfamide,\n      and cisplatin on day 1. Regimen C: Patients receive mitomycin, vinblastine, and cisplatin on\n      day 1. Regimen D: Patients receive vinorelbine on days 1 and 8 and cisplatin on day 1.\n      Treatment in all 4 regimens repeats every 3 weeks for 3 courses. Patients are followed at 3\n      months, 6 months, 1 year, and then annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 1,800 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years."
