Assess the tumor\n      response, toxic effect, and survival rate of this regimen in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment is repeated every 3\n      weeks for 3 courses. Patients are followed every 3 months posttreatment.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 16-35 patients will be accrued for this study."
