  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ABC PICU is a randomized clinical trial that will compare the clinical consequences of RBC
      storage duration in 1538 critically ill children. Laboratory and observational evidence
      points to serious concerns about the lack of safety and effectiveness of older RBCs,
      especially in more vulnerable populations. Physicians and institutions have been
      systematically transfusing fresh RBCs to some pediatric patients primarily because of
      beliefs that the use of fresh RBCs improve outcomes.  Conversely, the standard practice of
      blood banks is to deliver the oldest RBC unit in order to decrease blood wastage. To provide
      much needed high quality evidence to answer the question &quot;do RBCs of reduced storage
      duration improve outcomes?&quot; The ABC PICU Trial will conduct a RCT comparing development of
      New or Progressive Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome (NPMODS) in critically ill children
      transfused with either RBCs stored ≤ 7 days or standard issue RBCs (expected mean RBC
      storage duration of 17-21 days).

    <description>The primary outcome measure of this RCT is NPMODS defined as the proportion of patients who die during the 28 days after randomization or who develop NPMODS.  For patients with no organ dysfunction at randomization, New MODS is the development of ≥ 2 concurrent organ dysfunctions during the 28 days after randomization. For patients with 1 organ dysfunction at randomization, New MODS is the development of at least 1 other concurrent organ dysfunction after randomization. Patients with MODS (ie concurrent dysfunction of ≥ 2 organ systems) at randomization can develop Progressive MODS defined as development of at least 1 additional concurrent organ dysfunction at during the 28 days after randomization. All deaths will be considered Progressive MODS. NPMODS will be monitored up to 28 days or ICU discharge because it is almost never observed beyond this time in children.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Patients are considered eligible to participate in the trial if one of the following
        occur:

          1. First RBC transfusion is requested within the first 7 days (168 hours) of ICU
             admission.

             OR

          2. First RBC transfusion is requested for a patient in the Emergency Room, and the PICU
             team is involved with the clinical care of the patient, and the patient will
             definitively be transferred to the ICU.

             OR

             post-operatively, and who is determined to definitively require a first RBC
