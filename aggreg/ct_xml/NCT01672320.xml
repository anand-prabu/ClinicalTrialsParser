  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are to evaluate the clinical value of robotic-assisted total
      hip arthroplasty with respect to acetabular cup implantation, and to document the long-term
      clinical outcome of patients with Total Hip Arthroplasty  (THA). IRB approval will be
      obtained at every study site to evaluate the basic clinical outcomes and post-operative
      component placement accuracy of each MAKOÂ® THA patient.

      The hypothesis is that robotic preparation of the acetabulum will significantly reduce the
      variability and inaccuracy in the component alignment parameters that lead to post-operative
      complications, including implant failure.
