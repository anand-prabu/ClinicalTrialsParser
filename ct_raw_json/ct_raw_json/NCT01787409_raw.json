To determine if vitamin D replacement in vitamin D insufficient patients with newly\n      diagnosed untreated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) can improve event free survival at\n      12 months to be equivalent to that of a control population of vitamin D sufficient patients.\n      (Study I) II. To determine if vitamin D replacement in vitamin D insufficient patients with\n      early stage chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) being managed with observation can improve\n      the percentage of patients requiring treatment with conventional therapy at 36 months to\n      that of a control population of vitamin D sufficient patients. (Study II) III. To determine\n      the incidence of vitamin D insufficiency in Alaska Native People with untreated breast\n      cancer and colorectal cancer. (Study III)\n\n      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. To assess the effect of vitamin D replacement in vitamin D insufficient patients with\n      newly diagnosed untreated DLBCL on overall survival. (Study I) II.
