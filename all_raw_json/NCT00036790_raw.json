Motexafin gadolinium may increase the effectiveness of\n      doxorubicin by making tumor cells more sensitive to the drug.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combining motexafin gadolinium with\n      doxorubicin in treating patients who have recurrent or metastatic cancer."

Patients are assigned to 1 of 2\n      groups.\n\n      Group A:\n\n        -  Course 1: Patients receive motexafin gadolinium IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, 9, and\n           10 and doxorubicin IV over 15 minutes on day 8.\n\n        -  Course 2: 28 days after the beginning of course 1, patients receive doxorubicin IV over\n           15 minutes.\n\n        -  Courses 3-6: Beginning 21 days after course 2, patients receive doxorubicin IV over 15\n           minutes on day 1 and motexafin gadolinium IV over 30 minutes on days 1-3. Treatment\n           repeats every 21 days.\n\n      Group B:\n\n        -  Course 1: Patients receive motexafin gadolinium IV over 30 minutes on day 1 and\n           doxorubicin IV over 15 minutes on day 8.\n\n        -  Course 2: 28 days after the beginning of course 1, patients receive doxorubicin IV over\n           15 minutes on day 1 and motexafin gadolinium IV over 30 minutes on days 1-3.\n\n        -  Courses 3-6: Beginning 21 days after course 2, patients receive doxorubicin and\n           motexafin gadolinium as in group A.\n\n      Treatment in both groups continues for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease\n      progression, unacceptable toxicity, or a cumulative doxorubicin dose of 450 mg/m^2.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of doxorubicin and motexafin gadolinium\n      until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the highest dose\n      at which no more than 0 of 3 or 1 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed at 1 and 2 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-48 patients will be accrued for this study."
