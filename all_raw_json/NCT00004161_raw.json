Determine whether\n      fenretinide will cause significant modulation of intermediate endpoint markers and\n      significant regression of oral dysplastic leukoplakia in this patient population. III.\n      Compare the ability of fenretinide and placebo to modulate surrogate endpoint biomarkers in\n      this patient population. IV. Document the degree of recurrence of oral dysplastic\n      leukoplakia after the administration of fenretinide, both at the same site and at new sites.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled study. Patients are\n      randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms: Arm I: Patients receive oral fenretinide daily (except\n      days 1-3 each month) for 6 months. Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo daily (except days\n      1-3 each month) for 6 months. Patients then receive oral fenretinide daily (except days 1-3\n      each month) for 6 months. Patients are followed every 3 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study."
