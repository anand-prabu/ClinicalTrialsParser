Twenty subjects with chronic (greater than 6 months)\n      complete or incomplete SCI with a neurological level of injury above T10 will be randomly\n      assigned to first undergo whole body vibration while standing on a tilt table for multiple\n      treatments for a total of approximately 14 minutes followed by a one-hour break and then\n      tilt-table standing alone for the same amount of time or vice versa. Spasticity monitoring\n      will be evaluated prior to, during and after each treatment with physical examination\n      electrophysiological monitoring and subject impression. We hypothesize that treatment\n      following the combination of whole body vibration with tilt table standing compared to tilt\n      table standing alone will result in a greater decrease spasticity measured by change in\n      combined Modified Ashworth Scale score and at the individual joints evaluated, change in\n      H-reflex amplitude, changed in H-reflex to M wave ratio (H:M ratio), and subject global\n      impression."
