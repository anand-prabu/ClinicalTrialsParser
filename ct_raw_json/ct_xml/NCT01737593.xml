  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Emergence agitation (EA) occurs in up to 67% of pediatric patients after anesthesia for
      bilateral myringotomy tubes (BMT, &quot;ear tubes&quot;). The goal of this study is to find out
      whether acetaminophen given well before surgery can decrease pain and therefore, decrease
      emergence agitation better than acetaminophen given shortly before or during surgery. EA can
      be dangerous for the patient because it may be hard to monitor their vital signs during an
      important phase of recovery, they may injure themselves, may require the presence of extra
      staff, and it can be very distressing to the parents. Causes of EA are not well understood,
      but it can be worsened by pain. 70% of patients undergoing BMT experience pain that needs
      treatment. Intranasal fentanyl, a strong analgesic, has been shown to decrease EA, but often
      ends up in dose-dependent nausea and vomiting. In previous studies and in common practice,
      acetaminophen is given either 30 minutes before induction of anesthesia or immediately after
      induction. The peak analgesic effect of acetaminophen is 60-120 minutes. Since the procedure
      is generally completed in 5-10 minutes, the therapeutic effect of acetaminophen may not be
      present upon emergence from anesthesia.

      The purpose of this study is to find out if acetaminophen given 60-120 minutes prior to
      emergence can decrease EA in patients undergoing BMT. Patients would be randomized to one of
      three groups: Control will receive acetaminophen rectally while under anesthesia (standard
      practice), Group 1 will receive acetaminophen 10 mg/kg at 60-120 minutes prior to surgery,
      Group 2 will receive acetaminophen 20 mg/kg at 60-120 minutes prior to surgery. All groups
      would also receive a dose of intranasal fentanyl during the surgery, which is standard
      practice. Patients would be observed in the recovery room at various time points for
      evidence of EA and pain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Emergence agitation (EA) occurs in up to 67% of patients undergoing Sevoflurane anesthesia
      for bilateral myringotomy tube placement (BMT). Often EA presents as inconsolable screaming,
      crying, thrashing, and kicking, and may require restraints. It can be dangerous for the
      patient because it may be difficult to monitor their vital signs during a critical phase of
      recovery (i.e. unable to detect hypoxemia), they may injure themselves as they thrash about,
      it usually requires the presence of extra staff, and it can be very distressing to the
      parents. Causes of EA are theoretical, but can be exacerbated by pain. 70% of patients
      undergoing BMT have pain requiring treatment. Since BMT is performed without IV placement
      the options for analgesia are limited to intranasal fentanyl, intramuscular ketorolac,
      rectal or oral acetaminophen, oral opioids (i.e. codeine, oxycodone). Intranasal Fentanyl
      has been shown to decrease EA, but results in post operative nausea and vomiting, as with
      any opioids. Intramuscular ketorolac is costly and can lead to hematomas. In previous
      studies (common practice), acetaminophen is given either 30 minutes before induction (PO
      route) or immediately after induction (PR route). Since the procedure is generally completed
      in 5-10 minutes, the therapeutic effect of acetaminophen can not be appreciated. The peak
      effect (for analgesia) of acetaminophen is 60-120 minutes. Our hypothesis: If acetaminophen
      is given 60-120 minutes prior to emergence, when it reaches therapeutic effect, it can
      decrease EA in patients undergoing BMT. The importance of mitigating EA not only involves
      patient safety and satisfaction, but will also impact hospital/surgery center efficiency (RN
      staffing and smoother and shorter recovery periods).

      This study will be a randomized controlled trial. Potential subjects will be identified and
      recruited by study personnel and/or patient's surgeon. Children scheduled for BMT placement
      whose parents' consent to participate will be enrolled in the study. These patients will be
      consented on the day of surgery. Parents will be informed that whether they enroll their
      children in the study or not, they will be receiving standard clinical care. Only subjects
      meeting all inclusion criteria and requirements for continuation in the study will be
      consented.

      Patients will be enrolled into one of three study groups. All patients meeting all inclusion
      criteria and requirements for the study (see below) will be identified, consented then
      computer randomized into either control, group 1 or 2.

      Control - acetaminophen PR (20-40mg/kg) after induction of Anesthesia (acetaminophen is in
      suppository form and given rectally) Group 1 - acetaminophen PO (10mg/kg) 60-120min before
      start of BMT placement (acetaminophen is in syrup form and given by mouth) Group 2 -
      acetaminophen PO (20mg/kg) 60-120min before start of BMT placement (acetaminophen is in
      syrup form and given by mouth)

      After randomization, treating physicians will be made aware of what treatment group the
      patient is assigned to. The data collection and behavior/pain assessments will be made by
      blinded study personnel in the operating room (only for induction) and PACU.

      Data Collection: Data will be collected at the time points: Induction, Emergence
      (spontaneous extremity movement), and every 5 minutes after emergence until the patient is
      discharged. There will also be a follow-up questionnaire for the parent on satisfaction with
      the child's emergence, side effects, additional medications, and his/her PACU experience.
      This will be conducted on the phone within 36 hours after the parents have left the
      hospital.
