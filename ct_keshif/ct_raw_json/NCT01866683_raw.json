However, there is a lack of data addressing the effects of such\n      interventions on EEG patterns of health fit male subjects, as well as there are no study\n      investigating if there is a relationship between heart autonomic modulation changes and EEG\n      patterns. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of 1 month respiratory\n      yoga training on heart rate variability, EEG, salivary cortisol and quality of life of\n      health fit male subjets."
