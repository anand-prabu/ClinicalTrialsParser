The investigators hope to provide sufficient evidence in directing treatment\n      that will give the most efficacious and the most satisfactory return of prior function to\n      patients.  Since distal radius fractures in the elderly are common because of poorer bone\n      quality, the elderly proportion of the population is increasing, and controlling health\n      costs is of current concern, answering the question of which treatment produces the best\n      results for all these concerns is of increasing importance now."
