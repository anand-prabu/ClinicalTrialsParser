ALS is\n      the most common of the five motor neuron diseases.Riluzole (Rilutek) is the only treatment\n      that has been found to improve survival but only to a modest extent. It lengthens survival\n      by several months, and may have a greater survival benefit for those with a bulbar onset. It\n      also extends the time before a person needs ventilation support.Stem cell transplantation is\n      a new hopeful way to improve the patients conditions and reduce the period of disabilities."
