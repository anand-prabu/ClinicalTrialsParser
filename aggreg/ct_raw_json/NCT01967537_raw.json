The\n      only treatment for NETs is surgery, but most are found when they are too advanced for\n      surgery. Researchers are looking for the best way to find NETs earlier, so that surgery can\n      be successful. They want to test if the study drug can be used along with imaging devices to\n      detect NETs.\n\n      Objectives:\n\n      - To see how well a new experimental imaging agent, 68Gallium-DOTATATE, detects unknown\n      primary and metastatic NETs in the gastrointestinal system and pancreas.\n\n      Eligibility:\n\n      - Adults over 18 years old with a suspected NET or family history of NET.\n\n      Design:\n\n        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history and physical exam, and have a\n           blood test.\n\n        -  Participants will undergo three scans. For all of these, a substance is injected into\n           their body, they lie on a table, and a machine takes images.\n\n      < TAB> - A standard CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.\n\n      < TAB> - An octreotide scintigraphy SPECT/CT.\n\n      < TAB> - A 68Gallium-DOTATATE PET/CT. The study drug is injected into a vein, usually in the\n      arm. Low-dose X-rays go through the body. For about 40 minutes a large, donut-shaped device\n      takes images of the body. The entire session takes 90 to 120 minutes.\n\n        -  Researchers will compare images from the three scans.\n\n        -  Participants will have 1 follow-up visit each year for 5 years. At this visit, they\n           will have a medical exam, blood taken, and a CT scan."

Data will be stored in a computerized database.\n\n        -  After their initial on-study evaluation, patients will be staged according to findings\n           on imaging studies with respect to primary tumor site, size and metastases. Surgical\n           resection of NET and/or medical managements will be recommended based on standard\n           practice guidelines. In patients who undergo surgical treatment, the samples will be\n           immediately stored until molecular analysis.\n\n        -  Follow up will be done yearly for a total duration of 5 years. This includes a yearly\n           imaging study and a biochemical and clinical evaluation, to assess tumor growth and\n           disease progression.\n\n        -  A sample size of 100 patients would result in a 10% width of the 95% confidence\n           interval for an 85% rate of correct classification (accuracy) with this (68)Ga-DOTATATE\n           imaging technique compared to the gold standard diagnosis using (111)In-Octreotide\n           receptor scintigraphy.\n\n        -  An interim analysis will be performed after accruing 50 patients, to evaluate the\n           utility of (68)Ga DOTATATE imaging.\n\n        -  We estimate that the accrual rate will be 3-10 patients per month; the total accrual\n           period for this study will be 10 months to 3 years."
