    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well cabozantinib-s-malate works in treating patients with
      recurrent or metastatic endometrial cancer. Cabozantinib-s-malate may stop the growth of
      tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood
      flow to the tumor.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine efficacy of single agent cabozantinib in women previously receiving one line of
      chemotherapy for metastatic endometrial cancer or with progression within 12 months of
      completing adjuvant therapy, with co-primary endpoints of objective response rate by
      Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 and progression-free-survival at
      12 weeks (PFS).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Correlation of clinical response with: baseline molecular status of archival tumor
      (hepatocyte growth factor receptor [c-met] amplification &amp; mutation status).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive cabozantinib-s-malate orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Courses
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 4 weeks.
