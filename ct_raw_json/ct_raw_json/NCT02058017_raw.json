            "textblock": "This is a lead-in dose escalation study to determine the safety, tolerability,\n      pharmacokinetics, maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and recommended Phase II dose of OPB-51602\n      administered on a weekly basis in subjects with advanced malignancies. Using the recommended\n      phase II dose, the efficacy and tolerability of OPB-51602 administered prior to definitive\n      chemoradiotherapy will be evaluated in locally advanced NPC patients. This study's\n      overarching goal is the development of STAT3 inhibitors as a novel class of anti-cancer\n      agents and the optimization of patient selection for STAT3 inhibitor therapy through\n      parallel biomarker studies. This study hopes to establish a therapeutic window for OPB-51602\n      in solid tumours and will evaluate its potential as a targeted therapy of NPC, since this\n      represents a critical unmet clinical need. The development of predictive and pharmacodynamic\n      biomarkers in tandem with the clinical evaluation of OPB-51602 will be crucial to its\n      therapeutic advancement and will enable an understanding of the genetic contexts of\n      responsiveness and resistance to OPB-51602, which can in turn lead to the development of\n      effective drug combinations to overcome resistance.The study hypothesizes that OPB-51602, a\n      first-in-class STAT3 inhibitor, is efficacious in solid tumours with constitutively\n      activated STAT3, such as NPC."

Using a starting dose of 10mg per week, an accelerated dose titration escalation\n      followed by a 3+3 design will be employed until MTD and recommended weekly dose are\n      determined. Following this, an expansion cohort of 10 patients will be enrolled to establish\n      safety of the recommended phase II dose. Additionally, it is also planned to explore the\n      efficacy of the agent in an enrichment cohort of approximately 10 metastatic NPC patients.\n      One treatment cycle is defined as a period of 28 days. Tumour biopsies will be performed at\n      baseline while blood sampling for circulating biomarkers will be performed on days 1, 2, 3,\n      8, 22 and upon completion of OPB-51602 dosing. Pharmacokinetic sampling will be done on\n      Cycle 1 Days 1, 8 and 22. Safety assessments will be performed weekly till week 8, bi-weekly\n      till week 16, then monthly thereafter and response assessments will be performed every 8\n      weeks.

Response assessment will be performed after OPB-51602 dosing on day 15\n      using PET/CT scans and clinical tumour measurements, while other radiologic assessments will\n      be performed on the completion of chemoradiotherapy. Safety assessments will be performed at\n      weekly intervals until day 22 or until toxicities related to the study treatment have been\n      resolved. Tumour biopsies will be performed at baseline and day 15 while circulating\n      biomarker studies will be performed on days 1, 2, 3, 8, 15 and upon completion of\n      chemoradiotherapy. There is no mandated rest period between the administration of study drug\n      and definitive chemoradiotherapy. The decision to proceed with chemoradiotherapy is at the\n      discretion of individual investigators, provided the subject has recovered or is recovering\n      from all significant toxicities of the study drug. Chemoradiotherapy should be in accordance\n      with the institutional standard and induction chemotherapy is not permitted. Proposed\n      alternative treatment regimens must receive the approval of the Principal Investigator."
