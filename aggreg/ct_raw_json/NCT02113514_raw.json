To accomplish these aims, a case-control study was proposed.  Women age 18 and older\n      with an intact cervix, not pregnant, and no current or past history of invasive cervical\n      cancer are recruited at the time of their scheduled Pap smear from clinics/physician\n      practices in Appalachian region of Ohio.  Women receiving Pap tests at  participating\n      medical clinics/physician practices are recruited for a case control epidemiologic study\n      assessing HPV prevalence and its impact on cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN).\n      Cervical mucus will be collected for Human Papillomavirus (HPV) assays and stored for\n      potential other assays related to HPV. Serum will be drawn for HPV serology and stored for\n      future analysis.  Controls are defined as women with a normal Pap smear.  Cases are defined\n      as women with abnormal Pap smear (from atypical squamous cells of uncertain significance\n      (ASCUS) to cancer."
