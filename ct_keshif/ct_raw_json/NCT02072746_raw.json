Based on our preliminary animal data and other published reports,\n      we expect zinc therapy to achieve all of these goals. Zinc is affordable, available over the\n      counter or by prescription, and has an excellent safety profile. Positive results from this\n      study will show that zinc is a significant therapy for millions of Americans with alcoholic\n      liver disease."

It has been estimated that 15%-30% of heavy drinkers develop advanced Alcoholic\n      liver disease (ALD).  The prevalence of ALD in the United States is conservatively estimated\n      at 2 million persons.  Nearly 50% of liver-related deaths and 30% of hepatocellular\n      carcinomas in the US are due to alcoholic cirrhosis.  Despite recent advances in our\n      understanding of ALD, there is currently no FDA approved medication for any stage of ALD.\n      Zinc sulfate is inexpensive, available over the counter, and has an excellent safety\n      profile.  If zinc positively influences the mechanisms postulated to play a role in human\n      ALD, this affordable treatment would become relevant to millions of people worldwide."
