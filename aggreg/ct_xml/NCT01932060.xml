  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although prior dose-finding studies have investigated the optimal bolus dose of oxytocin to
      initiate adequate uterine tone, it is unclear what oxytocin infusion regimen is required to
      maintain adequate uterine tone after delivery. The study investigators aim to compare two
      different infusion rates of oxytocin to assess the optimal infusion regimen for reducing
      blood loss in women undergoing elective Cesarean delivery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Oxytocin (pitocin) is a drug commonly used in obstetric practice, and the drug effect is to
      increase the muscular tone of the uterus to reduce uterine bleeding after neonatal delivery.
      Pregnant patients undergoing elective (scheduled)Cesarean delivery routinely receive
      oxytocin after delivery of the baby. Post-delivery, oxytocin is commonly administered as an
      IV bolus and/or infusion. No previous studies have accurately assessed differences in
      oxytocin infusions after delivery in patients undergoing elective cesarean delivery. Thus
      the study aim is to investigate which infusion rate can optimally provide adequate
      maintenance of uterine tone during Cesarean delivery while being associated with minimal or
      no maternal side-effects.
