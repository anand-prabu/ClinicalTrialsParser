Combining radiation therapy with chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of radiation therapy followed by\n      bleomycin in treating adult patients who have newly diagnosed supratentorial glioblastoma\n      multiforme."

Patients then receive sustained release bleomycin\n      intratumorally via the reservoir once a week for up to 2 years in the absence of disease\n      progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 2 years, and then\n      annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 72 patients will be accrued for this study within 5 months."
