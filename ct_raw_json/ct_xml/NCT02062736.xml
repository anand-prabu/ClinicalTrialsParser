  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study ( observational and prospective ) is to evaluate the efficacy and
      tolerability  of the methadone maintenance treatment in patients addicted to heroin. The
      efficacy and tolerability are assessed by correlating to the adequacy of the dosage of
      methadone. The patients will be observed for two years.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      500 patients will be selected among all patients addicted to heroin according to DSM-IV_TR
      (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV_ text revision), in maintenance
      methadone treatment, observed in the involved sites. The investigators will use treatment
      schemes with methadon conform to clinical practice and according to SPC (Summary of Product
      Characteristics).

      The enrollment will be competitive. Patients that meet incl/excl and that sign the informed
      consent, will be observed for 2 years. Follow up visits will be performed according to
      routine procedures, for patients that belong regularly to site at 3/6/9/12/18/24 months post
      V1. During the visits, patients will be assessed by validated and used as clinical practice
      questionnaires . For the evaluations of tolerability and safety the laboratory tests and
      electrocardiograms routinely performed will be collected.
