This is a test that uses ultrasound to\n           evaluate the size of the heart and how well the heart is pumping blood.\n\n        -  The investigators will use a computer-like device, called a programmer, that \"talks\" to\n           the CRT device using radio signals or by using wanded telemetry to adjust the CRT\n           device's programmed settings.   The left ventricular lead of your device will be turned\n           off.  The defibrillator will continue to function and back-up pacing will continue if\n           needed.\n\n        -  Complete the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ).\n\n        -  A 6 minute walk test will be done.\n\n      Regularly Scheduled Clinic Visit:  At the next regularly scheduled Left Ventricular Assist\n      Devices (LVAD) clinic visit, approximately 4 weeks after the baseline visit, the following\n      procedures will be done:\n\n        -  A second limited echocardiogram.\n\n        -  The investigator will use a computer-like device, called a programmer, that \"talks\" to\n           the CRT device using radio signals or by using a wand to obtain a report that will give\n           the current program settings and any heart rhythm events that have occurred since the\n           last CRT device was checked.  Once the information from the CRT is obtained, the study\n           doctor will reprogram the device to its original settings.\n\n        -  Complete the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ).\n\n        -  A 6 minute walk test will be done."
