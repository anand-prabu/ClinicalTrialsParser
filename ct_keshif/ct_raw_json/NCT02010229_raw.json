Moreover the technical resources necessary for\n      the safest delivery of women at risk have not been clearly identified.\n\n      Objectives: The primary objectives are to identify individual risk factors for maternal\n      morbidity, as well as risk factors related to types of management and healthcare facilities\n      for postpartum hemorrhage (PPH). Secondary objectives are to 1) determine the prevalence of\n      placenta accreta among women at risk; 2) assess the predictive value of ultrasound and MRI\n      for the diagnosis of placenta accreta in this population; 3) evaluate psychological impact\n      and physical complications; 4) report maternal physical complications during the year after\n      delivery.\n\n      Design: Population-based prospective observational study of pregnant women with a placenta\n      inserted at a uterine scar Setting; A total of 166 centers in 8 French regions, with 260,000\n      deliveries annually.\n\n      Methods: We expect to include 570 women at risk of placenta accreta in two years, of whom\n      approximately 100 (20%) will have placenta accreta.\n\n      Main outcome measures: The primary outcome measure is severe maternal hemorrhage; secondary\n      outcome measures are maternal morbidity and deaths, predictive value of ultrasound and MRI,\n      and psychological evaluations at 1, 6 and 12 months after delivery.\n\n      Conclusion: This study will be the first prospective population-based study to include women\n      at risk of placenta accreta and to investigate incidence, prenatal detection, type of\n      management, morbidity and maternal psychological consequences."
