      This study is attached to a comprehensive quality assurance/quality improvement (QA/QI)
      program conducted by the Office of the medical director, and is designed to contribute to
      generalizable knowledge to determine effectiveness and tolerability of an FDA approved
      Impedance Threshold Device (ITD) device in a large urban emergency medical service (EMS)
      system. The cohort will comprise a convenience sample of patients that are being treated by
      EMS for a hypotensive emergency.
