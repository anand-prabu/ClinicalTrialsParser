  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if a medication called Curosurf can reduce the length of
      time that small premature babies with Respiratory Distress Syndrome (immature lungs) or RDS,
      stay on the ventilator, as compared to the standard medication called BLES. Curosurf is a
      medication that is already used in other countries around the world but not yet in Canada.

      Babies born under 30 weeks of gestation frequently need respiratory support after birth,
      including being placed on a breathing machine or respirator.  The most common reason is
      Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS) whereby immature lungs don't produce enough surfactant,
      a soapy like substance that helps the air sacs open and close.  Our current standard
      treatment is a surfactant called BLES.  Curosurf contains more active ingredient per volume
      therefore the amount is smaller. The investigators hypothesize that babies who receive
      Curosurf will be able to be removed from the ventilator sooner.

      Babies in this study will have a 50/50 chance of receiving either Curosurf or BLES and the
      investigators will monitor their progress during their Neonatal Intensive Care Unit
      admission.

      The study is taking place in Canada. The goal is to enroll 88 babies. There are no extra
      tests (blood tests or X-Rays) or return visits to the hospital for the purposes of this
      study.
