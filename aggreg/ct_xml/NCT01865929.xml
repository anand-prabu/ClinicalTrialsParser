      A randomised controlled trial comparing hysterectomy by minimally invasive surgical methods;
      robotic hysterectomy versus vaginal hysterectomy or traditional laparoscopic hysterectomy;
      outcome and cost analyses.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Laparoscopic surgery is advantageous compared to open surgery in terms of patient morbidity,
      shorter hospitalization and a more rapid return to daily activities. Robot-assisted
      laparoscopic surgery have facilitated a higher proportion of minimally invasive surgery
      first and foremost within gynecologic oncology.It is not clear whether or not this is true
      for less advanced surgery where a vaginal approach or a traditional laparoscopic approach is
      possible.

      Robot-assisted surgery is associated with additional cost due to investment and more
      expensive surgical equipment. The study is performed to investigate whether or not
      performing hysterectomy for benign conditions with robotic surgery will be advantageous in
      terms of shorter operating time, less complications, less conversions to open surgery, and
      shorter hospital stay in comparison to other minimally invasive procedures such as vaginal
      hysterectomy and traditional laparoscopic hysterectomy.

    <description>The cost of surgery includes the actual surgery (anaesthesia, OR-nurse, circulating nurse, doctors and use of the OR) as well as the length of the inpatient stay.  The cost for conversions to open surgery,  reoperations, readmissions, and any additional cost associated with additional procedures or medical interventions such as radiological examinations and blood transfusions. Based on the estimated cost of surgical material, use of the operating room and cost of anaesthesia each benign hysterectomy performed with robotic surgery would need to be 50 minutes shorter than other minimal invasive procedures to compensate for the additional cost.</description>
