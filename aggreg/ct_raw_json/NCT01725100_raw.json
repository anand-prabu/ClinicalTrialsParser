Safety\n      assessments, including assessment of AEs, clinical laboratory (hematology and clinical\n      chemistry) and vital signs, will be made throughout the study.\n\n      After a subject completes the study, he or she may be eligible to enter study MEK114375, an\n      open-label rollover study of trametinib (no wash-out period or follow-up visit required) and\n      continue receiving trametinib. For those subjects who wish to discontinue or complete the\n      current study and choose not enter the rollover study, a follow-up visit should be performed\n      within 21 days after receiving the last dose of study treatment."
