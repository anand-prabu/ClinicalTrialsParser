While viral replication can be suppressed by antiviral treatment,\n      excessive inflammatory responses, which are increasingly recognized to contribute to severe\n      influenza complications, remain unopposed. Macrolides have been used widely to treat\n      community-acquired pneumonia, and shown to exert anti-inflammatory effects in other\n      respiratory diseases, providing clinical benefits. In this randomized, open-label,\n      multicenter study, we aim to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects of macrolide\n      treatment in influenza LRTI. Its impacts on the cytokine response, viral clearance, symptoms\n      and disease resolution will be studied. Such results may lead to the development of new\n      therapeutic approaches against severe influenza infection, and provide better insights into\n      disease pathogenesis."
