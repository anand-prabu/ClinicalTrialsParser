Thereafter, patients will receive 2.5\n      mg/kg bolus dose infusion of ciclosporin, followed by either 5 mg/kg/day or 10 mg/kg/day of\n      ciclosporin as continuous infusion for 5 days+3 days monitoring at the intensive care unit.\n      After an additional 30 days, a follow-up phone call will be made to the patient, or the\n      patient's nursing staff, checking patient status and serious adverse events. The two dose\n      levels will be investigated in 10 patients each, starting with the lower dose level for the\n      first 10 patients. Patients will have samples of blood and cerebrospinal fluid drawn at\n      pre-defined time points during the study for pharmacokinetic assessment and evaluation of\n      biomarkers. Bedside monitoring with microdialysis and brain tissue oxygenation will be\n      performed. The safety monitoring includes nephrotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, monitoring of\n      intracranial pressure (ICP), infections monitoring and adverse events collection and\n      reporting."
