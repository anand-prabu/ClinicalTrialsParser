    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, open-label, blinded endpoint, parallel-group, active-control,
      multi-center, proof-of-concept study in subjects with Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD),
      designed to assess the safety and potential efficacy of adding edoxaban to aspirin following
      femoropopliteal endovascular intervention, with or without stent placement, relative to
      current treatment practice with clopidogrel and aspirin.
