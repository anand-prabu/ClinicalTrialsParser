        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  A histologically confirmed diagnosis of DLBCL according to the World Health
             Organization criteria for diagnosis of NHL in the setting of RT from CLL

          -  One or more measurable (&gt; 1.5 cm in longest dimension) disease sites on PET-CT scans

          -  Objective documented evidence of disease progression at study entry

          -  ECOG  status of ≤ 2

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Radiation, chemotherapy, or immunotherapy or any other anticancer therapy ≤ 2 weeks
             prior to C1D1 and radio-immunotherapy 4 weeks prior to C1D1 provided the patient has
             recovered to Grade ≤ 1 from clinically significant adverse effects

          -  Less than 1 month since completion of autologous stem cell transplantation or less
             than 3 months since completion of allogeneic stem cell transplantation

          -  Major surgery within 4 weeks of C1D1

          -  Impairment of GI function or GI disease that could interfere with the absorption of
             selinexor, including obstructed GI tract and uncontrolled vomiting or diarrhea.

          -  Inability or unwillingness to take supportive medications including a centrally
             acting appetite stimulant (e.g., mirtazapine or olanzapine) and a peripherally acting
             appetite stimulant (e.g., low dose glucocorticoids or megesterol acetate).
