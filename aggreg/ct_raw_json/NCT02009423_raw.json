            "textblock": "GISTs are uncommon visceral sarcomas that arise predominantly in the gastro-intestinal\n      tract. Most GIST cells are positive for c-kit (CD117), a cell surface antigen corresponding\n      to the Stem Cell Factor (SCF) receptor. The receptor has an intracellular tyrosine kinase\n      (TK) joined by a juxtamembrane domaine. It is hypothesized that all malignant GIST cells\n      harbor a mutation of c-kit, resulting in the activation of c-kit and cell division and\n      tumour growth. Drugs that can selectively inhibit TKs are likely to be of benefit in GISTs.\n      Masitinib (AB1010) is a TK inhibitor, selectively and effectively inhibiting c-kit. Imatinib\n      is also a TK inhibitor indicated in the treatment of GIST. It might be associated with side\n      effects and patients might develop a resistance to treatment over time. Based on\n      pre-clinical and clinical studies, masitinib (AB1010) can be considered as a good candidate\n      in adjuvant therapy for patient after complete surgery and with high risk of relapse."
