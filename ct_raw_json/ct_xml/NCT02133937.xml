    <textblock>
      This single-center, randomized open-label, single-dose, parallel group study will
      investigate the relative bioavailability of a high concentration liquid formulation (HCLF)
      versus the reference lyophilized formulation (LyoF) of gantenerumab. Healthy volunteers will
      be randomized 1:1 to receive single-dose gantenerumab by subcutaneous injection.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy male and female subjects, 40 to 70 years of age inclusive. Healthy status is
             defined by absence of evidence any active or chronic disease following a detailed
             medical and surgical history, a complete physical examination including vital signs,
             12-lead ECG, hematology, blood chemistry, coagulation, serology and urinalysis. Some
             medical conditions are allowed that are well controlled by single stable medication

          -  A BMI between 18.0 to 30.0 kg/m2 inclusive

          -  Use of highly effective contraception until 6 months after study follow-up visit

          -  Agree not to donate blood or blood products for transfusion for the duration of the
             study and for one year after their dosing

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Suspicion of alcohol or drugs abuse addiction using DSM IV criteria

          -  Regular smoker (&gt; 5 cigarettes, &gt; 1 pipeful or &gt; 1 cigar per day), tobacco users and
             subjects on nicotine replacement therapy

          -  Prior administration of gantenerumab

          -  Participation in an investigational drug or device study within 60 days before dosing

          -  Donation of blood over 500 mL within three months before dosing

          -  Pregnancy or breast-feeding

          -  Any abnormal skin conditions or potentially obscuring tattoos, pigmentation or
             lesions in the area intended for subcutaneous injection

          -  Any familial history of early onset Alzheimer's disease

          -  Claustrophobia, presence of pacemakers, aneurysm clips, artificial heart valves, ear
             implants, or foreign metal objects in the eyes, skin or body which would
             contraindicate an MRI scan
