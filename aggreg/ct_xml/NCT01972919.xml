  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is for people who have pancreas cancer for which surgery is not
      recommended. Potential patients must have already received several months of chemotherapy
      before they are eligible for this study and there will not have been any detectable spread
      of their tumor on imaging studies following this chemotherapy course.

    <textblock>
      In this study the investigators want to find out more about the efficacy of giving higher
      doses of radiation with concurrent chemotherapy in controlling unresectable pancreas cancers
      than are used in either the pre-operative or post-operative setting. The investigors will
      assess acute and late side effects (problems and symptoms) of radiation therapy given at
      these higher doses of radiation (dose escalated) following full dose chemotherapy given
      before the radiation and with concurrent chemotherapy for pancreas cancer. Radiation therapy
      is given in higher doses that are limited by the proximity of normal organs to the radiation
      dose distribution to improve the likelihood of controlling the tumor in the pancreas while
      minimizing the risk of radiation injury to these organs.  There are two chemotherapy drugs,
      Capecitabine is an oral drug taken twice per day on the same day that radiation therapy is
      given and Gemcitabine is an intravenous drug given once per week, during radiation therapy.
      Everyone in this study will have already received chemotherapy alone first.  Everyone in
      this study will receive radiation therapy and concurrent chemotherapy.

          -  Pathologically confirmed (histologic or cytologic), locally advanced, adenocarcinoma
             of the pancreas; patients must have unresectable disease based on institutional
             standardized criteria of unresectability or medical inoperability.

          -  Patients with and without regional adenopathy are eligible.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        3.2

          -  Distant metastatic disease, second malignancy or peritoneal seeding;

          -  Prior invasive malignancy (except non-melanomatous skin cancer) unless disease free

          -  Prior radiotherapy to the region of the study cancer that would result in overlap of
             radiation therapy fields.

          -  Any major surgery within 28 days prior to study entry (for example, insertion of a
             vascular access device, exploratory laparotomy and laparoscopy are not considered
             major surgery; biliary or gastric bypass is considered major surgery);

          -  Severe, active co-morbidity, defined as follows:

          -  Unstable angina and/or congestive heart failure requiring hospitalization within the
             last 6 months;

          -  Acute bacterial or fungal infection requiring intravenous antibiotics at the time of
             registration;

          -  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation or other respiratory illness

             capecitabine.

          -  Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) based upon current CDC definition; note,
             however, that HIV testing is not required for entry into this protocol. The need to
             exclude patients with AIDS from this protocol is necessary because patients receiving
             antiretroviral therapy may experience possible pharmacokinetic interactions with
             capecitabine.

             for men, for 6 months after the last study drug administration; this exclusion is
             necessary because the treatment involved in this study may be significantly
             teratogenic.

          -  Women who are lactating at the time of registration and who plan to be lactating
             through 3 months after the last study drug administration.
