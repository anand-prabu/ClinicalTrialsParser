Bone marrow\n      transplantation may be able to replace immune cells that have been destroyed by radiation\n      therapy used to kill tumor cells. Sometimes the transplanted cells can make an immune\n      response against the body's normal tissues. Mycophenolate mofetil and tacrolimus may be an\n      effective treatment for graft-versus-host disease caused by bone marrow transplantation.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of total-body irradiation, tacrolimus,\n      and mycophenolate mofetil plus bone marrow transplantation in treating patients with\n      hematologic cancers."

Determine whether sustained engraftment of HLA identical sibling marrow can\n      be achieved in patients treated with total body irradiation before transplant and tacrolimus\n      and mycophenolate mofetil after transplant. II. Document the nonhematologic toxicities of\n      this regimen. III. Characterize immune reconstitution of patients during this treatment\n      regimen. IV. Document the incidence of aplasia and graft-versus-host disease associated with\n      donor leukocyte infusions when administered after this regimen.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients receive total body irradiation in a single fraction on day -1. Tacrolimus\n      is given orally twice per day on days -1 to 50. Mycophenolate mofetil is given orally on day\n      0 and twice per day on days 1 to 28. Patients receive donor bone marrow infusion on day 0.\n      Patients are evaluated on days 56, 180, 292, and 365. If there is donor engraftment, donor\n      chimerism is less than 80%, there is no active graft-versus-host disease, no disease\n      progression, less than 50% decrease in donor cell chimerism from last measurement, and the\n      patient is not taking immunosuppressive agents, then donor leukocyte infusions are\n      administered on days 70, 194, and 306. Patients are followed annually for 5 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued for this study."
