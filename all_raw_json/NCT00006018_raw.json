Determine the safety and tolerability\n      of this regimen in these patients. III. Determine the pharmacokinetics of this treatment\n      regimen in this patient population. IV. Determine the pharmacodynamic effects of this\n      treatment regimen in serial tumor biopsies in these patients. V. Determine the cytotoxicity\n      of this treatment regimen in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of BMS-214662. Patients receive paclitaxel IV over\n      3 hours on day 1 and BMS-214662 IV over 1 hour on day 3 of course 1. For all subsequent\n      courses, patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours followed 30 minutes later by BMS-214662\n      IV over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for at least 2 courses in the\n      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with stable disease or\n      objectively responding disease receive additional therapy at the investigator's discretion.\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of BMS-214662 until the maximum tolerated\n      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6\n      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed every 4 weeks.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 18-21 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-15\n      months."
