    <textblock>
      Neurally Adjusted Ventilatory Assist (NAVA) is a new form of partial support wherein the
      machine applies positive pressure throughout inspiration in proportion to the electrical
      activity of the diaphragm (EAdi), as assessed by trans-esophageal electromyography. To test
      the hypothesis that NAVA could provide better patient-ventilator synchrony during NIV
      delivered by nasal-facial mask as compared to conventional flow-triggered PSV in infants
      with Acute Respiratory Failure.

    <textblock>
      Neurally Adjusted Ventilatory Assist (NAVA) is a new form of partial support wherein the
      machine applies positive pressure throughout inspiration in proportion to the Electrical
      Activity of the diaphragm (EAdi), as assessed by trans-esophageal electromyography. Because
      ventilator functioning and cycling are under control of the patient's respiratory drive and
      rhythm, NAVA has the potential to enhance patient-ventilator interaction ensuring synchrony
      and minimizing the risk of over-assistance. A high incidence of asynchrony events has been
      demonstrated to have a significant clinical impact by favouring weaning failure and longer
      duration of mechanical ventilation.

      NAVA has been implemented safely in animals, in healthy volunteers and in critically ill
      adults and has been shown to improve patient-ventilator synchrony, to limit excessive airway
      pressure and tidal volume, and to unload the respiratory muscles in tracheally intubated
      patients.

      Moreover NAVA was found to be effective in delivering non-invasive ventilation (NIV) even
      when the interface was excessively leaky (75% leak) with reduced positive end-expiratory
      pressure. With these conditions, NAVA was able to unload the respiratory muscles and
      preserve gas exchange, while maintaining synchrony to respiratory demand. To date, no data
      exist on the use of NAVA in infants during noninvasive ventilation. The aim of this
      physiological study is to compare patient-ventilator interaction in infants receiving NIV by
      NAVA and Pressure Support Ventilation (PSV).
