The overall aim of the main study is to determine the role of\n      various risk factors in the development of cardiovascular disease in this native American\n      population.\n\n      DESIGN NARRATIVE:\n\n      Data from the first and second clinical exams of the Strong Heart Study were analyzed to\n      determine if body fat distribution as measured by waist-to-hip circumference was a better\n      correlate of lipoproteins than was body mass index.  In addition, change in body mass index\n      (BMI) and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) were correlated with change in lipoproteins."
