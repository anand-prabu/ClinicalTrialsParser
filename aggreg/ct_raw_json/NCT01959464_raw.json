Crinone 8% is formulated to provide a long-acting vaginal retention, and is prescribed daily. Each applicator delivers 1.125 grams of Crinone gel containing 90 mg of progesterone. The reported time to maximum progesterone concentration is 6.8 +/- 3.3 hours with use of a single dose of Crinone 8%. Absorption half-life is approximately 25-50 hours and an elimination half-life of 5-20 minutes.\nOn the evening of day 3, the female will insert the applicator into the vagina, administer the gel, and have intercourse within 1 hour of insertion of the cream."

However, a previous study performed by our group\n      found that intercourse lowered the absorption of vaginal estrogen cream in women, and men\n      absorbed a small but statistically significant amount of estradiol during intercourse.\n      Vaginal progesterone gel may be used by women for several clinical indications, and if\n      intercourse alters the absorption and distribution of vaginal progesterone, clinical\n      outcomes may be compromised. If intercourse lowers absorption, the efficacy of the treatment\n      could be reduced. If intercourse enhances absorption, side effects may be increased. Also,\n      if the male sexual partner absorbs vaginal progesterone, undesirable side effects may occur."
