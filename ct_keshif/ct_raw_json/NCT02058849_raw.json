The investigators central hypothesis is that dietary nitrate\n      supplementation in head and neck cancer patients receiving aggressive medical care will\n      improve compliance with medical treatment by attenuating the loss of muscle mass and\n      strength and reducing symptoms (mucositis) associated with treatment compared to patients\n      receiving standard care with placebo."
