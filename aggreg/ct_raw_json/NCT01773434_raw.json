Subjects may have any solid tumor without intracranial involvement or\n      metastases that has failed standard chemotherapy.\n\n      This study will be conducted in 2 parts: 1) Part 1 will be the dose escalation portion of\n      this study to assess the tolerability and the safety profile of MORAb-004. Dose will\n      escalate in different cohorts as follows: 2, 4, 8 and 12 mg/kg weekly dosing each as a\n      4-week cycle with no intra-subject escalation. Individual participants may have additional\n      cycles at the same dose until disease progression unless the participants meet the\n      discontinuation criteria.\n\n      2) Part 2 will comprise cohort expansions to further characterize the safety and\n      tolerability of MORAb-004 and to assess preliminary efficacy and the\n      pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship of MORAb-004 in gastric cancer and\n      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Three dose levels will be expanded based on the safety\n      profile that was obtained in the dose escalation portion of this study (Part 1): 4 mg/kg\n      (administered on a weekly basis), 8 mg/kg (administered on a weekly basis) and 12 mg/kg\n      (administered every OTHER week)."
