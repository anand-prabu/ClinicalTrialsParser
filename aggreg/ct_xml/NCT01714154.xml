  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multi-center, fixed-sequence, open-label, multiple-dose, 2-period study will evaluate
      the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of setrobuvir alone or in combination with
      ritonavir-boosted danoprevir in subjects with mild hepatic impairment compared to healthy
      controls. All subjects will receive multiple doses of setrobuvir orally for 10 days in
      Period 1 and multiple doses of setrobuvir plus ritonavir-boosted danoprevir orally for 10
      days in Period 2, with a washout phase of at least 9 days between treatments.
