  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The efficacy and safety of panitumumab (Vectibix) in the routine clinical setting will be
      studied.

      Specifically, information will be collected on the following as events of interest: skin

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The efficacy and safety of panitumumab (Vectibix) in the routine clinical setting will be
      studied.

      Participants of this surveillance will be patients with unresectable, advanced or recurrent
      colorectal cancer with the wild-type KRAS gene. The planned sample size is 2,000 patients.

      The usual adult dosage is 6 mg/kg of panitumumab  given by intravenous drip infusion over a
      60-minute period once every 2 weeks. The dosage may also be reduced as needed, depending on
      the patient's condition.
