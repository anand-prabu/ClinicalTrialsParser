Strong evidence exists that a healthful diet and regular physical\n      activity can prevent many chronic diseases and improve physical function. More research\n      however is needed to develop interventions that can produce long-term adherence to healthful\n      lifestyle behaviors. This pilot study is based on the hypothesis that vegetable gardening\n      interventions will be feasible and result in improvements in diet and exercise behaviors as\n      well as improvements in physical functioning and well-being."

A total of 46 older (\u226565 years) cancer\n      survivors  recently diagnosed with a loco-regionally staged cancer with a good prognosis\n      (i.e., \u2265 80% 5-year survival) and with 2 or more physical function limitations will be\n      recruited from select rural and urban counties in Alabama and randomized to 1-of-2 study\n      arms: 1) an intervention group that receives a 1-year mentored vegetable gardening\n      intervention that pairs cancer survivors with certified Master Gardeners, or 2) a usual care\n      control group that is observed during the year, but receives the gardening supplies at study\n      completion. Aims of this study are to: 1) explore the feasibility and acceptability of a\n      mentored vegetable gardening intervention by assessing accrual, retention, adherence,\n      fidelity, and possible adverse events, 2) obtain means and precision estimates, and explore\n      between-arm differences on pre-post changes in physical function and secondary endpoints\n      (e.g., quality of life, fruit & vegetable intake, physical activity, etc.), and 3) to\n      explore participant factors associated with program efficacy (e.g., gender, comorbidity)."
