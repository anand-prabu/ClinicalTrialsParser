Steroid is one of the conventional\n      treatment methods for TLN. However, its response rate was still not so satisfactory (about\n      30%-35%).The mechanism of TLN is under exploring and not completely understood. It has been\n      proposed recently that chronic oxidative stress and inflammation involve in the pathogenesis\n      of radiation-induced late normal tissue injury.\n\n      Edaravone(3-methyl-1-phenyl-2-pyrazolin-5-one), which is proved to be an excellent free\n      radical scavenger, has been applied to a wide range of oxidative stress-related\n      diseases.Thus, it may exert a therapeutic effect on radiation-induced temporal lobe\n      necrosis. To support this hypothesis, the investigators carried out a randomized study of\n      combining edaravone with common fundamental management versus common fundamental therapy in\n      patients with TLN, and analyzed the Late Effects of Normal Tissues -Subjective, Objective,\n      Management, Analytic (LENT/SOMA) scale before and after treatment."
