Body composition and maximal voluntary knee extension torque\n      (KET) were determined using a bioelectrical impedance analyzer and a static myometer,\n      respectively. Sprint velocity was measured by a non-motorized treadmill. Jump height was\n      calculated from the following equation; g \u00d7 (flight time)2 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 10-1. The flight time\n      during jumping was measured by a matswitch system."
