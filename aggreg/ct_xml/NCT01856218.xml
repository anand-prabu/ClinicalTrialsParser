    <textblock>
      UX003-CL201 is an open-label Phase 1/2 study to assess the safety, efficacy, and dose of
      UX003 in MPS 7 subjects via IV administration every other week (QOW) for 36 weeks with up to
      an additional 36 weeks from the optional continuation period. Up to 5 subjects, who are
      between 5 and 30 years of age inclusive, will be enrolled and treated with UX003.

      The initial 12-week treatment period will be followed by a 24-week forced dose titration
      period to assess the optimal dose.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Confirmed diagnosis of MPS 7 based on leukocyte or fibroblast glucuronidase enzyme
             assay or genetic testing confirming diagnosis.

          -  Elevated uGAG excretion at a minimum of 2-fold over normal.

          -  Between 5 and 30 years of age, inclusive (approximately two subjects between the ages
             of 20-30 years).

          -  Willing and able to provide written, signed informed consent, or in the case of
             subjects under the age of 18 (or 16 years, depending on the region), provide written
             assent (if required) and written informed consent by a legally authorized
             representative after the nature of the study has been explained, and prior to any
             research-related procedures.

          -  Sexually active subjects must be willing to use an acceptable method of contraception
             while participating in the study.

          -  Females of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test at Screening
             and be willing to have additional pregnancy tests during the study.  Females
             considered not of childbearing potential include those who have had tubal ligation at
             least one year prior to Screening, or who have had total hysterectomy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Has undergone a successful bone marrow or stem cell transplant or has any degree of
             detectable chimaerism with donor cells.

          -  Any known hypersensitivity to rhGUS or its excipients that, in the judgment of the
             Investigator, places the subject at increased risk for adverse effects.

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding at Screening or planning to become pregnant (self or
             partner) at any time during the study.

          -  Use of any investigational product (drug or device or combination) within 30 days
             prior to Screening, or requirement for any investigational agent prior to completion
             of all scheduled study assessments at any time during the study.

          -  Has a condition of such severity and acuity, in the opinion of the Investigator, that
             it warrants immediate surgical intervention or other treatment or may not allow safe
             study participation.

          -  Has a concurrent disease or condition that, in the view of the Investigator, places
             the subject at high risk of poor treatment compliance or of not completing the study,
             or would interfere with study participation or affect safety.
