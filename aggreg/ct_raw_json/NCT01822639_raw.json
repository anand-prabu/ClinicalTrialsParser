The rational for this study is to provide a more convenient dosing regimen\n      for patients. This is an open-label, randomized, single dose, two-way crossover study, in\n      which 16 healthy adult male and female subjects will be enrolled and dosed under fasting\n      conditions. Each subject will participate in two treatment periods of 7 days each. There\n      will be at least 14 days of wash out period between the two dosing periods and a follow-up\n      period of up to 21 days after treatment period 2. The total duration of study will be\n      approximately 35 days from the start of the first treatment."
