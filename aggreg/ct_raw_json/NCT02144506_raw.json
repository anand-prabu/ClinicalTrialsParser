In this\n      feasibility pilot study, 18 patients with at least 65 years will be allocated randomly to\n      one of two interventions. The control group gets a well-known home-based exercise program\n      (OTAGO) aiming to prevent falls where the exercises are prescribed by a physical therapists.\n      The exercises will be presented on a booklet and on printed cards. The Intervention group\n      consists of an exercise program, the \"T&E\" program, where the elderly persons can choose the\n      exercises depending on their abilities. The exercises in the \"T&E\" program will be presented\n      in a printed manual and shown on videos on an electronic tablet. Both intervention groups\n      receive 6 hours of instruction and control/supervision sessions by physical therapists. In\n      addition,  the participants will exercise alone.\n\n      The interventions will be performed over 24 weeks.\n\n      In this pilot study, the hypothesis is that the adhesion rate is at least 65%. Other\n      feasibility criteria will be costs, data recording issues and the qualitative evaluation of\n      the booklet and the tablet.\n\n      Falls will be assessed with a falls calendar. The amount of physical activity of the\n      participants is assessed with an accelerometers (actigraph) and quality of life will be\n      assessed with OPQOL-35 at baseline, week 16 and week 24."
