  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overarching goal of this project is to develop and test a behavioral intervention
      delivered by promotoras to help at-risk Latinas lose weight and prevent diabetes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This lifestyle intervention condition will be compared to a usual care (UC) condition. The
      aim of this study is to 1) develop a protocol-based, promotora-led lifestyle intervention
      (PLI) to promote weight loss in at-risk Latinas, and assess its feasibility, and 2) compare
      changes in weight and cardiometabolic markers—hemoglobin A1C, fasting lipids, blood
      pressure—from baseline to 1 year between at-risk Latinas randomly assigned to the PLI group
      versus the usual care (UC) group. The investigators hypothesize that 1) Latinas assigned to
      PLI will have greater weight loss (primary outcome) and greater improvements in
      cardiometabolic markers from baseline to 1 year than those randomized to UC

    <description>PLI aims to promote healthy lifestyle behaviors through a core curriculum of 12 group sessions of 90-minute duration over a 12-week period. There will be 8-12 participants per group. One promotora will lead each session in Spanish, exploring Diabetes Prevention Program topics. The promotora and participants will spend the first half of each session reviewing goals from the previous session and problem-solving; the second half will cover new content and set the following week's goals. Participants will be instructed to record their physical activity and dietary intake daily. Participants will also weigh themselves weekly. The core curriculum will be followed by a maintenance phase of 10 biweekly and then monthly 90-minute sessions during months 4 through 12.</description>

    <description>One physician visit at Puentes de Salud or Congreso Health Center to discuss healthy lifestyle behaviors that promote weight loss and diabetes prevention. During that visit, UC participants will also receive standard educational materials in Spanish from the NIDDK Weight-control Information Network covering the same topics. UC participants will receive another physician visit upon completion of 1-year follow-up to review laboratory assessments.</description>
