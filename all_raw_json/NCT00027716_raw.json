Patients are stratified according to\n      disease (stratum I: soft tissue sarcoma not specified in stratum II, osteogenic sarcoma\n      arising from soft tissues, or gastrointestinal stromal tumor vs stratum II: Ewing's sarcoma\n      of soft tissue or bone, rhabdomyosarcoma, or osteogenic sarcoma of bone). (Stratum I closed\n      to accrual as of 10/17/03.)\n\n      Patients receive bortezomib IV over 3-5 seconds on days 1, 4, 8, and 11. Courses repeat\n      every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 21-41 patients will be accrued for stratum I within 5-11\n      months and 21-41 patients will be accrued for stratum II within 10.5-22 months. (Stratum I\n      closed to accrual as of 10/17/03.)"
