They have an equal\n      chance of receiving memantine or placebo. After 24 weeks they will discontinue all study\n      medication for 4 weeks. This process will be repeated one additional time in the study and\n      the participant  will crossed-over to either memantine or placebo, whichever the participant\n      did not receive before, so they will have taken both placebo and memantine during one of\n      these courses.\n\n      Randomization will be stratified by prednisone dose of < 20 mg/day vs. \u2265 20 mg/day.\n      Memantine or placebo starting at 5 milligrams once a day, increased to 5 milligrams twice a\n      day (10 total) at week 2, 15 milligrams total at week 3, and 20 milligrams total from weeks\n      4-24 unless side effects require the study doctor to increase the initial doses slower than\n      described above or reduce the dose.  This same process will be repeated at week 28 after the\n      participant have been completely off of study medication for 4 weeks.  Structural MRI and\n      1HMRS will be obtained at baseline and weeks 24 and 52 (after memantine and placebo).\n\n      The clinician version of the structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID) is a brief\n      structured interview for major Axis I disorders in DSM-IV including major depressive\n      disorder, dysthymic disorder, bipolar disorders, psychotic disorders, anxiety disorders,\n      eating disorders, and alcohol and substance abuse/dependence.  This will be given at\n      baseline to screen for illnesses with CNS involvement or cognitive impairment. Blood draws\n      will be performed at baseline to assess insulin and fasting glucose levels.\n\n      Each participant will then return for follow-up appointments as scheduled and repeat outcome\n      measures. Pill counts will be conducted, and a list of current medications and doses will be\n      obtained at each visit. Participants will be compensated and receive bus passes at each\n      appointment, plus a monetary incentive for compliance.  Participants will be evaluated by\n      both the RA and PI at each follow-up appointment.\n\n      The HVLT-R will be given at baseline, and weeks 12, 24, 28, 40, and 52; this will be the\n      primary outcome measure.  Other cognitive assessments will be performed at these same visits\n      as well."
