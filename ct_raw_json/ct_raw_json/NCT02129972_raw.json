            "textblock": "The incidence of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD) is in a continuous progression both in\n      adults as in children. The colonoscopy is considered as the gold standard exam for the\n      diagnosis and the follow-up of the patients presenting or suspected to have an IBD. The\n      follow-up and financial management of this kind of pathology is very much dependent on the\n      quality of the endoscopic images. Because colonoscopy is an expensive and invasive technique\n      which assumes a general sedation, many efforts have been done to develop new less expensive\n      and less invasive techniques in order to offer alternatives to the classic colon endoscopy.\n      One of these new techniques is the colon videocapsule (CVC) endoscopy (PillCam\u00ae colon 2 -\n      Given Imaging, Yoqneam, Israel). This is a new promising semi-invasive endoscopic technique\n      which has been successfully validated with adults. We hypothesize that the CVC can be used\n      in children with similar results in terms of efficacy, as is the case for adults.\n\n      This prospective simple blind multicenter study, will investigate the diagnostic value of\n      the CVC compared to the conventional colonoscopy under general sedation for the detection\n      and the control of colon lesions in children presenting IBD.\n\n      If the feasibility and the efficacy of the colon video capsule technique are also proven for\n      use with children, then this new technique might become a very interesting alternative for\n      the endoscopic examination of the colon because of being less expensive and less invasive.\n\n      Moreover, this technique would be very useful as a means of lesions detection all along the\n      digestive tract and not limited to the colon only."
