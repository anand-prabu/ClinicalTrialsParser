Current instructions for the treatment of severe hypoglycaemia call\n      for the immediate injection of 1 mg of glucagon subcutaneously or intramuscularly. Large\n      dose of glucagon such as 1 mg subcutaneous is usually associated with undesirable\n      side-effects such as nausea, vomiting, bloating and headache. Moreover, glucagon emergency\n      kits are relatively expensive (around $100 per kit), thus increasing the financial burden of\n      diabetes on patients and the health care system.\n\n      The primary objective of this research project is to the study the pharmacological effects\n      of different doses of glucagon injected subcutaneously to correct hypoglycaemia during\n      controlled conditions mimicking a hypoglycaemic event in adults with type 1 diabetes. More\n      specifically, we will be looking at the effects of subcutaneous glucagon injected at 0.1 or\n      0.2 mg and 1.0 mg to normalized plasma glucose during a hypoglycaemic hyperinsulinemic clamp\n      in subjects with type 1 diabetes."

Dextrose infusion will be enriched with D-[6,6-2H2] glucose. A third catheter will be inserted for sampling. D-[6,6-2H2] glucose will be administered as a priming dose followed by a constant infusion throughout the experiment. Insulin will be administered as a primed continuous infusion. The first two hours will serve as an equilibration period for the tracer while glucose infusion will be adjusted to achieve a plasma glucose concentration of 5 mmol/L. The third hour is considered the baseline period. Following this, dextrose infusion rate will be decreased over a period of 1 hour to attain hypoglycaemia with a target blood glucose level at 2.8 mmol/L. At the end of the fourth hour, a subcutaneous glucagon dose will be given and plasma samples will be drawn for the determination of labelled and unlabelled glucose, plasma insulin and glucagon.",
