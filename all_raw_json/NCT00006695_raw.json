Drugs used in chemotherapy\n      use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining\n      chemotherapy with peripheral stem cell transplant may allow the doctor to give higher doses\n      of chemotherapy drugs and kill more cancer cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well monoclonal antibody therapy, chemotherapy,\n      and peripheral stem cell transplant work in treating patients with relapsed or refractory\n      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma."

On day -19, patients receive unlabeled\n      monoclonal antibody anti-B1 (MOAB anti-B1) IV followed by a dosimetric dose of iodine I 131\n      MOAB anti-B1 IV over 20 minutes. On day -12, patients receive unlabeled MOAB anti-B1 IV\n      followed by a therapeutic dose of iodine I 131 MOAB anti-B1 IV over 20 minutes. Patients\n      then receive high-dose chemotherapy comprising carmustine IV on day -6, etoposide IV and\n      cytarabine IV twice daily on days -5 to -2, and melphalan IV on day -1. Patients undergo\n      autologous PBSC transplantation on day 0.\n\n      Patients are followed at days 30 and 100, at 6 months, and then annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study over 5 years."
