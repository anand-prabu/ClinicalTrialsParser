It is believed by some that central to this\n      theme is the maternal cytokine profile, with particularly T-helper (Th) cells. Immune\n      modulating therapies have therefore been mooted as potential therapeutic strategies. Recent\n      reports of high pregnancy rates achievable in women with RIF have added fuel to the debate\n      regarding the effectiveness of intralipids in modulating the immune system."
