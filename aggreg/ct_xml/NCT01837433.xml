      Efficiency and Safety Study of Short-term Prednisone to Treat Moderate and Severe Subacute
      Thyroiditis

      The investigators hypothesize that less adverse reactions will be observed, comparing with
      the guidelines recommend. The recurrence rate, adrenal insufficiency, temporary and
      permanent hypothyroidism aren't significant difference.

    <textblock>
      Comparing with the guidelines recommend, short-term (one week)prednisone and nsaids
      following up next week to treat moderate and severe subacute thyroiditis will be assessed.

      The patients in wards will be assessed from temperature,erythrocyte sedimentation
      rate,C-reactive protein,local pain and goiter.The random treatment will be executed in
      moderate and severe SAT after informed consent be signed.

      Subjects will be monitored once every 2 weeks.If patients complained of pain in their neck
      or if the erythrocyte sedimentation rate is still high,after discontinuation of prednisone,
      prednisone treatment will be resumed in moderate and severe subject and non-steroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs will be used in mild subject.Anti-ulcer drugs will be administered
      to all patients.

      The endpoint of the study are efficiency and safety of short-term prednisone treating. The
      investigators will assess adrenal insufficiency (such as anorexia, nausea, vomiting,
      abdominal pain),steroid withdrawal syndrome, recurrence rate and hypothyroidism. The
      investigators will observe erythrocyte sedimentation rate,pain,steroid level and thyroid
      function.
