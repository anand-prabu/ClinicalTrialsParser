Primary objective is to demonstrate the\n      efficacy of porcine brain peptide to improve motor recovery measured by the improvement\n      ratio of Fugl-Meyer assessment ((score of FMA after 3 weeks - score of FMA at baseline) /\n      score of FMA at baseline) in patients with subacute stroke."
