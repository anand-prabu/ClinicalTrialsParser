  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the proposed study is to evaluate a new, molecular image directed,
      three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound guided biopsy system in human patients. The current biopsy
      uses ultrasound imaging as guidance. However, the procedure uses two-dimensional (2D)
      ultrasound images and has sampling errors thus some cancers can be missed from the standard
      2D image-guided biopsy.  In this study, an FDA-approved ultrasound device will be used to
      obtain three-dimensional (3D) images of the prostate from a commercially available
      ultrasound scanner. The clinician can use the 3D images to guide biopsy, record the core
      location of the biopsy sites, and perform re-biopsy to the same sites in a patient follow-up
      examination. This system can also use images from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or
      positron emission tomography (PET) and then fuse PET or MR images with 3D ultrasound images
      to guide the needle to a suspicious tumor target as seen on MRI or PET. We think that this
      fusion targeted biopsy technology will help to improve the accuracy of the current
      systematic biopsy approach for prostate cancer detection.

    <description>This study will determine (i) whether fusion targeted biopsy can detect more cancer per core than the standard TRUS-guided biopsy; (ii) whether the addition of targeted biopsy to systematic biopsy increases the rate of diagnosis of aggressive cancer.</description>

    <description>Patients will have a PET/CT prior to the biopsy. The CT images will be combined with the PET images for improved localization of  suspicious tumors. During the biopsy, the 3-D ultrasound images will be acquired immediately  before the biopsy while the patient is on the table. The ultrasound images together with the PET images will be used to guide the targeted biopsy of the prostate.</description>
