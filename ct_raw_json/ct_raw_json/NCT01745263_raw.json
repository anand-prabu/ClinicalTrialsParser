            "textblock": "The European population is aging rapidly which poses a challenge on the individual, the\n      European societies, and health care systems. Among the most promising public health\n      interventions that may extend healthy life expectancy at older age are vitamin D, marine\n      omega-3 fatty acids and physical exercise. However, their individual and combined effects\n      have yet to be confirmed in a clinical trial.\n\n      The broad aim of DO-HEALTH is to prolong healthy life expectancy in European seniors. The\n      specific aim is to establish whether vitamin D, omega-3 fatty acids, and a simple home\n      exercise program will prevent disease at older age.\n\n      To achieve these aims, DO-HEALTH will enroll 2152 community-dwelling men and women who are\n      70 years and older, an age when chronic diseases increase substantially. The DO-HEALTH\n      seniors will be recruited from 7 European cities (Zurich, Basel, Geneva, Toulouse, Berlin,\n      Innsbruck and Coimbra) and will be randomized in a 2x2x2 factorial design trial to a simple\n      home exercise program and/or vitamin D, and/or omega-3 fatty acids, over a 3 year period.\n      This will allow to test the individual and the combined benefit of the interventions in the\n      prevention of 5 primary endpoints: the risk of incident non-vertebral fractures; the risk of\n      functional decline; the risk of blood pressure increase; the risk of cognitive decline; and\n      the rate of any infection. Key secondary endpoints include risk of hip fracture, rate of\n      falls, pain in symptomatic knee osteoarthritis, gastro-intestinal symptoms, mental and oral\n      health, quality of life, and life-expectancy.\n\n      All clinical endpoints will be supported by a large DO-HEALTH biomarker study to evaluate\n      the effect of the interventions at the cellular level of multi-organ function. DO-HEALTH\n      will further evaluate reasons why or why not seniors adhere to the 3 interventions, and will\n      assess their cost-benefit in a health economic model based on documented health care\n      utilization and observed incidence of chronic disease.\n\n      website DO-HEALTH: http://do-health.eu/wordpress/ website EC:\n      http://ec.europa.eu/research/health/medical-research/human-development-and-ageing/projects/do-health_en.html"

Home exercise program (muscle strength) of 30 minutes 3 times a week compared to a\n           control exercise program (joint flexibility) 30 minutes 3 times a week\n\n      Follow-up: DO-HEALTH seniors will be followed for 3 years, in-person, and in 3-monthly\n      intervals (4 clinical visits and 9 phone calls) at the 7 recruitment centers.\n\n      Study population: DO-HEALTH will enroll seniors age 70 years and older. To represent the\n      largest part of the senior population, DO-HEALTH will recruit community-dwelling seniors.\n      However, to represent also the pre-frail population at risk of institutionalization, 50% of\n      seniors will be enrolled based on a fall with or without a fracture in the year before\n      DO-HEALTH enrolment.\n\n      Study Design: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2\u00d72\u00d72 factorial design\n      clinical trial.\n\n      Recruitment Centers: The trial will be performed at 7 recruitment centers located in 5\n      countries: Switzerland (University of Zurich, Basel University Hospital, Geneva University\n      Hospital), France (University of Toulouse Hospital Centre), Germany (Charit\u00e9 Berlin),\n      Portugal (University of Coimbra), and Austria (Innsbruck Medical University).\n\n      Randomization: Stratified block randomization. Labeling of study intervention will be\n      performed by a central randomization centre in Switzerland.\n\n      Stratification variables: recruitment centre (7 centers), fall during previous 12 months\n      (yes/no), gender, and age (70 - 84 and 85+). Even balance among those who fell or did not\n      fall during the last year will be enforced at each of the 7 recruitment centers. Gender and\n      age distribution will be monitored within each recruitment centre with the DO-HEALTH\n      randomization software. If gross imbalance (less than 30% of participants in a stratum) is\n      detected within a centre, recruitment strategies for the centre will be adapted to boost\n      recruitment of participants of underrepresented category.\n\n      website DO-HEALTH: http://do-health.eu/wordpress/ website EC:\n      http://ec.europa.eu/research/health/medical-research/human-development-and-ageing/projects/do-health_en.html"
