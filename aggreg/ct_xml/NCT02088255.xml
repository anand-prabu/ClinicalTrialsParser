  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is evaluate the effects of walking training with partial body
      weight support on static (floor) and dynamic (treadmill) surfaces in individuals with
      hemiparesis due to stroke. For this purpose, three training protocols will be employed in
      three experimental groups: G1 will do the walking training with partial body weight support
      on static surfaces, G2 will do the walking training with partial body weight support on
      dynamic surfaces and G3 will do the walking training with partial body weight support on
      both static and dynamic surfaces.
