The subject will then have their teeth and gums examined.\n       At this visit, the investigator will assess whether or not the subject is a good candidate\n      for the study. During the phone interview each subject was asked not to brush or floss their\n      teeth and not to eat or drink anything other than water for 8 hours prior to the\n      pre-screening visit (Visit 0).  If the subject was compliant with these requests, oral\n      samples will be collected at this pre-screening visit and will now be considered Visit 1\n      (Baseline).  If not, they will be asked to return to the clinic for another visit and asked\n      not to brush or floss their teeth and not to eat or drink anything other than water 8 hours\n      prior to that appointment.  This visit will then be consider Visit 1 (Baseline).\n\n      Visit 1 (Baseline) - The subject will have their medical and dental history reviewed.  They\n      will have their teeth and gums examined.  Saliva and plaque will be collected.  Each subject\n      will be given a toothbrush and toothpaste and instructed to not use any other dental\n      products.  This will be considered the \"washout\" period.\n\n      Visit 2 - The subject will be asked to return the unused toothpaste.  Their medical and\n      dental history will be reviewed and they will have their teeth examined.  Saliva and plaque\n      will be collected at this visit.  The subjects will then be randomly assigned (by chance,\n      like the flip of a coin) to the group that will use a marketed fluoride-containing\n      toothpaste or to the group that will use a marketed arginine containing toothpaste.  The\n      subject will also be instructed not to brush or floss their teeth or eat or drink anything\n      other than water for 8 hours prior to your next appointment.\n\n      Visits 3, 4, and 5 - Subjects will not be allowed to brush or floss their teeth or eat or\n      drink anything other than water 8 hours prior to these visits.  Saliva and plaque will be\n      collected.  On the 5th visit subjects will be asked to return the unused toothpaste tube.\n      At this time participation in this research study will end and they will be instructed to\n      return to their regular oral hygiene regiments."
