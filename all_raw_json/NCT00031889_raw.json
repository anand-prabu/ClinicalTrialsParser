Hormone therapy\n      using exemestane plus bicalutamide may fight prostate cancer by reducing the production of\n      androgens. It is not yet known if exemestane is more effective with or without bicalutamide\n      in treating prostate cancer.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to study the effectiveness of exemestane with or without\n      bicalutamide in treating patients who have stage IV prostate cancer that has been previously\n      treated with hormone therapy or surgery."

Patients are stratified according to\n      performance status (0 vs 1-2), pain (none or mild vs moderate or severe), and participating\n      center. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral exemestane once daily.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive exemestane as in arm I and oral bicalutamide once daily.\n\n      Treatment in both arms continues every 4 weeks for a minimum of 2 courses in the absence of\n      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Quality of life and pain are assessed at baseline, on day 1 of course 2 and any subsequent\n      courses, and at disease progression or treatment failure (if applicable).\n\n      Patients are followed monthly until disease progression.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-62 patients (10-31 per treatment arm) will be accrued for\n      this study."
