Two simultaneous interventions will occur.\n\n      In intervention 1, students with ASD in inclusion classrooms will be randomized to the\n      Playground Intervention or a waitlist control group. In the Playground Intervention,\n      UCLA/ROC/UPENN staff will work with school personals (teachers, paraprofessionals) to\n      increase peer engagement on the yard.\n\n      In intervention 2, students in special day classes will be randomized to the 'Schedule Tools\n      Activities Transitions' Intervention (STAT) or wait-list control.  In the STAT Intervention,\n      UCLA/ROC/UPENN staff will work with teachers to implement behavioral strategies in the\n      classrooms.\n\n      In both interventions, the conditions are: 1) Immediate treatment, where the training will\n      begin immediately after baseline measures are completed. 2) Wait-list treatment, where the\n      training will begin the follow school year."
