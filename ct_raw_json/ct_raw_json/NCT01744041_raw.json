Despite increasing evidence of the importance of this\n      critical risk interval, little research has investigated the effects of depression treatment\n      during pregnancy on infant outcomes. The purpose of this study is to test the feasibility,\n      acceptability, and effectiveness of a new intervention, Interpersonal psychotherapy for the\n      mother-infant dyad (IPT-Dyad). This intervention begins during pregnancy and continues with\n      the mother and infant until one year postpartum. The investigators hypothesize that IPT-Dyad\n      will be better than treatment as usual in reducing depressive symptoms, improving\n      psychosocial functioning,increasing parenting self-efficacy, improving infant emotional\n      development, and enhancing mother-infant relationship quality."
