  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children with cerebral palsy are at an increased risk of having their hips move partially or
      completely out of joint. This can cause pain and restrict movement at the hip, making
      sitting in a wheelchair uncomfortable and make personal care difficult. This condition may
      be treated with surgery. Surgeons use x-rays taken before and after the surgery to determine
      whether or not the surgery has been successful. However, it is also important to know
      whether the surgery has improved life from the child or the caregiver's point of view. The
      investigators will also evaluate if waiting for surgery affects the child. This information
      will be added to results from a physical exam and an evaluation of the child's x-rays for a
      more complete picture of how this surgery impacts the lives of our patients.  It is
      predicted that that the health-related quality of life of children with cerebral palsy will
      improve following surgery.

      HRQoL will be measured using the Child Health Index of Life with Disabilities (CPCHILD). Our
      specific hypothesis is that health related quality of life, as measured by the CPCHILD will
      change by at least a mean of 10 points from pre- to post-surgery.
