  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine if metformin in combination with cytarabine is safe
      and effective. Participants in this research study have acute myeloid leukemia (AML) that
      has come back after initial treatment or has not gone away with initial therapy.There is
      evidence that metformin directly kills leukemia cells. Laboratory data have also shown that
      combinations of metformin with cytarabine are more efficient than each agent alone in
      killing leukemia cells in the laboratory.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of metformin (metformin hydrochloride) in
      combination with cytarabine in relapsed/refractory AML.

      II. Define the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) of metformin in combination with cytarabine in
      relapsed/refractory AML.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Remission rate. II. Overall survival (OS). III. Disease-free survival (DFS). IV. Length
      of remission.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of metformin hydrochloride in combination with
      Cytarabine.

      Patients receive metformin hydrochloride orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-15 and
      cytarabine intravenously (IV) over 3 hours BID on days 4-10.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months for 5 years.
