            "textblock": "Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), or high blood pressure in the lungs, is a rare\n      condition that can shorten life. Although the cause of this disease is usually unknown, in\n      about 70% of heritable and 15-20% of idiopathic cases there is a change in a gene (a\n      mutation) that controls how blood vessels grow and function. The gene is called bone\n      morphogenetic protein type receptor 2 (BMPR2). Although mutations in BMPR2 are a risk factor\n      for PAH, not everyone with a mutation gets the disease. Additional genetic and environmental\n      factors are likely to contribute. The investigators suspect that mutations in other genes\n      are responsible for some cases of PAH. In this study the investigators aim to recruit all\n      patients with PAH and some of their relatives and follow them up for several years. The\n      investigators hope to discover new mutations for this disease and to determine what factors\n      lead to poor outcome, and to understand what triggers disease in patients with mutations.\n\n      Who can participate? Adults with PAH and their relatives"
