Also, none of\n      those reports have used foods rich in selenium as a source of supplementation. Thus, the aim\n      of our study was to investigate whether the consumption of Brazil nuts improves cognitive\n      function. We hypothesized that the daily consumption of Brazil nuts would have benefits on\n      selenium status, increase antioxidant enzyme activity and improve cognitive function in\n      older adults with MCI."

The diagnosis of MCI\n      was based on a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment which included the Consortium to\n      Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) neuropsychological battery (Welsh et\n      al., 1994; Bertolucci et al., 2001). Participants were recruited from May 2011 to August\n      2012. Eligible subjects were aged 60 years or older, fluent in Portuguese, and free of any\n      other significant neurologic or psychiatric diseases. None of them presented major\n      depression or psychosis, had a regular intake of Brazil nuts, used supplements with\n      selenium, or had intolerance to oleaginous food. An informed consent was obtained before the\n      interview from all participants.
