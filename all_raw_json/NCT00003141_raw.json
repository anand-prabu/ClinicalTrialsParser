Combining chemotherapy with peripheral stem cell\n      transplantation may allow the doctors to give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill\n      more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy plus\n      peripheral stem cell transplantation in treating infants with malignant brain or spinal cord\n      tumors."

Twenty four hours after\n      the last cyclophosphamide dose, patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) and\n      undergo peripheral blood stem cell harvest 2 days later. Treatment repeats every 21 days for\n      up to 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Within 6 weeks after induction chemotherapy, patients receive consolidation chemotherapy\n      comprising carboplatin IV over 2 hours on days 0-1 followed immediately by escalating doses\n      of thiotepa IV over 2 hours. Patients then undergo peripheral blood stem cell\n      transplantation 48 hours after the last thiotepa dose. Patients receive G-CSF SC daily on\n      days 3 to 21.
