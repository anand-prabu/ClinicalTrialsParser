The\n      investigators hypothesize that eight weeks of vitamin D supplementation will produce a\n      statistically significant decrease in symptoms of depression compared to placebo for people\n      with non-remitted depression.\n\n      This study will be a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled study.  Individuals will be\n      recruited who have failed to achieve remission from a depressive episode after a minimum of\n      eight weeks of treatment with a first-line antidepressant, at an adequate dose.   They will\n      be randomized to receive either placebo or vitamin D supplementation in addition to their\n      anti-depressant medication, which they will continue to take at the same dose for the\n      duration of the eight week study.There will be an additional follow up visit one month\n      later.\n\n      The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of supplemental vitamin D as an adjunctive\n      treatment in the management of non-remitted depression compared to placebo. Additionally,\n      its safety and tolerability will be assessed.\n\n      A secondary objective will be to assess the relationship between changes in serum vitamin D\n      levels and mood in order to elucidate information about the role that reversal of vitamin D\n      deficiency may play in the treatment of this condition."
