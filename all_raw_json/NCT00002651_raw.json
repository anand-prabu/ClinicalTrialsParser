It is not yet known which regimen of hormone\n      therapy is most effective for stage IV prostate cancer.\n\n      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying two different regimens of hormone\n      therapy and comparing how well they work in treating men with stage IV prostate cancer."

Patients are stratified according to SWOG\n      performance status (0-1 vs 2), severity of disease (minimal vs extensive), and prior\n      hormonal therapy (neoadjuvant hormonal therapy vs finasteride vs neither).\n\n        -  Induction therapy: Patients receive combined androgen-deprivation (CAD) therapy\n           comprising goserelin subcutaneously once a month and oral bicalutamide once daily for 8\n           courses (7 months).\n\n        -  Consolidation therapy: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 consolidation regimens.\n\n             -  Arm I (continuous CAD therapy): Patients continue CAD therapy as in induction\n                therapy. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression.\n\n             -  Arm II (intermittent CAD therapy): Patients undergo observation in the absence of\n                rising prostate-specific antigen (PSA) or clinical symptoms of progressive\n                disease. Patients with rising PSA or progressive disease begin CAD therapy as in\n                induction therapy. Patients whose PSA normalizes after 8 courses return to\n                observation. Patients whose PSA does not normalize after 8 courses continue CAD\n                therapy.\n\n      Quality of life is assessed before induction therapy, at 3 months (before consolidation\n      therapy), and then at 9 and 15 months.\n\n      Patients are followed every 6-12 months for at least 10 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 1,500 patients will be accrued for this study."
