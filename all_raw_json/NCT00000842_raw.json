Because nerve growth factor is\n      important in the development and maintenance of sympathetic and sensory neurons and their\n      outgrowths, it is proposed that recombinant human nerve growth factor may provide a specific\n      restorative treatment for HIV-associated painful sensory neuropathy."

Patients will assess their pain daily using the\n      Gracely Pain Scale.
