Each participant will\n      receive an anesthetic injection, pain medication and a prescription for an antibiotic.  They\n      will be asked to keep a diary to record their pain level after the injection and their pain\n      levels and the amount and type of pain medication taken each day for the next 5 days.\n      Participants who did not receive root canal therapy at the initial appointment will receive\n      it after the 5 day postoperative period.  The pain levels and medication use will be\n      compared between the treatment and nontreatment groups."
