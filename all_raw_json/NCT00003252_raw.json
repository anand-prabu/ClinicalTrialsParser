Chemoprotective drugs, such as amifostine, may protect normal\n      cells from the side effects of chemotherapy.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase IV trial to study the effectiveness of amifostine in treating patients with\n      cancer who have neurological changes caused by chemotherapy."

Patients are followed for one month post\n      treatment.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued for this study."
