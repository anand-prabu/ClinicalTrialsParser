    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, open label study designed to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of prolonged treatment with bortezomib twice monthly and dexamethasone after a
      salvage treatment containing bortezomib for relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma
      patients.

             protocol requirements.

          3. Patient has given voluntary written informed consent before performance of any
             study-related procedure not part of normal medical care, with the understanding that
             consent may be withdrawn by the patient at any time without prejudice to their future
             medical care.

          4. Female patient is either post-menopausal for 24 consecutive months or surgically

             willing to use two acceptable method of birth control at the same time (one highly
             effective method and one additional effective method) (Highly Effective Methods:
             Intrauterine device -IUD-; Hormonal -birth control pills, injections, implants-;
             tubal ligation; partner's vasectomy; Additional Effective Methods: Latex condom;
             Diaphragm; Cervical Cap) for 4 weeks prior to beginning study drug therapy, during
             study drug therapy (including dose interruption) and for 4 weeks after
             discontinuation of therapy.

          5. Male patient agrees to use an acceptable method for contraception (i.e., condom or
             abstinence) during study drug therapy (including dose interruption) and for 4 weeks
             after discontinuation of bortezomib therapy.

          6. Patient was previously diagnosed with multiple myeloma based on standard criteria.

          7. Patient is relapsed or refractory after one to three lines of treatment and the last
             one must be a bortezomib-containing regimen, without evidence of progressive disease.

          8. Patient had previously received at least 4 cycles of a salvage treatment containing
             bortezomib, before enrolment, without evidence of progressive disease.

          9. Patient must be enrolled and start therapy within 45 days from the completion of the
             last salvage cycle containing Bortezomib.

         10. Before the salvage treatment with bortezomib-based regimens, patient must have
             measurable disease

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any serious medical condition, laboratory abnormality or psychiatric illness that
             prevented the subject from signing the informed consent form or placed the subjects
