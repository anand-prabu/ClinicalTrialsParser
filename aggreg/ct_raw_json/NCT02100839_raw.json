The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of AEM-28 will\n      also be evaluated.\n\n      The second part of this study will be a multiple ascending dose evaluation of AEM-28 in\n      patients with refractory hypercholesterolemia.\n\n      AEM-28 has demonstrated significant lipid lowering activity and positive effects on the\n      artery wall. AEM-28 is being developed for the treatment of homozygous familial\n      hypercholesterolemia."
