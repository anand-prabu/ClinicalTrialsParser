They are\n      instrumental in presenting antigens (such as HIV antigens) to the body's immune system.\n      Since dendritic cells are not functioning maximally in HIV-infected patients, infusion of\n      dendritic cells from an HIV-negative sibling may enable the affected sibling's immune system\n      to recognize foreign particles more readily and increase immune response against the virus."
