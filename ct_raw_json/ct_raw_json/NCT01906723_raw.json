The Up n' Free (Easy Walking)\n      is a gait trainer equipped with a dynamic partial weight-bearing. The trainer is designed to\n      provide the user with independence, safety, and endurance. It allows for easy transfer from\n      sitting to standing position and stabilizes the pelvis, allowing for free movement of the\n      hands. The effectiveness of the Up n' Free trainer in increasing the patient's functionality\n      at the hospital or at home has not been quantified. We therefore aim to evaluate\n      effectiveness of the gait trainer in increasing the functionality and spatiotemporal\n      parameters of gait of 4 patients."

Each subject will understand and agree to an informed consent form\n      pretrial. The subjects' age, weight, and BMI will be documented. They will then receive a\n      10- minutes instruction on using the Up n' Free gait trainer and will be provided with the\n      trainer for the 1-week duration of the trial. Spatiotemporal parameters and gait symmetry\n      will be recorded in the Hadassah gait laboratory, while the patient ambulates with his or\n      her own walking aid. Physical Activity (PA) will be assessed using triaxial\n      accelerometer-based activity monitors (ActiGraph GT3X, Pensacola, Florida, USA), using a\n      preset sampling epoch of 1s. The participants will be instructed to wear the activity\n      monitors on their right hip for 7 consecutive days and only remove it during night time\n      sleep or water activities. At the end of 7 days the subjects will return the Up n' Free gait\n      trainer and fill out a satisfactory questionnaire. Spatiotemporal parameters and gait\n      symmetry will be recorded again in the Hadassah gait laboratory, while the patient ambulates\n      with the Up n' Free.\n\n      2.3 Data Analysis Estimates of the PA will be weighed by 5/7th of the weekly activity for\n      the weekdays (Sunday-Thursday) and 2/7th for weekend days (Friday and Saturday) as\n      within-week variation is expected. Total PA (1,000 counts \u00d7 day\u22121), wear time PA (count \u00d7\n      min\u22121), sedentary time (hours \u00d7 day\u22121; between 0-99 counts/min), low-light PA (min\u00d7day\u22121;\n      between 100-759 counts/min), High-light PA (min \u00d7 day\u22121; 760-2019 counts/min),\n      moderate-vigorous PA (min \u00d7 day\u22121; \u22652020 counts/min)."
