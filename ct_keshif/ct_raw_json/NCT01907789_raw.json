The safety of RRSO and PSDO will also be studied.\n\n      Ovarian cancer screening does not involve a surgical procedure.  Instead, physical exams,\n      blood tests, and ultrasound are used to check for ovarian, fallopian tube, and peritoneal\n      cancer.\n\n      The surgical procedures, RRSO and PSDO, are designed to lower your risk of ovarian cancer.\n\n      In RRSO, the fallopian tubes and ovaries are removed at the same time.\n\n      In PSDO, the fallopian tubes are removed and the ovaries remain in place so that the patient\n      does not go through menopause.  The ovaries are removed at a later date.  The main goal of\n      this study is to learn how many patients actually have their ovaries removed at a later\n      date.  Researchers also want to learn whether the removal of fallopian tubes will decrease\n      the risk of ovarian cancer."

            "textblock": "This study has 3 options: ovarian cancer screening, PSDO, and RRSO.  You may choose which\n      study group you want to take part in.  However, you must let the researchers know what your\n      choice is before any testing for the study begins.  The 3 study groups are described in\n      detail below.\n\n      GROUP 1: OVARIAN CANCER SCREENING:\n\n      Study Visits:\n\n      For this group, there is no testing required before starting the study.  If you agree to be\n      in Group 1, the following tests and procedures will be performed:\n\n        -  You will have a physical exam, including a pelvic exam.\n\n        -  You will have a transvaginal ultrasound (ultrasound inside the vagina) to look at your\n           ovaries and fallopian tubes.\n\n        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn to measure your CA125 levels.  This test is\n           used to screen for ovarian cancer.\n\n        -  You will complete a questionnaire about your quality of life.  This should take up to\n           15 minutes.\n\n      Every 6 months for up to 3 years:\n\n        -  You will have a physical exam, including a pelvic exam.\n\n        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for CA-125 testing.\n\n        -  You will have a transvaginal ultrasound to look at your ovaries and fallopian tubes.\n\n      At the end of Years 1, 2, and 3, you will complete the quality-of-life questionnaire.\n\n      All of your test results will be discussed with you.  If any of your test results are\n      abnormal, the study doctor may ask you to have additional testing, which may include CA-125\n      testing, ultrasound, and/or a computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging\n      (MRI).  If the results show cancer, the study doctor will refer you to a gynecologic\n      oncologist (a doctor for women's cancer) and/or recommend that you have your ovaries and\n      fallopian tubes removed.\n\n      Length of Study:\n\n      You will have study visits for up to 3 years.  You will be taken off study early if you\n      develop cancer or if you are unable to follow study directions.\n\n      Follow-Up:\n\n      One (1) time a year after your last study visit for as long as needed, the study staff will\n      contact you by phone, e-mail, or letter to ask if you have had any changes in your medical\n      history.  If you are called, the calls should last about 5 minutes.\n\n      GROUP 2: FALLOPIAN TUBE REMOVAL WITH DELAYED OVARY REMOVAL (PSDO):\n\n      Salpingectomy:\n\n      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study in Group 2, the study doctor will\n      discuss the salpingectomy surgery with you in detail, including the risks and possible\n      benefits.  You will be asked to sign a surgical consent form.  After that, the salpingectomy\n      will be scheduled.\n\n      Most patients have salpingectomy performed as an outpatient procedure.  This means that you\n      will likely go home the day of your surgery.  If the study doctor plans to have you stay\n      overnight in the hospital for any reason, it will be discussed with you.\n\n      During the surgery, the inside of your abdomen will be looked at and both of your fallopian\n      tubes will be removed.  If the study doctor finds anything during the surgery that may be\n      cancerous, a tissue sample will be removed during surgery and tested.\n\n      Post-Salpingectomy Follow-Up:\n\n      The study staff will call you 1 day and 1 week after surgery to ask how you are doing.  The\n      calls should last about 5 minutes.\n\n      One (1) month after surgery:\n\n        -  You will have a physical exam, including an exam of your surgical incisions (wounds).\n\n        -  You will complete the quality-of-life questionnaire.\n\n      The pathology (tissue) results from your surgery will be discussed with you at either the\n      1-week phone call or the 1-month visit.  If the results show cancer, the study doctor will\n      refer you to a gynecologic oncologist.\n\n      Ovarian Cancer Screening Period:\n\n      Every 6 months for 3 years after the salpingectomy:\n\n        -  You will have a physical exam, including a pelvic exam.\n\n        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for CA-125 testing.\n\n        -  You will have a transvaginal ultrasound to look at your ovaries.\n\n      At the end of Years 1, 2, and 3, you will complete the quality-of-life questionnaire.\n\n      Pre-Oophorectomy Testing:\n\n      After the 3-year screening period, you will have a pre-oophorectomy visit.  The following\n      tests and procedures will be performed:\n\n        -  You will have a physical exam, including a pelvic exam.\n\n        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests and CA-125 testing.\n\n        -  You will have a transvaginal ultrasound to look at your ovaries, if this has not been\n           done in the last 6 months.\n\n        -  You will complete the quality-of-life questionnaire, if this has not been done in the\n           last 6 months.\n\n        -  You may have other tests performed if the study doctor thinks it is needed.\n\n      Oophorectomy:\n\n      If your pre-surgical testing is normal, the study doctor will discuss the planned surgery\n      with you in detail, including the risks and possible benefits.  You will be asked to sign a\n      surgical consent form.  After that, the oophorectomy will be scheduled.\n\n      Most patients have oophorectomy performed as an outpatient procedure.  This means that you\n      will likely go home the day of your surgery.  If the study doctor plans to have you stay\n      overnight in the hospital for any reason, it will be discussed with you.\n\n      During the surgery, the inside of your abdomen will be looked at and both of your ovaries\n      will be removed.  If the study doctor finds anything during the surgery that may be\n      cancerous, a tissue sample will be removed during surgery and tested.\n\n      Post-Oophorectomy Follow-Up:\n\n      The study staff will call you 1 day and 1 week after surgery to ask how you are doing.\n\n      One (1) month after surgery:\n\n        -  You will have a physical exam, including an exam of your surgical incisions.\n\n        -  You will complete the quality-of-life questionnaire.\n\n      The pathology results from your surgery will be discussed with you at either the 1-week\n      phone call or the 1-month visit.  If the results show cancer, the study doctor will refer\n      you to a gynecologic oncologist.\n\n      At 6 months and 1 year after surgery, you will complete the quality-of-life questionnaire.\n\n      At 1 year after surgery:\n\n        -  You will have a physical exam, including a pelvic exam.\n\n        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for CA-125 testing.\n\n      All of your test results will be discussed with you.  If any of your test results are\n      abnormal, the study doctor may ask you to have additional testing, which may include CA-125\n      testing, ultrasound, and/or a CT scan or MRI.  If the results show cancer, the study doctor\n      will refer you to a gynecologic oncologist.\n\n      Length of Study:\n\n      You will have study visits for up to 4 years.  You will be taken off study early if you\n      develop cancer or if you are unable to follow study directions.\n\n      Follow-Up:\n\n      One (1) time a year after your last study visit for as long as needed, the study staff will\n      contact you by phone, e-mail, or letter to ask if you have had any changes in your medical\n      history.\n\n      GROUP 3: REMOVAL OF FALLOPIAN TUBES AND OVARIES AT THE SAME TIME (RRSO):\n\n      RRSO:\n\n      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study in Group 3, the study doctor will\n      discuss the surgery with you in detail, including the risks and possible benefits.  You will\n      be asked to sign a surgical consent form.  After that, the RRSO will be scheduled.\n\n      Most patients have RRSO performed as an outpatient procedure.  This means that you will\n      likely go home the day of your surgery.  If the study doctor plans to have you stay\n      overnight in the hospital for any reason, it will be discussed with you.\n\n      During the surgery, the inside of your abdomen will be looked at and both of your ovaries\n      and fallopian tubes will be removed.  If the study doctor finds anything during the surgery\n      that may be cancerous, a tissue sample will be removed during surgery and tested.\n\n      The pathology results from your surgery will be discussed with you at either the 1-week\n      phone call or the 1-month visit.  If the results show cancer, the study doctor will refer\n      you to a gynecologic oncologist.\n\n      Post-Surgery Follow-Up:\n\n      The study staff will call you 1 day and 1 week after surgery to ask how you are doing.\n\n      One (1) month after surgery:\n\n        -  You will have a physical exam, including an exam of your surgical incisions.\n\n        -  You will complete the quality-of-life questionnaire.\n\n      The pathology results from your surgery will be discussed with you at either the 1-week\n      phone call or the 1-month visit.  If the results show cancer, the study doctor will refer\n      you to a gynecologic oncologist.\n\n      At 6 months and 1 year after surgery, you will complete the quality-of-life questionnaire.\n\n      At 1 year after surgery:\n\n        -  You will have a physical exam, including a pelvic exam.\n\n        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn to measure your CA-125.\n\n      All of your test results will be discussed with you.  If any of your test results are\n      abnormal, the study doctor may ask you to have additional testing, which may include CA-125\n      testing, ultrasound, and/or a CT scan or MRI.  If the results show cancer, the study doctor\n      will refer you to a gynecologic oncologist.\n\n      Length of Study:\n\n      You will have study visits for up to 1 year after surgery.  You will be taken off study\n      early if you develop cancer or if you are unable to follow study directions.\n\n      Follow-Up:\n\n      One (1) time a year after your last study visit for as long as needed, the study staff will\n      contact you by phone, e-mail, or letter to ask if you have had any changes in your medical\n      history.\n\n      This is an investigational study.  At this time, the only known method that may lower your\n      risk of ovarian cancer is to have both of your ovaries and fallopian tubes removed (RRSO).\n      Screening for ovarian cancer does not lower the risk that you will develop cancer.  PSDO has\n      not previously been studied and may not lower your ovarian cancer risk.  PSDO is currently\n      being used for research purposes only.\n\n      Up to 40 women will take part in this study.  All will be enrolled at MD Anderson."
