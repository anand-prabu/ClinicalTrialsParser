The study will engage patients, ages 50-75 years who are non-adherent to CRCS, to\n      assess their CRCS test preferences and corresponding test-specific barriers in \"real time\".\n      Based on patient characteristics (e.g. age, personal and family history, physician CRCS\n      recommendation, CRCS test preferences, top test-specific barriers), tailored messages/videos\n      will appear in the pop-up screens to address/reduce the top patient-reported, test-specific\n      CRCS barriers while incorporating an action plan for CRCS adherence. The investigators\n      hypothesize that modifying the IPHR-CRCS module to address each patient's individual CRCS\n      knowledge, attitudes, preferences, and test-specific barriers will further increase CRCS."
