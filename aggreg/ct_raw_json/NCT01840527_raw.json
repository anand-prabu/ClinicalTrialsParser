You will be\n      placed in one of the Groups.\n\n      Group 1-For participants with advanced melanoma: Your existing tumor tissue sample will be\n      compared to the blood samples given in order to further analyze and to understand the\n      BRAFV600E gene mutation.\n\n      Group 2-For participants with stage II/III melanoma: Following surgery, blood samples will\n      be collected and analyzed.\n\n      Understanding the BRAFV600E gene mutation in melanoma will help the researchers better\n      understand the disease, and help plan treatment options for people with melanoma of all\n      stages in the future."
