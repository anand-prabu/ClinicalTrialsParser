The Part II (Phase 1b) assessments of the dose-related safety, PK, and\n      initial antiviral efficacy of NVR 3-778 in hepatitis B patients will also be conducted at 4\n      different sites to meet enrollment goals of 72-84 chronic hepatitis B patients.\n\n      Study treatment in Parts I and II will be randomized and double-blinded. The volunteers in\n      each Part I dose cohort will be randomized 6:2 with active NVR 3-778 doses or matching\n      placebo doses. Similarly, study treatment for each cohort in Part II will be randomized 10:2\n      to treatment with active NVR 3-778 doses or matching placebo doses.\n\n      To promote objective safety and tolerance assessments during this trial, study subjects, and\n      site personnel administering the study drug and performing the clinical assessments on the\n      subjects, will be blinded to individual subjects' treatments assignments (active NVR 3-778\n      or placebo doses), for all treatment cohorts in the study. Study advancement to subsequent\n      volunteer cohorts in Part I and subsequent patient cohorts in Part II will require\n      satisfactory interim reviews of available cumulative safety data by the Part I and Part II\n      Safety Review Committees (SRCs), using the safety criteria and review procedures described\n      in the protocol. Also, there will be two interim reviews of safety data by an independent\n      Safety Monitoring Board (SMB), as described in the protocol."
