Evaluate the response and survival rates of patients with metastatic melanoma\n      following induction with high-dose and maintenance with low-dose interleukin-2. II. Assess\n      the toxicity of this regimen.\n\n      OUTLINE: All patients receive high-dose interleukin-2 over 24 hours, followed by low-dose\n      interleukin-2 for 4 days in the absence of toxicity. Patients receive a second cycle\n      beginning 9-13 days after completion of the first cycle, with response assessed\n      approximately 2 months after initiating therapy. Patients with stable or responding disease\n      receive a second course as above; those with a continued response may receive additional\n      courses provided toxicity is limited. Patients are followed for survival.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 20 patients will be entered."
