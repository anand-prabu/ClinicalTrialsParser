The use of lycopene may be an effective way to prevent prostate\n      cancer.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of lycopene in preventing prostate cancer."

Patients are asked to maintain a diet that contains\n      negligible carotinoid for 28 days.\n\n      Cohorts of 5 patients receive escalating doses of lycopene until the maximum tolerated dose\n      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 5 patients\n      experience dose limiting toxicities.\n\n      Patients are followed weekly for 4 weeks.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 5-25 patients will be accrued for this study."
