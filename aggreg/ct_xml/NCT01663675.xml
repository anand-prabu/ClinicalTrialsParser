  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Trisomy 21 or Down syndrome, is the most common genetic cause of cognitive disability.
      Currently, in Alsace, the birth prevalence is about 1 in 1600 live births, which means 10
      liveborns with Down syndrome each year.If screening and prenatal diagnosis of children with
      trisomy 21, as well as medical care, social and educational integration in childhood was the
      subject of much research and has led to remarkable progress in terms of health and medical
      care, it is not the same for the knowledge about adolescents and adults.Despite a more and
      more higher life expectancy, the evolution of trisomy 21 in adulthood is often marked by a
      deterioration in health status, with a regression of acquired psychomotor skills, often
      attributed only to the precocious occurrence of Alzheimer's dementia. Nevertheless, it seems
      that the diagnosis of Alzheimer's dementia is often overdiagnosed, and it is well
      established that only a fraction of Down syndrome patients will develop this type of
      dementia. Too often a decline in general health, behavioral changes and decreased cognitive
      abilities are only attributed to the Down syndrome with an early dementia without looking
      for an underlying, potentially curable, disease.This study aims to better evaluate the
      health and social status of 100 adults with trisomy 21 in Alsace. The medical evaluation
      will include a comprehensive assessment of health status and quality of life conducted by
      the geneticist, a cardiac, sensory, hormonal, biological and radiological evaluation. A
      speech-language and psychomotor evaluation will also be conducted. A psychiatric
      consultation and a psychometric assessment will aim to assess cognitive function and to
      search for associated mood disorders.The expected results are to better know the natural
      history of trisomy 21 in adulthood, with the determination of the frequency of morbid events
      specific to adulthood, and also to improve the medical and paramedical care with the
      establishment of a monitoring program to prevent the occurrence of these morbid events.
