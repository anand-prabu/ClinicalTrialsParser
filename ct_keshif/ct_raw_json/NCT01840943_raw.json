The study consists of 3 phases: screening phase (30 days\n      before administration of study medication), treatment phase, and follow up phase (every 8\n      weeks for tumor assessment until disease progression or death, or until the study\n      completion, whichever is earlier and every 3 months after disease progression for overall\n      survival and for anti-tumor therapy for a minimum of 1 year). In the treatment phase,\n      approximately 120 eligible participants will be categorized prospectively for\n      platinum-sensitivity (sensitive versus refractory) and bulky disease (presence versus\n      absence). Later on participants will be randomly assigned either to experimental arm\n      (CAELYX: administer on Day 1 of each cycle) or control arm (topotecan HCl: administer on Day\n      1 to Day 5 of each cycle). Treatment will continue until disease progression occurs and may\n      continue for at least 2 cycles after confirmed complete response (disappearance of all\n      target lesions). On average, it is expected that participants will continue treatment for\n      approximately 3 to 6 cycles in experimental arm (CAELYX) or 4 to 8 cycles in Control arm\n      (topotecan HCl). Safety evaluations will include assessment of adverse events, clinical\n      laboratory tests, electrocardiogram, echocardiogram (or multiple gated acquisition scans),\n      vital signs, and physical examination which will be monitored throughout the study. The\n      total duration of the study will be approximately 23 months."
