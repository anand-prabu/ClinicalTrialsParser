            "textblock": "To improve rectal cancer management, there is a need for better visualization of drug\n      targets in rectal cancer to identify patients who might benefit from specific targeted\n      treatments. Molecular imaging of rectal cancer associated targets is a promising technique\n      to accommodate this need. Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF), which is differentially\n      expressed in normal versus malignant colon tissue, has proven to be a valid target for\n      molecular imaging. Fluorescent labeling of bevacizumab (a VEGF targeting humanized\n      monoclonal antibody currently used in anti-cancer therapy) using IRDye800CW (a fluorescent\n      dye) has potential advantages in view of safety, infrastructure, costs, stability and\n      imaging resolution. Therefore, the fluorescent tracer bevacizumab-IRDye800CW has been\n      developed at the University Medical Center Groningen (UMCG) and was recently approved to be\n      administered to patients in a tracer dose. To detect this tracer in vivo in patients with\n      colorectal cancer, a newly developed flexible near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence endoscope and\n      optoacoustic endoscope have been developed which can be used in clinical studies. Optical\n      fluorescence imaging may support response evaluation following chemoradiotherapy and give\n      insight which patient might benefit from anti-VEGF targeted therapy in future studies."

The patient will then be observed for 1 hour post administration.\n\n        -  Visit 3: First endoscopy will be performed at baseline (two days after tracer\n           administration); before the start of chemoradiotherapy.\n\n        -  Visit 4: 3 weeks after start of the chemotherapy patients will receive a second dose of\n           4.5 mg of bevacizumab-IRDye800CW (second tracer administration)\n\n        -  Visit 5: A second flexible NIR fluorescence endoscopy procedure will be performed (two\n           days after the second tracer injection).\n\n      Optionally and when available, we will ask patients if they would like to undergo\n      optoacoustic endoscopy. This is a form of endoscopic ultrasound which is able to detect\n      bevacizumab-IRDye800CW up to 2 cm in depth. The procedure is comparable with NIR\n      fluorescence endoscopy. If patients agree, after removal of the NIR fluorescence endoscope\n      the optoacoustic endoscope will be introduced in the rectum of the patient for detection of\n      bevacizumab-IRDye800CW in deeper areas of the tumor."
