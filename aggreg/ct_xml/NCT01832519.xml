    <textblock>
      Our research is comparing the lungs of babies and young children with CF (cystic fibrosis)
      to those without CF. We are looking at the blood flow in the lungs to help doctors better
      understand how CF damages lungs and how to prevent this damage in the future. We will use
      MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) and special blood tests as ways to understand early changes
      in the lungs of babies and young children with CF. We will look at the special blood tests
      to see if they can work as signals for the doctors to better understand when changes are
      happening in the lungs.

      For the babies with CF, we will compare MRI images of the lungs to their CT images (also
      sometimes called CAT scans or Computerized Tomography). We hope that this study will help us
      reduce the number of X-rays and CT scans children with CF might get in the future. Because
      MRI's do not use radiation, this could reduce the amount of radiation exposure that children
      with CF would get over their lifetime.

    <textblock>
      Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a well characterized multi-organ disease producing mucus
      obstruction, chronic lung infection, inflammation, and oxidant stress. These processes
      result in airway damage, chronic pulmonary symptoms, and ultimately death in young
      adulthood. These processes are largely silent in the infant and toddler CF population, and
      ultimately result in lung damage and symptoms of CF. Detection and monitoring of lung
      disease in infants and toddlers with CF is currently limited, and is a major barrier to
      advancements in care and research for this population.

      This study will be performed in CF and non-CF controls age 6 months - 3 years, with repeated
      measures in CF patients over this window. We intend to examine new techniques to evaluate
      the lung of CF infants based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that incorporates
      measurements of lung structure and blood flow. In the CF group, we will augment MRI images
      with CT images to determine structural relationships between MR and CT (a gold standard to
      assess lung structure in CF). We will correlate imaging data with core peripheral biomarkers
      of CF using an unbiased, metabolomic and proteomic-based approach.  It is hoped that the
      results of this study will provide support for the use of MRI to monitor lung structure and
      blood flow in early CF lung disease, potentially providing a modality to monitor disease
      status independent of radiation exposure.

      We hypothesize that MRI of the lung and pulmonary circulation has the potential to serve as
      a sensitive and portable tool to monitor early CF lung disease. We will examine three
      functional aspects of pulmonary blood flow (total and regional pulmonary perfusion, vascular
      resistance, and aortopulmonary collateral blood flow) compared with structural assessment of
      the lung by MRI and CT.

      This proposal couples advancements in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques with the
      emerging technologies of metabolomics and proteomics, linking new MR imaging to candidate
      and novel pathway analysis. We will use the new technologies (metabolomics and proteomics -
      performed on peripheral blood samples) to determine if altered signaling pathways detected
      in the blood are related to changes in the lung. We hypothesize that changes in pulmonary
      perfusion and/or structure can be correlated with peripheral biomarkers identified by
      metabolomics and proteomic methodology.

      Candidate metabolomic pathways that have been shown to segregate CF from non-CF conditions
      (including oxidative status, purinergic signaling, and glucose metabolism) will be the focus
      of initial biomarker analysis, with advanced bioinformatic techniques applied to define
      novel relationships between the metabolome and imaging.  Proteomics will serve a validating
      function, helping to assign enzyme pathways to metabolomics alterations.

      The study design includes 30 CF subjects who will receive chest CT with gadolinium contrast
      and High Resolution CT (HRCT) at baseline and 12 months. They will be compared to 60 age
      matched non-CF subjects who will have one visit of MRI with contrast. The non CF group only
      includes subjects scheduled for MRI for clinical reasons and will have an additional chest
      imaging at the end of their scheduled MRI. Both groups will have blood drawn to measure
      metabolomic and proteomic markers.
