            "textblock": "Lung cancer, largely the result of cigarette smoking, is the leading cause of cancer death\n      in the United States, killing over 160,000 people in 2010, more than breast, colorectal, and\n      prostate cancer combined.  Since only 10% of heavy smokers develop lung cancer and 20% of\n      lung cancers develop in nonsmokers, it is thought that genetic predisposition plays an\n      important role. This study proposes to examine the genetic correlation between nasal and\n      bronchial epithelium and to identify a patient's risk for lung cancer earlier."
