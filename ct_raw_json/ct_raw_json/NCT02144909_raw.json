Participants in the support groups will receive a\n      culturally-tailored, semi-structured social support program delivered in a community setting\n      by trained community peer educators and other health professionals (e.g., pharmacist). The\n      investigators believe that the addition of a semi-structured social support component as a\n      supplement to an evidence-based diabetes self-management intervention will improve diabetes\n      self-care maintenance."
