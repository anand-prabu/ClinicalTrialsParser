For\n      patients, which will be included in the trial (mainly middle aged patients without severe\n      complications of diabetes), HbA1c>7.0% is the marker showing that optimal individual goal of\n      glycemic control is not achieved.\n\n      If a patient meets inclusion criteria and does not show non- inclusion criteria he/she is\n      randomized in one of 2 groups: Group 1 - the group receiving standard type II diabetes\n      mellitus therapy + Subetta at a dose of 1 tablet 4 times a day; Group 2 - the group\n      receiving standard type II diabetes mellitus therapy + Placebo under the regimen used for\n      Subetta. The invented names of the drugs containing basal insulin, metformin and\n      sulfonylurea derivatives used as standard type II diabetes mellitus therapy, should be\n      unchanged for each patient during the whole trial.\n\n      All patients will receive glucometers and the appropriate glucose test strips, so they could\n      self monitor blood glucose and register this data in their diaries.\n\n      The trial duration is 26 weeks; the main stages of the trial are conducted during screening,\n      then in 4 weeks (Visit 2), in 12 weeks (Visit 3) and in 24 weeks (Visit 4). In 1 week after\n      randomization and the onset of the trial therapy and between the visits to the study site\n      (on weeks 8\u00b11 and 18\u00b11) an investigator collects data on patient's health and complaints\n      (phone visits) to decide whether it is necessary to arrange unplanned visit to the site."
