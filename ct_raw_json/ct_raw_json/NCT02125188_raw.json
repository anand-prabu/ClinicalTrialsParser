            "textblock": "Desmopressin, a synthetic analogue of vasopressin, has been employed as a non-transfusional\n      treatment for hemophilia and von Willebrand's disease. Hemostatic effects of desmopressin\n      include: 1) an increase in plasma factors through endogenous release of coagulation factor\n      VIII, von Willebrand factor and tissue plasminogen activator; 2) an increase in platelet\n      adhesiveness; and 3) a reduction in bleeding time. Randomized, double-blind studies have\n      been performed on patients undergoing various types of surgical procedures. A study in\n      patients undergoing orthognathic surgery showed a significant reduction in intraoperative\n      blood loss and a study in patients undergoing lumbar fusion concluded that desmopressin was\n      effective in reducing intraoperative blood loss. The purpose of this study was to\n      investigate the effect of administration of desmopressin on intraoperative blood loss in\n      patients undergoing FESS."
