  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patient reported pain, stress, and anxiety measures have been found to be inter-related, but
      it is not known if they are all associated with receiving opiate medications. The objective
      of this study is to determine if patients' degree of reported pain, stress, or anxiety is
      associated with receiving opiate pain medications in the emergency department or at
      discharge. Alert patients at least 18 years of age and who report pain greater than 3/10 are
      eligible to participate in the study. Consenting patients complete Visual Analog Scales
      describing their perceived pain, stress, and anxiety from enrollment until discharge.
      Demographic data and administration of pain medication is also recorded. Visual Analog Scale
      scores among patients who received an opioid pain medicine in the emergency department and
      at discharge will be compared to those who did not.
