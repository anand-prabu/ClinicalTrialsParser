It is possible that high leukocyte\n      count in children with sickle cell anemia is a bad prognostic sign due to NETs formation\n      supporting occlusion of peripheral and central blood vessels.Hydroxyurea treatment might\n      prevent vaso occlusive syndrome not only by increasing HbF but also by decreasing neutrophil\n      count and inhibiting NETs formation."
