The patient has a large chromosomal deletion or complex rearrangement that includes a\n             deletion of the FMR1 and/or FMR2 genes.\n\n          3.

The patient has contra-indications for performance of lumbar puncture such as\n             musculoskeletal/spinal abnormalities or risk of abnormal bleeding.\n\n          5. The patient has a history of complications from previous lumbar punctures or\n             technical challenges in conducting lumbar punctures such that the potential risks\n             would exceed possible benefits for the patient.\n\n          6. The patient has an opening CSF pressure upon lumbar puncture that exceeds 30.0 cm\n             H2O.\n\n          7. The patient has experienced infusion-related anaphylactoid event(s) or has evidence\n             of consistent severe adverse events related to treatment with Elaprase which, in the\n             Investigator's opinion, may pose an unnecessary risk to the patient.\n\n          8. The patient has received a cord blood or bone marrow transplant at any time or has\n             received blood product transfusions within 90 days prior to Screening.\n\n          9. The patient has a history of poorly controlled seizure disorder.\n\n         10. The patient is unable to comply with the protocol (eg, has significant hearing or\n             vision impairment, a clinically relevant medical condition making implementation of\n             the protocol difficult, unstable social situation, known clinically significant\n             psychiatric/behavioral instability, is unable to return for safety evaluations, or is\n             otherwise unlikely to complete the study), as determined by the Investigator.\n\n         11. The patient is enrolled in another clinical study that involves clinical\n             investigation or use of any investigational product (drug or [intrathecal/spinal]\n             device) within 30 days prior to study enrollment or at any time during the study.\n\n         12. The patient has any known or suspected hypersensitivity to anesthesia or is thought\n             to be at an unacceptably high risk for anesthesia due to compromised airways or other\n             conditions.\n\n         13. The patient has a condition that is contraindicated as described in the SOPH-A-PORT\n             Mini S IDDD Instructions for Use (IFU), including but not limited to the presence of\n             a CSF shunt device in the patient."
