  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective observational study to determine the point after bone marrow
      transplant in adults and children at which the neutrophils derived from the transplanted
      stem cells are competent to form functional neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs).
      Furthermore, given the importance of platelet function for NET formation, we also plan to
      examine platelet activation and function as well as the platelet transcriptome using the
      same clinical samples.

      Background and Introduction

      The role of the human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) in the acute inflammatory response
      is well documented.  PMNs play a fundamental role in the innate immune response and are
      rapidly recruited to areas of injury or inflammation where they participate in bacterial
      phagocytosis and killing.  Disorders associated with a deficiency or impairment of PMN
      function (neutropenia, chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), leukocyte adhesion deficiency)
      predispose to infections with bacteria and fungi.  Regulation of this potent component of
      the acute inflammatory response is imperative to prevent overwhelming infections often
      associated with morbidity and mortality.

      Recently, neutrophils isolated from healthy adult donors were shown to undergo programmed
      cell death distinct from apoptosis and necrosis to form neutrophil extracellular traps
      (NETs).  NETs are extensive lattices of extracellular DNA and chromatin decorated with
      anti-microbial proteins and degradative enzymes such as myeloperoxidase and neutrophil
      elastase (NE).  NETs effect extracellular killing of bacteria and fungi.  The laboratory of
      Christian Yost, MD recently characterized impaired NET formation as a novel innate immune
      deficiency of human newborn infants and showed that PMNs isolated from the cord blood of
      newborn infants, both term and preterm, demonstrated impaired NET formation and
      extracellular bacterial killing as compared to PMNs isolated from healthy adults.  However,
      the timing for developmental maturation of newborn infant PMN NET formation remains unknown.

      Stem cells for bone marrow transplants originate from cord blood, peripheral stem cells, or
      bone marrow stem cells.  Regardless of the source of these stem cells, patients receiving a
      bone marrow transplant are essentially building a new immune system, as if they were a
      newborn baby.  Immune system reconstitution is a continuous process whose components can
      take up to 1 to 2 years to fully recover.  Severe infections in bone marrow transplant
      patients occur and may be associated with deficient PMN NET formation by way of impaired
      extracellular bacterial containment and killing.  We hypothesize that the increased risk of
      infection attributed to bone marrow transplant recipients results, in part, from deficient
      PMN NET formation by the nascent, post-engraftment immune system which is molecularly and
      functionally similar to that of a newborn baby.  We plan to determine the point after
      transplant at which the neutrophils derived from the transplanted stem cells are competent
      to form functional NETs.  Furthermore, given the importance of platelet function for NET
      formation, we also plan to examine platelet activation and function as well as the platelet
      transcriptome using the same clinical samples.
