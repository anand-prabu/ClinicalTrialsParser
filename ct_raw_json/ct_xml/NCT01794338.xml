  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the outcomes of patients who have been treated with Strattice or Gore
      Bio-A mesh for the repair of complicated abdominal wall hernias. The purpose of this study
      is to collect information and evaluate the outcome of your surgery. Synthetic (man made)
      mesh has been shown to provide durable long-term outcomes; however, this type of mesh should
      not be used in patients at risk of developing an infection. Therefore, to address the
      challenge of finding an artificial strengthening material to repair complicated hernias in
      patients that could potentially develop surgical infection, two types of non-permanent
      materials have been developed, including biologics and bioabsorbables. Biologic mesh is made
      of living tissue and bioabsorbable mesh is made of synthetic material that is gradually
      absorbed by the body over time. The purpose of this study is to allow surgeons to compare
      the postoperative course of patients associated with these two mesh types to decide which
      material will improve the outcomes of their patients with complicated abdominal wall
      defects. To date there is no evidence to suggest that either mesh type is superior or safer
      than the other.
