Follow-up appointments will be held every 3 weeks. One group will be\n      encouraged to update their Facebook status at least once a day, regarding their healthy\n      lifestyle changes (exercise routine, healthy food choice, \"checking-in\" at the wellness\n      center, kilograms lost, etc). The control group will be asked not to share information about\n      their program on Facebook for 12 weeks. Facebook follow-up will be held by the investigators\n      on the study's Facebook account. Teenagers will be thoroughly explained on how to set the\n      account to a limited profile if they want to. At the end of the program both groups will be\n      compared regarding weight loss and mean BMI."
