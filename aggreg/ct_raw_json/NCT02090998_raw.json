Subjects will recieve either sphenopalatine ganglion nerve block\n      with 5% lidocaine gel into the nasopharynx or medical management with traditional\n      antidepressants, Elavil, to produce a reduction in the frequency and severity of the\n      headache.\n\n      We propose that there will be a difference in the outcomes when comparing the two methods of\n      treating transformed migraines and that one research arm will result in more patient\n      satisfaction and greater efficacy in the treatment of subjects"
