The patient must have failed standard therapies to prevent the progression of liver\n             disease such as surgical treatment, cyclic TPN, avoiding overfeeding,\n             reduction/removal of copper and manganese from TPN, advancement of enteral feeding,\n             and use of ursodiol (Actigall)\n\n          6. Subjects who are currently under treatment for PNALD with Compassionate Use Omegaven\n             and have a direct Bilirubin of< 2, but who remain TPN dependent and require continued\n             therapy with Omegaven\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          1. Other known causes of chronic liver disease (hepatitis C, cystic fibrosis, biliary\n             atresia and alpha 1 anti-trypsin deficiency)\n\n          2. Enrollment in any other clinical trial involving an investigational agent (unless\n             approved by the designated physicians on the multidisciplinary team)\n\n          3. The parent, guardian, or child is unwilling to provide consent or assent\n\n          4. Allergy to any fish product, egg protein, and/or previous allergy to Omegaven\n\n          5. Active coagulopathies characterized by on-going bleeding or by a requirement for\n             clotting factor replacement such as fresh frozen plasma or cryoprecipitate to\n             maintain homeostasis\n\n          6. Impaired lipid metabolism or severe hyperlipidemia with or without pancreatitis\n\n          7. Unstable diabetes mellitus\n\n          8. Stroke/embolism\n\n          9. Collapse and shock\n\n         10. Undefined coma status\n\n         11. Active infection at time of initiation of Omegaven\u00ae up until such time as child is\n             afebrile with stable vital signs and one negative 48 hour culture"
