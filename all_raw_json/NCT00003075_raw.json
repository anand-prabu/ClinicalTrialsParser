Document the qualitative and\n      quantitative toxicity of 4-HPR in women with CIN.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a double blinded study. Patients are randomized to receive either\n      fenretinide or placebo. Patients are administered fenretinide or a placebo by mouth (PO)\n      daily for 6 months with 3 days of rest every month. Patients undergo colposcopy,\n      colpophotography, and Pap smears at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Patients undergo cervical biopsy\n      at 6 and 12 months to assess changes.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 84-100 patients will be accrued."
