The NIH research team is studying how an experimental vaccine will\n      affect MTC.  The vaccine (GI-6207) is made with yeast and designed to target cells making a\n      protein called CEA (carcinoembryonic antigen).  The study is testing the safety and\n      tolerability of GI-6207.  GI-6207 is made with baker's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae).\n      The yeast is genetically modified, made to express CEA, then heat killed.  The goal is to\n      get the immune system to respond to the vaccine by making immune cells that can recognize\n      and attach tumor cells.  Patients will be randomized to GI-6207 or to surveillance for 6\n      months followed by treatment with GI-6207.  Patients will receive up to 1 year of treatment."

There are no\n      standard treatments for patient with asymptomatic metastatic disease.  GI-6207 can induce\n      specific T cell responses against the CEA antigen.  Previous data suggests that therapeutic\n      cancer vaccines can alter tumor growth rates and do so within 6 months.  An analysis of\n      medullary thyroid cancer patients suggest that 6 months of surveillance is adequate to\n      calculate a growth rate in the control arm.  A comparison of growth rates after 6 months\n      will be made between patients treated with GI-6207 and those on surveillance.  For patients\n      on surveillance, they will also be compared to their own baseline growth rate after they\n      have received 6 months of therapy."
