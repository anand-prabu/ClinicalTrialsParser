  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute and chronic anemia continue to be associated with increased mortality in a number of
      clinical settings, including cardiac and non-cardiac surgery. However, &quot;We have no clinical
      measures that let us know of impending insufficient oxygenation as anemia progresses&quot; (R.B.
      Weiskopf). The current proposal is based on experimental and clinical data which suggest
      that plasma methemoglobin (MetHb) may be a sensitive biomarker of tissue hypoxia and &quot;anemic
      stress&quot; in surgical patients.

      Hypothesis: Increased methemoglobin is a biomarker of tissue hypoxia during acute anemia.

      Primary Objective: To demonstrate a direct relationship between decreased Hb and increased
      MetHb in patients undergoing acute hemodilution on cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB).

      Acute and chronic anemia continue to be associated with increased mortality in a number of
      clinical settings, including cardiac and non-cardiac surgery. 1-6 However, as recently
      stated by one of the pioneers of anemia research; Dr. R.B. Weiskopf: &quot;We have no clinical
      measures that let us know of impending insufficient oxygenation as anemia progresses&quot;.7
      Toward achieving this goal, we have developed experimental models to define the adaptive
      mechanisms which maintain oxygen homeostasis during acute anemia. Our research has
      identified that increased nitric oxide (NO) production by nitric oxide syntheses (NOSs) may
      be an important survival mechanism in acute anemia.3;8;9 Experimental data suggests that
      nNOS may promote survival by maintaining oxygen (O2) homeostasis during acute anemia.10
      Resultant increases in nitric oxide (NO) contributes to adaptive cell signaling mechanisms
      and also increase oxidation of hemoglobin (Hb) to methemoglobin (MetHb).3 In addition,
      oxygen extraction results in increased levels of deoxyhemoglobin which has been proposed to
      act as a nitrite (NO2-) reductase to generate additional bioactive NO, thereby promoting
      vasodilation in hypoxic vascular beds.11-15 Thus, by more than one mechanism, increased
      MetHb may be indicative of hemoglobin desaturation, tissue hypoxia and activation of
      adaptive tissue responses to anemia. These responses may identify the threshold for local
      tissue hypoxia or &quot;anemic stress&quot;. In attempt to determine if such mechanisms are active in
      humans we performed a retrospective study in patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass
      (CPB) during heart surgery to determine if plasma MetHb increased as Hb decreased during
      CPB. We observed an inverse relationship between Hb and MetHb that was independent of red
      blood cell transfusion and exogenous nitrate use
