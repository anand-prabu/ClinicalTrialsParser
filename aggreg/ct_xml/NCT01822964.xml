    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess the possible neuroprotective effects of cooling (targeted
      cooling of the brain to 33°C) during Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI)
      procedures. From start of anesthesia, until final valve implantation, local cooling (by the
      RhinoChill device) will be applied to the brain. Effect of cooling on cerebral oxygenation,
      by cerebral oxygen saturation monitoring (NIRS ForeSight technology) during the TAVI
      procedure will be continuously assessed during native valve manipulation and during final
      valve deployment (=primary endpoint of he study). As secondary endpoints, neuropsychological
      testing performed before and after TAVI procedure will assess the effects of the use of
      cooling during the TAVI procedure. Neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and S100-beta will be
      analyzed during and up to 72hrs after TAVI to compare the cerebral ischemic damage between
      cooled and non-cooled patients. And finally, diffusion-weighted MRI of the brain will be
      performed  5 days before and 5-7 days after TAVI to compare the number and total amount of
      cerebral ischemic insults between cooled and non-cooled patients. The hypothesis behind this
      study is that by local cooling of the brain during manipulation of the calcified aorta and
      aortic valve, the brain might be protected from cerebral ischemic insults.
