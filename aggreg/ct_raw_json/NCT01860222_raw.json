It is the fifth most common cancer in the world and the\n      third most common cause of cancer-related death,especially in East-Asia countries.SR remains\n      the first therapeutic option for a cure but is suitable only for 9%\u201427% of patients.The\n      presence of significant background cirrhosis often precludes liver resection for HCC.Even\n      though these HCC patients undergo SR\uff0cthe incidence of posthepatectomy liver failure(PHLF)\n      and death would be high\uff0cespecially to HCC patients complicating CSPH\uff0cwhose corresponding\n      risk of PHLF and persistent PHLF were 59.02%and 14.75%respectively in our past study. It is\n      extremely urgent to search a safe and effective means in this subgroup of  HCC\n      patients.PLAT, a recently developed local ablative technique, has attracted the greatest\n      interest and popularity because of its effectiveness and safety,with a 3-year survival rate\n      of 62-77%,a low treatment complication rate of 8-9% and a low treatment mortality rate of\n      0-0.5%.However, there is still debate on whether PLAT or SR is the most suitable therapy for\n      HCC.To our knowledge,there have been no study on the therapy of HCC complicating CSPH."
