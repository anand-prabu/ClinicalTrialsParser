You will no longer be able to take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if\n      intolerable side effects occur, if you are able to have an allogeneic stem cell transplant\n      (a stem cell transplant from a donor), or if you are unable to follow study directions.\n\n      Your participation on the study will be over once you have completed the end-of- treatment\n      visit.\n\n      End-of-Treatment Visit:\n\n      At 30 days after your last dose of study drug:\n\n        -  You will be asked about any drugs you may be taking and any side effects you may have\n           had.\n\n        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.\n\n        -  If your doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a bone marrow aspirate and/or biopsy\n           to check the status of the disease and for cytogenetic testing.\n\n      This is an investigational study.  Bortezomib is FDA approved and commercially available to\n      treat multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma.  Giving it to patients with MDS is\n      investigational.\n\n      Up to 40 participants will be enrolled in this study.  All will take part at MD Anderson."

Radiation therapy within 3 weeks before randomization. Enrollment of subjects who\n             require concurrent radiotherapy (which must be localized in its field size) should be\n             deferred until the radiotherapy is completed and 3 weeks have elapsed since the last\n             date of therapy."
