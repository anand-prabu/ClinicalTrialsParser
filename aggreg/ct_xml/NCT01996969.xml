  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Regorafenib is a valuable treatment option for metastatic colorectal cancer patients who
      have progressed after prior standard treatments. Prior progression-free survival data
      suggest that there could be a distinct subgroup of patients that may benefit from
      regorafenib. The aim of this study is to identify predictive biomarker of regorafenib in
      terms of its efficacy.

    <textblock>
      Regorafenib is a multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor which has been shown to increase survival
      in metastatic colorectal cancer patients who have progressed after prior standard
      treatments.  Progression-free survival data suggest that there could be a distinct subgroup
      of patients that may benefit from regorafenib. Therefore, it would be important to identify
      predictive biomarker of efficacy of regorafenib. Considering that regorafenib is a
      multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor, comprehensive approach is required to discover predictive
      biomarker.

      NGS-based sequencing allows generating large amount of data regarding multiple genes and
      multiple genetic alterations within a single experiment. Also, it requires less amount of
      DNA or tissue and cost compared to currently used individual gene testing techniques such as
      direct sequencing or FISH. Moreover, superior sensitivity over Sanger sequencing can be
      obtained by increasing coverage depth, especially in cases with low tumor purity. Wide range
      of genes targeted by regorafenib and genes in the major oncogenic pathway of colorectal
      cancer influenced by regorafenib can be efficiently assessed using NGS-based sequencing.

      The aim of this study is to identify predictive biomarker of efficacy of regorafeinib in
      metastatic, refractory colorectal cancer patients using NGS technology.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Signed informed consent obtained before any study-specific procedures.

          2. Age ≥ 20

          3. Pathologically confirmed metastatic adenocarcinoma of colon or rectum

          4. Failure of standard therapies, which must include fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, and
             irinotecan. Failure is defined as progression during or within 3 months following the
             last administration of therapy. Patients who have withdrawn from standard treatment
             due to unacceptable toxicity warranting discontinuation of treatment and precluding
             retreatment with the same agent before progression of disease will also be allowed
             into the study. Patients treated with oxaliplatin in an adjuvant setting who have
             progressed during or within 6 months of completion of adjuvant therapy are regarded
             as failure of oxaliplatin. Patients may or may not have received bevacizumab or
             cetuximab.
