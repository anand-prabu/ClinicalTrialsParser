Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.\n      Biological therapies use different ways to stimulate the immune system and stop cancer cells\n      from growing. It is not yet known which treatment regimen is more effective in treating\n      metastatic prostate cancer.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to compare the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy\n      with that of chemotherapy plus biological therapy in treating patients who have progressive\n      or metastatic prostate cancer that has not responded to hormone therapy."

Patients are stratified according to\n      disease (measurable vs nonmeasurable and elevated PSA). Patients are randomized to one of\n      two treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive vinorelbine IV over 10 minutes on days 2 and 9 followed by\n           mitoxantrone IV over 10 minutes on day 2 only. Oral estramustine is administered every\n           12 hours on days 1-5. Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of unacceptable\n           toxicity, disease progression, or administration of the maximum cumulative dose of\n           mitoxantrone.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral isotretinoin and interferon alfa subcutaneously on days 1\n           and 2 and paclitaxel IV over 1 hour on day 2 weekly for 6 weeks. Courses repeat every 8\n           weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.\n\n      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, on day 2 of courses 2, 4, and 6 (arm I), on day 22\n      of course 1 and day 1 of courses 2 and 3 (arm II), and then at completion of treatment.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then\n      annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 70-114 patients (35-57 per arm) will be accrued for this study\n      within 14-23 months."
