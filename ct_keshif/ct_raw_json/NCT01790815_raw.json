A simple, reproducible, scalable way to recognise acute\n      malnutrition and target early intervention would be a huge advance.  Can mothers with\n      limited training reliably measure and interpret the results of Mid Upper Arm Circumference\n      (MUAC), a measurement performed with a MUAC measuring tape costing $0.06?  MUAC contrasts\n      with Z-score (WHZ), which requires both scales and a height gauge, both health worker\n      interventions susceptible to considerable error, sensitive to non-nutritional factors,\n      requiring calculations and growth curves, yet much less accurate in predicting risk of death\n      compared with MUAC."
