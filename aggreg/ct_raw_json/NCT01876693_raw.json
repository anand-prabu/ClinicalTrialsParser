Prophylactic gastrostomy has been accepted for these patients with improvement of\n      quality of life. However, there is no prospective study confirming superiority of such\n      treatment.\n\n      The investigators enrolled head and neck cancer patients who had the plan of\n      chemoradiotherapy. The patients will be informed about both treatment arms and will decide\n      the arm that they preferred. The treatment interruptions, body weight and nutritional status\n      will be assessed every 2 weeks during treatment period."
