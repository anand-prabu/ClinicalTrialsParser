For example, rather\n      than trying to keep serum phosphorus below 5.5, patients enrolled in this study may have\n      treatment goals of less than 6.5, in order to reduce the number of pills they need to take\n      and potentially reduce harmful side effects.  Blood pressure and serum parathyroid hormone\n      goals will also be modified, to see if these modifications help hemodialysis patients feel\n      better."
