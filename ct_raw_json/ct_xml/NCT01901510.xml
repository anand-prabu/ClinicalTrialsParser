    <textblock>
      This study first is designed to see what dose of indigo carmine ingested orally mixed with
      the standard colonoscopy prep is needed to provide adequate staining of the right colon. It
      then will use this adequate staining concentration of Indigo Carmine to study whether this
      dye will increase the detection of polyps during colonoscopy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Colon cancer occurs in 5% of the US population. Currently colon cancer screening is
      recommended at the age of 50 years old for all patients who are at average risk. Colonoscopy
      is considered the gold standard test for colon cancer screening. This is partly because
      colonoscopy not only can detect polyps which are cancer precursors but also can remove them,
      and thereby detecting cancer and its precursors and preventing cancer. Unfortunately recent
      data suggest that colonoscopy can miss a significant percentage of polyps, especially on the
      right side of the colon. It is thought that one of the major reasons for missing polyps in
      the right side of the colon is the fact that they are flat or sessile serrated adenoma, both
      of which are more difficult than protruding polyps to identify with ordinary colon
      preparation and colonoscopes. Chromoendoscopy is the application of dye during colonoscopy
      to enhance detection of polyps. It has been shown that it improves the detection of polyps
      and thus has the potential of improving the performance of colonoscopy and increasing the
      detection of these difficult to detect polyps. It is however cumbersome and time consuming,
      which has discouraged its use. Indigo carmine, one commonly used dye, is actually FDA
      approved as a food colorant and can be consumed orally. It is minimally absorbed. In
      addition it is used intravenously for diagnosis of injuries of the urinary system because it
      is very rapidly excreted by the kidneys. The investigators believe that taking it orally
      will be well tolerated, and that any of the dye that is absorbed will be rapidly excreted by
      the kidneys and thus quickly eliminated without any side effects.  Effective staining of the
      colon with indigo carmine and increased detection of polyps could change the current
      standard of care for screening for colon cancer.

    <description>The Boston Bowel Preparation Scale will be used to grade the quality of the colonic prep:
0 = Unprepared colon segment with mucosa not seen due to solid stool that cannot be cleared.
= Portion of mucosa of the colon segment seen, but other areas of the colon segment not well seen due to staining, residual stool and/or opaque liquid.
= Minor amount of residual staining, small fragments of stool and/or opaque liquid, but mucosa of colon segment seen well.
= Entire mucosa of colon segment seen well with no residual staining, small fragments of stool or opaque liquid.</description>
