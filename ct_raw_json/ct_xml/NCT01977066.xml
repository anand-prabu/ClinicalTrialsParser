      The purpose of this study is to compare the effects two specific exercise interventions and
      one standard care control arm on physical functioning.The investigators expect that
      supervised training is most beneficial to the patients. However, they also expect some
      benefit for patients in the home-based training.

      The randomized-controlled balanced-parallel-group trial in 201 adult pancreatic cancer
      patients (stage I-II) from the University Surgery Clinic in Heidelberg shortly after
      resection will compare two specific exercise interventions and one standard care control
      arm. The intervention programs will be (1) a 6-month supervised moderate-to-high-intensity,
      progressive resistance training, and (2) a 6-month home-based exercise training. Thus, the
      two interventions differ primarily by the intensity and mode-of-administration of the
      intervention. Both interventions will start 8 weeks after surgery to allow for wound
      healing. The supervised progressive training will start with only moderate-intensity
      training during the first 4 weeks. Only patients without comorbidities that preclude
      participation in the intervention arms (e.g. severe pain, heart insufficiency, reduced
      standing or walking ability) are eligible. Patients who exercise more than 150 minutes per
      week will be excluded.

      The primary objective is to compare the effects of the different interventions on physical
      functioning, measured as change from baseline to 6 months. Additional endpoints are overall
      quality of life, fatigue, endurance, and strength performance, adherence to the
      interventions, discontinuation of adjuvant therapy, body weight and composition, disease
      progression, overall and progression-free survival. All outcomes will be assessed every 3
      months for a minimum follow-up period of 12 months.

      The investigators expect that supervised training is most beneficial to the patients.
      However, they also expect some benefit for patients in the home-based training.
