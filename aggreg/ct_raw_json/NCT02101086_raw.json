Infants requiring blood\n      transfusion were randomly assigned to an autologous or allogeneic product. Two randomized\n      groups were compared on the 14th, 28th, 35th days and >35th days with respect to hemoglobin\n      levels, transfusion numbers, transfusion and phlebotomy volumes, and hemoglobin,\n      reticulocyte counts and erythropoietin levels in the postconceptional 36th and 40th weeks'\n      gestation, and hemoglobin levels at postnatal 6-months age.
