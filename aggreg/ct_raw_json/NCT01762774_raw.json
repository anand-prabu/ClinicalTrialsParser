Cohorts 1 and 2 will enrol 12 subjects\n      each and each subject will take part in four study periods. All subjects will receive\n      placebo regimen and three dosing regimens of GSK2256294 in a specified sequence (planned\n      doses 2 mg, 6 mg and 18 mg in Cohort 1 and 15 mg, 40 mg and 100 mg in Cohort 2). Each study\n      period will be followed by a Wash-out period of 7 to 14 days in Cohort 1 and up to 4 weeks\n      in Cohort 2. During each study period subjects will be in-house from Day -1 until the 48\n      hours post dose assessments have been completed. Subjects will return to the unit as\n      out-patients for remaining post-dose assessments. Subjects will then be followed for 7 to 14\n      days in Cohort 1 and up to 3 to 4 weeks in Cohort 2. Total duration of the study for Cohort\n      1 will be 98 days and for Cohort 2 it will be up to 144 days. Cohort 3 and 4 will each\n      recruit 15 subjects. For Cohorts 3 and 4, each subject will take part in one treatment\n      period of 18 days (Day-1 to Day 17) with dosing from Day 1 to Day 14. Subjects will then be\n      followed for 7 to 14 days. Total duration of the study for Cohort 3 and Cohort 4 will be 67\n      days. Dose selection for Cohorts 3 and 4 will be based on the safety, PK profile and enzyme\n      inhibition obtained in Cohorts 1 and 2. This study will also evaluate the evidence for a\n      functional effect of soluble Epoxide Hydrolase (sEH) in a forearm blood flow (FBF) model."
