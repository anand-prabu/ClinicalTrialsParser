        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologically proven squamous cell carcinoma of the intrathoracic esophagus

          2. Surgically resectable (cT3, cT4a and/or disease with lymph node metastasis by AJCC
             7th ed) esophageal cancer, as determined by Endoscopic Ultra Sound (EUS), chest CT
             and PET-CT

          3. No prior treatment for the esophageal cancer

          4. Age: 20-70 years

          5. ECOG performance status 0, 1 or 2

          6. Adequate hematological, renal, hepatic, pulmonary and cardiac functions defined as
             6.1 Granulocytes &gt; 1,500/microliter, Platelets &gt; 75,000/microliter 6.2 Creatinine &lt;
             1.5 mg/dL (or CCr&gt; 50 mg/mL), 6.3 Total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 mg/dL 6.4 ALT and AST &lt; 2.5 Ã—
             upper normal limit 6.5 FEV1 &gt;=1.5 L/min 6.6 Ejection fraction &gt;= 45%

          7. Non-pregnant, non-lactating female patients. Sexually active patients of childbearing
             potential must implement effective contraceptive practices during the study when
             treated with chemotherapy

          8. Written, voluntary informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subtypes other than squamous cell carcinoma

          2. cT1N0M0, cT2N0M0 esophageal cancer or in situ carcinoma

          3. Invasion of recurrent laryngeal, phrenic or sympathetic nerve

          4. Invasion of the tracheobronchial tree or presence of tracheoesophageal fistula

          5. Invasion of major vessels (vena cava, azygos vein and aorta) by the tumor

          6. Malignant pleural effusion (documented by cytospin or cytology)

          7. Cervical esophageal cancer

          8. Para-aortic lymph node metastasis

             curatively treated early gastric cancer with endoscopic mucosal resection or a cured
             malignancy more than 5 years prior to enrollment

         10. Previous chemotherapy or prior history of radiotherapy interfering with the planned
             radiotherapy as per protocol

         11. Patients with a known history of HIV seropositivity or HCV (+). Patients with HBV (+)
             are eligible. However, primary prophylaxis using antiviral agents (i.e. lamivudine,
             etc) is recommended for HBV carrier to prevent HBV reactivation during whole
             treatment period.

         12. Other serious illness or medical conditions A. Unstable cardiac disease (i.e.
             congestive heart failure, arrhythmia, symptomatic coronary artery disease) despite
             treatment, myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to study entry B. History of
             significant neurologic or psychiatric disorders including dementia or seizures C.
             Active uncontrolled infection (viral, bacterial or fungal infection) D. Other serious
             medical illnesses

         13. New York heart Association Class III/IV and history of active angina. Documented
             myocardial infarction within the 6 months preceding registration. Patients with a
             history of significant ventricular arrhythmia requiring medication or congestive
             heart failure. History of 2nd or 3rd degree heart blocks.

         14. Active infection or other serious underlying medical condition which would impair the
             ability of the patient to receive the planned treatment

         15. Dementia or altered mental status that would prohibit the understanding and giving of
             informed consent

         16. Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus: fasting glucose &gt;150 mg/dL or patients requiring
             insulin therapy for glycemic control; fasting glucose &gt;150 mg/dL or patients
             requiring insulin therapy for glycemic control;
