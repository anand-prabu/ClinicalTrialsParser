It is not yet known whether ifosfamide alone is more effective\n      than ifosfamide plus paclitaxel in treating patients with cancer of the uterus.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of ifosfamide with or\n      without paclitaxel in treating patients with advanced, refractory, or recurrent cancer of\n      the uterus."

Patients are stratified according to GOG performance\n      status (GOG 0-1 vs GOG 2-3) and randomized to one of two treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive ifosfamide IV daily for 3 days every 21 days.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive paclitaxel IV on day 1 and ifosfamide IV on days 1-3 every 21\n           days. Filgrastim (G-CSF) is given subcutaneously beginning on day 4 until granulocyte\n           count is greater than 2,000/mm3. Paclitaxel therapy may precede or be given\n           concurrently with ifosfamide.\n\n      Treatment for both arms continues for a maximum of 8 courses in the absence of disease\n      progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, then every 6 months for an additional 3\n      years, and then annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 166 patients (83 per arm) will be accrued for this study\n      within approximately 5.5 years."
