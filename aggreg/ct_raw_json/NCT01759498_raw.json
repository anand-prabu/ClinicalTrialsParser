            "textblock": "Since hydrogen therapy in humans seems to be beneficial for treating inflammation,\n      ischemia-reperfusion injury and oxidative stress, it seems plausible to evaluate the effects\n      of exogenously administered hydrogen as an element of instant management of sport-related\n      soft tissue injuries (e.g. muscle sprain, ligament strain, tendonitis, contusion). The main\n      aim of the present study will be to examine the effects of two-week hydrogen-rich oral and\n      topical administration on the inflammation, recovery and functional abilities in competitive\n      male and female athletes after acute soft-tissue injury. During the season 2012/2013 (from\n      February to June) subjects (36 professional athletes) will be recruited and examined by\n      certified sports medicine specialist in the out-patient clinics of the Center for Health,\n      Exercise and Sport Sciences in the first 24 hours after the sport-related soft tissue injury\n      was sustained. The subjects will be allocated to a double-blind design to three randomly\n      assigned trials. During the period of 2 weeks subjects in the placebo group (PLA) will\n      receive traditional treatment protocol after the soft-tissue injury, consisting of RICE\n      protocol during the first 48 h and sub-acute protocol thereafter. Subjects in the first\n      experimental group will follow the above procedures with additional administration of oral\n      hydrogen-rich capsules (4 capsules three times per day) throughout the study. Subjects in\n      the second experimental group will follow the procedures of first experimental group with\n      additional administration of hydrogen-rick packs 6 times per day for 20 minutes throughout\n      the study. Participants will be evaluated at the beginning of the study (e.g. at the time of\n      the injury report), after 7 and 14 days after baseline testing for: a) serum C-reactive\n      protein, plasma viscosity and interleukin 6 level, b) pain intensity during rest and\n      walking, c) degree of joint swelling, d) passive joint flexibility, and, e) subjective\n      side-effects. The investigators expect that the administration of hydrogen will\n      significantly improve inflammation outcomes (e.g. decrease in serum C-reactive protein) as\n      compared to the placebo, with topical hydrogen administration will additionally improve\n      post-injury recovery outcomes (e.g. pain intensity, degree of swelling). These results could\n      support the hypothesis that hydrogen-rich intervention may be included as an element of\n      immediate treatment for sport-related soft tissue injuries."
