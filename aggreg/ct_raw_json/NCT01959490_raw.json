Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as\n      docetaxel, carboplatin, doxorubicin hydrochloride, cyclophosphamide, and paclitaxel, work in\n      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping\n      them from dividing.

To determine if genomically derived 'molecular subtypes' predict pathological complete\n      response to combination chemotherapy and targeted therapy for early stage breast cancer.\n\n      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. To assess the ability of trastuzumab response signatures to predict pathological complete\n      response (pCR) in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) positive tumors treated\n      with brief exposure to trastuzumab followed by combination chemotherapy.\n\n      II. To assess the value of the transforming growth factor, beta (TGF-B) response signature\n      to predict pCR in HER2 negative tumors treated with brief exposure to bevacizumab followed\n      by combination chemotherapy.\n\n      III. To determine if comprehensive annotation of genomic alterations (mutations, copy number\n      alternations, gene fusions, non-coding ribonucleic acid [RNA] and splice variants) can\n      further sub-stratify subtype-based classifiers for prediction of response to targeted\n      therapy in early stage breast cancer IV. To assess whether the findings on breast dynamic\n      contrast enhanced-magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) performed after the two-week 'run-in'\n      treatment with either single agent trastuzumab or single agent bevacizumab predict\n      pathologic response to the treatment regimen.\n\n      V. To determine if circulating RNA expression levels are associated with treatment response.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment cohorts based on HER2 status.\n\n      COHORT I (HER2 positive): Patients receive trastuzumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes,\n      docetaxel IV, and carboplatin IV on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 6 courses in\n      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      COHORT II (HER2 negative): Patients receive bevacizumab IV over 30-60 minutes on day 1 of\n      weeks 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11; doxorubicin hydrochloride IV and cyclophosphamide IV over 30-60\n      minutes on day 1 of weeks 1, 3, 5, and 7; and paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 1 of weeks\n      9, 11, 13, and 15. Prior to receiving paclitaxel patients will receive the anti-nausea\n      medication\n\n      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days."
