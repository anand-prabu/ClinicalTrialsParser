Bone marrow transplantation may be able to replace cells that\n      were destroyed by chemotherapy. Colony-stimulating factors such as filgrastim may increase\n      the number of immune cells found in bone marrow or peripheral blood and may help a person's\n      immune system recover from the side effects of chemotherapy.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of chemotherapy plus bone marrow\n      transplantation and filgrastim in treating patients who have acute myelogenous leukemia or\n      myelodysplastic syndrome."

Patients\n      undergo bone marrow collection.\n\n      Patients receive oral busulfan every 6 hours for 16 doses on days -5, -4, -3, and -2.\n      Patients receive etoposide IV over 4 hours on days -4, -3, and -2. Bone marrow is reinfused\n      36-48 hours after the last dose of etoposide. Patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) IV daily\n      beginning 2-4 hours after bone marrow reinfusion until hematopoietic recovery.\n\n      Patients are followed monthly for 1 year, every 3 months for 1 year, and then every 6 months\n      thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years."
