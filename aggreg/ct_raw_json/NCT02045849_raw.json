A decision will be made whether to\n      use the current capsule formulation or the new tablet formulation in Part 2 based upon the\n      safety and PK data obtained from Part 1. Part 3 is conditionally based upon progression of\n      the tablet formulation from Part 1 and will evaluate the effect of food on the safety,\n      tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of the tablet formulation following multiple doses in\n      elderly healthy subjects."
