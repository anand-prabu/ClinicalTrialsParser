  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this project is to conduct a pilot study evaluating feasibility, acceptability,
      and estimating the effect size of a new computerized Motivational Enhancement Therapy (cMET)
      intervention for alcohol-involved adolescent primary care patients. The investigators
      hypothesize that 1) cMET, when added to Computerized Alcohol Screening and Brief
      Intervention (cASBI), (cASBI+cMET) will be feasible and acceptable when used in primary
      care; and 2) 12- to 18-yr old patients receiving cASBI+cMET will have lower rates of any
      alcohol use, days of alcohol use, drinks per drinking day, and days of heavy episodic
      drinking, than cASBI alone.

    <description>In the cASBI protocol participants complete a computerized screen for alcohol and drug use, view their screen results on the computer, then see 10 pages of science and true life stories describing the health effects of alcohol and other substance use. The provider receives a report of the screen results and gives brief advice regarding alcohol and drug use during the office visit. The cMET protocol is a 2 session intervention composed of 8 exercises designed to encourage adolescents their alcohol and other substance use and develop a plan to stop or reduce their use.</description>
