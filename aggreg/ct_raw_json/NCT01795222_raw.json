Although the grant was approved in the beginning of 2013,\n      resources were released in November 2013.\n\n      We could not wait for funding release because this study was part of the MS dissertation of\n      the principal investigator that was supposed to be concluded in the first semester of 2013.\n      Then we decided to develop a less robust study, including only two arms: oral midazolam\n      versus oral placebo. The other variables of the study did not change. We finished this\n      two-arms study and have the final results for that comparison."
