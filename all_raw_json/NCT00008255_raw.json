Breathing in INS316 may make\n      it easier for patients to cough up mucus.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to study the effectiveness of INS316 in helping to\n      diagnose lung cancer."

            "textblock": "OBJECTIVES: I. Determine whether a cytological diagnosis of lung cancer can be obtained more\n      frequently from sputum specimens following inhalation of INS316 compared to specimens\n      obtained following placebo or compared to specimens spontaneously expectorated in patients\n      with untreated lung cancer. II. Assess the relative sensitivity of sputum cytology in the\n      diagnosis of lung malignancies in this patient population using these sputum collection\n      regimens. III. Determine the quantity of macrophages in sputum of these patients using these\n      techniques. IV. Determine if the number of macrophages in sputum obtained by these methods\n      is predictive of the likelihood of obtaining a positive diagnosis of lung cancer in these\n      patients. V. Determine the total amount of sputum expectorated from these patients using\n      these techniques.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over, multicenter\n      study. Patients are randomized to one of two arms, then cross-over to the other arm. Arm I:\n      Patients receive INS316 by inhalation via a nebulizer. Sputum is collected throughout the\n      dosing and for 1 hour post dosing. Arm II: Patients receive placebo in the same manner as\n      INS136 in arm I. All patients receive both treatments. Patients receive the first dose no\n      more than 7 days after screening, and the second dose 3 to 10 days after the first dose.\n      Patients are followed 1 day after completion of the second treatment. The sputum samples are\n      fixed and examined cytologically.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 100-130 patients will be accrued for this study."
