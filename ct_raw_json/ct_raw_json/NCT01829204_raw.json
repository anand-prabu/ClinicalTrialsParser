            "textblock": "Our approach specifically targets the evaluation of the proteins and cytokines present and\n      the bacteriological analysis of the microflora in the vaginal milieu.\n\n      Conjectures:\n\n        -  An initial insult in the vagina (possibly involving a bacterial, viral or fungal\n           organism or their products) causes modifications in the vaginal milieu\n\n        -  The vaginal milieu responds to the insult by developing an inflammatory reaction\n           characterized by cytokine and protein production\n\n        -  Long lasting or repetitive insults maintain biochemical changes in the vaginal milieu\n           producing a reaction, chemical irritation or micro flora alteration by changes in\n           proteins and/or abnormal protein production\n\n        -  Those changes eventually result in hypersensitivity, irritation, burning, and pain\n           manifested in patients with vulvodynia. And those changes may also result in the\n           recurrence of fungal or bacterial infections\n\n        -  Those changes may also contribute to initiate the cascade of premature events\n           conducting to cervical effacement and dilation observed in preterm labor\n\n      The conjectures will be investigated by using a multidisciplinary approach including:\n      microbiology, proteomics and cytokines evaluation of the vaginal milieu. Specifically we\n      will be comparing an asymptomatic female population to serve as a baseline to patients\n      affected by vulvodynia, recurrent fungal or bacterial vaginosis and/or pregnancy.\n\n      This is a prospective, descriptive study of about 550 women age 12 to 75 years.  There will\n      be four groups: 1) Asymptomatic healthy women, 2) Women being seen for any gynecological\n      vulvovaginal condition, and 3) Pregnant women who are asymptomatic and healthy, and 4)\n      Pregnant women have any gynecological vulvovaginal condition.\n\n      We will evaluate the following:\n\n        -  Types of cytokines normally present in women and in patients with vulvodynia, recurrent\n           fungal and bacterial vaginosis and preterm labor\n\n        -  Normal microbiology flora in women and variations present in the vaginal milieu in\n           these patients\n\n        -  The presence of normal and atypical proteins in the vaginal milieu of healthy women and\n           patients with vulvodynia, recurrent fungal and bacterial vaginosis and preterm labor\n\n        -  Informed consent will be obtained and documented for participation in the study\n\n        -  Comprehensive history assessment of environmental factors, topical vulvovaginal issues\n           and co morbid conditions as defined in the exclusion criteria.\n\n        -  Pelvic examination to obtain two samples via cotton swabs for proteomics, cytokines,\n           vaginal lactobacillus from vaginal secretions.\n\n      A. Swab procedure:\n\n      The cotton swabs (2) will be introduced only in the middle vagina, one at the time, no other\n      areas will be sampled.\n\n      B. Swab processing One swab will be placed in a special room temperature solution. This\n      de-identified swab will be mailed for Lactobacillus.\n\n      The second de-identified swab is to be place in 2 separated micro-containers in Liquid\n      Nitrogen Containers (one for cytokines and one for Proteomics). When 50 samples are\n      completed they will be processed at TTUHSC Permian Basin campus, with the Proteomics testing\n      being done in Lubbock.\n\n      Therefore, there are 3 samples, each processed differently. Data will be recorded in a\n      confidential manner with no personal identifiers, only an assigned study subject number.  As\n      such, the de-identified data may serve as a database for additional studies.  The computer\n      used will belong to TTUHSC and be password protected, access limited to only authorized\n      personnel.  Consent forms will be stored separately from the study data in the research\n      office."
