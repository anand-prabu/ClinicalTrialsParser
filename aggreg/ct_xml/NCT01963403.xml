  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized trial will compare the effects of the
      use of a combined oral contraceptive pill to a placebo pill for women who are experiencing
      irregular and/or heavy bleeding associated with the use of an etonogestrel (ETG) implant.

      The hypothesis of the study is:

        -  Use of combined oral contraceptive will significantly improve bleeding patterns for
           users of ETG implant

        -  Continuation rate of ETG implant users will be increased by use of combined oral
           contraceptive in women desiring ETG implant removal because of the undesirable bleeding

        -  Adverse events will be uncommon and acceptable to women who use a combined oral
           contraceptive with the ETG implant

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Women who are experiencing irregular and/or heavy bleeding associated with the use of an
      etonogestrel (ETG) implant will be recruited for this study.  Women who have bothersome
      bleeding will be randomized to use either a combined oral contraceptive pill or a placebo
      pill.

      Participants will take one pill every day and record their bleeding patterns on a daily
      diary.

      Participants will have one screening/enrollment visit, two in-person follow up visits, and
      one telephone follow up contact.  Subjects will be enrolled for a total of 84 days (three
      months).

      Participants will be assigned to a treatment group at her screening/enrollment visit.  Her
      first follow up visit will occur 22-28 days after her enrollment.  Participants can choose
      to:

        -  Continue use of assigned treatment medication

        -  Discontinue use of assigned treatment medication, but use an open-label combined oral
           contraceptive pill

        -  Discontinue the use of assigned treatment medication, decline use of an open-label
           combined oral contraceptive pill

        -  Discontinue use of ETG implant.

      Participants who choose to continue use of ETG implant will have a follow up telephone
      contact 50-56 days after her enrollment visit.  A final in-person visit will occur 78-84
      days after enrollment.  Bleeding patterns will be assessed by daily bleeding diaries
      completed by the participant.
