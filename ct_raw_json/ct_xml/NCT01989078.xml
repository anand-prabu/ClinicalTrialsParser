  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sickle cell nephropathy (SCN) is a progressive complication of sickle cell disease (SCD)
      that begins in childhood and results in renal (kidney) failure and early mortality in nearly
      12% of adults with hemoglobin SS (HbSS). The potential for prevention and reversal of kidney
      damage in SCD is not known.  Albuminuria is a commonly used biomarker of glomerular damage;
      however the correlations of albuminuria with specific measurements of glomerular function
      and pathophysiology have not been determined.  The investigators hypothesize that in
      patients with persistent albuminuria despite treatment of SCD with hydroxyurea, losartan
      will reverse kidney dysfunction in early stage nephropathy and ameliorate progressive kidney
      dysfunction in more advanced nephropathy.  The primary aim is to study the acute and
      longer-term effects of losartan (study drug) on specific glomerular functions in children
      and adults with SCD who have persistent albuminuria. Research glomerular function tests will
      be done at study entry (prior to losartan), 1 month, and 1 year after starting losartan
      therapy. In addition, subjects are seen each month in clinic and assessed by their regular
      clinical team. The second aim is to assess the correlation of changes in albuminuria after 1
      month of losartan with changes in direct measurements of glomerular function at 12 months,
      thus determining if the magnitude of the initial decrease in albuminuria in response to
      losartan predicts sustained improvements in renal function.

      persistent albuminuria despite treatment of SCD with hydroxyurea, losartan will reverse
      kidney dysfunction in early stage nephropathy and ameliorate progressive kidney dysfunction
      in more advanced nephropathy.  The primary aim is to study the acute and longer-term effects

      magnitude of the initial decrease in albuminuria in response to losartan predicts sustained
      improvements in renal function.

      Losartan is an FDA-approved drug to treat blood pressure to protect the kidneys in people
      who have diseases like diabetes and blood pressure. It is not specifically labeled for use
      in sickle cell disease.

      Thirty subjects, at least 10 years old, will be enrolled from Children's Healthcare of
      Atlanta (pediatric subjects)  or Grady Memorial Hospital (adult subjects). Subjects are in
      the study about 1 year.

      Accrual is expected to take 2 years. Study is funded for 3 years.
