Histopathologic\n        diagnosis must be confirmed in the pathology department of the treating institution prior\n        to initiation of therapy.  Diagnosis will be confirmed in the Laboratory of Pathology,\n        National Cancer Institute.  This confirmation is not necessary prior to entering the\n        patient onto protocol.\n\n        Patients must have FIGO stage III or IV disease and will undergo attempted surgical\n        debulking prior to the initiation of chemotherapy.\n\n        Patients must be able to begin therapy within 6 weeks of staging laparotomy and should\n        have an indwelling venous access device placed.  A double lumen catheter is preferred.\n\n        Performance status of less than or equal to ECOG 2.\n\n        Patients must be able to give written informed consent and express a willingness to meet\n        all of the expected requirements of the protocol.\n\n        All patients must be registered by calling the Orkand Corporation at 301-402-1732 between\n        the hours of 8:30 AM and 5:00 PM EST; Eligibility criteria will be queried.\n\n        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:\n\n        Evidence CNS involvement (patients with normal clinical exam will not require a head CT\n        scan or MRI).\n\n        History of myocardial infarction or unstable dysrhythmia within 1 month of study entry.\n\n        Creatinine clearance of less than 60 cc/min, ANC less than 1000/cm3, platelet count less\n        than 1000,000/cm3.\n\n        History of active GI bleeding within the last 30 days.\n\n        Prior therapy other than surgery for this malignancy.\n\n        Abnormal PT, PTT, and bilirubin.  SGOT greater than or equal to 3 times the upper limit of\n        normal.\n\n        Previous history of invasive malignancy.\n\n        Patients with ureteral obstruction must have this corrected prior to starting therapy.\n\n        Patients with germ cell, mixed Muellerian and borderline histologies are specifically\n        excluded."
