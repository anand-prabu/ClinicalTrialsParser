      The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of a short yoga program practiced
      daily at home on blood pressure, quality of Life and stress. The subjects of the study are
      primary health care patients diagnosed with hypertension, with or without current
      medication.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypertension is one of the most common diseases in the world, affecting approximately 26% of
      the adult population. Persistent hypertension increases the risk of developing coronary
      heart disease, stroke and other cardiovascular diseases, such as heart failure. Hypertension
      is a common diagnosis in primary health care and the societal costs of examination and
      treatment of hypertension and its consequences are considerable.

      The YHIP-study (The Impact of Yoga on Blood Pressure and Quality of Life in Patients With
      Hypertension), that investigated yoga as additional treatment for hypertension on primary
      care patients, showed that a short yoga program practiced daily at home had a blood pressure
      lowering effect as well as a positive effect on self-rated quality of life compared to
      control.

      Other previous studies have demonstrated positive effects of yoga on blood pressure, quality
      of life, subjective well-being and stress. However, these studies are relatively few and we
      need to further investigate the possibility of using yoga as a treatment in primary health
      care.

      If the yoga intervention shows to be effective, yoga exercises may be useful as a
      supplementary BP therapy in addition to medical treatment when prescribed by primary care
      physicians. It is to be hoped that patients will also experience a higher quality of life
      and less stress if they perform yoga on a regular basis.
