  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain is the most common presenting symptom in medical outpatients, and depression and
      anxiety are the two most common mental disorders.  All three conditions are often
      inadequately treated and result in substantial disability, reduced health-related quality of
      life, and increased health care costs and utilization.  Additionally, pain, anxiety, and
      depression (PAD) are frequently comorbid with one another and have reciprocal negative
      effects on treatment response and additive effects on adverse health outcomes.  The PAD
      triad is especially burdensome in Veterans, with their high prevalence of chronic pain,
      depression, PTSD, and other anxiety disorders. The Comprehensive vs. Assisted Management of
      Mood and Physical Symptoms (CAMMPS) study is a randomized comparative effectiveness trial
      designed to test the relative effectiveness of a lower-resource vs. a higher-resource
      enhancement of usual primary care in the management of veterans suffering from with pain
      plus comorbid anxiety and/or depression.

      The Comprehensive vs. Assisted Management of Mood and Physical Symptoms (CAMMPS) study is a
      randomized comparative effectiveness trial designed to test the relative effectiveness of a
      lower-resource vs. a higher-resource enhancement of usual primary care in the management of
      veterans suffering from with pain plus comorbid anxiety and/or depression.

      This will be a single-site study enrolling Veterans. Patients followed in primary care
      clinics at the Roudebush VAMC will be eligible if they have clinically significant levels of
      pain plus comorbid anxiety and/or depression.  A total of 300 eligible patients who provide
      informed consent will be randomized to one of two treatment arms.  One group (n=150) will
      receive assisted symptom management (ASM) consisting of automated symptom monitoring by
      interactive voice recording or Internet and prompted pain self-management guided by symptom
      levels. The second group (n=150) will receive comprehensive symptom management (CSM) which
      combines ASM with optimized medication management delivered by a nurse-physician specialist
      team and facilitated mental health care. This team will partner with both VA primary care
      physicians and psychologists embedded in primary care to monitor and adjust treatments using
      evidence-based analgesic and antidepressant algorithms, reinforced self-management, and care
      coordination. We postulate that although both interventions are likely to be beneficial, CSM
      will be superior to ASM.

      In short, this trial compares: 1) usual care plus assisted symptom management (ASM) vs. 2)
      usual care plus ASM plus optimized medication and care management and facilitated mental
      health care (CSM).  Outcomes will be assessed at baseline, 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. The
      primary outcome is a composite pain-anxiety-depression severity score. Secondary outcomes
      include individual pain, anxiety, and depression scores; functional status and
      health-related quality of life; treatment satisfaction; and perceived barriers and
      facilitators of the CSM and ASM interventions.  The rationale for ASM is preliminary
      evidence of its effectiveness and its lower use of resources. The rationale for CSM is that
      the addition of optimized medication management, facilitated mental health care, and
      coordination with both primary care physicians/PACTs and psychologists for the PAD symptoms
      should substantially enhance the benefits of ASM.

    <description>The primary outcome measure will be the composite z-score of the main pain, anxiety, and depression measures in this trial: the Brief Pain Inventory, GAD-7, and PHQ-9, respectively. These 3 symptom scales total 27 items: 11 items for pain, 9 for depression, and 7 for anxiety. A standard z-score will be calculated for each scale as follows: subject's scale score minus the sample mean divided by the sample standard deviation.  A composite pain-anxiety-depression score will be the average of the standard z-scores for the 3 scales.</description>
