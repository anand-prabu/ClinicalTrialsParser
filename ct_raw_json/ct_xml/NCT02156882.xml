    <textblock>
      In this longitudinal study with a follow up time of at least 6 months, up to 300
      tuberculosis (TB) patients or TB suspects will be screened for TB using the Xpert MTB/RIF
      assay along with standard smear microscopy after Ziehl-Neelsen staining at the TB health
      clinic located at Mavalane health center. Confirmed TB cases will be followed up during TB
      therapy until month six after treatment initiation in order to obtain clinical and
      microbiological data on treatment including treatment response. Apart from relevant research
      questions in the field of TB diagnostics and treatment, the main objective of this study
      will be the development of a clinical TB research site, including capacity development in
      clinical and laboratory based TB research methods, in Mavalane, Maputo.

      Main study objective:

      To assess the feasibility to perform a TB clinical trial in Maputo, Mozambique, by
      screening, examining,enrollment, follow-up and data collection of TB patients sent for TB
      treatment as well as TB suspects who are sent for smear microscopy to the TB clinic at the
      Mavalane health center.

      Screening of study patients:

      After consenting, each study participant (with confirmed or suspected TB) will be screened
      for TB with smear microscopy after Ziehl-Neelsen staining and Xpert MTB/RIF assay. In
      patients with signs of extrapulmonary TB manifestation, specimen collection other than
      sputum are to be decided by the treating physician in the patient' s best interest, to
      establish TB diagnosis by using smear microscopy and/or Xpert MTB/RIF assay. Patients
      without a positive Xpert MTB/RIF-assay result will not continue in the study but will be
      referred to the National TB Program for further evaluation and treatment. In patients with a
      positive Xpert MTB/RIF result in any specimen anti TB treatment will be commenced according
      to the National Guidelines. All TB positive study participants will be followed up until 6
      months after TB treatment initiation.

      Study methods:

      Follow up visits will occur at week 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 17 and 26 after commencement of TB
      therapy. An optional visit will be performed in selected patients at week 52 in order to
      confirm cure of TB disease. At each study visit, a clinical investigation will be performed
      and a medical questionnaire will be completed for each participant. Further, sputum and
      urine samples will be collected for the evaluation of the new TB diagnostics. A chest x-ray
      will be performed and blood for HIV testing, CD4 count, biochemistry and full blood picture
      will be collected at baseline only or when medically indicated during the course of the
      study.

      Data recording and analysis:

      The study will follow ethical principles as outlined in the declaration of Helsinki and its
      revisions (last in 2008) and will be performed in compliance with the guidelines of Good
      Clinical, Laboratory (GCLP) and Clinical Data Management Practice (GCDMP). All essential
      documents will be archived for 3 years. All patient information will be treated in a
      strictly confidential manner and will be linked to a unique ID number and not to personal
      identifiers. Data will be collected on paper CRFs, which will be entered into a secured
      clinical data management system, for which daily backups will be done. Double data entry
      will minimize data entry errors, and full data validation and cleaning process will be
      employed.
