The product is used for two following indications:\n\n        -  Intend of Use #1: OctavaPink is indicated for women above 18 years old, who performed\n           mammography and were determined negative for breast cancer. Being moderately sensitive\n           (>55% sensitivity) the test is able to detect 55% of mammography false negatives. In\n           addition, being highly specific (>95% specificity) it supplies additional evidence for\n           true mammography negative result which will reduce examinees anxiety of being\n           misdiagnosed as a result of high false negative mammography rate (10-30%)\n\n        -  Intend of Use #2: OctavaPink is indicated for women above 18 years old, who performed\n           biopsy after positive mammography and the biopsy result was negative. Being moderately\n           sensitive (>55% sensitivity) the test is able to detect 55% of biopsy false negatives.\n           In addition being highly specific (>95% specificity) it supplies an additional evidence\n           for true biopsy negative result which reduces examinees anxiety of being misdiagnosed.\n\n      OctavBlue is a qualitative in vitro diagnostic test service, performed by EventusDx\n      authorized laboratories. Intend of use of OctavBlue is the following:\n\n      \u2022 OctavBlue is indicated for women above 18 years old, who performed mammography and\n      received doubtful results. Being highly sensitive (>95% sensitivity) the test can help to\n      reveal 95% of positive cases; and being moderately specific (>55% specificity) - about half\n      of negative cases. The test is not intended to be used as a standalone diagnostic technique\n      but to supply additional information to a physician and help deciding about the further\n      course of diagnosis."
