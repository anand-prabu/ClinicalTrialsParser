An abdominal ultrasound will be done at the screening and year 3 visits along with the completion of a liver questionnaire. Finally, participants will have a liver biopsy done, with the use of lidocaine, lorazepam, or midazolam and fentanyl, after the screening visit and potentially at the year 3 study visit, depending on the results of the first liver biopsy.  Participants who experience pain after the liver biopsy may receive acetaminophen or oxycodone/acetaminophen. Any subject experiencing nausea may receive ondansetron."

In some individuals, the intrinsic cellular mechanisms of the hepatocyte are\n      sufficient to clear adequate amounts of the abnormally folded protein such that liver\n      disease does not occur.  In AAT deficient individuals who develop liver disease,\n      environmental and other genetic factors stress the hepatocyte, and the normal cellular\n      mechanisms that maintain homeostasis are disrupted, leading to liver disease.\n\n      For this proposal, our hypothesis is that the prevalence of liver disease in adults with AAT\n      is higher than previously reported because liver injury and fibrosis is not accurately\n      detected by available routine liver testing.   Testing this hypothesis will require an\n      initial evaluation for liver disease with liver function testing and imaging, and then\n      histologic confirmation by liver biopsy."
