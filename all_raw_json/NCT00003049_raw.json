Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage\n      tumor cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing\n      so they stop growing or die. Combining surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy may be\n      an effective treatment for cancer of the pancreas.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of surgery to remove the\n      pancreas and a portion of the small intestine with or without removing lymph nodes, followed\n      by radiation therapy and chemotherapy, in treating patients with cancer of the pancreas."

Radiation therapy is given every week for 5 weeks. Fluorouracil/leucovorin\n      calcium is administered by rapid IV push daily within 2 hours of radiation on days 1-4 of\n      week 1 and days 29-31 of week 5.\n\n      Patients are followed every 4 months for the first year, then every 6 months for the next 2\n      years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 50 patients will be accrued per group for a total of 100 patients."
