The goal of the Bronchiectasis Research Registry is to support\n      collaborative research and assist in the planning of multi-center clinical trials for the\n      treatment of NTM and non-CF Bronchiectasis, a progressive, non-curable disease of the lungs,\n      which afflicts thousands of patients. The Registry will also be used to provide better\n      insight into the study of the different types of Bronchiectasis, as well as the\n      pathophysiology of the disorder. In 2012, in collaboration with NTM Info and Research, Inc\n      (NTMir) and the consortium members, the COPD Foundation expanded the Bronchiectasis Research\n      Registry to enroll patients with \"non tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) only\". Prior to this\n      time, the registry included individuals with Bronchiectasis, with or without NTM."
