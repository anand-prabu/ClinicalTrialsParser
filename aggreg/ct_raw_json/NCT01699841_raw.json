By following\n      mothers and their infants, we will evaluate the important interactions between infant immune\n      responses and infectious disease events in relation to breast milk composition and feeding\n      patterns. Our aim is to identify a set of predictive factors corresponding to healthy early\n      infant growth and development in this setting in Northern Tanzania."
