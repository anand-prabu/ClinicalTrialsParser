The median survival time remains around 6-8 months with a poor\n      quality of life. Patients with resectable locoregionally recurrent SCCHN may benefit from\n      surgery. Patients with recurrent SCCHN who are not suitable for curative salvage surgery or\n      re-irradiation, and patients who have distant metastases, usually receive CT (Cohen EE et\n      al.) A number of compounds demonstrate single-agent activity in recurrent and/or metastatic\n      disease including cisplatin, carboplatin, methotrexate, 5-FU, bleomycin and the taxanes (\n      Scantz SP et al). Cisplatin is one of the most active agents identified for head and neck\n      cancer, with carboplatin providing an alternative for patients unable to tolerate cisplatin.\n      While carboplatin is associated with lower response rates than cisplatin, there appears to\n      be no difference between the agents in terms of survival\n\n      Cetuximab is a targeted therapeutic agent, a chimeric IgG1 monoclonal antibody that\n      specifically binds to the EGFR with high affinity, internalising the receptor and preventing\n      the ligands EGF and TGF-alfa from interacting with the receptors and thus effectively\n      blocking ligand-induced EGFR phosphorylation.  In addition, cetuximab has been found to\n      potentiate the effects of chemotherapy and radiotherapy in experimental systems.  The dose\n      of cetuximab has been found to be generally safe and effective in several studies in major\n      tumor types expressing the EGFR. These included colorectal cancer, squamous cell carcinoma\n      of the head and neck and non-small cell lung cancer, with cetuximab given either in\n      combination studies with chemotherapy and radiotherapy or as monotherapy. The main side\n      effects of cetuximab monotherapy are hypersensitivity- and acne-like skin reactions."
