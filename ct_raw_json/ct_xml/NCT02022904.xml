  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a minimal risk correlative clinical blood-drawing protocol. The objective of this
      lead in pilot component is to determine whether Circulating Tumor Cells (CTC's) can be
      captured using the novel mesenchymal-marker based Near Infrared-Emissive Polymersomes
      (NIR-EPs), the PSMA-based NIR-EP, and the epithelial EpCAM-based NIR-EP.   If successful,
      the capture method will be evaluated further in the larger comparative study.

          -  Evidence of disease progression on androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) as evidenced by
             either of the following in the past:

               1. Two consecutive PSA levels greater than the PSA nadir achieved on ADT, separated
                  by greater than one week

               2. Radiographic evidence of disease progression as defined by new bone scan lesions
                  or soft tissue/visceral metastases &gt;2 cm in diameter.

               3. Clinical progression as determined by the treating physician.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of intercurrent or past medical or psychiatric illness that would make
