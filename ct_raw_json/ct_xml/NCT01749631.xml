      This is a prospective, open-label, multicenter, post marketing, observational study to
      investigate the effectiveness of Sevoflurane anaesthesia in difficult to intubate  Egyptian
      patients.

    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of sevoflurane in intubation in Egyptian, non
      obstetric patients undergoing surgery who suffer from suspected difficult intubation.

      The study will collect clinical data from approximately 97 difficult to intubation patients
      who has been administered sevoflurane during anesthesia induction in the operating room. The
      intubation success rate and duration of intubation will be calculated.

    <description>- The primary endpoint is the rate of intubation success (the percentage of patients for whom intubation was successful). A success is defined as intubation achieved in less than four attempts.
Patient is either considered a success or failure. Number of Intubation Attempts (following the guidelines of ASA) is a maximum of three attempts after which patient will be considered a failure</description>
