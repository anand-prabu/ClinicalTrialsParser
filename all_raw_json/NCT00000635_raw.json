HSV\n      infection in patients with AIDS is often associated with skin sores and frequent\n      recurrences. Treatment with the drug acyclovir results in healing for most patients, but\n      repeated treatment sometimes results in resistance of the virus to acyclovir. Thus, when\n      this happens, other treatments need to be used. Trifluridine is an antiviral drug that is\n      used for the treatment of Herpes infections that occur in the eye. This study attempts to\n      determine if trifluridine is useful for treating HSV sores that have not healed after\n      treatment with acyclovir."
