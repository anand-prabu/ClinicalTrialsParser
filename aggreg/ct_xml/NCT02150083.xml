  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stress urinary incontinence (SUI) is a common condition that affects up to 35% of women.
      Many surgical procedures have been developed to treat SUI, and midurethral slings have
      gradually become the first line treatment. Voiding dysfunction, or inability for a patient
      to empty her bladder, immediately after surgery is common.  A bladder test is often
      performed in the recovery area to see if the patient is able to empty her bladder. This
      typically consists of filling the bladder with 300 mL of saline through the foley catheter.
      The catheter is then removed and the patient is asked to void. The investigators then
      measure the voided volume and the residual left inside the bladder to determine if she is
      able to empty her bladder sufficiently or not. A successful voiding trial is defined as
      voiding 2/3 of the total volume in the bladder and having less than 100 mL left inside the
      bladder as residual. Our goal of this study was to evaluate efficiency and effectiveness of
      a retrograde postoperative voiding trial that is initiated in the operating room. Our
      hypothesis was that a retrograde postoperative voiding trial initiated in the operating room
      would be as effective as a standard retrograde postoperative voiding trial to predict
      postoperative voiding dysfunction while allowing for patients to spend less time in the
      recovery unit.

    <description>At completion of sling placement in the operating room, the bladder will be filled retrograde via a cystoscope with 300 mL sterile saline or water to inspect for bladder perforation. The cystoscope is removed and the foley catheter is NOT replaced for the duration of the surgery.  The surgery is completed and the patient is transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit. Once she is able to ambulate, she will be instructed to void. The voided volume and residual volume will be recorded.</description>

    <description>At completion of sling placement in the operating room, the bladder will be filled retrograde via a cystoscope with 300 mL sterile saline or water to inspect for bladder perforation. The cystoscope is removed and the foley catheter is replaced for the duration of the surgery and when complete the patient is transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit. Once she is able to ambulate, she will undergo a retrograde bladder fill with 300 mL of normal saline. The foley catheter will be removed and she will be instructed to void. The voided volume and residual volume will be recorded.</description>
