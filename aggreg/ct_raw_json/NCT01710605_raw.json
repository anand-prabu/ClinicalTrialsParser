In the standard arm, the kind of\n      treatment will be decided by clinicians, taking into account the criteria usually used in\n      this setting. In the CTC arm, the type of treatment will be decided by CTC count:\n      hormone-therapy if <5CTC/7.5mll (CellSearch technique) or chemotherapy if =5. The main\n      medical objective is to demonstrate the non-inferiority of the CTC-based strategy for the\n      progression-free survival: 994 patients are needed, and will be accrued in French cancer\n      centers. Secondary clinical objectives are to compare toxicity, quality of life and overall\n      survival between the two arms. The medico-economic study will compare cost per\n      progression-free life years gained of the two strategies. The financial impact of\n      centralized (one platform) vs decentralized (several platforms) CTC testing will be\n      evaluated."
