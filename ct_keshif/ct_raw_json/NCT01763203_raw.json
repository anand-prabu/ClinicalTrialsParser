The CM will follow care\n      protocols developed by the research team. The CHW will serve as a liaison between the\n      patient and the health care system, and mobilize resources and system support to reduce\n      social isolation and improve stroke risk factor control self-management, through a series of\n      workshops and home visits.  Intervention participants will receive home blood pressure\n      monitors.  Subjects in either arm are eligible to receive their usual source of care.  Five\n      hundred participants who have had a stroke or TIA will be enrolled, randomized to the\n      intervention or to usual care in a 1:1 ratio, and followed for 12 months.  The impact of the\n      intervention on systolic blood pressure is the primary study outcome;  secondary outcomes\n      are other stroke risk factors.  Enrollment will occur at four sites in Los Angeles County,\n      and the study sample is projected to include over 90% socioeconomically disadvantaged\n      individuals from minority groups."
