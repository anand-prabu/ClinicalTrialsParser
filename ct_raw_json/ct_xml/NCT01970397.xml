        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have moderate to severe perioral lines as assessed by the Investigator using the

          -  Accept the obligation not to receive any other facial procedures or treatments at any
             time during the study that are not study related

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have lip tattoos, facial hair or scars that would interfere with visualization of the
             lips and perioral area for the effectiveness assessments

          -  Have dentures or any device covering all or part of the upper palate, and/or severe
             malocclusion, dentofacial or maxillofacial deformities, or significant asymmetry of
             the  perioral area, as judged by the Treating Investigator

          -  Have a history of skin cancer

          -  Is an active smoker

          -  Has noticeable acne scarring, active inflammation, infection, cancerous or

          -  Have undergone cosmetic facial or perioral area procedures [e.g., face-lift, or other
             surgeries which may alter the appearance of the perioral area, including tissue
             grafting, or tissue augmentation with silicone, fat, or other permanent fillers] or
             be planning to undergo any of these procedures at any time during the study

          -  Have undergone temporary or semi-permanent facial dermal filler injections (e.g.,
             hyaluronic acid, calcium hydroxylapatite, L-Polylactic acid)  in the lower face
             (below the orbital rim) within 24 months

          -  Have received mesotherapy, or resurfacing (laser, photomodulation, intense pulsed
             light, radio frequency, dermabrasion, chemical peel, or other ablative or
             non-ablative procedures) within 6 months prior to entry in the study or be planning
             to undergo any of these procedures at any time during the study other than study
             related procedures.

             sunscreens and continued therapy with some cosmeceuticals (e.g., alpha hydroxyl
             acids, glycolic acids, retinol, or retinoic acids) is allowed if the regimen was
             established ≥ 90 days prior to enrollment]

          -  Have had epilation (e.g. laser hair removal, electrolysis, threading, etc.)  in the
             perioral area performed within 3 months

          -  Have received treatment with botulinum toxin of any serotype for any indication in
             the lower face  [below the infraorbital rims (IORs)]  within 1 year of the baseline
             visit
