For patients with bronchial dysplasia postoperatively, starting less\n      than 6 months from the time of surgery, patients will be randomized to receive either 850 mg\n      po BID of metformin or observation. Metformin dosing will include a 4 week ramp up of 850 mg\n      po daily prior to starting the BID dose. Adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy will be\n      applied at the discretion of treating physicians.  Patients found to have bronchial\n      dysplasia at the time of bronchoscopy will undergo follow up bronchoscopy and tissue\n      sampling at 6 months follow up."
