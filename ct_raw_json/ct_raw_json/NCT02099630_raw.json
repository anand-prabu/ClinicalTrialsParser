These metabolic changes are accompanied by altered functional\n      activation in medial and lateral prefrontal areas during emotional and cognitive\n      stimulation, respectively. After longterm treatment, excitatory glutamate and inhibitory\n      gamma-aminobutyric acid  concentrations adapt to a new homeostatic level which is reflected\n      in antidepressive response or remission of symptoms. The investigators assume that the\n      levels of glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid  determine the amplitude of BOLD responses\n      during emotional and cognitive stimulation. Furthermore, the investigators hypothesize that\n      the plasma concentration of brain- derived neurotrophic factor might be a predictor for\n      therapy response and changes in the course of treatment.\n\n      With our protocol we adhere to the rules of good scientific practice and observe all\n      relevant laws, regulations and guidelines that pertain to the project. The investigators'\n      study is in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the local ethics\n      committee. Storage of data is in accordance with german privacy laws."
