  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the first phase of this study (Cohort 1), the investigators will determine the
      feasibility of adding MRSI to the evaluation of newly-diagnosed GBM patients treated with
      standard RT/TMZ and determine whether magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) can
      predict for better outcomes in these patients.  In the second phase of this study (Cohort
      2), the investigators will treat newly-diagnosed GBM patients with vorinostat and standard
      RT/TMZ  and determine whether MRSI can aid clinicians in the early determination of response
      to this new therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients (45 in each Cohort) will be sequentially enrolled to Cohort 1 (standard RT/TMZ for
      6 wks followed by adjuvant TMZ) and then Cohort 2 (standard RT/TMZ + vorinostat for 6 weeks
      followed by adjuvant TMZ).

      Patients will undergo MRSI scans before beginning treatment and then at several time points
      during treatment to look for the early response of their tumor to treatment. Blood and tumor
      samples will be used to measure the levels of certain markers within the cancer cells.
      Patients will also be assessed for the side effects they experience. Progression-free and
      overall survival outcomes will be recorded.  Patients will also have assessment of their
      depressive symptoms, quality-of-life and neurocognitive function at several time points
      during and after therapy course.
