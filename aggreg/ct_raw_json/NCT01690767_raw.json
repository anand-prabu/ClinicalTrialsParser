An accurate diagnosis\n      of a UTI ensures timely and appropriate treatment given to reduce the risk of renal\n      scarring, which is the greatest in this age group. To ensure diagnostic accuracy, urethral\n      catheterization is the preferred method to obtain a urine sample from a young child. In\n      contrast to adults, most children do not receive local analgesia for urethral\n      catheterization; despite growing recognition that children experience avoidable pain and\n      discomfort during invasive procedures.\n\n      Following informed consent, participants will be randomized by block randomization in a\n      concealed fashion to receive either topical and intraurethral 2% lidocaine or standard of\n      care using a computerized random number generator. The research nurse will access a\n      sequentially numbered, opaque sealed envelope that will contain the participant's group\n      assignment. No adjunctive analgesic methods will be used. A research pharmacist will prepare\n      2% lidocaine gel in a 3 cc syringe attached to a 24 gauge angiocath. Children < 7 kg and > 7\n      kg will receive 1 cc and 1.5 cc, respectively (2).\n\n      The entire procedure will be videotaped and participants pain will be scored using a brow\n      bulging score and visual analogue scale by independent, blinded raters."
