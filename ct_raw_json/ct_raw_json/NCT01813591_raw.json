Despite\n      the widespread use of anti-seizure medications, there remain a significant number of patient\n      whose migraines are refractory to these agents.  The pathophysiology of migraine is such\n      that the neural substances calcitonin G related protein (CGRP), substance P, and neurokinin\n      A are released at the trigeminal nerve endings innervating the large cranial and dura mater\n      blood vessels and this neurotrasmission generates migraine associated pain.  Because of\n      this, treatment for migraine can be directed towards down regulating those receptor sites\n      accordingly.  Acthar may provide pain relief through this mechanist, as ACTH has been shown\n      to inhibit the release of CGRP and may also provide relief through a negative feedback loop\n      as exogenous ACTH inhibits CRH release and mast cell degranulation."
