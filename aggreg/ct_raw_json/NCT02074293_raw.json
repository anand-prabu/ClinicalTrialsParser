Gadolinium will be injected with ASIS subdermally (30) or\n      conventional intramuscularly (30) for these 7 muscle groups: Splenius, Scalene,\n      Sterno-cleido-mastoid, Levator scapulae, Semispinalis, Trapezius, and Longissimus. An MRI\n      will be taken promptly after Gadolinium injection, as starting reference, to which\n      subsequent MRI taken at 6 hrs, 12 hrs, and 24 hrs later will be compared for Persistent %.\n      Since there isn't a way to measure level of Gadolinium within it, or any other (e.g. Botox)\n      for that matter, at least the Prolongation of Gadolinium may be approximated by the greater\n      or longer Persistent % on MRI. However, this approximation can only work if the variables\n      are minimized to the same population with Cervical Dystonia, and these particular 7 muscle\n      groups. Case in point, patients with Cervical Dystonia presumably have hyperactive Splenius,\n      Scalene, Sterno-cleido-mastoid, Levator scapulae, Semispinalis, Trapezius, and Longissimus\n      muscles, so expectantly will have shortened Gadolinium intramuscularly Persistent %, and\n      somewhat reduced Gadolinium subdermally Persistent % as well due to agitation, thus these\n      Persistent % values in Cervical Dystonia patients will not be like those of normal patients,\n      or even the same between these 7 different muscle groups.  Therefore, the Relative\n      Prolongation Ability Score or total Persistent % subdermally over total Persistent %\n      intramuscularly, will be specific and valuable indicators to help us modify Botox dosage and\n      duration to inject into \"unknown\" subdermal bloodless space for Aim 2.\n\n      Aim 2 over 12 months, using Botox, instead of Gadolinium, will  demonstrate the advantages\n      of ASIS device subdermally over intramuscularly, for the same 60 adult subjects with\n      Cervical Dystonia, on these particular 7 muscle groups: Splenius, Scalene,\n      Sterno-cleido-mastoid, Levator scapulae, Semispinalis, Trapezius, and Longissimus.\n      Hypothetically speaking, if that subdermal bloodless space in patients with e.g., Cervical\n      Dystonia somehow failed to show prolongation of half-life for Gadolinium in Aim 1, we can\n      still proceed with primary interest being therapeutic comparison for Botox in Aim 2, in\n      terms of improvement on the Physician Global Assessment Scale at 6, 12, 18, 24, and 30\n      weeks, and reduction in Cervical Dystonia Severity Scale (CDSS) as well as adverse\n      reactions."
