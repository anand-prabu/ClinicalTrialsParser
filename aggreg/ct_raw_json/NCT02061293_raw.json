            "textblock": "Several lines of evidence suggest that classic hallucinogens such as psilocybin can\n      facilitate behavior change in addictions such as alcohol dependence. The proposed\n      investigation is a multi-site, double-blind active-controlled trial (n = 180, 90 per group)\n      contrasting the acute and persisting effects of psilocybin to those of diphenhydramine in\n      the context of outpatient alcoholism treatment.  Two to four sites will participate. Aims of\n      the study are 1) to characterize the acute effects of PO psilocybin 25 mg/70 kg, 30 mg/70\n      kg, and 40 mg/70 kg in alcohol dependent patients; 2) to evaluate the effect of psilocybin\n      treatment on drinking outcomes for 32 weeks after the first administration, relative to\n      diphenhydramine control; 3) to evaluate the explanatory value of changes in alcohol craving,\n      self-efficacy, motivation, and other psychological domains in accounting for the observed\n      experimental effect of psilocybin relative to diphenhydramine control; and 4) to test\n      whether or not characteristics of the drug administration session experiences and short term\n      (1 week) persisting effects mediate effects of psilocybin on post-session drinking behavior.\n\n      The total duration of psychosocial treatment in the double-blind period will be 12 weeks,\n      and double-blind drug administration sessions will occur after 4 and 8 weeks. In the first\n      psilocybin session, a dose of 25 mg/70 kg will be administered. Depending on the response in\n      the first session, the dose for the second session may be increased to 30 mg/70 kg or 40\n      mg/70 kg, or held at 25mg/70kg. The dose of diphenhydramine will start at 150 mg, and may be\n      increased to 250 mg or held at 150 mg in the second session, depending on response in the\n      first session. The drug will be administered during 8-hour sessions in an outpatient setting\n      under close medical and psychiatric monitoring. The drug administration sessions will occur\n      in the context of an extended version of Motivational Enhancement Therapy (Motivational\n      Enhancement and Taking Action, META) with the addition of standardized preparation before\n      and debriefing and follow-up after the psilocybin administration sessions. Extensive\n      screening and baseline assessment will be completed, including thorough safety screening and\n      assessment of participant characteristics that could potentially moderate treatment\n      response. Within-session and short-term persisting effects will be assessed. Drinking\n      outcomes and changes in several potential mediators of treatment effect, including\n      motivation, self-efficacy, craving, depression, anxiety, and spiritual dimensions of the\n      experience, will be measured until 32 weeks after the first drug administration session, for\n      a total of 36 weeks from the initiation of treatment."
