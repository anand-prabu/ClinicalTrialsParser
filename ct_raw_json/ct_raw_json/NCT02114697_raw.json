            "textblock": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer are the leading causes of suffering and death\n      amongst the American population. While an ever-increasing number of cancer survivors have a\n      favorable outcome due to advances in cancer treatment; cancer survivors remain at high risk\n      of developing CVD at an early age. There is scant information available on the pathogenic\n      process that contributes to cardiovascular threat amongst cancer survivors and little is\n      known about the interventions, which may interrupt or decrease the risk of CVD in this\n      population. Importantly, early-subclinical markers may substantially precede clinical\n      markers.\n\n      The investigators are a collaborative team of basic and clinical scientists with\n      complimentary strengths and would like to propose a research study. The goal of this study\n      is correlation between metabolomics (in blood) and atherosclerosis in carotid arteries\n      (measured via MRI) in asymptomatic cancer survivors. The overlapping and interacting\n      components of the proposed study will create a system to classify CVD risk phenotype in\n      terms of metabolic outlines and predictive models that integrate the metabolic patterns,\n      pathways, and functional networks. This makes it feasible to discover metabolomic signatures\n      of 'high' and 'low' CVD risk in a relatively healthy population with/without subclinical\n      vascular disease.\n\n      By establishing a bio-repository, this data can be used for answering additional innovative\n      research questions now and in future. We expect use of metabolomics technology to support\n      affordable disease surveillance and forecasting models in a manner similar to the one used\n      by National Weather Service to predict the timing, occurrence, path and intensity of\n      hurricanes."

            "textblock": "The objective of this project is to accurately determine the constituents and\n      characteristics of atherosclerotic plaques in carotid arteries by magnetic resonance imaging\n      (MRI) techniques in cancer survivors; at different data intervals: before and after\n      administration of treatment (medical and life style modification) and then correlate\n      contrast agent dynamics with serum markers of inflammation and other tests of cardiac or\n      vascular dysfunction, where available.\n\n      The proposed study involves 100 asymptomatic patients who received prior chest or head and\n      neck radiation therapy (HNXRT) as part of cancer treatment. MRI data (direct assessment of\n      atherosclerosis) would be correlated with indirect measures of atherosclerosis (blood\n      surrogate markers & metabolomics).\n\n      The investigators intend to conduct an initial baseline MRI, blood tests (to correlate with\n      surrogate markers of inflammation) and other tests whenever available of cardiac or vascular\n      dysfunction. This cohort will be followed up with medication and/or life style modification\n      regimen for a period of initially18 months and subsequently at 36 months. A repeat of all\n      baseline studies (MRI and blood tests) would be performed as part of the 18 and 36-month\n      follow-up. The plaque characteristics found at MRI will be correlated with results of blood\n      tests (baseline, 18 and 36 months) and changes in one or both will be the expected end point\n      of the study.\n\n      Introduction: Radiation therapy (XRT) is critical for the treatment of many benign and\n      malignant neoplasms. It is well established that cancer survivors who have undergone XRT\n      exhibit a long-term survival rate that significantly lags behind age and gender-matched\n      population controls (7-11). Several scientific studies and publications have demonstrated\n      that, of all etiologies of non-cancer mortality, cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the\n      most significant cause of morbidity and mortality in cancer survivors (7-11). Until recently\n      radiation vasculopathy has attracted little research attention, because patients would often\n      succumb to their malignancy before the vascular conditions manifested clinically (8). This\n      is no longer the rule as more patients are now \"outliving\" their malignancies and are\n      presenting with the long-term sequelae of cancer treatments (9). Sequelae and manifestations\n      of accelerated atherosclerosis have been identified in the vasculature of almost every organ\n      system (12-15). Atherosclerotic plaques that are susceptible to rupture, termed \"vulnerable\"\n      or \"unstable\" consist of a large necrotic core made substantially of lipids and cell debris\n      and a thin, collagen-poor fibrous cap (3, 16-18).\n\n      Another characteristic of unstable plaques is that they contain numerous inflammatory cells.\n      It has been documented that inflamed plaque and those with a large lipid core and thin\n      fibrous cap are more likely to progress and cause clinical events than those without these\n      features (19-21). Inflammation plays a major role in the onset, progression and\n      destabilization of arterial plaque (22-27). Therefore imaging the vasculature for both its\n      inflammatory state and presence of type of disease is very important (28-30). The potential\n      of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to characterize arterial plaques has been extensively\n      studied (1, 31-33). MRI due to its ability of tissue characterization, superior resolution,\n      lack of radiation, non invasiveness is an ideal modality for in vivo study of arterial\n      plaques.\n\n      Aims: The purpose of this study is to assess carotid artery MRI plaque characteristics in\n      100 asymptomatic cancer survivors with history of chest, head and neck radiotherapy (HNXRT).\n      Another objective is to analyze plaque changes in the same group after initiation of\n      treatment for 18 and 36 months.\n\n      The following specific aims (A), research questions (RQ) and hypotheses (H) will be\n      addressed.\n\n      A 1: To characterize the plaque constituents including fibrous cap (FC), lipid core and\n      hemorrhage within the carotid plaque by MRI. RQ 1a: What are the predominant plaque\n      constituents?. RQ 1b: Is there a predominance of complex and vulnerable plaque features in\n      the neck arterial vasculature of cancer survivors?. H 1: We hypothesize that there is a\n      predominance of vulnerable plaque in carotid arterial vasculature of HNXRT patients due to\n      the phenomenon of radiation vasculopathy.\n\n      A 2: Determine the correlation between plaque inflammation (direct measure by MRI) with\n      serum markers of inflammation through blood tests (hsCRP, LpPLA2, IL-6) and metabolomics. RQ\n      2: Is there any correlation between the direct and surrogate markers of inflammation?. H 2:\n      We hypothesize that there is a predictable correlation between the direct and surrogate\n      measures of inflammation.\n\n      A 3: To assess the longitudinal change in the artery plaque characteristics (inflammation\n      and morphology) with treatment. RQ 3: Is there a predictable relationship between\n      inflammation (pattern of enhancement-/contrast kinetics) and vulnerable features within a\n      plaque?. H 3: We hypothesize that changes in plaque characteristics pre and post treatment\n      would correlate with contrast agent dynamics over time.\n\n      A 4: To determine the efficacy of comprehensive treatment (life style modification + statin)\n      versus (life style modification + placebo). RQ 4: Is one regimen better than the other in\n      cancer survivors with subclinical atherosclerosis? H 4: We hypothesize that comprehensive\n      treatment (life style modification + statin) would have better inflammation control and\n      favorable plaque modification than life style modification alone as measured by parameters\n      in (A2 & A3).\n\n      Research Strategy:\n\n      Subjects: The investigators intend to recruit 100 asymptomatic cancer survivors who had\n      prior history of chest, head and neck radiotherapy (HNXRT). These patients of The Winship\n      Cancer Institute who are being invited to return to The Survivorship Clinic as part of\n      longterm routine follow-up. The research will be coordinated through the Emory School of\n      Medicine, Department of Radiology in partnership with The Winship Cancer Institute,\n      Survivorship Clinic, Department of Cardiology and The Stroke Center. All the aspects of\n      clinical and research assessment and follow-up will be provided within The Emory Healthcare\n      System.\n\n      Variables and Measures: Blood will be drawn for testing in the MRI Research Laboratory at\n      EMORY by a research nurse. The blood specimens will be drawn immediately before each MRI\n      examination to measure laboratory testing of serum markers of inflammation (hsCRP, LpPLA2,\n      IL-6) and metabolomics. Creatinine will be measured to calculate eGFR. In addition, the\n      Framingham Risk Assessment Tool for General Cardiovascular Disease (FRAT) will be employed\n      to determine the 10-year risk prediction for general cardiovascular events using the\n      assessed values of age; history of diabetes, smoking, and hypertension; systolic blood\n      pressure.\n\n      Examination Plan Overview: All study participants will be given IRB approved informed\n      consent. Those who decide to take part and give consent for the study would be enrolled in\n      the research study. The investigators would be taking snap shots with MRI at three data\n      points and monitor treatment effects. A baseline MRI will be performed to assess arterial\n      atherosclerotic constituents and blood tests to have a baseline. Once the initial MRI and\n      blood tests have been performed, and in the case where subclinical disease is present i.e.\n      elevated blood markers or arterial plaque on MRI. HNXRT cancer survivor patients with\n      abnormal tests will be started on treatment, which includes life style modification and-/-or\n      lipid lowering medication. Patients with positive tests would be divided into two groups;\n      one group will receive life style modification + statin therapy and the second group will\n      receive life style modification alone. A repeat MRI and blood tests (2nd study) will be\n      performed at 18 months after initiation of such treatment to assess changes in plaque\n      morphology and enhancement characteristics. A final set of MRI and blood tests will be\n      performed at 36 months after initiation of such treatment to assess changes in plaque\n      morphology and enhancement characteristics. MRI findings of baseline, 18 months and 36\n      months would be correlated with blood markers of inflammation.\n\n      Treatment and Clinical Follow-Up: Patients enrolled in the \"Accelerated Atherosclerosis in\n      High Risk Population Groups: An Assessment by Magnetic Resonance Imaging\" study will be\n      evaluated in the cardiology clinic by Khusrow Niazi, MD, FACC, FSCAI who is the Director of\n      Peripheral Vascular Intervention at Emory University and treats patients with carotid artery\n      disease. All these patients will be randomized based on the last digit of their medical\n      record number. If the last digit will be an even number they will then be given a statin,\n      which they will take and will also be instructed about regular exercise by Emory HeartWiseSM\n      Risk Reduction. Program. Patients will be made aware of the side effects of statins and\n      about the procedures to report these side effects. Patients with the last digit being an odd\n      number will ONLY be advised about exercise by Emory HeartWiseSM Risk Reduction Program.\n      These patients will have regular visits and patients on a statin will be followed up and\n      evaluated for any adverse effects of the medication and for compliance. Additionally these\n      patients will get routine clinical follow-up in the oncology (The Winship Cancer Institute\n      Clinics) and cardiology clinics (Emory Hospital) as part of the ongoing routine clinical\n      care.\n\n      After initial/baseline MRI, our recruited research subjects that demonstrate increased blood\n      markers and/or atherosclerosis on MRI would be subjected to life style modification \u00b1\n      medical (statin) therapy. Department of Cardiology would prescribe and monitor statin\n      therapy: Rosuva (20 mg once a day) with target LDL goal < 70; non-HDL goal < 100 and Aspirin\n      (81 mg once a day). The rational for using rosuva 20 mg is because this dosage has already\n      been successfully used in JUPITER Trial (35). The follow-up by Cardiology department would\n      comprise educating the patients on life style modification and also how to monitor and\n      report any adverse drug affects which if expected would be further assessed with laboratory\n      testing with LFT's and CBC. Any patients who suffer clinical side effects of treatment as\n      part of our research would be taken off our study. They would however continue routine\n      clinical follow-up in 'The Survivorship and Cardiology clinics'.\n\n      Life style modification will be tailored, implemented and followed up by Emory HeartWiseSM\n      Risk Reduction Program. This Program will use several analytical tools including\n      questionnaire (BOMC, Rose, FRAT, CHD Knowledge Test). These analytical tools, laboratory as\n      well as imaging tests will help EmoryHeartWise Risk Reduction Program devise the best life\n      style modification and exercise strategy for our patients.\n\n      Emory HeartWiseSM Risk Reduction Program\n\n      Joint Proposal WCI/Preventive Cardiology- Emory HeartWiseSM Risk Reduction:\n\n      Lifestyle Modifications in our high-risk patients with Subclinical Atherosclerosis 12 week/3\n      months; 3 x/week, total 36 visits Recommend 6 Minute Walk Test (MWT) on Telemetry for each\n      Patient: functional screen\n\n      Evaluation:\n\n        1.

Individualized exercise prescription created and progressed by staff; tracked on flow\n           sheets; monitor blood pressure; if diabetes - Blood Glucose (BG) pre/post/during if\n           necessary.\n\n      The Healthy Exercise for Lymphoma Patients (HELP) trial was a randomized controlled trial\n      looking at the benefits of 12 weeks supervised exercise program for cancer survivors\n      compared to usual care (36). Improvements in health-related fitness and quality of life were\n      maintained at the 6-month clinical follow up. The same model of secondary prevention through\n      supervised, graded exercise as well as identifying and intervening with education and active\n      participation in risk factor modification is being proposed to help high-risk patients\n      identified with subclinical atherosclerosis.\n\n      The premise of inclusion of exercise regimen in our study is that regular, moderate levels\n      of exercise have been shown to be beneficial at lowering blood pressure, total cholesterol,\n      low-density lipoprotein, triglycerides, increasing high density lipoprotein, metabolic\n      syndrome, insulin sensitivity, and all-cause mortality (37). Intensive lifestyle\n      modification through education, support, and supervised exercise are the core components\n      directed at risk factor reduction (38).\n\n      MRI Examination:\n\n      Pre-MRI screening and informed consent: Upon arrival at the MRI Research Center, a trained\n      MRI technologist will screen each study participant for metal objects and implants that may\n      be hazardous in the MRI environment. The subject will be given a copy of the informed\n      consent form. The PI or the co-investigator will be responsible for ensuring that the\n      subject fully understands the procedure, for answering any questions the subject may have\n      and for obtaining written informed consent. The technologist will then guide the subject to\n      the MRI scanner room.\n\n      Imaging protocol: All scans will be performed on a 3.0T MRI scanning system using 4-channel\n      dedicated coil. A fast gradient echo 3-plane localizer will be performed to locate the major\n      artery and its bifurcations.  The location and extent of the lesion will be ascertained or\n      verified from the 3D-TOF angiographic images. The site of imaging will be selected to\n      coincide with the location of a selected known lesion.\n\n      Baseline, Intermediate and Final MRI: Each subject will undergo similar scan protocol at\n      baseline, intermediate and final MRI. Anatomical landmarks will be used to match images\n      (baseline, intermediate and final) in the same patient from the three time points spread\n      over an intervals of 18 months. These landmarks include arterial bifurcations, vertebrae,\n      proximity of other vessels and patterns of fat and muscle. Since the slice volume would be\n      planned centered at the area of interest for all the studies (initial and repeat); the exact\n      Z-location of each slice would be known and reproducible for acquisition and comparative\n      measurements.\n\n      Project Timeline: The equipment and resources are currently in place to begin patient\n      examinations immediately upon receiving funding. We anticipate the recruitment of all 100\n      patients from the existing pool of patients at the Emory Clinics (Survivorship Clinic)\n      within the 12 months of funding. The time from baseline MRI and initial follow-up MRI study\n      will be 18 months which would give us time to observe therapy related changes in the plaque\n      morphology and observe correlation between plaque morphology and inflammatory markers in the\n      serum. The last set of follow up MRI and blood tests at 36 months would serve as the end\n      point for final analyses of the long term effects of the instituted treatment regimen. Thus,\n      if the co-investigators responsible for statistical models receive the complete data 6\n      months after the end of the studies, it is expected to take another 6 months to complete the\n      entire work. So realistically the project should be completed in 48 months.\n\n      Adverse Event Reporting: We do not expect any serious physical adverse events from this\n      research study. Participating in this study involves very few/minimal risks. Study staff\n      will work with patients to minimize any stress or discomfort with the study procedures. The\n      study involves a blood draw, which may cause slight bruising or pain at the site where the\n      blood is drawn. In addition, bleeding, dizziness, fainting or feeling lightheaded, nausea,\n      hematoma or infection may occur because of drawing your blood. The blood will be drawn from\n      expert/trained staff so this will be less likely to happen.\n\n      We do not expect any serious physical adverse events from MRI examinations. Due to recent\n      concerns related to the use of gadolinium-based contrast agents in patients with renal\n      dysfunction and risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF), serum creatinine levels will be\n      measured from blood drawn before each MRI examination (49). Patients with normal renal\n      function values will be administered contrast and this approach virtually eliminates any\n      possibility of NSF. Statin treatment might cause some side effects in few individuals which\n      would be closely monitored by symptoms and followed by blood tests; if any side effects\n      occur, the medication would be immediately stopped; patients would be taken off the study\n      protocol and they would continue their routine follow up in The Survivorship and Cardiology\n      clinics. Subjects will be provided with telephone numbers of the PI, co-investigators and\n      the Emory University IRB. Any adverse events will be appropriately documented and reported\n      through the Department of Radiology Safety Committee.\n\n      Data and Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP): There might be a minimal risk due to breach in\n      confidentiality of the patient information, which we plan to overcome by keeping all\n      personal facts and data private and confidential, and will use it strictly for research\n      purposes. In order to maintain confidentiality, we will use a participant number rather than\n      patient names on study records where we can. All patient records will be identified by an\n      individual code number and the record of subject identifiers and corresponding reference\n      codes will be stored in a locked cabinet in the protected and monitored research office\n      building. All the results will be presented and published as group data. Agencies such as\n      the Food and Drug Administration and the Emory University Human Investigations Committee\n      have the right to review these records. We will keep the records private to the extent\n      allowed by law. We will do this even if outside review occurs."
