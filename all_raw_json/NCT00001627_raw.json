A blood and bone marrow sample will be obtained to verify that\n      the patient has normal blood cell production.\n\n      Researchers plan to obtain bone marrow samples to be used in laboratory studies directed\n      toward understanding the formation of blood cells.  Bone marrow samples will be taken from\n      the hip bone of patients and healthy volunteers.\n\n      These samples are valuable to many research studies within the Hematology Branch of the\n      National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, including studies of normal and abnormal\n      production of blood cells, the viral causes of blood diseases, and the role of the immune\n      system in bone marrow failure and related conditions."
