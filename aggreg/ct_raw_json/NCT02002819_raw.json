            "textblock": "Patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) have seizures in addition to losing their memory and\n      other mental functions (referred to as cognitive functions). The seizures, and other\n      examples of overactive electrical activity in the brain that is not noticeable, contribute\n      to the loss of cognitive function. Studies in animal models suggest that a drug that\n      prevents seizures called levetiracetam may reduce neuronal over-excitation and improve\n      cognition in individuals with AD. We propose to determine if levetiracetam can also be used\n      to treat patients with AD-associated seizures and loss of mental functions. We developed\n      novel instruments for this population that will also be used in future large-scale clinical\n      trials.\n\n      The current study will last for 12 weeks and will involve people with early-onset AD and\n      epileptic brain activity. Participants will be initially examined and then assigned to\n      groups in a randomized manner. One group will receive levetiracetam for 4 weeks, then no\n      drug for 4 weeks, and then placebo for 4 weeks. For another group, the order of treatments\n      will be reversed. The cognitive abilities of participants will be retested every 4 weeks and\n      compared to those at the beginning. The cognitive tests include a virtual-reality navigation\n      test of memory and computerized tests of mental flexibility and problem solving. The\n      participants will be monitored with a magnetoencephalogram (MEG) with simultaneous EEG\n      (M/EEG) at their initial visit and after each treatment phase (levetiracetam and placebo).\n      M/EEG is a highly effective non-invasive method for identifying brain regions of epileptic\n      activity. We will need to recruit 36 randomized participants to test our hypotheses. This\n      study will take place at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) Memory and Aging\n      Center, which is a large referral site for early-onset dementias, and the Department of\n      Radiology. Our overall goal is to demonstrate that levetiracetam engages the intended brain\n      target by suppressing epileptic activity and provides cognitive benefit in a select group of\n      patients who would be predicted to respond favorably to this treatment."
