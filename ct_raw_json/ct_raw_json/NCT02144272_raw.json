Prior or current use of other biologics\n             for indications other than an inflammatory arthritis may be allowed with sponsor\n             approval.\n\n          -  Treatment with >10 mg/day, or unstable dose, of oral prednisone or equivalent within\n             28 days prior to screening.\n\n          -  Confirmed or suspected septic arthritis, crystal arthropathy, systemic lupus\n             erythematosus, reactive arthritis, or certain other rheumatic conditions."
