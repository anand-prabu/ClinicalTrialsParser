Although some western countries\n      product similar injections and use them, Shuxuening injection also regarded as Chinese\n      medicine injection. As a TCM injection, the most important thing is how to safety use it in\n      practice.\n\n      In order to improving monitoring adverse events or adverse drug reaction of Chinese medicine\n      injection in hospital, registry study is suitable method in this area. Otherwise, nested\n      case control study is used to find out the mechanism of allergic reaction.\n\n      Calculate the incidence of adverse events or adverse drug reaction is one of the main aims\n      for this study. Safety surveillance on Chinese Medicine injection is an important problem\n      that needs to be sorted out through large sample observational study.\n\n      According to the 'rule of three', 30,000 cases need to be registered at least. The aim\n      population is who using Shuxuening injection's during inpatient time from December 2012 to\n      December 2014.\n\n      Data will be collected for three departments as following:\n\n      Form A (green): demographic information \uff1bForm B (pink): adverse drug events/reaction\uff1b Form C\n      (white): extracted information from hospital information system and laboratory information\n      system."
