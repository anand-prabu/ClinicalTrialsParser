            "textblock": "Background:\n\n      - Long-term survival with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is not well understood.\n      Adults who were infected with HIV as children have lived with the virus for many years.\n      However, the effect of HIV on this group of people has not been studied in depth.\n      Researchers are interested in studying how HIV infection and the medicines used to treat it\n      affect people who were infected early in life. They want to find out if there are any\n      problems with how HIV-infected children grow and develop as adults, especially if they have\n      developed heart problems. As part of this study, people with HIV will be compared with\n      healthy volunteers.\n\n      Objectives:\n\n      - To study the effect of HIV infection and treatment on people who acquired HIV infection in\n      early life.\n\n      Eligibility:\n\n        -  Individuals at least 18 years of age who were infected with HIV before age 10.\n\n        -  Healthy volunteers at least 18 years of age who have no history of heart disease.\n\n      Design:\n\n        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. They will have\n           regular study visits about once a year for up to 10 years to collect health\n           information.\n\n        -  Blood and urine samples will be collected to look at kidney and liver function.\n\n        -  X-ray scans will be used to look at bone density and the amount of fat and muscle in\n           the body.\n\n        -  Heart function tests and imaging studies, including ultrasound and echocardiograms,\n           will be used to look more closely at the heart.\n\n        -  Treatment will not be provided as part of this study."
