Our second\n      aim is then to find better tacrolimus exposure markers for therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM)\n      such as Area Under the time-concentration Curve (AUC) or intralymphocytic (PBMCs) tacrolimus\n      concentration and a way to model and predict it without invasive tests in pediatric\n      patients.\n\n      The final objective should be then to implement these findings in a more individualized and\n      comprehensive immunosuppression protocol and monitoring in order to maintain adequate and\n      well-balanced immunosuppression (preventing graft rejection while avoiding acute and\n      long-term side effects). This is particularly important for a pediatric population exposed\n      throughout their life to immunosuppressants."
