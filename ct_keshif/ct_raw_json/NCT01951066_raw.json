            "textblock": "Patients with Diabetic Macular Edema (DME) are increasingly being treated with molecules\n      targeting vascular endothelial factor (VEGF). One potential advantage of OZURDEX over\n      specific VEGF antagonists is that steroids suppress production of multiple pro-permeability\n      factors.\n\n      It is important to test the effect of OZURDEX in patients who have had a suboptimal response\n      to VEGF antagonists to determine if OZURDEX provides more sustained benefit and to\n      simultaneously assess its effect on aqueous levels of pro-permeability factors.\n\n      Our primary objective is to measure the pro-permeability factors VEGF, SDF-1, and\n      angiopoietin-2 in the aqueous humor of patients with persistent/recurrent macular edema\n      despite prior treatment with anti-VEGF agents at baseline and at 1, 2, 3, and 4 months after\n      intraocular injection of OZURDEX."
