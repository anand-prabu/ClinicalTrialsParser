  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epidemiological studies indicate that regular consumption of three cups of black tea per day
      reduces the risk of stroke or myocardial infarction. In a number of previous nutrition
      intervention studies tea has been shown to improve vascular function as assessed by Flow
      Mediated Dilation (FMD).

      The current study tests a specific Black tea extract against a placebo in population that
      has previously show to be sensitive to the effect of black tea on Flow Mediated dilation. A
      tea extract that has previously been shown to improve FMD is included as the positive
      control.
