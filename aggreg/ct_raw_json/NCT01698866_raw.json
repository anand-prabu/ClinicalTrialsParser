It is\n      an indispensible drug for the treatment of B-cell lymphoproliferative syndrome which induced\n      immunosuppression. So, the infectious complications increase. Reactivation of hepatitis B\n      virus is one such complication that can lead in asymptomatic hepatitis to death. Prevention\n      of hepatitis B reactivation is recommended like using nucleoside analog for patients with\n      chronic hepatitis B or occult hepatitis and vaccination against virus for seronegative\n      patients. The published data about efficacy of hepatitis b vaccination in onco-haematology\n      are rare. therefore, we carried out a prospective study to assess efficacy of hepatitis B\n      vaccination in patients with lymphoproliferative disorder."
