            "textblock": "Over the past several years, there has been growing concern over the significant deleterious\n      effects of RV pacing, including electromechanical dyssynchrony, proarrhythmia and\n      development of heart failure (HF). However, it remains unclear whether pacing-related\n      ventricular dyssynchrony can translate into significant LV structural changes and produce\n      important clinical impairment in an average pacemaker population with compromised AV\n      conduction. Alternatively, left ventricular pacing has been shown to minimize ventricular\n      dyssynchrony and to improve symptoms and prognosis in patients with mild to moderated\n      systolic HF and prolonged QRS duration.\n\n      This randomized controlled study is been conducted to compare the effects of conventional\n      right ventricular (RV) pacing vs. left ventricular (LV) in patients with AV block. The\n      hypothesis is that isolated LV pacing through the coronary sinus can be used safely and\n      provide greater hemodynamic benefits to patients with AV block and normal ventricular\n      function who require only the correction of heart rate.\n\n      Specifically, the investigator aims are to evaluate the safety, efficacy and the effects of\n      left ventricular pacing using active-fixation coronary sinus lead\u2014the Attain StarFix\u00ae Model\n      4195 OTW Lead, compared to right ventricular pacing in patients with implantation criteria\n      for conventional pacemaker stimulation."
