Inactivity is known\n      to negatively impact both morbidity and mortality, and is especially pronounced among cancer\n      survivors. Self-directed interventions targeting inactivity among breast cancer survivors\n      often report clinically insignificant behavior change. More successful behavior change\n      interventions have suggested that tailoring and, more recently, the fostering of intrinsic\n      motivation, may have improved outcomes. However, no interventions to date have utilized\n      these approaches to increase physical activity among sedentary cancer survivors.\n\n      AIM 1: Develop and test intervention (tailored) and comparison group (targeted) messages in\n      a sample of sedentary women to determine message acceptability.\n\n      AIM 2: Determine the efficacy of a 12-week tailored intervention to increase the number of\n      weekly steps taken among sedentary post-treatment breast cancer survivors compared to a\n      12-week, targeted intervention."
