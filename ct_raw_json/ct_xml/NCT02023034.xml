      Introduction: Although the motor changes are well determined in Parkinson's disease (PD),
      few studies describe the effects the virtual exercises on the clinical and functional
      outcomes in this disease.

      Objectives: To analyze the effectiveness of virtual exercises on functional exercise
      capacity, fatigue and quality of life in patients with PD.

      Methods: 20 subjects, 60 years old will be included, who will be randomized into 2 groups:
      group of virtual exercises associated with conventional exercises (n = 10) and control group
      with conventional exercise group (n = 10).

      The following variables are evaluated: functional exercise through walking test in 6
      minutes, fatigue by the Fatigue Severity Scale and Quality of Life through Quality of Life
      Questionnaire-PDQ-39.
