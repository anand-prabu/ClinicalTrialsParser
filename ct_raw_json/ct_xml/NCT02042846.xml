  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The SportWelding FijiAnchor is an absorbable suture anchor which is inserted by applying
      ultrasonic energy. This provides an intimate bond between implant and bone delivering
      immediate stability.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the surgical and clinical outcome of the
      SportWelding Fiji Anchor in ligament repair of the hand and hand wrist.
