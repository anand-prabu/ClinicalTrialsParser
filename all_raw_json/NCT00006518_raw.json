This protocol provides a mechanism to effect a variety of such\n      studies.\n\n      OBJECTIVES: Acquisition of serum, circulating cells, bone marrow, and tumor or normal tissue\n      samples from patients with HIV infection, KSHV infection, or with cancer.\n\n      ELIGIBILITY: Eligibility criteria include age 18 years or older and at lest one of the\n      following: Exposure risk to HIV, KSHV, or HPV; HIV seropositive; KSHV seropositive; EBV\n      seropositive; HTLV-1 seropositive; malignancy, Castleman   s disease, or skin lesions with\n      appearance of Kaposi   s sarcoma; or cervical or anal intraepithelial lesion.\n\n      DESIGN: Blood samples may be collected at the initial visit, and at follow-up visits. Tumor\n      samples may be obtained by fine needle aspirate, by removal of pleural or peritoneal fluid,\n      by skin punch biopsy, or by excisional biopsy, providing the tumor is accessible with\n      minimal risk to the patients. Specific risks will be described in a separate consent to be\n      obtained at the time of the biopsy. Samples will be studied in the HIV and AIDS Malignancy\n      Branch, CCR, NCI; laboratories in NCI-Frederick; or those of collaborating investigators."
