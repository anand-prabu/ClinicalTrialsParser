  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In today's society, we see a global obesity epidemic in both children and adults, which are
      mainly related to poor diet and inactivity. Obesity in children has tripled between
      1960-1990, which is approximately double that observed in adults. The risk of developing
      type I and II diabetes increases with increased body mass index (BMI). Obese children /
      adolescents has also decreased blood vessel function, aerobe capacity and impaired insulin
      and glucose regulation. Recent studies have shown that obese children and adolescents are
      increasingly experiencing complications of excess weight as previously only associated with
      obesity in adults. These findings have created considerable concern about the current
      epidemic of obesity, which might give today's obese children and adolescents a shorter life.

      Exercise interventions in obese children and adolescents has proved positive in terms of
      improving blood vessel function, physical capacity and decrease in BMI .

      The possibility healthcare providers have to extract gains from prevention is so far not
      exploited sufficiently by preventing more to repair minor. Part of the reason for this is
      that there is no specific advice on how health professionals can provide information on
      training for the cause of health. The World Health Organization's Commission on
      Macroeconomics and Health (2001) show that investments in health provide significant
      economic gains globally, and that the benefits of health measures is three times as large as
      investments.

      Goal: To compare the effects of moderate exercise and high-intensity endurance training when
      it comes to risk factors for heart / cardiovascular disease and cardiac function in obese
      children / adolescents.

      Method: The project uses standard methods, modern ultrasound and genetic engineering of data
      collection and data processing.

      Scientific Significance : Based on a solid scientific foundation project is expected to
      result in simple, concrete and feasible advice on effective training for health 's sake to
      prevent cardiovascular disease as well as training advice for individuals from the studied
      population. The project is expected to help identify the role of exercise for improving
      cardiovascular function, and may provide new points of attack for treatment of
      cardiovascular disease
