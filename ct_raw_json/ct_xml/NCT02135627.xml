      Introduction: Gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding arising from malignant tumors is increasingly
      recognized as a result of oncological advances and improved detection methods, and stems
      from local vessel damage and tumor invasion with associated derangements in the hemostatic
      system(1, 2). Although conventional endoscopic hemostasis methods improve outcomes in UGIB
      due to peptic ulcers and other non-variceal benign bleeding lesions of the upper, and
      perhaps the lower GI tract, data on their use in hemorrhagic, upper or lower
      gastrointestinal neoplasms are scarce and associated with varying success in initial
      hemostasis and high rebleeding rates(3-7). Other recognized single or multimodality
      treatment approaches include radiation therapy, interventional angiography, and surgery. All
      exhibit disappointing rebleeding rates, and in the case of emergency surgery, high
      mortality(4, 8-11). Challenges associated with bleeding tumors include hematological
      derangements such as thrombocytopenia, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and
      neutropenia, as well as the endoscopic manipulation of friable, diffusely bleeding surfaces
      when attempting hemostasis(2, 12, 13). The recent advent of TC-325 (HemosprayTM) to Canada,
      Europe and Asia - referred henceforth as TC-325 - may provide a highly adapted novel
      endoscopic hemostatic therapeutic alternative for this refractory clinical entity, with
      promising uncontrolled observations having just been published by our group(13) and
      others(14).  More robust controlled evaluative data are now needed. We propose to study the
      use of TC-325 in upper and lower malignant GI bleeding compared to contemporary standard of
      care, and more specifically seeks funding for a pilot study to inform a subsequent
      peer-review application for a larger, more definitive randomized clinical trial (RCT).
