  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Phase I, multicenter study is to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics,
      pharmacodynamics and clinical activity of AG-120 in advanced hematologic malignancies that
      harbor an IDH1 mutation. The first portion of the study is a dose escalation phase where
      cohorts of patients will receive ascending oral doses of AG-120 to determine maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) and/or the recommended Phase II dose. The second portion of the study
      is a dose expansion phase where three cohorts of patients will receive AG-120 to further
      evaluate the safety, tolerability, and clinical activity of the MTD. Anticipated time on
      study treatment is until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs.

        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject must be ≥18 years of age.

          -  Subjects must have an advanced hematologic malignancy including: Relapsed and/or
             primary refractory AML as defined by WHO criteria; OR Untreated AML, ≥60 years of age
             and not candidates for standard therapy due to age, performance status, and/or
             adverse risk factors; OR Myelodysplastic syndrome with refractory anemia with excess
             blasts (subtype RAEB-1 or RAEB-2), or considered high-risk by the IPSS-R (Greenberg,
             et al. 2012), that is recurrent or refractory, or the subject is intolerant to
             established therapy known to provide clinical benefit for their condition.

          -  Subjects must have documented IDH1 gene-mutated disease based on local evaluation.

          -  Subjects must be amenable to serial bone marrow biopsies, peripheral blood sampling,
             and urine sampling during the study.
