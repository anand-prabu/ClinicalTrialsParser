The CAR enables the T cell to recognize and\n      kill the leukemic cells though the recognition of CD19, a protein expressed on the surface\n      of the majority of pediatric ALL.  This is a phase I study designed to determine the maximum\n      tolerated dose of the CAR+ T cells and define the toxicity of the treatment.

During the process of cell generation,\n      subjects will continue to be cared for by their primary oncologist and may undergo\n      additional treatment directed at the leukemia during this time.\n\n      After the CAR+ T cells have been generated, the subject undergoes a disease assessment and\n      will be admitted to the hospital to receive 2 days of cyclophosphamide for lymphodepletion\n      and reduction of disease burden.  Several days later, the subject will receive an infusion\n      of the CAR+ T cells.\n\n      Following treatment with the CAR+ T cells, subjects will be intensely followed for 6 weeks\n      with serial blood testing and re-evaluation of disease status with bone marrow aspirates.\n      After 6 weeks, the subjects clinical care will be resumed by their primary oncologist, and\n      it is possible that they would receive additionally chemotherapy or a stem cell transplant.\n\n      Upon completion of the study, subjects will be followed at least annually with a either a\n      medical history, physical exam and blood tests or a phone call/questionnaire for 15 years.\n      This follow up will help to determine if the subject develops any long-term health problems\n      related to the CAR+ T cells including a new cancer."
