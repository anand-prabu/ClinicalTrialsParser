Physical function measured by slow usual gait speed predicts the risk of\n      future falls, disability, institutionalization and mortality. Behavioral physical activity\n      interventions have improved physical activity and physical function, but have not generally\n      been implemented where they may have the most impact  -- primary care settings.  In part,\n      this is due to the limited time and training for clinical staff to screen for physical\n      function impairment and to treat with physical activity counseling.  The proposed scientific\n      goal is to overcome these barriers by adapting an evidence-based screening tool and\n      telephone-based physical activity intervention into primary care settings.\n\n      Aim1: Among older adults who screen positive for physical function impairment, to determine\n      the estimated intervention effect size of a 12-week behavioral intervention on physical\n      activity and physical function.\n\n      Hypothesis 1a:  Physical activity levels will increase more in the intervention vs. usual\n      care group.\n\n      Hypothesis 1b:    Physical function will increase more in the intervention vs. usual care\n      group.\n\n      Aim 2: Among Aim 1 participants and clinical staff who deliver the functional screening and\n      Aim 1 intervention, to evaluate standard implementation science process metrics of reach,\n      acceptability, and implementation"
