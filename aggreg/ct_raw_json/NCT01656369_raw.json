Using electrocautery, the mucosa was stripped to the apex of the prolapse. The muscular layers of the rectal wall were reduced as the mucosa was stripped. Mucosal stripping continued past the apex of the prolapse and then continued inside the prolapsed segment to a point internally that is equivalent to the point of the initial mucosal incision. The underling muscle was plicated by vicryl 2/0.The muscle bite was taken longitudinally from 8 sides to reach a horizontal line of plication at the end. The mucosa was then reanastomosed. Postoperatively, minimal pain medication was required. Early ambulation was encouraged, and patients' diets were advanced as tolerated."
