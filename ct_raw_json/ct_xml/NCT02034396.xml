  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, there is no standard approach for the treatment of patients with venous stasis
      ulcers, and no means of accounting for the genetic factors that may contribute to a
      patient's response to different therapeutic interventions.  In order to determine whether,
      or to what extent, genetic profiling of venous stasis ulcers can stratify patients according
      to their potential for disease progression or healing, and guide preventive strategies and
      levels of therapeutic interventions, the study will involve retrospective genetic profiling
      of patients with a healed or persistent venous stasis ulcer as a means of determining the
      efficacy of current therapies, and to establish a future prospective evaluation of treatment
      algorithms based on genetic phenotype and variation.  Results obtained from the 2
      aforementioned groups of participants will be compared with those of a control group of
      participants who have no history of venous ulcer nor peripheral vascular disease.

      A blood specimen will be drawn, medical and medication history taken, and wound/s will be
      assessed and followed for 2 years in regard to the enrollees w/active venous ulcer/s or
      healed venous ulcer/s.

      A venous duplex ultrasound of right and left lower extremities will be done at no cost, a
      blood specimen will be drawn, and medical and medication history will be taken in regard to
      control group enrollees.
