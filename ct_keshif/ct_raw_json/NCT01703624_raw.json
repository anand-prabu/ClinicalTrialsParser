COPD is a\n      long term and progressive disease of the lungs, generally caused by cigarette smoking, but\n      other factors may be involved. Glycopyrronium bromide (GB) appears to be particularly useful\n      in dilating the constricted airways of such patients, with a duration of action variously\n      described as being between 12 and 24 hours.\n\n      This study will investigate how well tolerated and safe this medication is at a range of\n      doses. It will also help in the selection of a suitable dose for larger and repeat dose\n      studies, based on measures of lung response. It will also help to determine how often the\n      medication should be given; twice daily, or once daily.\n\n      Up to 40 patients will be enrolled into the study, ranging in age from 40 to 75 years of\n      age. Patients will be medically assessed before participation to ensure their suitability.\n      The study will take place in one centre in the UK over five sessions; at each session one\n      dose (2 puffs) of GB or one dose (2 puffs) of placebo will be administered from a simple\n      inhaler device. Neither staff nor patients will know which dose, or if placebo, is being\n      taken. Lung function will be measured for up to 26 hours after the administration of each\n      dose using standard spirometry equipment. Blood samples will be taken over a 24-hour period\n      to check the blood levels of GB. There will be a period of about a week between each dosing\n      session. Patients will be medically reviewed after the study to confirm that no untoward\n      effects are present."
