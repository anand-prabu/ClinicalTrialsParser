Patients will be surveyed with\n      questionnaires (at baseline and 6 months post discharge) and biomarkers (baseline only) to\n      assess the status of their physical function, depression, nutrition, inflammation, and\n      response to antiplatelet therapies. Four - six weeks after hospital discharge: 100\n      randomized patients and their outpatient providers will receive a evaluate the impact of a\n      personalized post-AMI health goal education and reminder tool on patient adherence to\n      evidence-based secondary prevention therapies and long-term clinical outcomes. Data will be\n      analyzed in aggregate using descriptive statistics. The primary endpoint of interest is a\n      composite measure of at six months adherence to secondary prevention therapies described as\n      the sum of measures received divided by the sum of available opportunities. The secondary\n      endpoint will be analyzed to describe platelet response profiles as a function of age. The\n      study team anticipates the risks for this study to be minimal, since the patient does not\n      receive any investigational therapies."
