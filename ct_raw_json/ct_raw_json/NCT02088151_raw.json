            "textblock": "Background\n\n      Laser photocoagulation of the retina targeting the outer layers is an established therapy\n      for proliferative retinopathy and macular edema from diabetic microangiopathy or retinal\n      vein occlusion, centrals serous retinopathy, and extrafoveal subretinal neovascular\n      membranes. However, collateral damage occurs and scotomas can result when using conventional\n      lasers with pulse duration of 100ms and more. This is particularly relevant for laser\n      treatments of the macula where the main therapeutic effect results from stimulation of the\n      retinal pigment epithelium cells and photoreceptor damage is thought to be an unnecessary\n      side effect. Recent experimental research with new laser devices using much shorter pulse\n      duration has shown that photoreceptor damage can be greatly reduced and the retinal pigment\n      epithelium selectively targeted, hence the term selective retinal pigment epithelium laser\n      therapy (SRT). In age-related macular degeneration, regression of drusen has been observed\n      after laser treatment with convention laser or SRT. Investigators hypothesize that SRT is\n      equally effective as standard laser photocoagulation for macular disease but minimizes local\n      visual field defects.\n\n      Objective\n\n      To assess the efficacy of SRT in patients with central serous retinopathy, macular edema\n      from diabetic microangiopathy or branch vein occlusion, and non-exudative age-related\n      macular degeneration. Up to five patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy can\n      optionally be treated with SRT too.\n\n      Methods\n\n      At baseline and during follow-up patients will receive a full ophthalmic examination\n      including optical coherence tomography, fundus autofluorescence imaging, fluorescein\n      angiography (FA), and visual acuity testing. SRT (SRT Vario Laser, Medizinisches\n      Laserzentrum L\u00fcbeck GmbH, Germany) will be delivered under topical anesthesia. For titration\n      of energy spots will first be applied outside the major arcades. Immediately thereafter FA\n      will be performed for extrapolation of the laser dose, since the treatment is sub-threshold\n      and laser spots will not be visible biomicroscopically. The patient will then be treated at\n      the discretion of the ophthalmologist with up to 500 laser burns. One hour after the laser\n      treatment FA will be repeated to confirm the treatment effect. Patients will be assessed 1,\n      3 and 6 months after treatment. Pulse duration can be chosen between 200ns and 2\u03bcs. The\n      maximum pulse energy will be 1mJ. 1-30 pulses will be applied for every laser burn at a\n      frequency of 100Hz."
