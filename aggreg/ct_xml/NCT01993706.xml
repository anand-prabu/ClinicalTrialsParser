      Background:

      - VRC01 is a manmade antibody directed against the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
      Antibodies fight infection. Researchers eventually want to know if VRC01 helps prevent or
      treat HIV infection. In this study they want to know if the study drug is safe if taken in a
      vein or under the skin. Taking VRC01 in this study will not protect against HIV infection.

      Objectives:

      - To see if VRC01 and placebo are safe and well tolerated.

      Eligibility:

      - Healthy adults 18 to 50 years old.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with medical history, physical exam, and lab tests.

        -  Participants will be randomly divided into 4 groups. VRC01 or the placebo will be given
           in weeks 1 and 4. Blood samples will be taken several times after each VRC01 or placebo
           dose.

        -  Three groups will receive VRC01 by needle into a vein with an IV pump. It will take
           about 1 hour and it is done in the hospital.

        -  One group will receive either VRC01 or the placebo by needle into the fatty tissue
           under the skin, usually the belly. It will take up to 20 minutes and it is done in the
           hospital.

        -  Participants will stay in the hospital overnight after receiving the medication and
           have about 14 clinic visits over 4 months. Most clinic visits last about 2 hours.

        -  Participants will keep a symptom diary after receiving the medicatino.

        -  Participants can volunteer to have mouth, rectal, and genital samples taken throughout
           the study.

        -  The study will last 8 months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      VRC 602 is the first study of the VRC-HIVMAB060-00-AB (VRC01) monoclonal antibody (MAb) in
      healthy adults. It is a dose-escalation study to examine safety, tolerability, and
      pharmacokinetics of VRC01. The hypothesis is that VRC01 will be safe for administration to
      healthy adults by the intravenous (IV) and subcutaneous (SC) routes and will not elicit
      hypersensitivity reactions. The SC route evaluation will be placebo-controlled and conducted
      double-blinded to evaluate safety and tolerability of VRC01 and placebo
      (VRC-PLAMAB068-00-AB).

      Healthy adults 18-50 years of age will be enrolled. There are 3 dose escalation groups for
      IV administration and 1 blinded, placebo-controlled group for SC administration. The doses
      are 5 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg, and 40 mg/kg for the IV administration, and 5 mg/kg of VRC01 or
      placebo for the SC administration.

      Each group is expected to include 3-5 participants. Each participant will receive two
      infusions of VRC01 or placebo. The infusions are administered in an inpatient unit and an
      overnight stay at the NIH Clinical Center is required. No more than one subject per day in
      each group will receive the first IV infusion of the study product, and no more than one
      subject per week will receive the first SC administration for the first 6 subjects in Group
      4. For each subject the study participation will last about 16 weeks. Blood and mucosal
      samples will be collected and stored for research purposes.
