During the first 6 months (-6 to 0 months)potential subjects\n      will be on a diet developed by researchers at the University of Kansas Medical Center\n      (KUMC). Subsequent to 6 months, participants who lost 5% weight will begin the weight\n      maintenance phase of the study (0-12 months). Thus the total duration of the study is 18\n      months.\n\n      Approximately 68% of U.S. adults are classified as overweight or obese (BMI >25).\n      Behaviorally based weight loss programs, typically delivered by face-to-face clinics,\n      produce clinically significant reductions in body weight over 3-6 months. However,\n      approximately 50% of those who lose weight regain more than 45-75% of the weight lost within\n      12-30 months. Face-to-face clinics present many barriers and burdens to individuals\n      including scheduling and logistical and financial burdens.\n\n      Virtual Reality (VR) environments allow participants to create virtual representations of\n      themselves called \"avatars\". An existing VR called \"Second Life\" will be used for\n      participants randomized to VR. Participants avatars attend group meetings and use headsets\n      for voice communication to interact with each other.\n\n      Those not randomized to VR will participate in traditional face-to-face group weight loss\n      intervention. The study will examine many different factors to determine if those\n      participants in the Second Life group experience improved weight maintenance."
