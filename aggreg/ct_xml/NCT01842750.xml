  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to test the hypothesis that insertion of an endorectal balloon into a
      patient receiving radical prostate radiotherapy by treatment radiographers is feasible
      without the patient experiencing undue discomfort.  In addition this study will test the
      hypotheses that insertion of the rectal balloon prior to radiotherapy delivery stabilises
      rectal volume during radiotherapy treatment and minimises organ motion within the pelvis.

    <description>The primary aim is to determine whether the balloon insertion is tolerated throughout treatment.  The principle outcome measure is the percentage of patients who tolerate the endorectal balloon throughout treatment.</description>

    <description>Rectal volume stability will be determined by comparing the rectal volume for scans with the endorectal balloon(ERB)in situ to scans without the ERB in situ</description>

    <description>PTV coverage and an assessment of prostate shape and position between the weekly imaging scans  with the balloon in situ will be compared with the position of the prostate and PTV coverage on the original planning scan with the balloon in situ</description>

    <time_frame>patients reviewed across 4 weeks of radiotherapy treatment</time_frame>

    <description>Rectal wall sparing will be assessed by comparing the estimated dose determined from the imaging scans with the ERB in situ and not in situ against the planned dose from the radiotherapy planning scan</description>

    <description>Acute toxicity according to CTCAE v. 4.0.  This will record any reasons why balloon insertion is not possible for review.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years

          -  ECOG performance status 0-2 (Patients with PS-2 as a result of comorbidity  will be
             excluded).

          -  Patients with histologically confirmed diagnosis of prostate adenocarcinoma

          -  Patients who are going to undergo treatment with radical radiotherapy for prostate
             cancer.

          -  Patients must be able to receive and understand verbal and written information
             regarding the study and give written, informed consent

          -  Patients must be able to comply with trial requirements.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must not have a history of previous bowel surgery involving the rectum or
             anus.

          -  Evidence of significant clinical disorder or laboratory finding which, in the opinion
             of the investigator makes it undesirable for the patient to participate in the trial,
             as well as any other serious uncontrolled medical condition.

          -  Any patient with a medical or psychiatric condition that impairs their ability to
             give informed consent

          -  Pre-existing anorectal disease, e.g. Haemorrhoids, active bleeding, anal irritation,
             inflammatory bowel disease.

          -  Patients who are unable to give consent.

          -  Patients in clinical trials of new investigational medicinal products or treatment
             regimens unless there is written, prior agreement that the patient can also consent
             to this study, and that clinical data can also be used for this study.

          -  Prior pelvic radiotherapy
