Up to 32 older adults will be\n      randomized to receive a mindfulness meditation intervention or a time and attention control,\n      both delivered over the internet (16 completers). Participants will have a one-hour session\n      weekly for six weeks with daily home practice between sessions. Participants will complete\n      the sessions online with a study iPad. Their home practice will also be installed on the\n      study iPad as well as an objective adherence monitoring program that the investigators\n      developed to track actual home practice between sessions. The feasibility and acceptability\n      measures are enrollment rate, completion rate, and participant satisfaction. Self-report\n      mood questionnaires and cognitive tasks will be measured before and after the intervention\n      period and data used to conduct power analyses and sample size estimation for a larger\n      clinical trial."
