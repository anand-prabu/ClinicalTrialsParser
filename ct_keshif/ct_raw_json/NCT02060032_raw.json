Atorvastatin (ATV) and Simvastatin (SMV) are\n      specific competitive inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-2-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A reductase. The\n      present study was designed to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of 1.2% ATV, and 1.2%\n      SMV as an adjunct to scaling and root planing (SRP) in the treatment subjects with chronic\n      periodontitis.\n\n      Methods: Ninety six subjects were categorized into three treatment groups: SRP plus 1.2%\n      ATV, SRP plus 1.2% SMV and SRP plus placebo. Clinical parameters; full mouth plaque index\n      (PI), modified sulcus bleeding index (mSBI), probing depth (PD), and relative attachment\n      level (RAL) were recorded at baseline before SRP and at 3, 6 and 9 months. Percentage\n      radiographic defect depth reduction was evaluated using computer-aided software at baseline,\n      6 months and 9 months."
