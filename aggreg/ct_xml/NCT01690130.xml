    <textblock>
      The proposed study will measure the change of cortical excitability during nicotine craving
      and examine the effects of Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) on nicotine
      craving and cue-reactivity among adult regular smokers.

      This pilot protocol proposes to test and further develop TMS for the purpose of studying
      brain function in nicotine users.

      Specific Primary Aims include:

      Aim # 1. To test change of cortical excitability during nicotine craving in cigarette
      smokers and explore the potential use of TMS  in cigarette smokers.

      Aim # 2. Given the role of the prefrontal cortex (and connected regions) in craving, we will
      examine whether modulating prefrontal activity through rTMS will impact measures of craving
      and the reinforcing effects of nicotine.

      Design:

      The study was a randomized, blind, sham-controlled crossover study in which participants
      will involve two study visits. Participants will have an initial assessment about tobacco
      use habits and craving patterns. Participant will look at images related to and not related
      to cigarette smoking.

      Participants will receive two different types of brain stimulation with repetitive TMS (10
      Hz): sham rTMS and active rTMS over prefrontal cortex. Craving assessments will be performed
      before and after each stimulus experiment.

      Participants will be measured cortical excitability with TMS before and after each stimulus
      experiment.

    <description>Seventy highly palatable scenic images, forty neutral control images) and forty cigarette smoking cue images were presented in four blocks. Immediately after viewing each block of cue images, participants completed a 10 question computerized visual analog scale (CVAS) designed to assess craving. Each question is followed by a CVAS (range 0 - 100). After 15 minutes of real or sham rTMS, participants viewed the images again and rated their cravings. At each visit, participants were blind to the rTMS condition (real or sham) and the order was randomized.</description>

    <description>Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a noninvasive (and relatively painless) brain stimulation technology that can focally stimulate the brain of an awake individual.The brain stimulation techniques could theoretically improve the efficacy of smoking cessation. Treatment was standardized at 100% magnetic field intensity relative to the participant's resting MT, at 10 pulses per second (10 Hz) for 5 seconds, with an intertrain interval of 10 seconds. Treatment session lasted for 15 minutes with 3000 pulses.</description>
