The consequences of oral\n      diseases in systemic health are substantial, including increase of inflammatory parameters,\n      alteration of nutrition and increase of cardiovascular risk factors. It has been shown\n      before that several oral diseases can be considered as cardiovascular risk factor in the\n      general population and in diabetic patients through the chronic inflammatory pathway. In CKD\n      patients, the influence of oral diseases on the progression of the chronic kidney disease is\n      not yet established, as most of the studies are focused on stage 5 CKD or dialysis patients.\n      That's why the interactions between dental health and CKD will be evaluated in this\n      population of patients, at different stages of the disease (stages 2 to 5).\n\n      The main objective will be to describe the oral diseases at each stage of CKD. Secondary\n      objectives will be: (1) To evaluate the link between the oral health and the chronic kidney\n      disease stage, the nutritional and inflammatory status; (2) Among patients needing dental\n      treatments, to evaluate after 6 months and 12 months whether dental cares have an influence\n      on nutrition parameters, inflammatory status and CKD; (3) to evaluate the completion of\n      dental treatments after the dental consultation including advises on dental health."

            "textblock": "The consequences of oral and dental diseases in general health are substantial, including\n      acute infectious process starting from teeth or peridontium, benign or malignant diseases\n      starting from mucosa or teeth/peridontium and an overall reduction of nutrition indices and\n      a decrease of quality of life markers. More recently, an augmentation of systemic\n      inflammatory reaction markers has been shown correlated with periodontal diseases, leading\n      to an increase of cardiovascular diseases and/or diabetic risk in those patients. A large\n      panel of oral and dental diseases has been described in patients suffering from chronic\n      kidney disease (CKD) in a terminal stage or dialysis (haemodialysis and peritoneal\n      dialysis). In CKD patients, the influence of oral diseases on the progression of the chronic\n      kidney disease is not established today, as most of the studies are focused on stage 5 CKD\n      or dialysis patients. That's why the interactions between dental health and CKD will be\n      evaluated in these patients, at different stages of the disease (stages 2 to 5). In this\n      study, it is hypothesized that the augmentation of inflammation and the alteration of\n      nutrition due to oral diseases have an impact on the alteration of CKD patients, through the\n      chronic inflammatory pathway. We will evaluate the oral and dental health at Day 0, 6 months\n      and 12 months using several indices: the oral hygiene-simplified index, the community\n      periodontal index in treatment needs index, the decayed missing filled per tooth index, the\n      number of functional teeth index, the oral health impact profile index, the saliva\n      composition, the evaluation of halitosis and a mucosa evaluation. In parallel, an evaluation\n      of the influence of chronic oral diseases on nutrition, inflammation and progression of\n      chronic kidney disease will be done: biological check-up, nutrition intake statement and\n      body mass index."
