The primary objective is to assess, among HNC patients randomized to receive either\n           prophylactic PEG tube or NG tube for enteral support and who are undergoing\n           chemo-radiation at SKMCH&RC, the change from baseline in nutritional status at the end\n           of 24 weeks after treatment initiation.\n\n        2. The secondary objectives are to assess, among HNC patients randomized to receive either\n           prophylactic PEG tube or NG tube for enteral support and who are undergoing\n           chemo-radiation at SKMCH&RC, the change from baseline in nutritional status at the end\n           of 12 weeks; the rates of complications; quality of life including symptoms of\n           depression and anxiety; and cost of care (all related to enteral feeding tube placement\n           only) at baseline and at the end of 12 weeks and 24 weeks after treatment initiation.\n\n      Patients and methods:\n\n      Eligible patients will be enrolled consecutively from the gastroenterology outpatient\n      clinics at Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Research Center (SKMCH&RC), Lahore\n      and randomly assigned to receive either PEG tube or NG tube placement prior to commencement\n      of treatment. Patients will receive counseling from a trained nutritionist regarding\n      adequate nutrition during treatment and enteral feeding tube care. Detailed information\n      regarding demographics, cancer location, type and staging, clinical status, nutritional\n      status, quality of life, mental and emotional health, and cost of care will be obtained at\n      baseline (time at which cancer treatment is initiated) and on 21st day (3 weeks), 42nd day\n      (6 weeks), 84th day (12 weeks) and 168th day (24 weeks) after initiating chemoradiation. The\n      primary endpoint will be to compare the nutritional status between the two treatment groups\n      on an intent-to-treat basis on 168th day (24 weeks) after initiating chemoradiation."
