Despite several\n      results obtained, there is still lack of standardized osteopathic evaluation and treatment\n      procedures for newborns recovered in neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).\n\n      The aim of this research is to provide a guideline on osteopathic approach in treating\n      hospitalized newborns. Specific evaluation tests and treatments have been developed to\n      tailor osteopathic method according to preterm and term infants' needs, NICU environment,\n      medical and paramedical assistance."
