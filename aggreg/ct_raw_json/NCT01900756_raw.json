The study will have 2 Phases - a qualitative phase\n      (Phase 1) lasting less than one year involving development of the intervention through focus\n      group methodologies and structured interviews, and a clinical trial phase (Phase 2)lasting 3\n      years involving a randomized trial testing the efficacy of the intervention."
