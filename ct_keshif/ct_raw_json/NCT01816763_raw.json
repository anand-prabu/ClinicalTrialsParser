            "textblock": "The \"Pain as the Fifth Vital Sign\" Initiative is a prominent feature of the VA's pain\n      strategy. It focuses on current pain intensity by querying patients about \"pain right now.\"\n      In acute care settings (i.e, post-operative), assessment of current pain intensity allows\n      clinicians to provide appropriate and timely analgesia and adjust treatment to achieve\n      effective near-term pain control. In contrast, assessment of current pain intensity may have\n      less relevance in primary care and other outpatient settings where many patients with pain\n      have ongoing pain conditions and where functional impact may have greater clinical\n      significance.\n\n      Pain problems in primary care are diverse, but the chronic conditions, back and\n      osteoarthritis pain, are responsible for most of the burden of pain in primary care and\n      require a long-term management approach. Structured repeated assessment is needed to\n      evaluate the effectiveness of chronic pain management strategies, the benefits of which may\n      accrue over months or years. Discrepancy between the information provided by the current\n      pain screening approach and type of pain assessment information needed in primary care may\n      be an important reason for the limited benefits of pain screening in primary care to date.\n\n      We previously found that pain screening often misses clinically important chronic pain in\n      primary care. Several measures perform better than the 0-10 Numeric Rating Scale, or 'NRS\n      now.' We have validated the three item PEG, derived from the Brief Pain Inventory, as an\n      alternative to the 'NRS now'. A major advantage of the PEG is inclusion of emotional and\n      physical function, as well as pain intensity. Furthermore, adherence to screening process is\n      low, with informal approaches (e.g., \"are you hurting?\") being used in 50% of encounters\n      instead of elicitation of a numeric value. Finally, pain screening does not address\n      dimensions of pain, such as emotional or physical interference, which clinicians often find\n      relevant. These problems illuminate why clinicians don't act on pain, even when it's of\n      moderate-severe intensity.\n\n      Although screening may be improved by a more sensitive measure that includes functional\n      aspects (e.g., the PEG), improving clinician adherence to screening processes is likely to\n      be difficult. Direct patient reports of symptoms offer an alternative screening approach\n      with momentum outside of VA due to the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information\n      System (PROMIS) effort; underscoring the need to compare PRO vs. clinician assessment\n      directly. An empiric study can also consider clinicians' views of how to link a new\n      screening approach to management and formatively evaluate other implementation challenges\n      (e.g., kiosk throughput. Results can prospectively inform improvement to the VA's '5th vital\n      sign'. The ESP Project will test a new, better measure of pain using a computer kiosk,\n      evaluate that measure versus what is in use now (e.g. 5th Vital Sign) and consider the\n      barrier to implementing and using the new measure widely."
