            "textblock": "Maternal depression is a pervasive problem that disproportionately affects low-income\n      mothers. The effects of depression on mothers and their parenting result in many negative\n      outcomes for children, particularly in terms of school readiness. The proposed research will\n      build on a successful partnership between the University of Southern California School of\n      Social Work (USC) and Children's Institute, Inc. (CII) to implement and evaluate an\n      evidence-based intervention, interpersonal psychotherapy for group  (IPT-G), for Head Start\n      mothers with depression or dysphoric mood with the goal of reducing their depression and\n      promoting positive changes for both mothers and children. The objectives of the study are:\n      (1) adapt IPT-G for a Head Start population of mothers with depression; (2) implement IPT-G\n      via a randomized controlled trial in Head Start centers in Los Angeles County operated by\n      CII; (3) evaluate the effects of the intervention on maternal depression, parenting\n      behaviors, goal-directed behavior, interpersonal relationships, physical health, and child\n      behavior and school readiness; and (4) develop a manual for use of the intervention in Head\n      Start and disseminate findings nationally. The study will feature 2 groups of 60 mothers\n      each, randomized by Head Start site; one will receive the intervention and the other\n      services as usual. Outcomes for both mothers and children will be tracked for 2 years after\n      the intervention, allowing for the evaluation of short- and long-term effects. The\n      intervention will be delivered by Head Start mental health workers under the supervision of\n      Scott Stuart, a national trainer of the intervention. This intervention has the potential to\n      be a low-cost, high-impact intervention that can be replicated to other Head Start sites\n      across the country to improve the lives of Head Start children and families."
