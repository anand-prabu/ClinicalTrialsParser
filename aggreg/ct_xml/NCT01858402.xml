  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We conducted a prospective, randomized double-blind study to compare the effectiveness of
      intravenous paracetamol and dipyrone for preventing pain during early postoperative period
      in school-age children undergoing lower abdominal surgery with spinal anesthesia.

      The intensity of postoperative pain was assessed using a visual analog scale (VAS) (0
      represented no pain and 10 the worst pain ever experienced) at 15, 30, 60th minutes, and
      2nd, 4th, 6th hours postoperatively.
