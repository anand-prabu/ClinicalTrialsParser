  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed to investigate the effect of low intensity cathodal direct current on the
      release of plasma vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and nitric oxide (NO) in
      diabetic foot ulceration.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Twenty type 2 diabetic patients with foot ulceration and 13 age-matched healthy subjects
      were enrolled. Patients were randomly assigned to electrical stimulation (ES, n=10) or sham
      ES (placebo, n=10) groups. ES group received cathodal direct current for 1 h/day, 3
      days/week, for 4 weeks (12 sessions). Blood sample was collected for VEGF and NO measurement
      in the first and last treatment sessions before and after intervention. Wound surface area
      (WSA) and skin temperature were measured at 1st, 6th, and 12th session.
