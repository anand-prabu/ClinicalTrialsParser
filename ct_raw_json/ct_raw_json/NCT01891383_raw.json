Investigators will compare\n      the characteristics of dementia in those who have had a prior TBI to the characteristics in\n      those without a history of TBI.  It is our hypothesis that the dementia or MCI among those\n      with prior TBI has distinct neuropsychological features that distinguishes it from those\n      with dementia or MCI without a history of TBI."
