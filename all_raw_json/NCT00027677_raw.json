Treatment repeats every 14 days in the absence of\n      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 1-3 patients receive escalating doses of halofuginone hydrobromide until the\n      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which 20% of\n      patients experience acute dose-limiting toxicity. After the MTD is reached, 6-12 additional\n      patients are treated at dose levels preceding the MTD until the recommended dose for phase\n      II study is determined. The recommended dose for phase II study is defined as the dose\n      preceding the MTD that allows a 90% dose intensity for 2 months with no greater than grade 2\n      toxicity in 80% of the patients.\n\n      Patients are followed every 8 weeks until disease progression or initiation of another\n      treatment.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 7-40 patients will be accrued for this study."
