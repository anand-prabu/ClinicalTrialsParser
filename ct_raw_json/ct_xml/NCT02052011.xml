    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of Ranolazine for the treatment
      chest pain from disease of small vessels of the heart also known as 'microvascular angina'.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Yale Chest Pain Center (CPC) is a unique clinical lab that provides an integrated
      interdisciplinary research team, access to high volume of chest pain patients largely free
      of coronary disease (93%) as well state of the art diagnostics including cardiac PET and a
      sophisticated system for serum processing and banking facilities. The CPC cohort represents
      a unique population with unrecognized microvascular disease and is often only accessible
      through the ED. We propose a one-year pilot study to understand the mechanisms of angina
      relief by Ranolazine (n=20) in patients with microvessel disease in the ED population as
      compared to controls (n=10) at baseline and at 1-month. In addition, changes in pain scores
      and function as measured by Seattle Angina Questionnaire (SAQ), recidivism and costs will be
      measured and correlated with changes in coronary flow reserve (CFR). Serum samples will be
      obtained and banked for future marker analysis as intermediate surrogates of outcomes.

      Primary aim: To compare changes in coronary flow reserve as measured by cardiac PET in
      patients receiving Ranolazine versus controls.

      Secondary aim: To determine if Ranolazine changes Seattle Angina Questionnaire (SAQ) scores
      in association with changes in Coronary Flow Reserve (CFR) versus controls.

      Exploratory aim: To compare composite rate of return visits (office, emergency department
      and hospitalization) for chest pain within 4-weeks of enrollment between patients with and
      without Ranolazine.
