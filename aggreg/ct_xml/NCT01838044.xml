  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if treatment with celecoxib and pregabalin
      together would prove to be more effective in relief of pain than treatment with celecoxib
      alone in people who have chronic low back pain with a probable neuropathic component.

Total score 0 to 21 for each subscale; higher score indicates greater severity of anxiety and depression symptoms.</description>

    <description>BPI-sf is an 11-item self-report questionnaire that is designed to assess the severity and impact of pain on daily functions. BPI-sf are 4 questions that assess pain intensity (worst, least, average, right now) and 7 questions that assess impact of pain on daily functions (general activity, mood, walking ability, normal work, relations with other people, sleep, enjoyment of life). Each question is answered on a scale ranging from 0 to 10; '0=No pain and 10=Pain as bad as you can imagine'. Measure can be scored by item, with lower scores being indicative of less pain or pain interference.</description>

    <description>Participant-rated questionnaire to assess key constructs of sleep over the past week. Sleep Problems Index II (SPI-II) consists of a 12-item based on 7 subscales: sleep disturbance, snoring, awakened short of breath or with headache, sleep adequacy, and somnolence (range:0-100); sleep quantity (range:0-24), and optimal sleep (yes: 1, no: 0). Six (6) and 9 item index measures of sleep disturbance were constructed to provide composite scores. Scores are transformed (actual raw score minus lowest possible score divided by possible raw score range * 100); total score range: 0 to 100; higher score = greater intensity of attribute.</description>

             back pain with a neuropathic component.

             years.

          -  Patients with neurologic disorders unrelated to low back pain that may confuse or
             confound the assessment of neuropathic pain (eg, primary or secondary nerve
             diseases).

          -  Patients who have participated in any previous clinical trial for pregabalin or have
             participated in 2 or more previous clinical trials for pain related to chronic low
             back pain.
