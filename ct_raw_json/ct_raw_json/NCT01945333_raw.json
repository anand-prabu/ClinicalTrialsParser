            "textblock": "There are three phases of this study.\n\n      Phase 1: Development and Adaptation. The goal of this phase is to adapt currently used\n      computer based CR approaches to make them more personalized and scalable. We will create two\n      CR interventions which differ in choice and pacing of the cognitive exercises.\n\n      Phase 2: Open Trial and Intervention Refinement. The goal of this phase is to obtain\n      quantitative and qualitative feedback on the acceptability and usability of the\n      interventions from participants to inform further refinement of the assessment and treatment\n      packages. We will recruit ten subjects from an outpatient psychiatric rehabilitation program\n      in New York City. After determining study eligibility, individuals will complete a\n      standardized neuropsychological battery for schizophrenia assessment, and a 5-minute Tone\n      Matching Test to assess basic auditory processing. Participants will be randomly assigned to\n      receive one of two intervention packages, developed in Phase 1. Each session includes 60\n      minutes of computer-based learning activities and a 15 minute therapist-led discussion that\n      links the computer activities to cognition as applied to daily tasks and recovery goals.\n      Participants will complete a total of 10 sessions attending 2-3 times weekly for 5 weeks.\n      During each session, participants will be asked to keep a log of software used. At the\n      conclusion of this abbreviated trial, the participants will participate in focus groups in\n      which they will be asked to provide verbal feedback on how enjoyable, engaging, and useful\n      they perceived the computer and discussion based exercises to be. Participants will be asked\n      to provide verbal feedback on the assessment procedures. CR clinicians will join the\n      research team to discuss participants' engagement and their experience with administering\n      the Tone Matching Test and interventions. Qualitative data summarized from participant logs\n      and focus groups will be considered by the research team to refine the assessment battery,\n      treatment parameters, and rubric of learning exercises.\n\n      Phase 3: Pilot Feasibility Trial. People with a diagnosis of schizophrenia or\n      schizoaffective disorder may be referred by their treating clinician or may respond to\n      posted advertisements to inquire about study participation. After being informed of study\n      procedures, interested individuals will be asked to sign a consent form that documents\n      willingness to participate in this study. Following informed consent, participants will be\n      asked questions about demographic characteristics (e.g. age, education, employment),\n      medication and psychosocial treatment status, psychiatric symptoms and symptoms severity,\n      and will complete a brief assessment of estimated IQ. Those with an IQ estimate below 70 or\n      meeting substance dependence criteria at the time of evaluation will be exited from the\n      study.  In the same or second assessment session, participants will complete assessments of\n      neuropsychological ability, current functioning, and motivation for treatment. Participants\n      will then be randomly assigned to one of two treatment conditions named \"Brain Basics\" or\n      \"Brain Exercises\".\n\n      Each treatment condition is structured in a group format of up to 5 participants. Both\n      treatments use commercially available computer-based training software to exercise cognitive\n      skills such as speed of processing, attention, working memory, and verbal memory. Both\n      conditions will entail 60 minutes on the computer and 15 minutes group discussion. In the\n      discussion, participants review the cognitive activities they are working on and how they\n      will help them achieve their recovery goals. The treatment phase will consist of 30 separate\n      sessions each 75 minutes in duration, administered 3 times a week over the course of a\n      10-week period. Participants will be re-tested on outcome measures approximately 1 week\n      following end of treatment, and again 3 months later."
