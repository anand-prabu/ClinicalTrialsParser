    <textblock>
      The aim of this observational study was to describe usual practices in lymphedema management
      in France.

      It was the opportunity to assess the effects of these practices on lymphedema volume in a
      large number of patients, to identify predictive factors of response, and to assess the
      safety of this therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lymphoedema is commonly treated according a strategy called Complex Decongestive Therapy
      (CDT). This CDT is usually composed of 2 different treatment phases. The first phase is an
      acute phase which aim is to reduce affected limb volume. The second phase is a maintenance
      phase which aim is to maintain as long as possible the volume reduction acheived during the
      first phase.

      These 2 phases required multi modal parameters such as bandages, lymphatic drainages,
      physical exercises...and can be managed very differently from one site to another.
