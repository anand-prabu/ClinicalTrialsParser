It is characterized by a triad of symptoms involving\n      attention deficit, hyperactivity and impulsivity and having an impact on the functioning of\n      the subject especially in terms of learning.\n\n      Currently, main interventions to treat ADHD in children are stimulant medication or\n      supportive psychotherapy. Data from recent studies highlight the use of stimulant drugs\n      (amphetamine derivatives such as methylphenidate) to treat the core symptoms of ADHD\n      children. These drugs are generally effective but their nature (psychostimulants) and\n      adverse effects they cause (appetite suppression, sleep disturbances, headaches, motor tics,\n      abdominal pain, irritability, nausea and fatigue) encourage the development of new\n      therapeutic approaches. The use of supportive psychotherapy alone would have limited effect\n      on symptoms of children with ADHD. Our aim is to test the use a cognitive remediation\n      program using a virtual classroom in children suffering from ADHD."

            "textblock": "Virtual reality offers the possibility to develop environments approaching situations of\n      daily life that can be used to target evaluation but also for therapeutic purposes. As the\n      school classroom is a daily life situation for children, Rizzo team has developed a virtual\n      classroom software (Rizzo et al., 2006). This virtual classroom is a tool for the diagnosis\n      of ADHD based on the exploration of attention deficit (distractibility, sustained attention\n      ...), impulsivity and hyperactivity. On the other hand, the playfulness of the application\n      helps the child to \"forget\" quickly that he is placed in a test situation.\n\n      In the virtual classroom, the requested task is a letter detection task. The subject had to\n      click on the mouse only when he sees the letter \"K\" preceded by the letter \"A\" appearing.\n      The child had to perform this task, while the disruptive elements are distracting. These may\n      be auditory (the bell ringing), visual (a paper airplane flying in the class) or visual and\n      auditory distractors (the sound of the teacher who is moving).\n\n      Cognitive remediation using virtual reality is an innovative approach in the care of\n      children. We want to examine whether a cognitive remediation program based on the virtual\n      classroom software can be a therapeutic tool for children suffering from ADHD.\n\n      In our study, cognitive remediation will be accomplished through cognitive intervention such\n      as a \"training\" of attentional and executive functions (such as planning, working memory,\n      selective attention, ...). The cognitive remediation sessions will include the execution of\n      the virtual classroom protocol, a stage of metacognition and again the virtual classroom\n      assessment. Our remediation program will include 12 sessions (twice a week for 6 to 8\n      consecutive weeks), lasting 30 minutes each. The effects of cognitive remediation will be\n      compared to the effects of two other major interventions usually proposed: drug treatment\n      with methylphenidate and supportive psychotherapy. 60 ADHD children aged 7 to 11 years will\n      participate in our study, 20 in each treatment group (drug treatment vs. cognitive\n      remediation vs. supportive psychotherapy).\n\n      We expect that cognitive remediation and drug treatment improve attentional abilities of\n      children with ADHD."
