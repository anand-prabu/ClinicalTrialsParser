            "textblock": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in elderly subjects. AD is\n      characterized by brain lesions like extracellular deposits of \u00df-amylo\u00efd proteins in senile\n      plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles of hyper-phosphorylated tau protein, both\n      of which are associated with the loss of neurons. The development of disease biomarkers for\n      AD (Tau, PhTau and \u03b2amyloid dosing in the cerebrospinal fluid, brain MRI, amyloid PET\n      imaging and fluorodeoxyglucose PET imaging) to identify the pathophysiological processes\n      underlying cognitive impairment biomarkers, have been  incorporated into revised diagnosis\n      guidelines.\n\n      Post-mortem human AD and AD animal model studies have reported inflammatory processes also\n      implicated in the neuropathology of AD, and upregulated levels of pro-inflammatory\n      cytokines.\n\n      In vivo visualization of microglial activation has become possible with the development of\n      molecular imaging ligands (tracers) for use with positron emission tomography (PET). The\n      translocator protein (TSPO) formerly known as the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR),\n      a receptor located in the outer membrane of mitochondria, is upregulated during\n      neuroinflammation. So targeting TSPO with radiolabeled ligands for PET is considered as an\n      attractive biomarker for neuroinflammation.\n\n      The main aim of this pilot study is to quantify neuroinflammation, in terms of fixation and\n      distribution of   [18F] DPA-714(Binding Potential BP), and to study its relationship with\n      amyloid load, measured with in [18F]AV-45 (Standard Uptake Values ratio) in cognitive\n      decline."
