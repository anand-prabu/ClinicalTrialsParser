  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate the effect of auricular autonomous nervous
      system stimulation on cardiovascular parameters and sympathovagal balance in healthy
      subjects. It is investigated if auricular vagal nerve stimulation affects heart rate
      variability as well as peripheral local blood perfusion, and if this effect depends on the
      site of stimulation in the auricle, whereas four distinct stimulation points are tested.

    <description>Study participants (healthy) are treated with auricular vagus nerve stimulation using five needle electrodes connected to an electrical stimulation device (PrimeStim). After acclimatization the stimulation is turned on for 20 minutes followed by 20 minutes of paused stimulation, 20 minutes of stimulation, and 10 minutes paused stimulation. This intervention is repeated on four consecutive days, whereas at each intervention only one of the four stimulation points (and one fixed reference point) is stimulated. Needle electrodes are applied at each study visit.
Stimulation points in the auricle are stimulated in random order. One stimulation pattern is tested. Stimulation amplitudes are adjusted with respect to a distinct but comfortable sensation at the auricle.
During the described protocol various biosignals are continuously recorded, including ECG, respiration, blood perfusion, oxygen saturation, transcutaneous oxygen tension, blood pressure and skin temperature.</description>
