  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We wish to develop a protocol for PET/CT examination of humans using the bile acid tracer
      11C-Cholylsarcosin. This is done by a series of PET/CT examinations of health humans and
      patients with cholestatic disorders.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is the development of PET/CT protocols using 11C-CSar for human
      use. PET/CT methods developed in the pig studies are translated to studies in healthy humans
      and patients with cholestatic disorders. Dynamic PET/CT scans of the liver and biliary
      system are combined with measurements of tracer concentrations in a radial artery and a
      liver vein and measurements of hepatic blood flow by intravenous infusion of indocyanine
      green (ICG)/Ficks principle. Kinetic parameters from PET/CT measurements and invasive
      measurements are compared for validation of the PET estimated parameters and refinement of
      the PET modeling, if required. Based on these invasive studies, a protocol without liver
      vein catheterization is develop for subsequent clinical applications.

    <description>We will assess if 11C-CSar PET/CT studies can quantify the rate constants for the transport of 11C-CSar from blood-to-hepatocytes and from hepatocytes-to-bile - as expected from the pig studies (Frisch et al 2011) and in on-going pig studies</description>
