  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of weight loss rate on liver
      steatosis, steatohepatitis and fibrosis at different stages before and after bariatric
      surgery. In addition, the investigators would like to study the effect of low carbohydrate
      diet given for a month before bariatric surgery on liver steatosis. The investigators also
      aim to study the short-term effect of bariatric surgery on gastric cholecystokinin levels
      before and 10 days after the bariatric surgery.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline liver steatosis, steatohepatitis and fibrosis at different stages after bariatric surgery, measured by non-invasive measurements as described below.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline is defined as three weeks to one month before surgery. Different stages to compare to baseline are as following: 8-12 days and 6, 12, 24 and 48 weeks after surgery.</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Measurements to be performed to assess liver disease stage at baseline and at 8-12 days and 6, 12, 24 and 48 weeks after surgery:
Blood tests of liver functions (Alanine transaminase, Aspartate transaminase, Alkaline Phosphatase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, ferritin, prothrombin-time (PT), international normalized ratio (INR), Total/Direct Bilirubin, Albumin, uric acid), lipids profile (total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL, LDL) and diabetes biomarkers (insulin, glucose, HbA1c).
Blood tests of adiponectin and tumor necrosis factor (only at baseline and at 12, 24 and 48 weeks after surgery).
Fibroscan test for quantifying liver fibrosis by means of elastography (only at baseline and at 24 and 48 weeks after surgery).
A blood test (FibroMax) for determining the stage and grade of liver damage (only at baseline and at 12, 24 and 48 weeks after surgery).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of liver steatosis following a low carbohydrates diet at time of surgery compared to baseline.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline is defined as three weeks to one month before surgery. Change will be assessed 1-2 days before surgery.</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>A low carbohydrates diet will be given for 3 weeks to a month prior surgery  day.
Change will be assessed by the following measurements 3 weeks to a month before surgery and at 1-2 days before surgery:
Blood tests of liver functions (Alanine transaminase, Aspartate transaminase, Alkaline Phosphatase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, ferritin, PT, INR, Total/Direct Bilirubin, Albumin, uric acid), lipids profile (total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL, LDL) and diabetes biomarkers (glucose, HbA1c).
A blood test for determining the stage and grade of liver damage (FibroMax).
An intraoperative liver biopsy (on surgery day only).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in cholecystokinin levels before and after the surgery.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline levels of cholecystokinin at 1-2 days before surgery compared to 8-12 days after surgery.</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>In addition, gastric cholecystokinin levels will be measured from the removed stomach tissue.</description>
