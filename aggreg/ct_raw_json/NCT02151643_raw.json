Data from a large\n      international practice pattern study suggest that approximately 50% of all dialysis subjects\n      have serum phosphate above the recommended target value of 5.5 mg/dL The standard of care\n      for phosphate control remains the prescription of phosphate binders with meals. These drugs\n      act in the small intestine to bind phosphate and prevent its absorption into the\n      bloodstream. The 2 general categories of phosphate binders currently commercially available\n      include calcium containing phosphate binders (calcium carbonate and calcium acetate) and the\n      non calcium containing phosphate binders (sevelamer carbonate and lanthanum carbonate While\n      these 2 classes of phosphate binders have similar efficacy, they differ substantially in\n      their associated side effects."
