Combining chemotherapy with peripheral stem cell\n      transplantation may allow the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill\n      more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation\n      work in treating patients with stage IIIB breast cancer."

Filgrastim (G-CSF) is\n      administered on days 5-10, 20-25, 33-38, 48-55, and 61-68, and beyond if the granulocyte\n      count is less than 1000/mm^3. A modified radical mastectomy is performed between days 70 and\n      80. All stratum 1 and stratum 2 patients then receive paclitaxel IV for 96 hours on days\n      100-104, and cyclophosphamide IV on day 121. Filgrastim is administered at one dose on days\n      105-110 and days 122-127 and at a higher dose on days 110-116 and days 128-135. Stem cells\n      are harvested from the patient on days 113-116 and days 132-135.\n\n      High-dose chemotherapy is then administered to all patients in the study. Course 1 starts\n      with doxorubicin IV on days -7 to -3. Paclitaxel IV is administered for 24 hours on day -2.\n      Filgrastim is administered by IV on day -1 and continued until the granulocyte count is\n      greater than 1000/mm^3 for 3 days. Peripheral stem cells are reinfused on day 0. Course 2\n      starts 4-6 weeks after the start of course 1 with melphalan and cisplatin being infused on\n      day -11. Filgrastim is administered IV on days -10 to -6. Melphalan and cisplatin are\n      administered again on day -4. Stem cells are infused on day -3 and on day 0. Filgrastim is\n      then administered until the granulocyte count is at least 1000/mm^3 for 3 days.\n\n      Radiation therapy is started 4-7 weeks after the beginning of course 2. Tamoxifen is started\n      within 2 weeks of discharge following course 2 in patients with hormone receptor positive\n      tumors.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for two years and then annually for the next three\n      years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 60 patients will be accrued, at a rate of about 15 per\n      year."
