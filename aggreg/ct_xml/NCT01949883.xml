    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adults (aged ≥ 18 years)

          -  Histologically confirmed diagnosis of a non-Hodgkin or Hodgkin lymphoma that has
             progressed in spite of prior treatment, and for which additional effective standard
             therapy is not available

          -  Patients may have either measurable or non-measurable disease, but in all cases
             eligible patients must have disease that can be clinically evaluated for improvement
             or progression

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤2

          -  Adequate hematological, renal, hepatic, and coagulation laboratory assessments

          -  Written informed consent to participate in this study before the performance of any
             study-related procedure

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  A primary lymphoma of the central nervous system (CNS) or known lymphomatous
             involvement of the CNS.  CNS imaging and cerebrospinal fluid sampling are not
             mandatory in the absence of a clinical suspicion of lymphomatous involvement of the
             CNS.

          -  Current infection with HIV, Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C. Patients will have serologic
             testing performed during screening for HIV and Hepatitis B and C.  Any serologic
             results suggestive of an ongoing viral infection will be further investigated as
             necessary to clarify the patient's status.

          -  Impairment of gastrointestinal (GI) function or GI disease that may significantly
             alter the absorption of CPI-0610, including any unresolved nausea, vomiting, or
             diarrhea that is CTCAE grade &gt;1.

          -  Impaired cardiac function or clinically significant cardiac diseases, including any
             of the following:

               -  Acute myocardial infarction or angina pectoris ≤ 6 months prior to starting
                  study drug

               -  Serum cardiac troponin (cTn) level ≥ 99% percentile of the upper reference limit

               -  QTcF &gt; 470 msec on the screening ECG

               -  Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt; 40%

          -  Uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia (patients with rate-controlled atrial fibrillation
             are not excluded.)

          -  Any other concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled concomitant medical condition that
             could compromise participation in the study (e.g., clinically significant pulmonary
             disease, clinically significant neurological disorder, active or uncontrolled
             infection)

          -  Systemic anti-cancer treatment or radiotherapy less than 2 weeks before the first
             dose of CPI-0610

          -  Radioimmunotherapy (e.g., 131I-tositumomab, 90Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan) less than 6
             weeks before the first dose of CPI-0610

          -  Treatment with an investigational small molecule less than 2 weeks before the first
             dose of CPI-0610.  In addition, the first dose of CPI-0610 should not occur before a
             period equal to or greater than 5 half-lives of the small molecule investigational
             agent has elapsed.

          -  Treatment with a therapeutic antibody less than 4 weeks before the first dose of
             CPI-0610.  A minimum 2-week period between the last treatment with a therapeutic
             antibody and the first dose of CPI-0610 may be permitted in patients with rapidly
             progressive or aggressive subtypes of lymphoma following discussion with the medical
             monitor.

          -  Treatment with medications that are known to be strong inhibitors or inducers of
             CYP450 enzymes.

          -  Treatment with medications that are known to carry a risk of Torsades de Pointes.

          -  Immunosuppressive treatment that cannot be discontinued both prior to study entry and
             for the duration of the study. Oral prednisone at a dose of 10 mg or less per day is
             allowed, as are other oral corticosteroids given at glucocorticoid-equivalent doses.
             Topical, nasal and inhaled corticosteroids are also allowed.

          -  Pregnant or lactating women

          -  Women of child-bearing potential and men with reproductive potential, if they are
             unwilling to use adequate contraception while on study therapy and for 3 months
             thereafter

          -  Patients unwilling or unable to comply with this study protocol
