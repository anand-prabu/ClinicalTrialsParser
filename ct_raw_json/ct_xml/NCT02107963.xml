      Background

      GD2 is a well-characterized tumor antigen in neuroblastoma, which is also expressed on
      osteosarcomas and some other sarcomas. T cells expressing 1st generation anti-GD2 chimeric
      antigen receptors (CARs) were safe and mediated modest antitumor activity in some patients
      with refractory neuroblastoma.

      A 3rd generation anti-GD2-CAR (GD2-CAR.OX40.28.z.ICD9) has been produced and holds promise
      for increased activity compared to the 1st generation GD2-CAR already studied in clinical
      trials. As an added safety measure, the vector includes a suicide switch comprising a
      caspase dimerization domain (ICD9) that can be activated by a small molecule to induce death
      of the genetically engineered cells if they were induce untoward toxicity.

      Objectives

      Primary: Determine the feasibility of producing anti GD2-CAR cells meeting the established
      release criteria and to assess the safety of administering escalating doses of anti-GD2-CAR
      engineered T cells in children and young adults with non-neuroblastoma, GD2+ solid tumors
      following cyclophosphamide-based lymphodepletion.

      Secondary:

      1) Determine if administration anti-GD2-CAR engineered T cells mediate antitumor effects in
      children and young adults with GD2+ solid tumors; 2) Measure persistence of adoptively
      transferred anti-GD2-CAR T cells and correlate this with antitumor effects; 3) Extend
      information regarding the prevalence and intensity of GD2 expression in non-neuroblastoma,
      non-osteosarcoma solid tumors in children and young adults; 4) If unacceptable toxicity
      occurs that is possibly, probably or likely related to anti-GD2-CAR T cells, assess the
      capacity for AP1903, a dimerizing agent, to mediate clearance of the genetically engineered
      cells and resolve toxicity; and 5) Assess toxicity of AP1903 if administered to mediate
      clearance of anti-GD2-CAR T cells.

      Eligibility

      Patients 1-35 years of age, at least 15 kg, with osteosarcoma or a GD2+ solid tumor
      (excluding neuroblastoma) that has recurred after or not responded to standard theapy and is
      deemed incurable by standard therapy.

      Design

      After apheresis to collect T cells for transduction, patients receive cyclophosphamide
      1800mg/m(2)/d as a lymphodepleting regimen. A phase I cell dose escalation scheme will used
      at 4 dose levels (1 x 10(5) transduced T cells/kg; 1 x 10(6) transduced T cells/kg; 3 x
      10(6) transduced T cells/kg; and 1 x 10(7) transduced T cells/kg), using a standard 3 plus 3
      dose escalation design. An expanded group of a total of 12 patients will be treated at the
      highest dose, comprising at least 6 osteosarcoma patients.

      Patients will be monitored for toxicity, antitumor effects and persistence of anti-GD2-CAR T
      cells.

      Patients with a PR, SD may receive a 2nd cycle at the next higher dose level a minimum of 28
      days following completion of the first cycle if eligibility criteria are met.

      A maximum of 36 patients may be treated on this study. Given that there is likelihood that
      some patients with non-osteosarcoma will not meet the criteria for GD2 expression to be
      eligible for enrollment, up to 72 subjects will be screened to enroll a maximum of 36
      patients for treatment. Up to 2-3 patients will be accrued per month, and therefore this
      study may require up to 2-3 years to complete enrollment and treatment.

                  (a) Osteosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma (embryonal or alveolar), Ewing Sarcoma family
                  of tumors, and melanoma that have been treated with standard frontline therapy
                  and are judged to be incurable with standard therapy, based upon the fact that
                  they are unresectable, metastatic, progressive/persistent or recurrent.

                  Evaluable disease must be present.

                  i) For all histologies except osteosarcoma, pathologic review of frozen tissue

                  14G2a. If adequate archived frozen tissue is available, this may be utilized, or
                  if not, patients may undergo biopsy following enrollment to obtain tissue to
                  assess GD2 expression, with the following restrictions.

                  ii) Patients with histologies other than osteosarcoma must have adequate
                  accessible tumor for biopsy (at least 1 cm diameter).

                  iii) Procedures employed to acquire biopsies for tumor lysates will be limited
                  to percutaneous needle or core biopsies, thoracoscopic excision or open biopsies
                  of readily accessible lesions. Pulmonary lesions may be biopsied but extensive
                  surgery such as thoracotomy or laparotomy should not be employed.

                  iv) Patients who will require biopsy should not be enrolled if in the opinion of
                  the principal investigator, the tumor site places the patient at substantial
                  risk from the biopsy procedure.

                    3. Myelosuppressive chemotherapy: Patients must not have received
                       myelosuppressive chemotherapy within 3 weeks of enrollment (6 weeks if
                       prior nitrosourea).

                    4. Hematopoietic growth factors: At least 7 days must have elapsed since the
                       completion of therapy with a growth factor. At least 14 days must have

                  enzyme elevation is due to tumor involvement. (Gilbert   s syndrome is found in
                  3-10% of the general population, and is characterized by mild, chronic
                  unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia in the absence of liver disease or overt
                  hemolysis). NOTE: Adult values will be used for calculating hepatic toxicity and
                  determining eligibility, as is standard on POB phase I trials.

        childbearing potential.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Concurrent Illnesses

             Clinically significant systemic illness (e.g. serious active infections or
             significant cardiac, pulmonary, hepatic or other organ dysfunction), that in the
             judgment of the PI would compromise the patient   s ability to tolerate protocol
             therapy or significantly increase the risk of complications.

             Peripheral nerve symptoms from prior therapies or from tumor compression &gt;  grade 1.

          2. Untreated CNS metastasis

             Extradural masses that have not invaded the brain parenchyma or parameningeal tumors

             at least 6 weeks following completion of therapy are eligible.

          3. Prior Therapy

             Previous treatment with genetically engineered GD2-CAR T cells. Previous vaccine
             therapy, anti-GD2 mAb therapy or therapy with other genetically engineered T cells is
             not an exclusion criteria.

          4. Lactating or pregnant females (due to risk to fetus or newborn).

          5. Active HIV, HBV or HCV infection.
