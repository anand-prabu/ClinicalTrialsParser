  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.  Eligible subjects will be
      randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive GEN-004 with adjuvant or placebo.  Each subject will
      receive up to 3 doses at 4 week intervals.

      Following the third dose, subjects will be inoculated intranasally with S. pneumoniae
      serotype 6B.  Nasal washes to identify S. pneumoniae colonization will be obtained
      pre-inoculation, and then 2, 7 and 14 days after inoculation.

      Subjects will also be monitored for safety and tolerability throughout the dosing  period,
      and then for 12 months after their last dose.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of GEN-003 in reducing
      colonization rates and magnitude of colonization following the S. pneumoniae challenge.

    <description>The primary objectives of this study are to evaluate the efficacy of GEN-004 with aluminum hydroxide in healthy adult subjects to reduce nasopharyngeal colonization following intranasal inoculation with S. pneumoniae serotype 6B and to evaluate the impact of GEN-004 on the magnitude of colonization as measured by S. pneumoniae CFUs post-inoculation.</description>

    <description>GEN-004: 100 µg of each antigen, with adjuvant, 350 µg aluminum hydroxide, administered as a 0.5 mL intramuscular (IM) injection.
GEN-004 is a recombinant S. pneumoniae protein subunit vaccine consisting of 3 recombinant T cell antigens:
GB104: ABC transporter, substrate-binding protein
GB144: Maltose/maltodextrin binding protein, ABC transporter
GB152: Hypothetical protein GEN-004 is filled in 2 mL vials containing 0.5 mL (350 µg/mL of each antigen).
Aluminum hydroxide adjuvant is filled in 2 mL vials containing 1 mL at a concentration of 5 mg/mL.</description>

          -  Fluent English speakers only (for safety reasons)

          -  Willing to perform and comply with all study procedures including attending clinic
             visits as scheduled.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior vaccination with pneumococcal vaccine.

             would make the subject unsuitable for the study or unable to comply with the study
             requirements.

        NOTE:  Subjects who are taking a medication to control an underlying co-morbidity may be
        enrolled if there have been no changes to their medication within 60 days prior to first
        dose of Study Drug.
