            "textblock": "BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n\n      There are conflicting reports on the effectiveness of nutritional antioxidants in preventing\n      or slowing the growth of age related cataracts, despite extensive laboratory evidence\n      suggesting that oxidative damage to lens epithelial cells is a common underlying etiologic\n      factor in cataractogenesis. One reported review of nine clinical trials involving over\n      117,000 patients suggested that beta-carotene, Vitamin E, and Vitamin C had no effect in\n      preventing or slowing the progression of age-related cataract.  Conversely, a randomized\n      trial of over 14,000 US male physicians indicated that long-term daily multivitamin use\n      modestly and significantly decreased the risk of cataract.\n\n      Cataract formation following pars plana vitrectomy is a well recognized post-operative\n      complication of the procedure, with the reported incidence of clinically significant\n      cataract development as high as 80% within 2 years after pars plana vitrectomy.\n\n      INVESTIGATIONAL AGENT\n\n      Lenstatin\u2122 is a proprietary formulated nutritional supplement containing 11 micronutrients\n      and anti-oxidants intended to be taken for the nutritional support of the human crystalline\n      lens.\n\n      INTERVENTION\n\n      Participants will be randomized to treatment with Lenstatin or Placebo for (6) months\n      following pars plana vitrectomy.\n\n      STUDY METHODS\n\n      Participants will have baseline nuclear density (cataract)  measurements using the Pentacam\n      Nucleus Staging (PNS) program. The Pentacam Scheimpflug imaging system is a non-contact and\n      non-invasive anterior segment imaging device which has been shown to provide an immediate,\n      quantitative, examiner-independent measurement of lens density which correlates with the\n      LOCS III cataract grade. Serial Pentacam nuclear density measurements will be taken on each\n      participant at (1) month intervals for (6) months."
