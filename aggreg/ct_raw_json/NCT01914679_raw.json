Patients who meet the 1990\n      American College of Rheumatology criteria for fibromyalgia will receive up to 24 RINCE\n      treatments delivered by a medical device called \"NeuroPoint\". Approximately 20 patients will\n      receive a combination of active and inactive (sham) therapy treatments over a 16-week period\n      followed by a 4 week post-treatment evaluation. Patients will also undergo three (3)\n      functional brain imaging scans while participating in the study: the first prior to the\n      commencement of treatment, another mid-treatment; and the third at the completion of the\n      treatment period.\n\n      The study's primary outcome measure will be the change from baseline in self-reported\n      24-hour average pain intensity. The study's hypothesis is that there will be a change in\n      pain intensity as well brain functioning. We do not expect there to be a statistically\n      significant improvement in pain intensity due to the small sample but do expect to see\n      statistically significant changes in cortical function as measured by EEG and fMRI"
