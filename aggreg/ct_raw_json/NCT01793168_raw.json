Below are some\n      examples of information requested on the Questionnaire that will be entered into CoRDS:\n\n        -  Contact information: Name, Mailing Address, Phone Number, Email Address\n\n        -  Sociodemographic information: Date of Birth, Place of Birth, Sex, Gender, Ethnicity\n\n        -  Health information: Family History, Information related to Diagnosis\n\n      De-identified information in CoRDS will be made available to researchers, if they have\n      obtained approval for their research project from (1) the Institutional Review Board (IRB)\n      at the researcher's institution and (2) a panel of experts led by Dr. David A. Pearce.\n\n      A subset of de-identified information collected from each profile may be shared with certain\n      other databases. This is done in order to help improve understanding of rare diseases, to\n      avoid the duplication of efforts and to collaborate with existing research efforts and\n      organizations dedicated to rare diseases.\n\n      Participants may elect to have their information shared with patient advocacy groups (PAGs)\n      representing individuals with rare or uncommon diseases who have partnered with CoRDS. The\n      PAG will sign an agreement stating that they will not use the information for Research\n      purposes. Dr. David A. Pearce and CoRDS personnel will not be held responsible for the use\n      of information by the PAG.\n\n      The CoRDS Registry will not be paid by Researchers, Other Patient Registries or Patient\n      Advocacy Groups (PAGs) for access to information in CoRDS.\n\n      If a parent/LAR consents on behalf of a minor, CoRDS will contact the participant when he or\n      she reaches the age of 18 in order to obtain consent. If this consent is not obtained in a\n      timely manner, the participant will be withdrawn from CoRDS.\n\n      CoRDS contacts participants annually to confirm continued interest in participation in\n      CoRDS, and to request that participants update the information they have provided."
