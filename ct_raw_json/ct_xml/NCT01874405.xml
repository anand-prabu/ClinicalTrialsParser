  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Iron overload is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in transfusion-dependent
      patients. Deferasirox is the most promising iron chelator agent in several clinical
      scenarios. The investigators propose a retrospective study (chart review) to evaluate
      comprehensive iron overload management in transfusion-dependent patients treated with
      deferasirox for up to 5-10 years in a real clinical practice setting.

        Adult and pediatric transfusion- dependent patients (male and female) with different
        underlying cronic anemias who received iron chelation therapy with deferasirox during the
        observational study period and underwent at least 2 cardiac MRI scans at the Pozzuoli
        site.

        All consecutive patients visited at the participating sites starting from March 2003 to
        October 2012  will be entered in this observational study (chart review) provided all the
        inclusion an no exclusion criteria are met.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Transfusion- dependent patients (&gt; 2 years);

          -  Ongoing deferasirox therapy during the study period;

          -  â‰¥ 2 Magnetic Resonance scans (one at baseline and at least one post baseline - as per
             clinical need) during study period (this criteria is not mandatory for patients
             undergoing only the endocrine subanalysis and participating only to the cardiac
             analysis);

          -  Available medical history including relevant clinical and laboratory data (e.g serum
             ferritin, liver function tests, renal function tests, endocrine parameters ) at
             baseline before starting deferasirox treatment

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Non transfusion- dependent patients;

          -  Other chelation therapy than deferasirox;

          -  Absence of complete medical history as above specified
