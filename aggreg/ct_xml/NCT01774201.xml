  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic progressive neurological disease. Respiratory
      dysfunction due to weakness in the respiratory musculature has been described in MS. This
      leads to increased morbidity and mortality in late stages of the disease. It is possible
      that respiratory dysfunction influence physical fitness in earlier stages as well. Walking
      disability and fatigue causes significant impact on health in patients with MS, even in
      earlier stages.

      The hypothesis is that there is a relationship between respiratory function, walking
      capacity and fatigue and that daily deep breathing exercise during two months will improve
      respiratory function, walking capacity and fatigue.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Inhabitant in Örebro county, Sweden, that are diagnosed with MS according to the
             revised McDonald criteria and registered in the Swedish MS-registry with EDSS
             (Expanded disability status scale) score in the interval ≥ 3.0 - ≤ 7.0.

          -  Participants must understand verbal and written information and must be relapse free
             ≥ 3 months prior to inclusion.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with diseases that may have influence on walking ability and respiratory
             function (other than MS). Such conditions include heart and lung diseases, orthopedic
             disorders, patients recently subjected to surgery, and non-MS related neurological
             dysfunction.
