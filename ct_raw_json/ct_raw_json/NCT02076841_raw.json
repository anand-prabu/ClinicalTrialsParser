The secondary objectives of this study are to assess the following:  Overall change\n      in injection site tolerability from treatment switch (baseline) to Month 12 measured on a\n      composite VAS ranging from 0-100; Change in systemic tolerability (systemic adverse events)\n      assessed on VAS (0-100) from treatment switch to Month 4 and 12; Percentage of patients on\n      Avonex treatment after 4 and 12 months; Treatment satisfaction on VAS (0-100) at Month 12;\n      Changes in Quality of Live (QoL) (SF-36) and Fatigue Scale for Motor and Cognitive functions\n      (FSMC) from treatment switch to Month 12, adherence (drug accountability)."
