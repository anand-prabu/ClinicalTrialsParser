The factors influencing posttreatment BCVA were evaluated using multiple\n      regression analysis.\n\n      Detailed information on macular morphology, such as the photoreceptor IS/OS junction and\n      ELM, can be obtained in SD-OCT.  Some OCT studies evaluated other quantitative factors in\n      eye disease. It was reported that PROS length was correlated with BCVA in patients with\n      DME.\u00b9 Other investigators suggested that the thickness, area, and volume of the outer layer\n      were correlated with BCVA in patients with dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD).\u00b2\n      Outer foveal thickness (OFT) and relative reflectivity of the outer nuclear layer (ONL) were\n      associated with BCVA in patients with macular hole.3, 4 The volume of the ONL was found to\n      be associated with BCVA in patients with AMD.5 The aim of this study was to investigate the\n      pretreatment quantitative factors as shown in SD-OCT images that correlate with\n      posttreatment VA in patients who underwent intravitreal Lucentis (Ranibizumab) for RVO."
