This will be the first study to assess the response rate of the siG12D LODER in\n      patients with unresectable LAPC. The study is of a two-arm design with one arm receiving\n      siG12D LODER + chemotherapy, while the other arm receiving ony chemotherapy.\n\n      The investigational agent siG12D LODER is a miniature biodegradable capsule that encompasses\n      the drug, designed and produced by Silenseed Ltd. The implantation of LODERs is selected to\n      meet current gastroenterology endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) biopsy procedures, proved to be\n      highly effective and safe.\n\n      siG12D LODER has been studied in the escalating dose Phase I study of 12 patients, and\n      results showed a high safety and tolerability profiles, with no single DLT."
