Patients\n      with metastatic (stage IV) colorectal cancer have a median life expectancy of 2 years. The\n      response rates to chemotherapy range from 35-40%.\n\n      Epidemiologic evidence suggests that soy compounds may reduce the incidence of colorectals\n      cancers. Laboratory analyses demonstrate that genistein, a soy-derived compound, may inhibit\n      Wnt signaling, a pathway activated in majority of colorectal cancers. Laboratory\n      observations also demonstrate that genistein may augment growth inhibition when combined\n      with chemotherapeutic agents of 5-Fluorouracil and platinum compounds.\n\n      Based on pre-clinical data the investigators hypothesize that combining genistein with the\n      standard of care chemotherapeutic regimens will reduce chemotherapy resistance and improve\n      response rates in patients.  The aim of the study is to add genistein to the regimens of\n      FOLFOX or FOLFOX-Avastin in patients with newly diagnosed stage IV colon or rectal\n      neoplasms."
