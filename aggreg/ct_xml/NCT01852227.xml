  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In collaboration with the Neurointerventional programs at state university of new york
      Buffalo, state university of new york Stonybrook, Swedish Medical Center, Erlanger Health
      System, Vanderbilt University, and West Virginia University School of Medicine, the
      investigators aim to prospectively collect experiences where direct aspiration as a first
      pass technique is used for thrombectomy procedures.

      The investigators also want to compare specific characteristics from these cases to other
      stroke cases where traditional thrombectomy devices were used.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Traditionally, at a physician's discretion, first pass attempts at thrombectomy procedures
      are performed with any number of FDA cleared catheters, guide wires, and devices designed
      for efficient removal of clot within an intracranial vessel. Among institutions involved in
      this case study, the latest devices are readily available and fully support standard
      treatment paradigms.

      However, several cases, recently completed, using only large bore catheter and aspiration
      have anecdotally demonstrated a superior ability to remove clot from vessels, restoring
      blood flow to the affected vessel and brain tissue. In these limited number of cases, full
      restoration of blood flow has been achieved. While this combination of approved devices is
      minimalistic, the efficiency of the procedure, rapid technical success, and relative
      simplicity of the approach is unique and should be thoroughly reviewed and possibly prepared
      for publication.

        This is a chart review of clinical data for patients who have been treated for stroke with
        either direct aspiration or stent retrievers. This review will be conducted at MUSC and
        SUNY Buffalo, SUNY Stonybrook, Swedish Medical Center, Vanderbilt University, Erlanger
        Health System, and West Virginia University School of Medicine. Each participating group
        will submit for approval at their individual institution.
