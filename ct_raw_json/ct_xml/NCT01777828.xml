      Aortic valve stenosis is a serious chronic life-threatening in the short or medium term
      since the onset of functional symptoms. Aortic valve replacement surgery is currently the
      treatment of choice. It is done by surgery with sternotomy and extracorporeal circulation.
      However, despite the considerable improvement of the conditions of care per and post
      operative, this procedure is sometimes burdened with high mortality, especially in the
      population with severe co-morbidities and / or many. For this reason, some patients are
      considered against the indicated surgery or high surgical risk.

      The recent development of aortic valve bioprostheses implanted with new approaches (pressure
      or transapical) can be considered for aortic valve replacement in a population that was
      previously excluded.

      Based on very thorough evaluation of these valves test benches and animal as well as human
      settlements achieved through multiple studies and registries mono or multi patients
      challenged by cardiac surgeons or considered at high surgical risk, it is clear that the
      implementation of these valves could allow, under conditions of optimal implementation and
      monitoring, improve short-and long-term clinical status, quality of life and prognosis of
      patients.

      FRANCE 2 registry, established in 2010, and whose inclusions ended 30 June 2012 has allowed
      an initial assessment of aortic valve bioprostheses implanted catheter The following
      registry France 2 has been requested by the highest authorities of health, FRANCE register
      TAVI is performed in continuity FRANCE 2. It takes account of the first data FRANCE 2. Data
      Report Form has been reduced, no new item has been added, it will be carried out in all
      centers authorized in France to implement this technique. The collection of data will TAVI
      France under the same conditions as those FRANCE 2, the database will be managed by the
      French Society of Cardiology

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. - Existence of senile degenerative aortic stenosis with a transvalvular gradient by&gt;
             40 mmHg and / or maximum velocity&gt; 4 m / sec and / or initial valve area &lt;1 cm ²
             (indexed &lt;0.6 cm ² / m²). The initial measurement of valve area must be obtained
             within 30 days prior to valve implantation

          2. - Presence of symptoms related to aortic stenosis (dyspnea, angina, syncope effort
             ...) demonstrated by Functional Classification for Congestive Heart Failure
             functional class&gt; 2 or Class I, but with left ventricular dysfunction (ejection
             fraction &lt;40% )

          3. - A Score to &quot;EuroSCORE&quot; (Logistic European system for cardiac operative risk
             evaluation) &gt; 20% and / or Society of Thoracic Surgeons' risk Calculator&gt; 10. In case
             the &quot;EuroSCORE&quot; &lt;20% or STS &lt;10, confirmed that some comorbidities were not captured
             by these indices will be produced by the surgeon and cardiologist

             Some patients are in a situation against medical-cardiac surgery indicates heavy
             although this does not appear in the predictive risk assessment through the scores.
             In this regard, patients may be included in the following conditions:

             3-1 - ascending aorta very calcified (&quot;porcelain&quot;) 3-2 - Any other condition
             preventing cannulation for cardiopulmonary bypass, aortic clamping, or access
             mediastinal surgery: History of 3-2-1 against mediastinal irradiation indicating
             open-chest 3-2-2 thoracic deformity or history of mediastinitis-cons indicating the
             opening of the thorax 3-2-3 Other (eg, history of coronary bypass surgery may
             indicate against the opening of the thorax)

          4. - The patient accepts the scheduled evaluations at follow-up clinic

          5. - The patient or his legal representatives were informed of the nature of valve
             implantation and associated register and accept the conditions.
