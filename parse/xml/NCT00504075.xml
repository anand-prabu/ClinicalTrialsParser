      To determine if GAMMAPLEX raises the platelet count of subjects with chronic ITP to a
      threshold of 50 x 109/L, similar to that of published response &gt;60%.  Also to assess the
      safety of GAMMAPLEX and determine if platelet counts are maintained at 50 x 109/L in

      The primary objective is to determine if BPL's GAMMAPLEX raises the platelet count of
      subjects with chronic ITP to a threshold of 50 x 109/L, similar to that of published
      response &gt;60%.  The secondary objectives are:  1) to determine the safety of GAMMAPLEX at
      the dosage used in this study.  2) to determine if GAMMAPLEX maintains platelet counts of ³
      50 x 109/L in subjects with chronic ITP for a period of time similar to that of a published
      data.

The first course of GAMMAPLEX will be administered as an intravenous infusion of 1 g/kg on each of 2 consecutive days. If required, a further 1 or 2 courses on the same dosage regimen may be administered in the period Day 32 to Day 90 following the first course of GAMMAPLEX.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Males and females aged between 18 and 70 years.

          2. Confirmed diagnosis of chronic ITP of at least 6 months duration.

          3. Platelet count of less than or equal to 20 x 10 9/L at enrollment.

             been stable (for a minimum of 2 weeks before screening).  The dose of corticosteriod
             or other immunosuppressant should have remained constant until Day 32. 6) If subjects
             were being treated with cyclophosphamide, azathioprine or attenuated androgens, the
