Define the tonotopocity of multichannel brain stem stimulation and use this\n      information to better program the auditory brain stem implant for an individual.\n\n      II.  Optimize device fitting by combining monopolar and bipolar stimulation, and individual\n      psychoacoustic channels for each patient, to increase the number of usable information\n      channels for each patient and reduce or eliminate undesirable side effects.\n\n      III. Evaluate performance and learning effects using optimized fitting procedures."
