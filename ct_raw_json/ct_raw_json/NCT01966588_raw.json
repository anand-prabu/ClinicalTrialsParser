Participants' identities will\n      be matched with their coded identifier in a single, hard-copy of a Master Coding List. The\n      maintenance and security of this list is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator.\n\n      All processing steps of the blood samples, including details of the blood draw, nucleic acid\n      extraction, sequence library preparation, and sequence analysis will be documented in a\n      Microsoft Excel worksheet. This worksheet will be encrypted for privacy.\n\n      Anonymized aliquots of blood samples (as well as any derived cell cultures) will be barcoded\n      before long-term storage in a surveillance-monitored, secured freezer at -80 degrees\n      Celsius. Samples within the freezer will be maintained via a positional numbered grid within\n      the Laboratory Information Management System. This grid will also allow the study team to\n      link each barcoded sample to a participant's coded identifier.\n\n      Mapped genomic sequences and other data collected from participants will be saved in\n      password-protected folders on the UBC server. The coded sequence data will be transferred to\n      the Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences at Mount Sinai School of Medicine (MSSM) for\n      further analyses. Data transfer will occur by Two Factor Identification. The MSSM secure\n      network is Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) certified for secure handling\n      of patient sequence data. The transfer of sequence data between UBC and MSSM will be\n      performed under a material transfer agreement which requires that 1) all data and analysis\n      be confined within the secure, password-protected database defined by UBC, 2) not\n      distributed to any third party, and 3) both raw and analyzed data be destroyed from the MSSM\n      monthly. This study is not required to comply with any U.S. federal regulations, as the\n      group in MSSM will not have access to any identifying information about our participants."
