Each patient is his own control.\n\n      Primary outcome: Efficacy of an individual medical care on electro sensitive (IEI CEM)\n      patients evaluated from the improvement of health status, sensitivity to electromagnetic\n      fields (EMF) exposure, and quality of life.\n\n      Scheme:\n\n      Visit 1(T0): Patients undergo a specialized medical examination: a standardized medical\n      record is filled in. Physicians evaluate the psychological impact of IEI-EMF and a\n      psychotherapeutic care is proposed if necessary. Patients fill in 2 self-questionaries:\n      quality of life (SF-36) and EMF exposure sensitivity.\n\n      After the visit 1, a symptoms self-administrated questionary n\u00b01 is completed during 7 days.\n\n      1 month after inclusions (T1), radiofrequencies (RF) are recorded by a dosimeter worn by\n      patients for 7 days; patient fill-in the symptoms self-administrated questionary n\u00b0 2 during\n      the same time.\n\n      Visit 2: 6 months after inclusion, analysis of symptoms and RF exposure is restituted at\n      patient.  An adapted care is proposed.\n\n      12 months after inclusion (T12), patients complete the symptoms self-administrated\n      questionary n\u00b03.\n\n      Visit 3: 14 months after inclusion (T14), patients have medical examination and complete the\n      quality of life and EMF exposure sensitivity self-questionaries. Standardized medical record\n      is filled in by physicians. Patient and physician discuss the global and comparative\n      analysis of individual results.\n\n      Inclusion duration: 24 month; Follow-up: 14 months; Study duration: 38 months."
