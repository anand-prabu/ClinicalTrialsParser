The active mineralization can most probably be\n      attributed to the mineral component of this substance.\n\n      The distal radius fracture was chosen as the model to test the effects of ACC treatment\n      because it includes both trabecular and cortical bone, is accessible for radiographs, has\n      little soft tissue that can distort the radiograph, and is amenable to multiple functional\n      endpoints.\n\n      Primary objective:\n\n      To assess the efficacy of treatment with calcium from ACC compared to placebo on\n      radiographic healing time in subjects with distal radius fractures.\n\n      Secondary objectives:\n\n        -  To evaluate the effect of ACC compared to placebo on the improvement in wrist\n           functional outcome following distal radius fracture.\n\n        -  To evaluate the safety profile of ACC in this population"

Both formulations will be supplemented with vitamin D.\n\n      Safety parameters will be evaluated throughout the trial.\n\n      Subjects admitting to Barzilai medical center hand clinic following a new distal radius\n      fracture will be routinely evaluated. Subjects who were initially treated according to\n      current practice of fracture management, (i.e.; radiographic evaluation and fracture\n      fixation by splint in plaster of Paris), who are not candidates for surgery and who are\n      aimed for non-invasive treatment, will be considered candidates for the trial and be invited\n      to the clinical research center (CRC) for screening.\n\n      Screening (Day -7) - Subjects will sign an informed consent form (ICF). Chemistry and\n      hematology tests will be performed:  sodium, potassium, hemoglobin, sedimentation rate,\n      leukocytes calcium (total, albumin-corrected), phosphate, alkaline phosphatase, creatinine,\n      and albumin. Also, serum parathyroid hormone (PTH), 25-hydroxyvitamin D, and\n      thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) will be tested. Urinary excretion of calcium and\n      creatinine will be measured. General health will be examined by medical history and physical\n      examinations. Eligible subjects, complying with all inclusion criteria and none of the\n      exclusion criteria will be enrolled to the study.\n\n      Subjects will be informed by phone or on site whether they are eligible to enter the study.\n\n      Visit 1 - 1 week from fracture - (Day 0 (-7/+1)) - Eligible subjects will be invited to the\n      CRC. A fixture device will be applied to the cast to ensure consistence imaging. X-ray will\n      be performed to exclude loss of reduction.
