  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this Registry is to collect real-world outcome data for bronchial
      thermoplasty (BT) procedures in patients with asthma who remain symptomatic despite taking
      standard of care maintenance medications. Data will be used to confirm the impact of BT on
      safety, effectiveness, quality of life, and the anticipated reduction in healthcare
      utilization events and cost by way of a reduction in severe asthma exacerbations.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single arm, observational study to collect limited data on patients
      with asthma undergoing BT. All participating patients will sign the informed consent form
      approved at the participating center per local requirements. Patients will be recruited at
      participating study centers that offer BT as a treatment option to patients with asthma who
      remain symptomatic despite taking standard of care maintenance medications.

      In addition, patients may be included in the Registry retrospectively provided they sign the
      informed consent form for the Registry, have undergone BT procedures after January 01, 2013,
      and have adequate medical records to support completion of key data fields in the Registry
      including completed Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaires (AQLQ) at Baseline and at
      post-treatment follow-up visits.

      The Registry will be conducted at up to 40  sites globally and will enroll up to 225
      patients for 200 evaluable patients. The treatment period is from the date of the first BT
      procedure until 6 weeks after the third (last) procedure (approximately 12 weeks). The
      post-treatment period starts at the date of the 6-week follow up visit after completion of
      the third (last) BT procedure for 2-years of follow-up.

      This Registry will collect real-world outcome data on the experience of BT patients and
      allow for confirmation of the impact of BT on:

        -  Safety : procedure related respiratory adverse events (rates of serious respiratory
           adverse events, and percentage of patients with serious respiratory adverse events)

        -  Healthcare Utilization: emergency department (ED) visits for asthma symptoms (rates of
           ED visits and percentage of patients with ED visits for asthma symptoms);
           hospitalizations for asthma symptoms (rates and the percentage of patients with
           hospitalizations for asthma symptoms); unscheduled office visits including urgent care
           visits for asthma symptoms

        -  Pre- and post-bronchodilator FEV1

        -  Effectiveness: percentage of patients experiencing severe asthma exacerbations; rates
           of severe asthma exacerbations (exacerbations / patient / year).

        -  Quality of Life: Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ) Score - Baseline, 6-Week
           post BT 3, 1 Year, 2 Year Follow-up office visits

      The primary endpoint will be the incidence of severe asthma exacerbations following BT with
      the Alair System.
