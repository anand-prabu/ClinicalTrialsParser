Local\n      anesthesia means that, your doctor will inject numbing medication directly into the tissue\n      or part of your body where the surgery will be done. In this case, the numbing medication\n      will be injected directly into the area where your fistula will be made.  In regional\n      anesthesia, the numbing medication will be injected around the nerve (part of the body that\n      gives sensation) for your arm, to make the entire arm numb. The purpose of this study is to\n      compare the three month success rates of AV fistulae created by the two anesthesia\n      techniques."
