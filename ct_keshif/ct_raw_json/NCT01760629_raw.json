            "textblock": "Whole body cooling improves survival with normal neurological outcome after neonatal\n      encephalopathy in high-income countries. However, cooling equipments used in the high-income\n      countries are expensive and unsuitable for wider use in low and middle-income countries\n      (LMIC). We had previously conducted a randomised controlled trial of whole body cooling\n      using phase changing material in south India. Although cooling was provided, there were wide\n      temperature fluctuations.\n\n      Aim: To examine efficacy of the low technology cooling equipment (Tecotherm-HELIX) in\n      administering effective and stable whole body cooling in encephalopathic infants.\n\n      Methods: After informed parental consent (and ethical approvals), we will administer 72\n      hours of whole body cooling (rectal temperature 33 to 34C) to a total 50 encephalopathic\n      infants (aged <6 hours) admitted to the neonatal units at Calicut Medical College and Madras\n      Medical College, over a six month period. To induce cooling, the infants will be kept on the\n      cooling mattress. Temperature will be continuously measured for 80 hours using a rectal\n      probe connected to a digital data logger.\n\n      The primary outcome will be the effective cooling time i.e. percentage of time (95% CI) for\n      which the temperature remains between 33 to 340C during the intended cooling period."
