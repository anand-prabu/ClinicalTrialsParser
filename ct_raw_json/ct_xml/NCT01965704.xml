  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Investigators hope to learn if they can prevent or lessen the symptoms of neonatal
      abstinence syndrome (NAS) in babies born to narcotic-dependent mothers by using the drug
      ondansetron in the mothers and their babies.  The study is a randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled study with one half the mother-baby pairs to receive ondansetron and the
      other half of the mother-baby pairs to receive placebo.  The Investigators plan to give the
      pregnant narcotic-dependent mothers an intravenous dose of study medication prior to
      delivery and after the baby is born, the neonate will receive the same study medication the
      mother received every 24 hours for up to 5 days. The Investigators will follow up with the
      mother-baby pairs for 10 days after study drug has stopped and one last follow up, about 30
      days after stopping study drug, to see if the baby had any symptoms of NAS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All neonates will have a screening 12-lead EKG prior to their first dose of study medication
      to determine if QTc prolongation is present.  A second 12-lead EKG will be done after their
      3rd dose of study medication; if a neonate has prolonged QTc the study drug will be stopped.

      Investigators may obtain up to 9 pharmacokinetic (PK) blood samples from the neonates over 5
      days when standard of care blood samples are drawn.  These samples will consist of 1 to 2
      drops of blood collected on filter paper and sent to Stanford for PK analysis.

      Interim analysis: will be performed after the first 20 pregnant women and their neonates
      have been enrolled and dosed with study drug.

      To protect the confidentiality of the patients (study subjects), the lead site, Stanford
      University, received a Certificate of Confidentiality from the NIH.
