      The REVLIMID Registry will provide safety data from a large cohort of Taiwanese patients
      treated with REVLIMID. In addition, the registry will provide efficacy data and outcomes in
      a real-world setting (versus a clinical trial).

    <textblock>
      The REVLIMID Registry is a prospective, multi-center, observational study. The registry will
      register 100 patients being prescribed REVLIMID in Taiwan during and patients will be
      followed for two years after the enrollment of the last patient.

      Safety and efficacy data will be recorded in the registry monthly or bi-monthly. In
      accordance with the Risk Minimization Program for REVLIMID (RevAssure) a patient categorized
      as a woman of childbearing potential will be prescribed REVLIMID on a monthly basis, whereas
      women of non-childbearing potential and men will be allowed up to two months supply per
      prescription.

      After entry of baseline data, the prescribing physician should prescribe and monitor
      REVLIMID therapy according to the guidance and recommended schedules given in the approved
      Taiwan package insert (PI)
