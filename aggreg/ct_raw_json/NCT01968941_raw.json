Radiotherapy will be administered as soon as\n      possible following randomization and subjects will be followed for 5 years\n      post-randomization for cancer recurrence, toxicity and survival. The primary outcome is\n      local control (LC). The trial will be conducted at 16-20 clinical centres throughout Canada."
