Prior to study entry, any ECG\n             abnormality at screening must be documented by the investigator as not medically\n             relevant.\n\n          -  Currently receiving medication with Coumadin, heparin, low molecular weight heparin,\n             or NSAIDS.  Concomitant use with any of these medications must be discontinued within\n             two weeks prior to beginning protocol treatment.\n\n          -  Patient has hypersensitivity to VELCADE, boron, or mannitol.\n\n          -  Female subject is pregnant or lactating.  Confirmation that the subject is not\n             pregnant must be established by a negative serum pregnancy test result obtained\n             during screening.  Pregnancy testing is not required for postmenopausal or surgically\n             sterilized women.\n\n          -  Female patients who are lactating or have a positive serum pregnancy test during the\n             screening period, or a positive urine pregnancy test on Day 1 before first dose of\n             study drug, if applicable.\n\n          -  Serious medical or psychiatric illness likely to interfere with participation in this\n             clinical study.\n\n          -  Diagnosed or treated for another malignancy within 2 years of enrollment, with the\n             exception of complete resection of basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma of\n             the skin, an in situ malignancy, or low-risk prostate cancer after curative therapy.\n\n          -  Participation in clinical trials with other investigational agents not included in\n             this trial, within 14 days of the start of this trial and throughout the duration of\n             this trial.\n\n          -  Radiation therapy within 3 weeks before randomization. Enrollment of subjects who\n             require concurrent radiotherapy (which must be localized in its field size) should be\n             deferred until the radiotherapy is completed and 3 weeks have elapsed since the last\n             date of therapy."
