The majority of these studies do not\n      differentiate between the effects of EPA and DHA. The present study investigate the effects\n      of DHA in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n      As a precondition for participating in this study, the patients were provided information in\n      writing and verbally about the details of the study. Written informed consent was obtained\n      from all volunteers. Before the beginning of the study, all patients were subject to a\n      medical examination by their general rheumatologist. Thirty five patients with rheumatoid\n      arthritis (DAS \u2265 2.6, erythrocyte sedimation rate (ESR (1h) \u2265 12 mm) should entered the\n      study.\n\n      The placebo-controlled, randomized double-blind cross-over study consists of two\n      investigation periods of 10 weeks, with a ten-week washout period in between. After the\n      washout period the intervention was crossed between the groups and the respective products\n      were consumed for another 10 weeks. Patients in the placebo period receive 60g sausage, 8g\n      tomato spread and one bottle of the milk beverage daily. These products were enriched with\n      sunflower oil (8g/d).\n\n      In the intervention period, the products (60g sausage, 8g tomato spread and one bottle of\n      the milk beverage) were enriched with 8g alga oil (IOI) The daily dose of docosahexaenoic\n      acid (DHA) amounted to 2.8 g.\n\n      Venous blood is collected at the beginning and at the end of each period.\n\n      \u2022 Disease activity was determined by joint score DAS68, rheumascan, common inflammatory\n      markers (ESR, C reactive protein), ultrasonic (US-7 score), HAQ questionnaire and further\n      lifestyle forms"
