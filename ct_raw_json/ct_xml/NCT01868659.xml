      Diagnostic errors are common, but they have been largely ignored by patient safety groups.
      Diagnostic errors are often traced to physicians' cognitive biases and failed heuristics
      (mental shortcuts). We know how these faulty thinking processes lead to diagnostic errors,
      but we know little about how to resist them. Faulty thinking has plagued other high-risk,
      high-reliability professionals, such as airline pilots and nuclear plant operators. These
      professions have learned from their mistakes and have developed checklists to help prevent
      them. The medical profession has started to use checklists and time-out periods in the
      operating room and intensive care unit, but these strategies have not been used to reduce
      diagnostic errors. The most common reason that physicians fail to make the correct diagnosis
      is that they never consider it. This failure could potentially be prevented if the physician
      took a time-out to review a checklist. Our broad long-term goal is to reduce diagnostic
      errors by developing interventions that help counter faulty diagnostic thinking. The
      specific aims of this project are to (1) determine the feasibility of taking a diagnostic
      time-out in the acute outpatient setting (urgent care clinic and emergency department), (2)
      determine if new diagnostic possibilities are seriously considered as a result of the
      time-out and checklist, and (3) compare the initial differential diagnosis with the new
      differential diagnosis following the time-out, and with the discharge diagnosis documented
      in the medical record, and with the &quot;final&quot; diagnosis based on a one-month follow-up. To
      achieve these aims, the investigators will ask 5 urgent-care physicians to complete a
      time-out procedure for 10 diagnostically challenging adult patients and 5 physicians will
      serve as controls (no time out) for 10 diagnostically challenging patients (total of 100
      patients). The investigator will ask the intervention physicians to take a 2-minute time-out
      to review a complaint-specific differential-diagnosis checklist, which includes the
      differential diagnosis for 60 common presenting complaints, such as dyspnea and chest pain.
      The time-out will occur at the conclusion of the history and physical exam. We will use
      descriptive statistics and qualitative methods to characterize physicians' reactions to the
      time-out and checklists. We will use this pilot project to plan a larger study that will
      determine the risks and benefits of diagnostic time-outs and checklists.

      Diagnostic errors are common. They are more common than medication errors and they are the
      second leading cause of malpractice claims. They are more likely to harm patients and more
      likely to be preventable than other kinds of errors. Yet they have been largely ignored by
      patient safety groups, which have focused more on system problems than thinking problems.
      Diagnostic errors are often traced to physicians' cognitive biases and failed heuristics
      (mental shortcuts). We know how these faulty thinking processes lead to diagnostic errors,
      but we know little about how to resist them. Faulty thinking has plagued other high-risk,
      high-reliability professionals, such as airline pilots and nuclear plant operators. These
      professions have learned from their mistakes and have developed checklists to help prevent

    <description>Diagnoses will be considered &quot;correct&quot; if the one-month followup diagnosis exactly agrees with the final diagnosis recorded in the medical record at the time of the visit.  The one-month followup diagnosis will be determined by the investigators after reviewing the medical record and a one-month telephone interview with the patient.  Diagnoses will be labeled &quot;trivial discrepancy&quot; if the one-month followup diagnosis differs in a trivial manner with the final diagnosis recorded in the medical record at the time of the visit (e.g., viral upper respiratory infection vs. viral bronchitis).  Diagnoses will be labeled &quot;important discrepancy&quot; if the one-month followup diagnosis differs in an important manner with the final diagnosis recorded in the medical record at the time of the visit (e.g., viral bronchitis vs. bacterial pneumonia).</description>

The number of diagnoses in the differential diagnosis will be compared for checklist physicians vs. no-checklist physicians.</description>
