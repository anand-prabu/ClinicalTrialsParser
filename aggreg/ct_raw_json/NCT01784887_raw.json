Non-interactive wound\n      dressings are considered by FDA to be non-significant risk, as per their Investigational\n      Device Exemptions Manual (publication FDA 96-4159).\n\n      Procellera is FDA cleared under K081977 for professional use as a wound dressing for partial\n      and full-thickness wounds.\n\n      Selection of Subjects\n\n      Type of the Subject Population\n\n        -  At least 18 years old\n\n        -  Male or female\n\n        -  All ethnic groups\n\n      As a military-civilian cooperative Phase II prospective randomized trial, the study\n      population will include chronic wound patients from both military and civilian backgrounds.\n\n      As incidence of complex non-healing wounds remains high in both military and civilian\n      hospital settings, it is estimated that recruitment rate will be sufficiently rapid at each\n      research site. While unanticipated delays (e.g. slow accrual) may occur, the limited patient\n      population and length of time allotted for the clinical study (2 years) is assumed to offset\n      any delays.  A total of 60 participants will be enrolled studywide to obtain 50 evaluable\n      participants from both sites combined. Up to 16 patients will be screened each day. A\n      consecutive series of patients who meet the following inclusion/exclusion criteria and agree\n      to participate will be recruited.\n\n      Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria\n\n        1.
