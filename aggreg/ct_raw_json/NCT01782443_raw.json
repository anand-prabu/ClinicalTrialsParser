            "textblock": "This research study is a Phase II clinical trial, which tests the safety and effectiveness\n      of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a specific cancer.\n      \"Investigational\" means that the drug, Ziv-aflibercept, is being studied. It also means that\n      the FDA has not yet approved Ziv-aflibercept for use in patients with your type of cancer.\n\n      Every person has molecules in their bloodstream called vascular endothelial growth factors\n      (VEGFs). These molecules help grow and sustain new blood vessels needed by the human body.\n      Cancer tumors hijack this mechanism because they need new blod vessels and oxygen to grow.\n      Ziv-aflibercept is an antibody. Antibodies are proteins that are produced naturally in our\n      bodies and help to recognize foreign substances in our body. Ziv-aflibercept is a \"targeted\n      therapy\" called a \"VEGF Trap\", that \"traps\" (binds) these VEGFs and prevents the cancer from\n      using them to grow.\n\n      Though Ziv-aflibercept has not yet been FDA approved for the treatment of carcinoid tumors,\n      it has recently been approved for patients with treatment-resistant colorectal cancer.\n\n      In this research study, we will use Ziv-aflibercept in combination with standard octreotide\n      therapy to see if it slows the growth or spread of your carcinoid tumor. Standard octreotide\n      (sandostatin) therapy is currently approved for treating symptoms of carcinoid tumors, such\n      as those caused by carcinoid syndrome. Carcinoid syndrome is caused by hormones and other\n      substances released by carcinoid tumors into the bloodstream. One of these secreted\n      substances is serotonin, one of the body's natural chemical messengers. When excess\n      serotonin secreted by the carcinoid tumors reaches the body's tissues, it is thought to\n      cause diarrhea and redness (flushing) of the face, chest or back. Excess serotonin may also\n      cause changes in the structure of the heart valves, which can impair the heart's function.\n      Octreotide works by binding to receptors found on carcinoid tumors and prevents the release\n      of hormones from the tumor."

            "textblock": "If you are willing to participate in this study you will be asked to undergo some screening\n      tests and procedures to confirm that you are eligible. Many of these tests and procedures\n      are likely to be part of regular cancer care and may be done even if it turns out that you\n      do not take part in the research study. If you have had some of these tests or procedures\n      recently, they may or may not have to be repeated. These tests and procedures include: a\n      medical history, physical examination, CT or MRI, blood tests, serum chromogranin A, urine\n      tests, 24-hour urine collection, pregnancy test and an electrocardiogram. If these tests\n      show that you are eligible to participate in the research study, you will begin the study\n      treatment. If you do not meet the eligibility criteria, you will not be able to participate\n      in this research study.\n\n      If you meet the requirements for this study and you agree to continue your participation,\n      you will receive Ziv-aflibercept every two weeks. Each dose of Ziv-aflibercept consists of\n      an approximately 60 minutes infusion (through a needle into a vein). You will also receive\n      an injection of Octreotide LAR (long acting release) monthly as part of your treatment for\n      carcinoid tumor. This injection will be given to you by a nurse in your buttock. You may\n      already be on Octreotide LAR. In that case, you will continue taking it at the same dose and\n      schedule.\n\n      You will need to come to the clinic every two weeks while participating in this study. Each\n      cycle is 28 days.\n\n      The following tests and procedures will be performed on Days 1 and 15 of each cycle:\n      questions about your health, physical exam (Day 1 of each cycle only), vital signs, blood\n      tests, pregnancy test (Day 1 of each cycle only).\n\n      Urine tests will be performed every other cycle.\n\n      The following tests and procedures will be done at the end of every third cycle: CT scan or\n      MRI, Serum Chromogranin A, 24-hour urine collection.\n\n      After the final dose of the study drug the following tests and procedures will be performed:\n      questions about your general health, physical exam, vital signs, blood tests, pregnancy\n      test, EKG, Serum Chromogranin A, 24-hour urine collection."
