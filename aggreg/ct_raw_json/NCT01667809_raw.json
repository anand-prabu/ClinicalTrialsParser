Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) has been shown to be\n      effective in alleviating target symptoms of these disorders, but its effect on sick leave\n      rates has not been sufficiently addressed. The investigators have developed an intervention\n      called return to work (RTW), which is based in cognitive behavioral theory, that has a\n      primary aim of helping sick-listed patients with common mental illness return to work. This\n      new treatment has not been evaluated in a randomized controlled trial.\n\n      Aims: The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of CBT and RTW for subclinical\n      common mental illness in a randomized controlled trial conducted in primary care.\n      Participants will be randomized to diagnosis specific CBT (n=50), RTW (n=50. Main outcomes\n      are days of sick leave and clinician severity rating of psychiatric symptoms. This study\n      could contribute to new knowledge regarding how to best treat patients on sick leave with\n      mild common mental illness."
