  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This 2-stage, open-label study will evaluate safety and pharmacokinetics of ASTX727, as well
      as determine the dose for the study's second stage.  In the second stage the selected dose
      will be confirmed and evaluated for clinical activity, including response rate and duration.

    <description>ASTX727 is given by mouth daily X 5 consecutive days.  Dosing details will vary in the first 3 courses of therapy for pharmacokinetic measurements.  Based on safety and pharmacokinetic results the dose will be modified for subsequent cohorts. Dose escalation will continue until target pharmacokinetics are achieved or until a safe dose is exceeded.</description>
