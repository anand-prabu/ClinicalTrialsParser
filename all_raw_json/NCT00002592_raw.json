Combining chemotherapy with autologous bone marrow\n      transplantation may allow the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill\n      more cancer cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of chemotherapy followed by autologous\n      bone marrow transplantation in treating patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia."

Evaluate the ability of c-myb antisense oligodeoxynucleotide to purge bone\n      marrow cells of clonogenic chronic myelogenous leukemia tumor cells and repopulate the bone\n      marrow with normal stem cells in patients treated with high-dose busulfan and\n      cyclophosphamide followed by autologous bone marrow transplantation using marrow treated\n      with c-myb antisense oligodeoxynucleotide. II. Determine the response rate, degree of\n      hematopoietic reconstitution, overall survival, and relapse-free survival of patients\n      treated with this regimen. III. Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients undergo bone marrow harvest. The bone marrow is treated with c-myb\n      antisense oligodeoxynucleotide and cryopreserved. A portion of the marrow is cryopreserved\n      untreated in case of engraftment failure. Patients receive oral busulfan every 6 hours on\n      days -7 to -4 for a total of 16 doses. Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on\n      days -3 and -2. Bone marrow is reinfused on day 0. Patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF)\n      subcutaneously daily beginning on day 0 and continuing until blood counts recover. Patients\n      are followed every 2-3 months for 2 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study within 18-24\n      months."
