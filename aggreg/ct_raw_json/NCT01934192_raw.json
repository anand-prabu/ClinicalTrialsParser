Other aims are evaluation of GSK962040 safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics\n      upon repeat dosing in a critically ill population.\n\n      After meeting eligibility criteria, male and female subjects will be randomized to either\n      receive GSK962040 (50 milligram [mg]) once daily (OD) via naso-gastric (NG) or orogastric\n      (OG) feeding tube (oral solution), or placebo by the same route. If subjects develop\n      intolerance to enteral feeding at any point up to Dose 5 of study medication (inclusive),\n      study treatments will switch such that those originally receiving GSK962040 will receive\n      metoclopramide (10 mg, intravenous [iv], every 6 hours) and those subjects originally\n      randomized to receive placebo will receive GSK962040 (50 mg, via NG, OD).  Additionally, if\n      subjects develop intolerance prior to any treatment, they will be randomized to receive\n      either GSK962040 (50 mg, via NG, OD) or metoclopramide (10 mg, iv, every 6 hours).\n\n      The study will consist of a screening/baseline assessment, a treatment period (up to 7 days\n      in duration), and a 4-day post treatment safety follow-up assessment. The duration of each\n      subject's participation in the study from screening to follow-up safety assessment will be\n      up to approximately 2 weeks. In addition, mortality will be assessed 60 days after admission\n      to the ICU."
