It causes one to feel\n      dizzy, light headed, and weak. Neurogenic hypotension is caused by a problem in the part of\n      the nervous system that controls such functions as heart rate and blood pressure. Droxidopa,\n      a drug that may increase blood pressure, may be an effective treatment for neurogenic\n      hypotension.\n\n      PURPOSE: Clinical trial to study the effectiveness of droxidopa in treating patients who\n      have neurogenic hypotension."
