We will also assess the impact of the intervention on suicidal ideation (SI) and\n      explore the impact on the most common symptoms observed in Veteran suicide decedents (e.g.,\n      depression)."

The intervention targets a change in the beliefs that influence whether or not someone enters mental health or substance use treatment. During the session, participants will be given a brief introduction to CBT and informed that CBT is based on the theory that cognitions (i.e., thoughts/beliefs), feelings and behaviors all interact with each other;101, 102 therefore, thoughts about certain situations or things influence behavior. Since thoughts are modifiable, changing thoughts about situations may change behavior.",
