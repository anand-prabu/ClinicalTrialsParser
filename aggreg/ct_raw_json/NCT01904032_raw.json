Consenting\n      adult women who are eligible to participate will be randomly assigned to either a weekly\n      dose of 50,000 international units of vitamin D3 supplementation or a matching weekly active\n      comparator of 5,000 international units of vitamin D3 for six months. Participants will\n      complete approximately three in-person study visits and several telephone visits throughout\n      the six month trial period, where the researchers will assess depressive symptoms, diabetes\n      self-management, and systolic blood pressure.\n\n      Aim 1:  To determine the effect of vitamin D supplementation on depressive symptoms (primary\n      outcome), self-management (secondary outcome), and systolic blood pressure (exploratory\n      outcome) compared to placebo.\n\n      Hypothesis:  Women receiving vitamin D supplementation will report fewer depressive\n      symptoms, increased diabetes self- management mediated by depression improvement, and have a\n      lower systolic blood pressure compared to those taking placebo at three and six months\n      follow-up.\n\n      Aim 2:  To explore the mechanistic effect of vitamin D supplementation on inflammatory\n      biomarkers and their association with depression.\n\n      Hypothesis:  Women receiving vitamin D supplementation will have a decrease in inflammatory\n      biomarkers which will be associated with fewer depressive symptoms compared to those taking\n      placebo at three and six months follow-up"
