  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to gain a better understanding of how different types of
      exercise can help people after a stroke. The investigators want to study if different types
      of exercise will improve the use of arm and hand function after a stroke.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is the leading cause of disability in the United States with approximately 795,000
      new or recurrent strokes per year.  An estimated two thirds of patients post-stroke cannot
      incorporate the affected upper extremity (UE) into their activities of daily living.  In
      addition, stroke survivors experience a 60% decrease in cardiovascular capacity, which
      contributed to disability and diminished quality of life.  Developing rehabilitation
      techniques to optimize motor recovery while improving cardiovascular endurance would benefit
      the stroke population.

      Animal studies using a forced exercise (FE) paradigm, in which the rodent is exercised on a
      motorized treadmill at a rate greater than its voluntary rate, indicate an endogenous
      increase in neurotrophic factors such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and
      glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF).  These neurotrophic factors are thought to
      underlie neuroplasticity and motor learning.  It is hypothesized that patients with stroke,
      due to decreased motor cortical output, cannot sustain high rates of voluntary exercise
      necessary to trigger the endogenous release of neurotrophic factors; therefore,
      forced-exercise is necessary to augment their voluntary efforts and will be superior to
      voluntary exercise in facilitating motor recovery. When coupled with repetitive task
      practice (RTP) of the UE, an effective form of UE rehabilitation, FE will prime the brain
      for neuroplasticity.  We have developed a safe and effective method of delivering
      forced-exercise to Parkinson's disease (PD) patients (NIH R21HD056316). Clinical and imaging
      data with PD patients indicate forced-exercise, but not voluntary exercise, triggers a
      neurophysiologic response in the central nervous system resulting in global improvements in
      motor and non-motor functioning and increased cortical and subcortical activation. The aim
      of this project is to conduct a preliminary trial to compare the effects of forced to
      voluntary exercise when coupled with RTP in promoting the recovery of motor function in
      patients with stroke.
