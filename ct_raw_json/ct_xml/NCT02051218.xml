    <textblock>
      Denosumab, a monoclonal antibody against RANK-Ligand has been shown superior to zoledronic
      acid in delaying time to a first on-study skeletal related event (SRE) in patients with
      solid tumors, with no effects on disease progression or survival. Many SREs were silent
      compression fractures found only because of scheduled imaging. The approved dose of
      denosumab is 120 mg s.c. every 4 weeks (q4w). Although generally well tolerated, there is a
      time-dependent increase in osteonecrosis of the jaw in up to 8% of patients. Cases of fatal
      hypocalcaemia were observed during post marketing surveillance.

      The optimal dose and schedule for denosumab is unknown. Denosumab is associated with
      considerable costs and may add toxicity; thus a study of de-escalation is warranted.

      The aim of the trial is to test the hypothesis that the benefit of Denosumab is maintained
      if administered 120 mg q12w as compared to 120 mg q4w. The primary endpoint of this
      open-label randomized phase III non-inferiority trial is time to first on-trial symptomatic
      skeletal event (SSE: i.e. clinically significant pathological fracture, radiation therapy to
      bone, surgery to bone or spinal cord compression). With a non-inferiority margin of 1.2 for
      the hazard ratio, a power 80% and a type I error 5%, the total sample size is 1380.
      Secondary endpoints are safety, time to subsequent on-trial SSE, quality of life, health
      economic outcomes, and change in bone turnover markers. This study is open for international
      collaboration.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has given written informed consent.

          -  Histologically confirmed diagnosis of breast or prostate cancer before randomization.

          -  Patient has metastatic breast cancer (stage IV, all subtypes allowed) or prostate
             cancer (stage IV) and bone metastases and is planned to receive or is receiving
             antineoplastic treatment.

          -  Patients with prostate cancer must have evidence of disease progression on continuous
             androgen deprivation therapy (CRPC).

          -  Patients must have ≥ 3 bone metastases (lytic or blastic or mixed). The lesions must
             be documented by radiological evaluation within 12 weeks before randomization (by
             X-Ray, CT scan, PET-CT, MRI scan or bone scintigraphy).

          -  WHO performance status 0-2

          -  Age ≥ 18 years.

          -  Corrected serum calcium ≥ 2 mmol/l and ≤ 3 mmol/l (medical treatments to obtain serum
             calcium levels in the normal range are allowed, as far as no bisphosphonates or
             denosumab are used).

          -  Liver transaminases within normal range or not more than 3 x ULN with liver
             metastases. Serum total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN (≤ 2.0 x ULN in case of known Gilbert's
             disease)

          -  Women are not breastfeeding. Women with child-bearing potential are using effective
             contraception, are not pregnant and agree not to become pregnant during participation
             in the trial and during the 12 months thereafter. A negative pregnancy test before
             inclusion (within 7 days) into the trial is required for all women with child-bearing
             potential.

          -  Men agree not to father a child during participation in the trial and during 12
             months thereafter.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Definite contraindication for denosumab (e.g. hypocalcaemia [Albumin-corrected serum
             calcium &lt; 2.0 mmol/l]).

          -  History or current evidence of osteonecrosis of the jaw.

          -  Non-healed mucosa in oral cavity (by surgery or as a side effect of any other
             treatment).

          -  Jaw or dental conditions that require oral surgery or if surgery or invasive dental
             procedures are planned.

          -  Prior use of denosumab for bone metastases (dose 120 mg every 4 weeks) or
             bisphosphonates to treat bone metastases. Patients treated with denosumab or
             bisphosphonates against osteopenia or osteoporosis are allowed to enter the trial if
             the last dose was more than 28 days before randomization.

          -  Patients with known osteoporosis (T-score ≤ -2.5) at study entry (since fractures
             from osteoporosis are difficult to be discriminated from fractures through bone
             metastases).

          -  Radiotherapy or surgery to the bone within the last two weeks before randomization or
             planned within 6 weeks after randomization.

          -  Presence or history of CNS metastases or leptomeningeal disease. A MRI evaluation
             within 12 weeks before randomization must be performed in case of suspicious
             symptoms.

          -  Psychiatric disorder precluding understanding of information on trial related topics,
             giving informed consent, filling out QoL forms.

          -  Concurrent treatment in a clinical trial with SSE or SRE as primary endpoint.

          -  Known hypersensitivity to trial drug or hypersensitivity to any other component of
             the trial drug (e.g. fructose).

          -  Any concomitant drugs contraindicated for use with the trial drugs according to the
             approved product information.

          -  Any psychological, familial, sociological or geographical condition potentially
             hampering compliance with the trial protocol.
