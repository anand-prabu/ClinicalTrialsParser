Within the strata, participants will be randomly\n      assigned with equal probability to either the investigational arm (Arm A: docetaxel +\n      OGX-427) or the control arm (Arm B: docetaxel alone).\n\n      INVESTIGATIONAL ARM OGX-427 + DOCETAXEL (Arm A):\n\n      LOADING DOSE PERIOD:\n\n      Participants randomized onto the investigational arm (Arm A) will receive OGX-427 beginning\n      with a loading dose period prior to the initiation of docetaxel treatment. The first dose of\n      OGX-427 for the loading dose period must be administered within 5 working days of\n      registration and randomization.\n\n      During the loading dose period, participants will receive three separate administrations of\n      600 mg OGX-427 intravenously (IV) (days -9 to -1). There must be at least one \"non-infusion\"\n      day between each administration of OGX-427 (i.e., every other day) during the loading dose\n      period and between the third loading dose of OGX-427 and day 1 of cycle 1. There should be\n      no more than 7 days between the last loading dose and day 1 of cycle 1.\n\n      TREATMENT PERIOD:\n\n      During the treatment period, participants randomized to this arm will receive:\n\n        -  OGX-427 600 mg IV weekly on days 1, 8, and 15 of each 21-day cycle. OGX-427 must be\n           administered prior to docetaxel on day 1 of each cycle.\n\n        -  Docetaxel (75 mg/M2) IV on day 1 of each 21-day cycle. Docetaxel should be administered\n           immediately following the completion of the OGX-427 infusion.\n\n      OGX-427 MAINTENANCE:\n\n      Following completion of 10 cycles of docetaxel, 600 mg OGX-427 will continue to be\n      administered by IV weekly as maintenance therapy for participants who do not have disease\n      progression (i.e., stable disease or better). Participants without documented disease\n      progression who have discontinued from study treatment not due to toxicity related to\n      OGX-427 can also continue to receive OGX-427 maintenance as long as they have completed\n      disease assessments following at least 2 cycles of chemotherapy.  Maintenance with OGX-427\n      will continue until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      CONTROL ARM - DOCETAXEL ALONE (Arm B):\n\n      TREATMENT PERIOD:\n\n      During the treatment period, participants randomized to this arm will receive:\n\n      - Docetaxel (75 mg/M2) IV on day 1 of each 21-day cycle. The first dose of docetaxel must be\n      administered within 5 working days of registration and randomization.  Participants will\n      continue to receive docetaxel on day 1 of each 21-day cycle until disease progression,\n      unacceptable toxicity related to docetaxel, voluntary patient withdrawal, or a maximum of 10\n      docetaxel cycles.\n\n      FOLLOW-UP FOR BOTH ARMS:\n\n      Imaging studies will be performed every 6 weeks (i.e., after completion of cycles 2, 4, 6, 8\n      and 10) until disease progression and with any sign or symptom of new or worsening disease;\n      computed tomography scan (CT) of chest/abdomen/pelvis is preferred but magnetic resonance\n      imaging scan(MRI) is acceptable, especially for participants with increased risk of\n      contrast-related nephropathy or other contraindications. For Arm A, scans will be performed\n      every 2 cycles (6 weeks) +/1 week during the 21-day cycles of docetaxel administration and\n      every 6 weeks during maintenance OGX-427 administration until disease progression; for Arm\n      B, scans will be performed every 6 weeks during the 21-day cycles of docetaxel\n      administration until disease progression. All scans should be completed before the\n      subsequent cycle is scheduled to begin. Bone scans will be repeated, if positive at\n      baseline, every 6 weeks during the first 4 cycles of treatment (i.e., at the end of cycles 2\n      and 4) and then every 12 weeks thereafter until disease progression (i.e., at the end of\n      cycle 8, at end of treatment, and during maintenance with OGX-427 [Arm A only]).\n\n      All participants will have an End of Treatment (EOT) visit when they discontinue study\n      treatment. All participants will be followed until documented disease progression.\n\n      Once disease progression is documented, participants will enter a survival follow-up period.\n      All participants must be followed for survival as the primary endpoint. During the survival\n      follow-up period, data will be collected every three months regarding further cancer\n      therapy, secondary malignancy, and survival status.\n\n      Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1\n\n      Life Expectancy: Greater than 3 months\n\n      Hematopoietic:\n\n        -  Absolute neutrophil count(ANC)\u2265 1,500/mcL\n\n        -  Hemoglobin \u2265 8 g/dL\n\n        -  Platelets \u2265 100,000/mcL\n\n      Hepatic:\n\n        -  Bilirubin \u2264 1.1 x upper limit of normal (ULN) (\u2264 2.0 x ULN if secondary to Gilbert's\n           disease)\n\n        -  Aspartate transaminase (AST), serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT)/alanine\n           transaminase (ALT), serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) \u2264 1.5 X institutional\n           ULN\n\n      Renal:\n\n        -  Serum creatinine \u2264 1.5 x ULN\n\n      Cardiac:\n\n        -  Symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or\n           myocardial infarction within 3 months of randomization."
