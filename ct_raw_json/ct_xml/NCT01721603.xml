  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety and find out what effects, good and/or bad,
      dabrafenib (a BRAF inhibitor) alone or dabrafenib when given in combination with gamma knife
      radiosurgery has on participants with a certain type of skin cancer (BRAFV600E melanoma) and
      brain metastases (tumors that have spread to the brain).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm Phase II clinical trial.  All patients will receive continuous dosing
      of dabrafenib at 150 mg PO bid until progression of disease, withdrawal of consent, or the
      development of intolerable treatment associated toxicity. An MRI will be performed after 28
      days of treatment with dabrafenib.  Patients who have unequivocal disease progression in the
      brain at that time will be deemed to have disease progression at 4 weeks.  Patients with a
      complete response of all lesions in the brain will continue to receive dabrafenib on study
      but they will not undergo SRS.  For patients with stable disease or partial tumor responses
      in the brain, Gamma Knife radiosurgery will be performed on treatment cycle 2, day 1 (+/- 3
      days, 28 day cycle) using a stereotactic head frame and MRI imaging in accordance with
      FDA-approved procedures.

      Melanoma brain metastases

      Cutaneous melanoma is the most aggressive form of all skin cancers.  Worldwide, it is
      currently expected that approximately 132,000 people will be diagnosed with melanoma each
      year and some 37,000 people are expected to die of the disease annually.  Brain metastases
      are a major source of morbidity and mortality in patients with metastatic melanoma and
      approximately 3 out of 4 develop brain metastases at some point in their disease course.
      The prognosis of metastatic melanoma with CNS involvement is dismal1, and, until recently,
      no medical therapy demonstrated clear evidence of activity against melanoma in the brain.
      For patients with fewer than 4 brain lesions and no brain lesion greater than 3 cm in
      diameter, stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is the standard-of-care. By delivering highly
      focal irradiation to melanoma brain metastases, SRS confers local control rates exceeding
      80% for lesions under 2 cm in diameter.  However, SRS does not treat micrometastatic disease
      in the brain, and new brain metastases develop in approximately half of patients treated.

      Furthermore, local control rates are lower for lesions larger than 2 cm in diameter.  As a
      result, the median overall survival for melanoma patient treated with SRS is only 7 months.

      BRAF mutant melanoma

      The RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway is a critical proliferation pathway in many human cancers.  This
      pathway can be constitutively activated by alterations in specific proteins, including BRAF,
      which phosphorylates MEK1 and MEK2 on two regulatory serine residues.  Approximately 90% of
      all identified BRAF mutations that occur in human result in a V600 E/D/Kamino acid
      substitution.  This mutation appears to mimic regulatory phophorylation and increases BRAF
      activity approximately 10-fold compared to wild type.  BRAF mutations have been identified
      at a high frequency in specific cancers, including approximately 40-60% of melanoma.  The
      frequency of this activating mutation and the pathway addiction to which it leads makes
      mutated BRAF an extremely attractive target.

             her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician
             immediately.  Men treated or enrolled on this protocol who are sexually active with
             women of child bearing potential must also agree to use adequate contraception prior

          9. Patients with metastases within 2 mm of the optic nerve or optic chiasm so that some
             portion of the optic nerve or chiasm would receive &gt; 9 Gy from radiosurgery.

         10. Patients with metastases in the brainstem.

         11. Contraindication to MRI (such as cardiac pacemaker).

         12. The following medications or non-drug therapies are prohibited:

                  (Pgp) or Bcrp transporter because they may alter dabrafenib concentrations.  The
                  list may be modified based on emerging data.  These include but are not limited
                  to those listed in Appendix 2; consider therapeutic substitutions for these
                  medications.

         13. Unresolved toxicity of National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for
             Adverse Events, version 4.0. Grade 2 or higher from previous anti-cancer therapy,

         14. Presence of active gastrointestinal disease or other condition that will interfere
             significantly with the absorption of drugs.  If clarification is needed as to whether
             a condition will significantly affect absorption of drugs, contact the GSK medical
             monitor for permission to enroll the subject.  PI has final decision regarding which
             subjects will be enrolled.

         15. A history of known Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), Hepatitis B Virus (HBV), or

             Association (NYHA) functional classification system; abnormal cardiac valve
             morphology documented by echocardiogram (subjects with minimal abnormalities
             including mild regurgitation/stenosis can be entered on study with approval from the
             GSK medical monitor); or history of known cardiac arrhythmias.

         18. Uncontrolled medical conditions (i.e, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, etc),
             psychological, familial, sociological, or geographical conditions that do not permit
             compliance with the protocol; or unwillingness or inability to follow the procedures
             required in the protocol.
