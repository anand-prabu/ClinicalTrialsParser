            "textblock": "Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) is a relatively common procedure in pediatric patients\n      undergoing evaluation for various gastrointestinal ailments.  The procedure itself, with or\n      without associated biopsies, is relatively short in length.  Unlike adults, who regularly\n      undergo this procedure with conscious sedation, children most often require general\n      anesthesia. While safe and effective, endotracheal tracheal tube (ETT) intubation of\n      children for EGD can result in delayed awakening and slow room turnover, particularly when\n      intravenous medications are required for intubation.  Laryngeal mask airway (LMA) is an\n      alternative to intubation, which permits removal before full awakening.\n\n      Although considered a safe alternative to tracheal intubation in appropriate cases,\n      disadvantages of the LMA have been reported including kinking, occluding view of the\n      surgical field, failure of placement requiring tracheal intubation, aspiration of gastric\n      contents, desaturation, and laryngospasm. The study was designed to determine whether use of\n      an LMA for EGD could reduce operating room time, while providing satisfactory conditions for\n      the endoscopist, and an equivalent side effect and safety profile as compared to ETT in\n      otherwise healthy children with gastrointestinal complaints"
