Part A is designed to evaluate the safety and PK of\n      multiple-dose administration of ivacaftor in subjects 2 through 5 years of age and to\n      confirm the doses for Part B. Part B is designed to evaluate the safety, PK, PD, and\n      efficacy of ivacaftor in subjects 2 through 5 years of age.\n\n      Ivacaftor is currently approved by the US FDA and the EMA under the trade name Kalydeco\u00ae for\n      the treatment of cystic fibrosis in patients 6 years of age and older who have the\n      G551D-CFTR mutation"
