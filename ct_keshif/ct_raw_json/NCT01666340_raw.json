Generation 100 will be the first randomized,\n      controlled clinical study where the primary objective is to study the effects of exercise\n      training on morbidity and mortality in the elderly.  Furthermore, the researchers will\n      investigate  whether there is a relationship between the exercise intensity and health\n      benefits, with particular focus on major health problems in the elderly population.  In\n      addition to being a study, this is also an initiative to improve public health in all\n      healthy individuals between 70-75 years of age in the Trondheim municipality.  The\n      participants will either be randomized to supervised exercise or follow current guidelines\n      for physical activity on their own.  Clinical examinations, as well as questionnaires, will\n      be administered to all participants at baseline, after one year, after three years, and\n      after five years.  Additionally, participants will be followed-up by linking to relevant\n      registers for up to 20 years.\n\n      Also data will be collected with the purposes of (a) investigating genetic predisposition\n      for fitness and cardiovascular diseases, and (b) identification of potential targets for\n      therapies.\n\n      The study seeks to determine if exercise training gives the seniors a longer active and\n      healthy life."
