The primary objective is to determine whether IL administration of BCG followed by\n      intravenous (IV) infusion of ipilimumab is safe. Ipilimumab (YERVOY\u00ae) is the monoclonal\n      anti-CTLA-4 antibody approved by the FDA and TGA as anticancer therapy for melanoma.\n      Secondary objectives of the study are: a) clinical efficacy, to document whether this\n      combination therapy induces tumour responses; and b) immunogenicity, to identify if the\n      combination induces immune responses against the tumours.  All patients will be included in\n      the analysis of efficacy and immunogenicity.\n\n      Cohort 1 (9 patients with <10mm induration after tuberculin Purified Protein Derivative\n      [PPD] test): Group 1 (3 patients) will receive one IL injection of 200 \u00b5l BCG containing\n      0.16 - 0.64 x 106 cfu followed by four IV infusions of 3 mg/kg ipilimumab every 3 weeks,\n      starting on day 36. Group 2 (3 patients) and 3 (n=3) will receive 200 \u00b5l BCG containing 0.8\n      - 3.2 x 106 cfu and 4.0 -16.0 x 106 cfu, respectively, followed by the same ipilimumab\n      regimen. Safety will be evaluated in this cohort.\n\n      Cohort 2 (up to 9 patients with \u226510mm induration after PPD test): Enrolment will start after\n      the final patient in Cohort 1, Group 1 has reached study week 7. Then enrolment can proceed\n      in parallel for Cohort 2 and Cohort 1 Groups 2 and 3.  Patients will receive 0.16 -0.64 x\n      106 cfu BCG followed by four IV infusions of 3 mg/kg ipilimumab every 3 weeks, starting on\n      day 36.

The exact mechanism of action is not well known, but study data suggest that active non-specific immune responses are induced.  It is probable that BCG invokes a local inflammatory response involving a variety of immune cells, such as macrophages, natural killer cells and T cells",
