However, no study to date has measured and compared physiological\n      parameters such as mastication, salivary amylase activity, gastric emptying rates and gut\n      microbiota in a multi-ethnic Asian population, with varying prevalence of obesity and T2DM.\n      The aim of this study is to investigate ethnic differences in GR and IR as well as the GI\n      values of foods. Additionally, we aim to examine how physiological digestive factors\n      contribute to inter-ethnic and inter-individual variability in GR and IR. The study outcomes\n      can potentially explain, in part, the varying susceptibility to obesity, T2DM and DM control\n      between Chinese, Malays and Asian-Indians in Singapore, as reflected by the differences in\n      prevalence of obesity, T2DM and DM control among the three local ethnic groups."
