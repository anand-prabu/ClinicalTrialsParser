            "textblock": "Introduction: There is evidence that demonstrate the beneficial effects of pulmonary\n      rehabilitation programs (PR) on symptoms, exercise capacity, muscle strength and quality of\n      life in patients with Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The majority of the\n      studies used high intensity endurance and strength exercise training on land.  Exercise on\n      water is an effective form of training that has been used for decades for rehabilitation in\n      different chronic conditions. In addition, there are promising preliminary results on the\n      literature regarding aquatic training in patients with COPD. However, several gaps remain.\n\n      Aim: Compare the effects of two rehabilitation programs with 6 months of duration in\n      patients with COPD on physical activity in daily life and balance: land versus water.\n\n      Methods: The sample will consist of 60 patients with COPD diagnosed according to the GOLD\n      criteria, 50 years old or more and clinically stable.\n\n      Patients will be evaluated in 3 different moments: before the PR, after the PR and 6 months\n      after the end of the PR (follow up). In addition to the assessment of physical activity in\n      daily life and balance, the investigators will also evaluate pulmonary function, peripheral\n      and respiratory muscle strength, body composition, maximal and submaximal exercise capacity,\n      functional status and quality of life.\n\n      Both groups (land or water) will be submitted for 3 sessions of exercise training per week,\n      with 45 minutes of duration, during 6 months. The sessions of both groups include the same\n      exercises sequence. Endurance exercise training will be performed on a bicycle and walking\n      on land and strength training using free weights. Workload will be established according to\n      the tests performance on assessment and progression will follow a predetermined schedule and\n      adjusted according symptoms. On water the same approach will be followed.\n\n      Expected results: the investigators expect improvement in terms of symptoms, exercise\n      capacity, muscle strength, quality of life, functional status and physical activity in daily\n      life at the end of the two training protocols. However, it is unclear whether one training\n      protocol will be superior than the other. Due to the characteristics involved in the aquatic\n      training, the investigators hypothesized that this type of training can result in better\n      results on balance."
