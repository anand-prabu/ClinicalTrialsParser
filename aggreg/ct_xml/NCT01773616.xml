  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The treatment of the multisystem autoimmune disease systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)
      remains a challenge, particularly when there is renal involvement (lupus nephritis). For the
      last 60 years corticosteroids have been the backbone of the treatment of lupus nephritis but
      they are associated with significant toxicity.

      Although randomized placebo controlled trials of Rituximab in non-renal lupus and lupus
      nephritis did not meet their primary end-points, there is accumulating data that suggests
      that B cell depletion with Rituximab may be efficacious in lupus disease refractory to
      conventional therapy. Furthermore, our pilot data suggests that the addition of Rituximab to
      mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) without oral steroids is at least as effective at inducing a
      renal response as the standard of care therapy comprising MMF and high dose oral
      corticosteroids.

      RITUXILUP is a proof of concept, open labeled, randomized, controlled, multicentre trial
      that aims to demonstrate whether the addition of Rituximab to MMF therapy is useful in
      treating a new flare of lupus nephritis and whether it has a long lasting steroid-sparing,
      beneficial effect with equal efficacy and greater safety than a conventional regimen of MMF
      and oral prednisolone. If successful, this trial has the potential to dramatically change
      the management of lupus nephritis.
