  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We will examine the use of transcutaneous electrical stimulation of the lumbosacral spinal
      cord to: 1) assess spared function following a spinal cord injury; and, 2) use this same
      paradigm for rehabilitation. We hypothesize that the spinal cord below the level of injury
      can be activated to produce coordinated movement of the legs.

    <description>Subjects will be tested by several measures of sensory and motor function, as well as self assessments of spasticity, quality of life, and independence. These tests include:
American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) scoring system, Spinal Cord Independence Measure (SCIM), Ashworth Spasticity Scale, Penn Spasm Frequency, Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for Spasticity, Electromyographic (EMG) recordings, Joint angle (goniometer) measures, kinematic analysis.</description>

          -  Not dependent on ventilation support

          -  No painful musculoskeletal dysfunction, unhealed fracture, pressure sore, or urinary
