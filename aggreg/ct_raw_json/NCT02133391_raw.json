With a new RCCO-public health collaborative we will implement a\n      randomized controlled trial to test the effectiveness of 1) evidence-based collaborative\n      centralized method of increasing immunization delivery using reminder/recall techniques\n      versus 2) traditional practice-based reminder/recall techniques that are done by individual\n      practices (not centrally). These interventions have been previously developed by the study\n      team in different clinical settings.  The project will examine the collaborative centralized\n      approach, implemented within the new RCCO-public health collaborative first among preschool\n      children, the group in which it has been previously studied.  We will then extend the method\n      to new populations, including adolescents and adults within the RCCO, and will evaluate the\n      effectiveness of the intervention in each population."
