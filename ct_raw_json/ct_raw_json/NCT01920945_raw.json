NDPH is a\n      benign form of chronic daily headache that comes in two forms: one that resolves on its own\n      after months to years, or one that is difficult to treat and does not respond to preventive\n      or abortive medications. Some patients experience migrainous features such as nausea,\n      vomiting, photophobia, or phonophobia.  BOTOX\u00ae, a treatment approved for chronic migraine,\n      will be injected into specific muscles of the head and neck area by your study doctor, to\n      evaluate its effectiveness in reducing or relieving NDPH  days or severity. BOTOX has not\n      been approved for NDPH and this is the first time it will be used for treatment of NDPH. All\n      participants in this study will only receive BOTOX\u00ae and no other study drug."
