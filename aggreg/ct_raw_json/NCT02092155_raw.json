            "textblock": "An alternative and emerging treatment for malignant pleural effusions is the placement of a\n      chronic indwelling pleural catheter such as the Rocket\u00ae catheter.  The Rocket\u00ae catheter is a\n      16 French, 66 cm long, silicone catheter with side holes along its distal 24 cm.  The\n      proximal shaft has a polyester cuff designed to promote fibrosis in the subcutaneous tissue\n      into which it is tunneled.  This prevents dislodgement of the catheter and minimizes the\n      risk of infection.  The proximal end contains a self-sealing valve designed to enhance the\n      safety of the catheter.  The self-sealing valve prevents entry of air into the pleural space\n      and inadvertent leakage of pleural fluid unless the catheter is accessed with the matched\n      drainage line.   The matched drainage line is connected to a 600 milliliter vacuum bottle.\n      Pleural fluid is removed by inserting the access tip of the drainage line into the\n      self-sealing valve of the Rocket\u00ae catheter, allowing vacuum drainage of the pleural space.\n\n      As discussed above, tunneled pleural catheters (TPC) are ideal for treatment of MPE\n      associated with a trapped or non-expandable lung which will not have sufficient visceral and\n      parietal pleura apposition for chemical pleurodesis.  Transforming growth factor-Beta 1\n      (TGF-\u03b2) is a profibrotic cytokine, and a potent inducer of Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1\n      (PAI-1) in human pleural mesothelial cells. PAI-1 inhibits protease-dependent fibrinolytic\n      activity and along with TGF-\u03b2, its concentration is increased in exudative and tuberculous\n      pleural effusion. TGF-\u03b2 levels in pleural fluid have been shown to correlate with pleural\n      thickness in tuberculosis pleurisy and empyema in rabbits.\n\n      TGF-\u03b2 is a multifunctional cytokine primarily produced by mesothelial cells in the pleural\n      space, but can also originate from lung parenchymal macrophages that migrate to the pleural\n      space. In humans, TGF-\u03b2 consists of three isoforms (TGF-\u03b21, TGF-\u03b22, and TGF-\u03b23). They share\n      many biological activities and their actions on cells are qualitatively similar in most\n      cases.  TGF-\u03b2 stimulates the extracellular matrix production and studies support that TGF-\u03b2\n      over-production is a key regulator in pleural fibrosis and chemical pleurodesis. Moreover,\n      TGF-\u03b2 signaling for the production of PAI-1 is clearly noted in human mesothelial cells of\n      different origins. Different inflammatory stimuli in the pleural space including malignancy\n      and infection may activate TGF-\u03b2 up-regulation and enhanced production which in turns\n      results in PAI-1 expression."
