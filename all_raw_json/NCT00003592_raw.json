It is not yet known whether methotrexate or paclitaxel is more\n      effective in treating patients with advanced head and neck cancer.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of methotrexate with that\n      of paclitaxel in treating patients who have advanced head and neck cancer that cannot be\n      treated with cisplatin."

Compare the progression free survival, median survival, and overall survival\n      in cisplatin-ineligible patients with advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck\n      following weekly outpatient methotrexate (arm I) versus paclitaxel (arm II). II. Compare the\n      response rate of patients in the two treatment arms. III. Compare the Trial Outcome Index\n      scores of patients in the two treatment arms. IV. Compare the weight change, neurologic\n      toxicity, and mucositis scores of patients in the two treatment arms.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified by performance status (0-1 vs\n      2) and age (less than 60 vs at least 60). Patients are randomized to receive methotrexate IV\n      bolus every week for 4 weeks (arm I) or paclitaxel IV over 1 hour every week for 4 weeks\n      (arm II). All patients receive at least 4 weeks of treatment (1 course). Patients continue\n      treatment for a total of 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable\n      toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and\n      annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: There will be 230 patients accrued into this study over 2.4 years."
