Combining more than one drug, giving the drugs in different\n      ways, and combining biological therapy with chemotherapy may kill more cancer cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of topotecan, paclitaxel, and carboplatin\n      with or without filgrastim in treating patients who have advanced solid tumor or lymphoma\n      that has not responded to standard therapy."

Determine the maximum tolerated doses of combined topotecan, paclitaxel, and\n      carboplatin (TOPO/TAX/CBDCA) with or without filgrastim (G-CSF) in patients with advanced\n      solid tumors or lymphomas. II. Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these\n      patients. III. Determine the pharmacokinetics of TOPO/TAX/CBDCA and whether TAX/CBDCA will\n      affect the pharmacokinetics of TOPO on day 1 as compared to TOPO administered alone on day\n      3. IV. Describe any clinical responses observed in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of the combination\n      topotecan/paclitaxel/carboplatin. Patients are stratified according to prior chemotherapy\n      and radiotherapy (yes vs no). Part I: Patients receive topotecan IV on days 1-3 and\n      paclitaxel IV over 3 hours and carboplatin IV over 30-60 minutes, on day 1. Part II:\n      Patients receive topotecan, paclitaxel, and carboplatin as in part I, plus filgrastim\n      (G-CSF) on days 6-19. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression\n      or unacceptable toxicity Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of\n      topotecan/paclitaxel/carboplatin until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The\n      MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting\n      toxicity.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 20-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 4\n      years."
