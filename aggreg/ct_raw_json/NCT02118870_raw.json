            "textblock": "Background:\n\n      The optimal duration of dual antiplatelet therapy in ACS patients treated with DES is still\n      under debate. This is especially true for STEMI patients in the era of new anticoagulants\n      and antiplatelet agents. Yet, the potential benefits of longterm dual antiplatelet therapy\n      in avoiding thrombotic complications may be clearly counterbalanced by a higher risk of\n      major bleeding complications. In particular, the COMBO dual therapy stent, being associated\n      with early re-endothelization, may allow for a reduction of the duration of DAPT  (dual anti\n      plateled therapy) without increasing the thrombotic risk, while reducing the risk of severe\n      bleeding complications.\n\n      Study Objective:\n\n      Aim of the current study is to demonstrate a non-inferiority of a strategy of short-term\n      DAPT (3 months) as compared to standard 12-month DAPT in ACS patients treated with Combo\n      stent.\n\n      Study Design:\n\n      This study is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, investigator-initiated study designed\n      to enroll 1500 patients with ACS receiving a COMBO dual-therapy stent who will be randomized\n      1:1 to either short term (3 months) or to standard (12 months) DAPT. Patients will be\n      randomized within hospitalization (before discharge in case additional revascularization is\n      deemed necessary and performed during hospitalization). Clinical visit is scheduled at 3,\n      and 12 months, whereas a telephone contact will be performed at 6 and 24 months.\n\n      Patient Population:\n\n      The study population will consist of up to 1500 ACS patients (male and female) older than 18\n      years amenable to percutaneous treatment and treated with a COMBO stent. Subjects must meet\n      all of the eligibility criteria and provide written informed consent."
