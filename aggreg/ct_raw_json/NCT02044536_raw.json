Especially, in Korea where the stomach\n      cancer prevalent area, high-quality endoscopic examination is required not to overlook\n      pathologic lesions. Endoscopic biopsy is the gold standard for the confirmation of\n      endoscopic diagnosis. It is usually decided based on the abnormal morphology of the lesions\n      or color change of the mucosa. Diagnostic accuracy is known to be improved by training or\n      using optical techniques or chromoendoscopy. With the development of endoscopic imaging\n      technologies such as narrow band imaging (NBI), confocal imaging or magnifying techniques,\n      the diagnostic accuracy can be enhanced. However, inspection with conventional white light\n      endoscopy is still the most prevalent and basic form of screening or surveillance endoscopy.\n      Thus, detecting lesions by meticulous inspection and accurate approach by targeted biopsy\n      are important for the diagnosis of pathologic lesions. However, the optimal number of biopsy\n      and the detection rate of neoplastic lesions are not established. This study aimed at\n      evaluating the current practice pattern and effect of training in conventional upper\n      endoscopic biopsy."
