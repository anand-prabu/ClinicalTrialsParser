      This randomized phase II trial studies pomegranate-extract pill in preventing tumor growth
      in patients with prostate cancer that is limited to a certain part of the body (localized),
      who have chosen observation as their treatment plan. The use of pomegranate-extract pill may
      slow disease progression in patients with localized prostate cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the effect of pomegranate fruit extract (PFE) 1000 mg, taken daily for 1
      year, on the plasma levels of insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) from baseline to end of
      study (52 weeks) in participants undergoing active surveillance (AS) for early stage
      prostate cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess compliance with a once daily oral administration of PFE versus placebo over a
      52-week period of time.

      II. To assess the toxicity of PFE vs. placebo when taken daily for 52 weeks. III. To compare
      and correlate the modulation of the following biomarkers with response to PFE versus placebo
      on follow-up biopsy results performed at week 52 (or earlier if clinically indicated),
      including the presence or absence of tumor, the extent of tumor and Gleason scores; plasma
      biomarkers: Insulin-like growth factor 1/IGF binding protein 3 ratio (IGF-1/IGFBP-3 ratio);
      normal and abnormal prostate tissue biomarkers: prostate-specific antigen (PSA), IGFBP-3,
      apoptosis (TUNEL), proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R),
      8-hydroxy-2' -deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and androgen receptor.

      IV. Measure PFE constituents/metabolites in plasma and urine for evidence of accumulation
      (trough levels): ellagic acid, dimethyl ellagic acid, dimethyl ellagic acid glucuronide
      (DMEAG), urolithin A, urolithin A-glucuronide, urolithin B and urolithin B-glucuronide.

      V. Measure PSA doubling time (PSA DT) in serum, using the calculation provided on the
      Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center website.

      VI. To assess the feasibility of cancer chemoprevention trials in a population of men
      undergoing active surveillance for prostate cancer.

      VII. Measurement of serum testosterone.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I: Patients receive pomegranate-extract pill orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 52 weeks.

      GROUP II: Patients receive placebo PO QD for 52 weeks.
