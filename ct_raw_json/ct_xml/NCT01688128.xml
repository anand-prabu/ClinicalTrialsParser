  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the efficacy of the Ubiquitous Spaced
      Retrieval-based Memory Advancement and Rehabilitation Training (U-SMART) in the elderly
      individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) by an open-label, controlled, crossover
      Trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Spaced Retrieval-based Memory Advancement and Rehabilitation Training (SMART) which
      consisted of 24 one-hour face-to-face sessions (Lee, Park et al. 2009) was developed based
      on the spaced retrieval training (SRT), which was effective in improving memory retention
      span of very mild to mild Alzheimer's disease patients. The Ubiquitous SMART (U-SMART) by
      transforming the current SMART to a self-administered program using an application working
      on IPAD was developed, and showed its feasibility and efficacy in the elderly individuals
      with mild cognitive impairment in the preliminary study. (ClinicalTrials.gov ID:
      NCT01628653) To validate the efficacy of the U-SMART, an open-label, controlled, crossover
      design of clinical trial were planned in this study.
