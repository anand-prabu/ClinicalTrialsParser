            "textblock": "Increased production of free radicals and depletion of antioxidants are commonly observed in\n      diabetic patients. Based on animal studies, increased production of free radicals tends to\n      persist even after blood glucose is tightly controlled. The rationale of using a potent\n      antioxidant is based on the observation that increased oxidative stress associated with\n      hyperglycemia can contribute to cellular injury leading to apoptosis; consequently, leading\n      to diabetic retinopathy. Evidence from animal model showed that alpha lipoic acid (a potent\n      antioxidant) was effective for decreasing the progression of diabetic retinopathy and in\n      reducing free radicals.\n\n      Therefore, we hypothesize that therapy that can exert a powerful antioxidant activity can\n      provide a therapeutic modality needed to target the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy.\n\n      This study will be a 12-month pilot study demonstrating the role of alpha lipoic acid in\n      patients who have moderate non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy.\n\n      Eligible patients will be randomized to two groups, treatment and control groups. Patients\n      in the treatment group will receive 600 mg of alpha lipoic acid daily with routine care\n      while patient in control group will only follow routine care. Optical coherence tomography\n      (OCT)and electronic visual acuity testing algorithm (ETDRS) will be used to measure changes\n      in retinal thickness and visual acuity respectively. Blood changes in macrophage colony\n      stimulating factor (M-CSF), vascular endothelia growth factor (VEGF), Interferon 2 alpha,\n      interleukin 6 and 8 will also be evaluated and compared between the two groups. Descriptive\n      statistics and intention to treat analysis will be used to compare treatment and control\n      groups."
