To define the maximum tolerated dose of weekly docetaxel in combination with fixed-dose\n           oral STI571 in adult men with metastatic androgen-independent prostate cancer (AIPC).\n\n        2. To determine the qualitative and quantitative toxicity of the combination of oral\n           STI571 and docetaxel.\n\n        3. Evaluate PSA modulation with STI571 alone at thirty days in patients with AIPC.\n\n        4. Obtain a preliminary estimate of the response rate in AIPC to the combination of STI571\n           and docetaxel.\n\n        5. Obtain tissue for correlative science studies (these are optional studies)."

PSA- progression is defined as\n             2 consecutive increments in PSA (an absolute change of at least 1ng/mL) over 4 weeks.\n             An increase by 25% of the product of bidimensional disease qualifies as progression.\n             An increase in the number of metastatic lesions on bone scan qualifies as\n             progression.\n\n          -  All patients must have a minimum PSA of 1ng/ml.\n\n          -  Patients on antiandrogens should be discontinued from flutamide or nilutamide for at\n             least 4 weeks and bicalutamide for 8 weeks. If progression is documented as below\n             prior to this time interval, patients are eligible.\n\n          -  Patients must have a performance status of < 2 (ECOG).\n\n          -  Patients must have an expected survival from cancer or co-morbidity of at least three\n             months.\n\n          -  Patients may receive no concurrent chemotherapy, immunotherapy or ketoconazole.\n\n          -  Patients should not have received prior chemotherapy or radiation within the last 30\n             days and no Strontium or Samarium within the last 90 days.\n\n          -  Patients must have castrate serum testosterone levels (< 30ng/dl).
