  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to evaluate the impact of a text-message (SMS) program delivered to
      motorcycle drivers in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.  The SMS program, delivered by nonprofit
      Amend, sends daily reminders to motorcycle drivers to remind them to wear their helmets.  In
      this study, the investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial to see if this
      program leads to increased helmet use over time.  The investigators will recruit between
      350-400 motorcycle drivers to receive the text program. The investigators will obtain each
      of their cell phone numbers, and the participants will be split into three groups. The first
      group will receive reminders framed as social norming (ie &quot;Most of your peers wear
      helmets&quot;).  The second group will receive reminders framed as fear appeals (ie &quot;Not wearing
      your helmet increases your chance of dying in an accident&quot;). The third group will act as the
      control and receive texts that relate to general road safety, but not helmet use.  All
      groups will receive the same general road safety information being delivered to the control
      arm. The purpose of sending different types of reminders is to assess which type of messages
      are more likely to cause a motorcycle driver to regularly wear their helmet. The
      investigators will survey the participants at the initiation of the study and after weeks 3
      and 6 during the study, asking about their helmet use.  This will be a short survey, and any
      personal information gathered during the study (ie, phone numbers), will be securely stored
      so as to protect their privacy.
