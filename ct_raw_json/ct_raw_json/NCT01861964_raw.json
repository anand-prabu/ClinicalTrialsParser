XOS promotes gastrointestinal regularity and relieves\n      diarrhea and constipation at 0.7 g/d and 1.4 g/d, respectively.  Xylooligosaccharides may\n      also reduce blood cholesterol and may improve glycemic control, although more data from\n      clinical trials are needed to confirm preliminary findings."
