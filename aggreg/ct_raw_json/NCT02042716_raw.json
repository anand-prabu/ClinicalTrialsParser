            "textblock": "Preterm birth and perinatal events related can interrupt microscopic maturation of the\n      developing white matter leading to diffuse injury and subsequent neurocognitive impairments.\n      Brain maturation can be studied using diffusion tensor imaging but is difficult to assess\n      early after birth, repeatedly and at the bedside. Supersonic Shear wave Imaging (SSI) could\n      be of interest in this clinical setting. This technique, already investigated in adults\n      (breast, thyroid or liver fibrosis staging), has not been yet evaluated in neonates.\n\n      Objective:\n\n      To describe the feasibility and reproducibility of quantitative elasticity mapping in\n      preterm infants and to correlate to gestational age.\n\n      Methods:\n\n      SSI is a quantitative stiffness imaging technique based on the combination of a remote\n      palpation induced into tissues by the radiation force a focused ultrasonic beam and an\n      ultrafast ultrasound imaging sequence. Such ultrafast frame rates permit to track in real\n      time the displacements induced by the propagation of the resulting shear waves. For each\n      pixel, the shear wave speed can be estimated locally and enables quantitative mapping of the\n      local shear elasticity (characterizing the stiffness in kPa). In this study, we will use a\n      new generation of ultrafast ultrasound scanners (Aixplorer\u00ae, Supersonic Imagine, Aix en\n      Provence, France) with a linear L10-2 probe (256 elements, 6 MHz) in neonates born between\n      25 and 40 weeks' gestation (n=100). Three separate acquisitions will be obtained for each\n      area of interest both on right and left sides and stiffness was measured using a unique ROI\n      of 2.5 cm\u00b2."
