To assess acute and late toxicities from treatment.\n\n      II. To assess biochemical progression-free survival.\n\n      III. To collect prospective quality-of-life data related to bowel, urinary, and sexual\n      health.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.\n\n      Patients receive 5 fractions of SBRT over 1.5 weeks.\n\n      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 90 days and then\n      periodically for 3 years."
