      To demonstrate the substantial equivalence (SE) of Pefakit® PiCT® UC (test device, T) to
      aPTT-SP (Hemosil) (predicate device, P) in determining heparin levels in subjects undergoing
      heparin therapy in support of a United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 510(k)
      submission.

      Standard of Care Study. Objective is to monitor the patients' heparin levels under treatment
      with continuous unfractionated heparin infusions. Blood samples collections (4 ml) are
      required routinely. A proportion of this standard sample (leftover plasma) will be used for
      study purposes. About three samples will be analyzed which are collected within 2 - 4 days.
      Time points for blood sample collections will be defined by the treating physician according
      the local standard of care and will be associated exclusively to clinical considerations.
      Results of the Pefakit® PiCT® UC assay will NOT be used to take therapeutic decisions for
      study subjects.

        Subjects undergoing UFH anticoagulation therapy will are needed for this study. Typically,
        such patients are undergoing cardiovascular surgery, are being treated for thromboembolic
        events, or are receiving heparin intravenously for thrombosis prophylaxis due to its more
        advantageous pharmacokinetic profile in some situations.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects receiving a continuous infusion with UFH

          -  Subjects who have given written informed consent (unless written informed consent is
             waived by local regulations or local EC/IRB)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects treated with any other anticoagulants other than UFH

          -  Subjects who have been undergoing fibrinolytic therapy within the previous 4 weeks

          -  Subjects who are known to have a congenital bleeding disorder

          -  Subjects known to present unexplained prolongations of clotting time

          -  Subjects known to have coagulation factor deficiencies

          -  Patient participating or who has participated within one month from enrolment in
             another investigational study
