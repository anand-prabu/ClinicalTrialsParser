DENV\n      Detect\u2122 NS1 ELISA and rapid test results (positive or negative) must be confirmed by testing\n      with a reference standard test.\n\n      This study will use archived, leftover human serum samples that have been sequentially\n      collected from areas non-endemic for Dengue infection. Each specimen must have been\n      collected within the first 7 days of symptoms, and must be accompanied by clinical data\n      demonstrating that the individual had symptoms consistent with Dengue infection. The samples\n      will have no personally identifiable information.\n\n      ELISAs and reference tests will be performed by different operators who are laboratory staff\n      members. These staff members, blinded to each other's results, will evaluate the samples\n      from each method independently."
