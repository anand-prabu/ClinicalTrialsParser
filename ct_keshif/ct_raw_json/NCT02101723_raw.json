The proposed subjects are 9 month olds living\n      in a malaria endemic area of rural Kenya who are randomized at 6 months of age to one of\n      three fortificant groups: 1) Sprinkles\u2122 with 12mg Fe/day + other micronutrients, including\n      5mg/d Zn (test);   Sprinkles\u2122 with 0 mg/d Fe + other micronutrients, including 5mg/d Zn\n      (control);   Sprinkles\u2122 with no micronutrients (placebo).  The investigators hypothesize\n      that the microbiome will be significantly different in the three groups and that Zn\n      absorption and status, in addition to immune and oxidant status will be improved in the\n      non-Fe fortified groups when compared to the Fe-fortified group."
