Eligible patients (as per screening\n      visit) will be randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to Febuxostat or Allopurinol. The\n      double-blind treatment period starts two days prior to the planned beginning of chemotherapy\n      and continues for 7 to 9 consecutive days, according to Investigator judgment and on the\n      basis of the actual duration of chemotherapy regimen administered to the patient.  Along the\n      study treatment, uric acid levels, creatinine levels, Laboratory TLS/Clinical TLS and\n      Adverse Events represent the major clinical findings to be monitored on a daily basis.\n      Overall the study encompasses 10 to 11 planned visits at site, including screening,\n      randomisation, on treatment and final follow up visits."
