            "textblock": "The transition from acute low back pain to chronic low back pain has been shown to be a\n      result of changes in brain circuitry. Learning mechanisms give rise to the transition from\n      acute to chronic pain and render the pain to become more emotional. The aim of this study is\n      to further explore the idea that persistent pain, following an inciting injury, leads to an\n      aversive learning signal that reorganizes the brain into a chronic pain state. We\n      hypothesize that blocking the emotional/motivational learning response triggered by\n      peripheral nerve injury in a critical time window will decrease the probability of\n      transition to chronic pain. The primary hypothesis to be tested in the study is that early\n      treatment with Carbidopa/Levodopa and Naproxen in individuals with sub-acute back pain (SBP)\n      should decrease related reorganization and block transition to chronic back pain (CBP). This\n      will be done through a 6 month, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, three-arm,\n      parallel-group trial of the pharmacological treatment Carbidopa/Levodopa for individuals (N\n      = 200) with sub-acute back pain (SBP). A baseline MRI scan will be used to determine each\n      subject's pain type and group assignment. Individuals with recovering sub-acute back pain\n      will be observed over 6 months. Individuals with a persisting sub-acute back pain will be\n      randomized to receive either 12 weeks of Carbidopa/Levodopa plus naproxen or placebo plus\n      naproxen. The main outcome measurements will be the results of MRI scans at the baseline and\n      final visit, assessment of back pain by the VAS pain scale, as well as pain assessment\n      through self-reported questionnaires."
