  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether breathing in helium reduces indications of
      injury to the skeletal muscle seen in blood tests after knee replacement surgery.

      The ability to reduce the risk of skeletal muscle injury may help improve patient safety by
      providing protection to the area of the body having its blood supply interrupted during a
      particular surgery.

    <textblock>
      During hospitalization, beginning the day after surgery, additional tests will be added to
      the daily standard of care blood samples. When daily blood samples are not ordered as part
      of a study participants care after surgery, blood samples only for the study tests, may be
      done.

      Up to 120 study participants will be selected to be in one of four possible groups.

      After hospital discharge the study participants physical therapist will be contacted for
      copies of the notes and reports about the participants progress in physical therapy. This
      information will be used to evaluate if the different breathing gases have any impact on how
      quickly people recover after surgery.
