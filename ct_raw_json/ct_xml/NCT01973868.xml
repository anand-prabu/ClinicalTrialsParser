    <description>In the Intermittent-Regorafenib arm, regorafenib will be administered once daily on Days 1-21 of each 28-day Cycle (3 weeks on / 1 week off). The starting dose of regorafenib is 120 mg q.d., if this is tolerable in combination with cetuximab the dose will be escalated to 160 mg q.d.; if it is not tolerated the dose will be de-escalated to 80 mg q.d.
Subjects in each cohort first receive a single dose of regorafenib (at the assigned dose level) on Pre-cycle Day -14 (±2 days) and an initial i.v. infusion of cetuximab (loading dose of 400 mg/ m2 BSA) on Pre-cycle Day -7.
The treatment of regorafenib in combination with cetuximab maintenance dose (250 mg/m2 BSA) starts on Cycle 1 Day 1.
Cetuximab infusions will be given in a once-weekly dosing-regimen as approved.</description>

    <description>In the Continuous-Regorafenib arm, regorafenib will be administered once daily on Days 1-28 of each 28-day Cycle with no break between the cycles. If the starting dose of intermittent-Regorafenib arm in combination with cetuximab was tolerated, the continuous-Regorafenib arm will start with the dose of 100 mg q.d; if the starting dose of the intermittent arm was not tolerated, the dose will start with 60 mg q.d. Subjects in each cohort first receive a single dose of regorafenib (at the assigned dose level) on Pre-cycle Day -14 (±2 days) and an initial i.v. infusion of cetuximab (loading dose of 400 mg/ m2 BSA) on Pre-cycle Day -7. The treatment of regorafenib in combination with cetuximab maintenance dose (250 mg/m2 BSA) starts on Cycle 1 Day 1.

               -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤ 2.5 x ULN
                  (≤ 5 x ULN for subjects with liver involvement of their cancer)

               -  Alkaline phosphatase limit ≤ 2.5 x ULN (≤ 5 x ULN for subjects whose cancer
                  involves their liver).

               -  Amylase and lipase ≤ 1.5 x ULN

               -  Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 times ULN and creatinine clearance (CLcr) ≥ 30 mL/min
