            "textblock": "Radiation therapy (RT) is used as an effective local treatment modality to inhibit cell\n      proliferation, induce cell death and suppress tumor growth. To improve the treatment\n      outcome, in terms of both locoregional control and survival, the concurrent use of\n      chemotherapy during radiation therapy (CCRT) is now the standard treatment for various\n      malignancies, especially locally advanced cancers. Among the drugs used to enhance RT\n      effect, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) is one of the most commonly used chemotherapeutic agents of\n      CCRT.\n\n      In the past, RT was solely used as a local treatment and its effect was estimated by local\n      effect model. However, growing evidence shows that irradiation has direct DNA\n      damage-dependent effects as well as sending signals to neighboring cells. Recently, we\n      reported that abdominal irradiation could significantly modulate the systemic\n      pharmacokinetics of 5-FU at 0.5 Gy, off-target area in clinical practice, and at 2 Gy, the\n      daily treatment dose for target treatment in an experimental rat model. Additionally, the\n      results from a clinical investigation showed that colorectal cancer patients with lower AUC\n      of 5-FU during adjuvant chemotherapy had lower disease-free survival. Taken together, these\n      lines of evidence support the importance and necessity to search for the mediators\n      responsible for the unexpected effect of local RT on systemic pharmacokinetics of\n      chemotherapeutic agents, such as 5-FU.\n\n      In the present study, the investigators investigated whether the phenomena and mechanism of\n      RT-PK is a fact for different anticancer drugs in human."
