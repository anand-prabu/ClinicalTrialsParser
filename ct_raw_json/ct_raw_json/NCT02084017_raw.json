The device itself consists of open-cell foam that is\n      sealed with an occlusive adhesive dressing (covers and sticks to the incision) and suction\n      is maintained by connecting suction tubes to a vacuum pump and waste collector.\n\n      The investigators objectives are to determine whether there will be any reduction in\n      surgical site infection and this potential reduction will influence length of hospital stay,\n      emergency room visits, antibiotic use and need for re-operation."
