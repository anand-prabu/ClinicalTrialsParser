  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized study is to determine if the home SDHD is a suitable
      alternative to conventional dialysis performed in a dialysis center for patients suffering
      from chronic kidney disease from terminal Home Automated Peritoneal Dialysis (HAPD).

      The adequacy of this alternative dialysis technique confirms that the SDHD at home is a
      viable option for patients coming from HAPD and indeed support the clinical benefits of home
      SDHD compared with those of conventional dialysis: lowering blood pressure and lower use of
      antihypertensive drugs , improving the quality of life, maintenance of residual renal
      function related to a reduced risk of death and reduction in operating costs of dialysis and
      patient transport.

      Conventional Hemodialysis - 3 treatments per week for approximately 4 hours- will be
      performed in a dialysis clinic using any hemodialysis machine. Short Daily Hemodialysis - 5
      or 6 treatments per week for approximately 2-4 hours per treatment- will be performed in the
      patient's home, using any hemodialysis machine. Partecipants randomized to SDHD will undergo
      an intensive home hemodialysis training program expected to take 2-6 weeks to complete.
      Qualified healthcare professionals will train each SDHD subject's partner to perform
      dialysis using any hemodialysis machine as chosen by clinicians.  At baseline visit, before
      the first study treatment in either the SDHD or CHD arm, the following data will be
      collected: demographic information, ESRD history, EuroQol EQ-5D-5L questionnaire, vital
      sign, blood laboratory test results, KT/V parameters, 24 hour timed urine collection test
      results, comorbid conditions, vascular access type, current medications. After hemodialysis
      start, patients will be followed up to 12 months with data collection at 1, 3,6 and 12
      months. At each visit, the following data will be collected:  EuroQol EQ-5D-5L
      questionnaire, vital sign, blood laboratory test results, KT/V parameters, 24 hour timed
      urine collection test results, adverse events, vascular access type, current medications.
      During this study, the following parameters will be strictly monitored: treatment costs,
      medications, number of hospitalization admissions, number of days in hospital and reasons
      for hospitalizations, additional costs informations.

      Home hemodialysis could be an integrated therapeutic option favoring the de-hospitalization
      of patients requiring hemodialysis. Aim of this study is to offer the patient a better
      quality of life, to create the conditions for an improvement in blood pressure, phosphate
      control, of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and to reduce costs for the National
      Health Service.
