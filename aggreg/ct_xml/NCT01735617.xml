  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to gather safety and effectiveness information about a new
      formulation of Hydrocortisone (Chronocort®) used to treat patients with a disease called
      congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). Hydrocortisone is the man-made version of the hormone
      cortisol, which is released in the body following a regular daily pattern. The objective of
      the study is to measure the levels of hydrocortisone that are absorbed into the bloodstream
      once Chronocort® is taken and what affects it has on other hormones in the body. Since
      Chronocort® is anticipated to mimic the same release pattern of cortisol in the body, it is
      hoped that patients with CAH will be treated more effectively to manage their disease.

      This study is a Phase 2 pilot study to characterize and examine the pharmacokinetics and
      efficacy profile of Chronocort® in adults with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH).  It is
      designed as a two-part, single cohort, open label, multiple dose Phase 2 pilot study to:
      (Part A) characterize and examine the pharmacokinetics (PK) and disease bio-marker behavior
      following short-term dosing with Chronocort®; and to (Part B) examine the disease control
      after six months dose titration with Chronocort® in adults with CAH.
