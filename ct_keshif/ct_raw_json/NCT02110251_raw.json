So far, treatment strategies\n      focused on the preservation of life and limb by an open surgical or endovascular\n      revascularization, together with cardiovascular risk management and pain relief. Important\n      modifiable factors related to mortality and morbidity are not covered in the current\n      national and international guidelines. This study investigates the effects on mobility,\n      mortality and quality of life with supplementation of the standard treatment of critical\n      limb ischemia  with supervised exercise therapy. Also a reduction of cardiovascular risk by\n      intensive risk factor management and lifestyle coaching will be taken in to account. The\n      supervised exercise therapy will take place under the supervision of a trained\n      physiotherapist."
