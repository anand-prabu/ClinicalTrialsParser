FMS has recently been estimated to affect\n      approximately 2.6% of the Israeli population. Over the last decade, it has repeatedly been\n      shown that Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) of the primary motor cortex (M1) induces\n      an analgesic effect both in experimental pain, as well as in various chronic pain\n      conditions, possibly by activating intrinsic pain-modulation systems.\n\n      Thus, the purpose of this study is to explore the efficacy of H1 deep TMS for the treatment\n      of FMS patients. In addition, the investigators attempt to assess the effect of dTMS on the\n      perception and modulation of pain in patients suffering from FMS.\n\n      The study will take place in Shalvata Mental Health Center, After receiving the hospital's\n      BRI approval. Forty FMS patients between 18-65 years of age will sign an informed consent\n      form, and be randomized to an active arm (dTMS) and a placebo arm (sham-dTMS).  Twenty\n      treatments will be delivered to each subject over a period of 4 weeks. At base-line subjects\n      will complete a series of epidemiological and clinical questionnaires (assessing symptoms of\n      FMS, depression, pain, anxiety), as well as pain sensation and modulation tests.  At the\n      termination of the study and two weeks after the final treatment all questionnaires and\n      physical measurements will be re-administered for a final assessment of post-treatment\n      status comparison with initial status The importance of the study lies in its potential to:\n      1) provide evidence for the efficacy of dTMS in treating patients suffering from FMS\n      2)enhance the investigators understanding of the pathophysiology of FMS and its underlying\n      pain perception and modulation mechanisms 3) explore the role of the\n      Dorso-Lateral-Prefrontal-Cortex (DLPC) in modulating pain and as a possible target to\n      further therapeutic interventions in FMS."
