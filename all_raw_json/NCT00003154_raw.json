Determine whether aminocamptothecin colloidal dispersion (AC/CD) administered\n      as a 120 hour weekly infusion is an effective treatment for advanced non-small cell lung\n      cancer. II. Observe any toxicities associated with this treatment in this patient\n      population.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients receive a 120 hour continuous infusion of aminocamptothecin colloidal\n      dispersion (AC/CD) once a week for 2 weeks, followed by 1 week of rest. Patients are\n      assessed after every 2 courses of therapy. Treatment with aminocamptothecin continues\n      indefinitely if there is tumor shrinkage or stable disease and no significant toxicity is\n      experienced. Patients are followed every 3 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 19-36 patients will be accrued for this study."
