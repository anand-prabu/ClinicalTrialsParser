Diagnosis remains only microscopic and\n      lesions are irreversible. Recent studies prove that there is a strong correlation between\n      CTG and antibody mediated rejection (AMR) with a possible link with chronic aggression of\n      the endothelial cell. However, for unknown reason, all AMR does not lead to a CTG. Our\n      recent data on mice demonstrated that ephrin-B1 is expressed in the glomerular endothelial\n      cells and knockout mice for the gene encoding ephrin-B1 develop progressively\n      ultrastructural glomerular lesions close to modifications observed in CTG, as well as\n      proteinuria and chronic renal failure, suggesting that ephrin B1 could participate to CTG.\n      Moreover, in a preliminary study on human kidney transplant biopsy we observed decrease in\n      ephrin-B1 immunofluorescence on glomerulus when CTG, even in low grade. These data, and\n      ultrastructural modifications in Knock Out (KO) mice suggest that early regulation of kidney\n      expression of ephrin-B1 in the glomerulus may occur during the process leading to the CTG as\n      antibody-mediated kidney rejection (AMR).\n\n      The purpose of the study is to determinate if ephrin-B1 expression is modified in CTG."
