Our current intravenous (IV) fats do not contain the long chain fatty acids\n      and different milk sources have different compositions.  We would like to evaluate lactating\n      mothers dietary intake and breastmilk level of fatty acid status by doing an analysis of\n      their blood and breastmilk samples after they have been supplemented with a currently used\n      fatty acid supplement (DHA- Martek Biosciences, now known as DSM Nutritional Lipid) The DHA\n      supplement is available over the counter.\n\n      The information learned from this research study may benefit other mothers and babies in the\n      future.  The information could help make sure premature babies are receiving the right\n      nutrients they need for appropriate growth and development."
