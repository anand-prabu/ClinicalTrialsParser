  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to examine the ability of dermal rejuvenation therapies to
      protect geriatric skin from ultraviolet light (UVB)-induced carcinogenesis.  Skin cancers
      (including basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma) are the most common types of
      malignancy and are related to UVB exposure in sunlight.  UVB-irradiation of skin causes
      specific DNA damage to keratinocytes that can lead to cancer-causing mutations if they are
      allowed to persist in proliferating cells.  Moreover, the incidence of skin cancers is much
      greater in elderly over younger individuals. The objective of the present study is to build
      upon our previous data and test the effect of a non ablative Nd:YAG laser (LaserGenesis) of
      a localized area of skin on dermal IGF-1 production and UVB-mediated keratinocyte effects.
      Treatment of skin using a non ablative high-peak power microsecond pulsed 1064 nm Nd:YAG
      laser (Cutera's LaserGenesisTM laser) leads to papillary dermal heating. The laser targets
      the microvasculature and stimulates collagen production while protecting the epidermis.
      Generally, Laser Genesis is used clinically to improve irregularities in the contour,
      texture, and color of the skin.  Laser Genesis is also used to help treat photoaging by
      increasing collagen formation, suggesting that it stimulates fibroblast activity and thus
      possibly increases levels of protective IGF-1.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Only subjects older than 65 years will be enrolled.

          -  Subject's skin type must be &quot;Fair&quot;, Fitzpatrick type I or II.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who have underlying diseases that could affect wound healing (eg, diabetes
             mellitus)

          -  on medications that are known photosensitizers,

          -  or have a history of abnormal scarring (eg, keloids) will be excluded.

        Subjects will be asked the screening questions below as part of the inclusion/exclusion
        criteria

          -  How old are you?

          -  Do you regularly use tanning beds?

          -  Are you being treated with light therapy?

          -  Have you had any diseases that got worse when you went in the sun?

          -  Are you taking any medications that warn you to stay out of the sun?

          -  Have you ever had a reaction to medications that were applied to your skin?

          -  When cuts or wounds on your skin heal, are the scars abnormally large or take a long
             time to heal?

          -  Do you have diabetes mellitus or have you ever had high blood sugar?
