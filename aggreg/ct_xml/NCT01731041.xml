  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Platelets are parts of your blood that stick together to help form a clot. The stickier your
      platelets are, the greater your chance of having a heart attack. A clot in the wrong place
      can lead to a heart attack or stroke. Ticagrelor (Brilinta) keeps platelets from sticking
      together and it helps people from having a heart attack. The American College of Cardiology
      has recommended a combination of aspirin and Brilinta as one of the best treatments for the
      prevention of heart attacks, and death in patients who have had a heart attack or coronary
      stents. However, it is unknown if Brilinta may improve its work to keep platelets from
      sticking together giving a loading dose in patients already treated with Brilinta. A loading
      dose is a one-time increased dose of the same drug. The purpose of this study is to
      demonstrate whether the platelets of patients treated with Brilinta become less sticky when
      Brilinta is re-loaded.

    <textblock>
      A higher degree of platelet inhibition remains the goal of peri-interventional and long-term
      anti-thrombotic therapy in patients with coronary artery disease. Previous observations have
      shown that in patients on clopidogrel therapy undergoing percutanoues coronary intervention
      who get re-loaded with clopidogrel obtain enhanced platelet inhibition. Ticagrelor
      represents a new class of nonthienopyridine platelet inhibitors designed to address the
      limitations of current oral antiplatelet therapy, which has been recently approved for
      clinical use. However, to date it is unknown if greater inhibition of platelet aggregation
      can be achieved by adding a ticagrelor loading dose in patients already on maintenance
      ticagrelor therapy (90 mg twice daily). In addition, how to manage patients undergoing
      coronary interventions already on chronic ticagrelor therapy with regards to ticagrelor
      loading is an emerging clinical question which has yet to be explored. Therefore,
      understanding the pharmacodynamic implications of a ticagrelor re-load strategy in patients
      on already on chronic ticagrelor therapy is warranted. The scope of the present study is to
      evaluate the impact of ticagrelor re-load in patients on chronic ticagrelor therapy. A total
      of 60 patients will be randomized into one of the following two arms of treatment: 1) 90 mg
      of ticagrelor; 2) 180 mg of ticagrelor. Pharmacodynamic assessments will be performed at
      baseline, 1-hour and 4-hour after dosing administration. Comparison between baseline and
      4-hour values in term of platelet P2Y12 reactivity index determined by whole blood
      vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein will be the primary end-point of the study. Secondary
      endpoints will include other pharmacodynamic measures.
