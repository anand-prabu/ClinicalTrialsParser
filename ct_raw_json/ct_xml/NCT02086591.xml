      The purpose of this study is to determine whether doxycycline is effective in the treatment
      of relapsed Non Hodgkin Lymphomas (NHL).

      The long-term objective of this proposal is to develop more effective and less toxic
      therapeutic approaches for relapsed and refractory Non Hodgkin Lymphomas (NHL). Given the
      incurability of indolent lymphomas, innovative strategies for treatment are needed. For
      aggressive lymphomas such as Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL), novel treatments are
      particularly relevant since one third of patients have disease that will relapse or is
      refractory to standard therapy. Outcomes for this remaining group of patients are very poor.
      To address this unmet need, we have identified the antimicrobial agent doxycycline as a
      novel drug repurposed for lymphoma treatment based on results from a small molecule screen
      against Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL). Through preclinical work in his laboratory,
      my basic science collaborator Dr. Jiyong Zhao has found that doxycycline inhibits
      proliferation and survival in both activated B cell (ABC) type and germinal center B (GCB)
      type Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) cell lines, as well as in Burkitt lymphoma (BL)
      and follicular lymphoma (FL) cell lines. Based on this preliminary data, we propose an open
      label, single center phase II study of doxycycline in patients with relapsed Non Hodgkin
      Lymphomas (NHL). We have selected a dose and schedule (200 mg BID by mouth daily) based on
      maximum antimicrobial dose use, and acceptance of tolerability in several studies. The
      planned correlative studies should help to identify potential biomarkers for response to
      doxycycline, such as plasma matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9), and provide further insight
      into potential mechanisms of doxycyline action hypothesized from results of prior laboratory
      studies.

    <description>To investigate change in plasma matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) levels as a biomarker of treatment response; to assess plasma matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and correlate to response in order to test the hypothesis that elevated intratumoral levels of plasma matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) can predict response to doxycycline. To assess activation/expression of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kb) and Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT 3) pathways in archived tumor by immunohistochemistry (IHC) to predict response or resistance to doxycycline.</description>
