  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study investigators are studying the effects of a drug called ketamine on the
      symptoms of Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and whether those effects can be extended
      using exposure and response prevention therapy (EX/RP).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a common psychiatric illness that affects up to 2-3%
      of the population. People with OCD experience anxiety-provoking, intrusive thoughts, known
      as obsessions, and feel compelled to perform repetitive behaviors, or compulsions. The only
      medications approved for OCD are serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs), but even with SRI
      treatment, most patients continue to experience significant OCD symptoms, impaired
      functioning, and diminished quality of life. Recent studies have found that a single IV
      infusion of ketamine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist, can lead to rapid
      improvement in OCD symptoms (within hours) which can persist for a week or longer in some
      patients. An important next step in this line of research is to find ways of extending this
      effect. This proof-of-concept study will investigate whether a condensed course of EX/RP can
      extend the effects of ketamine on the symptoms of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) in
      adults aged 18-55.
