            "textblock": "Nearly 40% of patients with colorectal cancer who receive oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy\n      experience neuropathy (nerve damage that can include numbness, pain, and/or loss of motor\n      function). Sometimes, this nerve damage is serious enough that the chemotherapy dose has to\n      be lowered or stopped completely.  Researchers want to find out if taking minocycline can\n      lower the side effects caused by chemotherapy given to treat colorectal cancer.\n\n      Study Groups:\n\n      If you agree to take part in this study, you will be randomly assigned (as in the flip of a\n      coin) to 1 of 2 groups.  You will have an equal chance of being in either group:\n\n        -  If you are in Group 1, you will take a placebo.\n\n        -  If you are in Group 2, you will take minocycline.\n\n      Neither you nor the study staff will know if you are receiving the study drug or the\n      placebo.  However, if needed for your safety, the study staff will be able to find out what\n      you are receiving.\n\n      Study Drug Administration:\n\n      Starting on Day 1 of Cycle 1 of chemotherapy, you will start taking the study drug/placebo\n      capsule by mouth, twice a day every day.\n\n      You should take the study drug/placebo with a full glass (8 ounces) of water.  You may take\n      it with or without food, but if it causes an upset stomach, you should take it with food.\n\n      You should not lie down for at least 30 minutes after taking the study drug/placebo to\n      reduce the risk of side effects.\n\n      Study Visits:\n\n      Before you start taking the study drug/placebo:\n\n        -  You will complete 4 questionnaires about pain and other symptoms, and your quality of\n           life.  You will also complete a questionnaire about your tobacco history.  It should\n           take about 15-25 minutes to complete all questionnaires.\n\n        -  You may complete a sensory test.  For this test, researchers will try to find out how\n           sensitive you are to touching things such as small bumps on a board.  This test will\n           take about 10 minutes to complete.\n\n        -  Blood (about 6 teaspoons) will be drawn to test for markers of inflammation.  Markers\n           of inflammation are found in the blood and may be related to your symptoms.\n\n           1 time each week:\n\n        -  You will complete a questionnaire in the clinic or by telephone about any symptoms you\n           may be having and how they may be affecting your daily activities.  The questionnaire\n           should take about 3-5 minutes to complete each time.\n\n      At each chemotherapy cycle:\n\n      -You will fill out 2 questionnaires about pain and other symptoms.  It should take about\n      10-15 minutes to complete the questionnaires.\n\n      At about 2 months:\n\n        -  Blood (about 6 teaspoons) will be drawn to test for markers of inflammation.\n\n        -  You may complete a sensory test.  This test will take about 10 minutes to complete.\n\n        -  You must bring the study drug/placebo container (along with any remaining\n           drug/placebo).  The study staff will count the number of pills that you took so far.\n\n      End-of-Treatment Visit:\n\n      At about 4 months, you will return to the clinic.  The following tests and procedures will\n      be performed:\n\n        -  You will fill out the 4 questionnaires about your symptoms.  It should take about 15-20\n           minutes to complete all of the questionnaires.\n\n        -  Blood (about 6 teaspoons) will be drawn to test for markers of inflammation.\n\n        -  You may complete a sensory test. This test will take about 10 minutes to complete.\n\n        -  You must bring the study drug/placebo container (along with any remaining\n           drug/placebo).  The study staff will count the number of pills that you took so far.\n\n      Length of Study:\n\n      You may continue taking the study drug/placebo for up to 4 months, if there are no treatment\n      delays.  You will no longer be able to take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if\n      intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.\n\n      Your participation in the study will be over at the End-of-Study visit.\n\n      End-of-Study Visit:\n\n      At about 6 months, you will return to the clinic.  The following tests and procedures will\n      be performed:\n\n        -  You will fill out 4 questionnaires about pain and other symptoms and your quality of\n           life.  You will also complete a questionnaire about your tobacco history.  It should\n           take about 15-25 minutes to complete all of the questionnaires.\n\n        -  Blood (about 6 teaspoons) will be drawn to test for markers of inflammation.\n\n        -  You may complete a sensory test.  This test will take about 10 minutes to complete.\n\n      This is an investigational study.  Minocycline is FDA approved and commercially available\n      for the treatment of bacterial infection.  Its use in this study is investigational.\n\n      Up to 96 participants will be enrolled in this study.  Up to 48 will take part at MD\n      Anderson."
