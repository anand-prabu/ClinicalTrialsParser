Aim of this study is to estimate the\n      cumulative incidence of thrombosis in a cohort of patients carrying a PICC-line CVC,\n      monitored to allow an early detection and prevention of complications related to the\n      presence of asymptomatic deep venous thrombosis, and to explore the role of several\n      potential risk factors.\n\n      Methods: in a prospective observational cohort we will enroll 150 consecutive patients\n      having a PICC inserted by our team; clinical characteristics, comorbidities and main\n      features of catheter positioning procedure will be registered; patients will be followed\n      with clinical and echographic scheduled controls, weekly for the first month, then monthly;\n      patients with PRDVT will be treated with LMWH and recontrolled weekly until removal of\n      catheter"

Patients are recontrolled one week after\n      positioning; patients who report pain, swelling, fever, skin colour changes, exit site\n      tenderness, or any symptom suspected for thrombosis or infection, are immediately seen. A\n      duplex ultrasound complete examination of the upper limb and neck vessels is performed, and\n      at the same time the whole arm and the exit site is inspected to exclude infections;\n      diagnostic criteria for DVT include incompressibility of the vein and direct visualisation\n      of PICC-surrounding thrombus; in uncertain cases, a doppler examination is performed.If the\n      examination is negative for thrombosis, further controls are performed at 2,3,4 weeks after\n      positioning, then once a month.If a DVT is detected, we register the position and extension\n      of the thrombus, and its main characteristics (clot, mural or occlusive thrombosis); the\n      catheter is left in place and a therapy is prescribed with LMWH at full doses, according\n      with ACCP guidelines 2008 (confirmed in 2012 edition). Then, the patient is recontrolled\n      weekly until removal of the catheter."
