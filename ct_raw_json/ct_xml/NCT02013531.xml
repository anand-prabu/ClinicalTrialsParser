    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of flexibly dosed
      adjunctive brexpiprazole treatment in subjects with major depressive disorder  and anxiety
      symptoms, who are experiencing an inadequate selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor
      (SSRI)/serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) response.
