It exhibits unique pharmacokinetic\n      properties. Unlike atorvastatin which is metabolized by CYP3A4, metabolism of 1PC002 does\n      not depend on CYP3A4. This multi-center study is conducted to confirm the efficacy and\n      safety of 1PC002 administered for 12 weeks is non-inferior to atorvastatin."

Non-HDL value will be calculated by subtracting HDL-C from TC. Moreover,\n      serum Cystatin C, another biomarker of renal function, will also be assessed at baseline and\n      Week 12.\n\n      For monitoring the safety, biochemical and hematological assessment will be performed at\n      baseline, Week 4 and 12. Additional liver function and CK test will be conducted at Week 8.\n      The occurring AE(s) and SAE will be followed until resolution or the event is considered\n      stable."
