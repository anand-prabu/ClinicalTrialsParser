  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to compare the effects on sleepiness, quality of life,
      depression, hospitalization and deaths rate, of intensive vs standard interventions, on CPAP
      adherence, 2 years after CPAP initiation.

    <textblock>
      There is limited data concerning long-term randomized clinical trials proving the long-term
      efficacy of intensive use, follow programs on improving CPAP use. Therefore the
      investigators aimed to compare the effects on sleepiness, quality of life, depression,
      hospitalization and deaths rate, of intensive vs standard interventions, on CPAP adherence,
      2 years after CPAP initiation.
