Our purpose is\n      to evaluate the influence of general anesthesia immunosuppressive on HBV replication. If the\n      results show that HBV-DNA quantity increases, so the patients might be given anti-HBV drugs\n      or immune enhancer; otherwise it is indicated the general anesthesia immunosuppressive don't\n      influence HBV replication."
