  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to implement and measure the efficiency of a standardized
      acute and brief non-pharmacological intervention (Cognitive interventions on Sleep - Anxiety
      - Attention - Memory) following mild TBI and observe their impact pre- and post-treatments.
      The ultimate goal is to have patients be re-integrated to their activities faster with
      lesser symptoms and have patients present lesser post-concussive symptoms. Specific
      objectives: 1) Measure the effect of an acute and brief non-pharmacological intervention on
      PCS symptoms, sleep, headaches, affect, cognition and functional outcome following mild TBI;
      2)To redefine a model of outcome prediction following mild TBI.
