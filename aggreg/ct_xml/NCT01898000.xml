  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study was a randomized control clinical trial, which included 90 subjects with
      chronic generalised gingivitis of age group 25-40 years, reporting to outpatient department
      of Periodontics, Government Dental College &amp; Research Institute, Bangalore form January 2013
      to April 2013. The research protocol was initially submitted and approved by the
      Institutional Ethical Committee and Review Board of the Government Dental College and
      Research Institute, Bangalore. After ethical approval, all subjects were verbally informed
      and written signed informed consent was taken for participation in the study.

      Ninety subjects diagnosed with chronic generalized gingivitis were randomly assigned into
      three groups: Group I: Placebo mouthwash, Group II: Triphala (TRP) mouthwash, Group III:
      Chlorhexidine (CHX) mouthwash. Subjects were instructed to use mouth wash twice daily. The
      plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI) and oral hygiene index- simplified (OHI-S) and
      microbiological colony counts were recorded on baseline (B/L) and 7, 30 and 60 days
      respectively.

      TRP mouthwash was found to decrease the inflammatory parameters. As improvement in
      gingivitis was comparable to that of CHX mouthwash thus TRP mouthwash can be considered as a
      potential therapeutic agent in treatment of gingivitis.

      Objective: The aim of the present study is to evaluate the efficacy of triphala (TRP) as a
      mouthwash in reduction of plaque and gingivitis.

      Material &amp; Methods: Ninety subjects diagnosed with chronic generalized gingivitis were
      randomly assigned into three groups: Group I: Placebo mouthwash, Group II: TRP mouthwash,
      Group III: Chlorhexidine (CHX) mouthwash. Subjects were instructed to use mouth wash twice
      daily. The plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI) and oral hygiene index- simplified (OHI-S)
      and microbiological colony counts were recorded on baseline (B/L) and 7, 30 and 60 days
      respectively.

      Results: There was a gradual decrease in the PI, GI and OHI-S scores by the 7 days, 30 days
      and 60 days time interval, respectively, in all three groups. Microbial counts also showed
      significant reduction in all the groups at all the time intervals except in Group 1. There
      was a significant difference with respect to reduction in PI, GI, OHI-S and microbiological
      counts in Group I as compared to Group II and Group III. However, no significant difference
      was found between Group II and Group III for all the parameters at all-time intervals.

      Conclusion: TRP mouthwash was found to decrease the inflammatory parameters. As improvement
      in gingivitis was comparable to that of CHX mouthwash thus TRP mouthwash can be considered
      as a potential therapeutic agent in treatment of gingivitis.
