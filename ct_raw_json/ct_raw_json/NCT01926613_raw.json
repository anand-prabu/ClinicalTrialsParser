One half of the\n      participants in the study will receive vocational rehabilitation and the exercises to\n      improve thinking skills, and the other half will receive just vocational rehabilitation. All\n      participants will receive an assessment of symptoms and thinking skills at the beginning of\n      the study and 6, 12, and 24 months later. Work activity during the 24 months in the study\n      will be collected. It is expected that those participants who receive the practice of their\n      thinking skills will be more likely to get and keep the job they want compared with people\n      who do not receive this treatment."

Participants are randomized to either the\n      Thinking Skills for Work (cognitive remediation +supported employment; CT+SE) or enhanced\n      supported employment (E-SE), with cognitive, symptom, and quality of life assessments\n      performed at baseline, 3 months (following the completion of the computerized cognitive\n      training component of the Thinking Skills for Work program), 12 months, and 24 months, and\n      employment data gathered over the full 2-year period.  For the E-SE condition, supported\n      employment services are enhanced by training provided to the  employment specialists\n      regarding to recognize cognitive problems related to work performance, and how employment\n      specialists can teach clients coping strategies for managing these problems.  Primary\n      analyses will focus on testing the hypotheses that the Thinking Skills for Work Program\n      (CT+SE) leads to better cognitive functioning and better competitive work outcomes over the\n      2-year follow-up period compared to the E-SE program."
