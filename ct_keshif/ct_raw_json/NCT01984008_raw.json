An\n      additional objective of this study is to collect subject's response to the acceptability and\n      tolerability about bowel preparation and safety information.\n\n      After bowel preparation, independent evaluator who is blinded to subject's treatment will\n      evaluate the overall colon cleansing based on Aronchick and Ottawa scale. A total of 600\n      eligible subjects scheduled to a colonoscopy will be randomly assigned with equal allocation\n      to 1 of 2 treatment groups: \"Bowklean\" or \"Klean-Prep\" with Dulcolax. Each subject's\n      participation is expected to be maximally 4 weeks in study duration (up to 3-week screening\n      period followed by one week post colonoscopy)."
