            "textblock": "Despite the existence of effective medications for smoking cessation, approximately 50-80%\n      of smokers attempt to quit without using pharmacotherapy.  Efforts to encourage medication\n      use during cessation attempts have met with mixed success.  Many do not use medications\n      because of concerns about side effects, contraindications that make medication use\n      inappropriate, and individual preferences for chemical-free quit attempts. This leaves many\n      smokers seeking an effective alternative to assist them in attempting to quit smoking. Each\n      year, over 41% of smokers report failed attempts to quit smoking. Thus, effective\n      non-pharmacological interventions to increase rates of successful cessation are greatly\n      needed.\n\n      Our research, and the research of other investigators, has demonstrated that traditional\n      (Western) exercise (e.g., brisk walking, bicycling) improves smokers' ability to\n      successfully quit.  Exercise may help smokers quit by reducing concerns regarding\n      post-cessation weight gain, and by reducing nicotine withdrawal and enhancing mood.  Recent\n      research suggests that yoga is an acceptable and potentially effective alternative therapy\n      for smoking cessation for several reasons: As a form of exercise, yoga shares many of the\n      same properties as traditional (Western) aerobic exercise in that yoga has been shown to\n      improve mood, physical fitness, weight control, self-image and quality of life in healthy\n      and ill populations. Moreover, features of yoga, including a focus on breathing, mental\n      concentration, meditation, stress reduction and enhanced mood are likely to have special\n      relevance for smokers who are trying to quit. Thus, yoga may be particularly attractive as\n      an alternative for individuals who either cannot use medications, or who choose not to use\n      medications while quitting.\n\n      The proposed study will test the efficacy of Yoga as a complementary therapy for smoking\n      cessation using a randomized, controlled study design. Adult smokers will be randomly\n      assigned to either; 1) Yoga, or 2) an equal contact time Control group (CTL) given a health\n      & wellness program to control for contact time.  All participants will be provided\n      (separately by treatment group assignment) with the same cognitive-behavioral Smoking\n      Cessation Counseling (SCC). Smoking abstinence will be measured at the end of treatment\n      (week 8) and at 3, 6 and 12 months follow-up.  We hypothesize that abstinence will be\n      significantly higher in the SCC+Yoga group compared to SCC+CTL. We will also test\n      theoretically posited mediators of intervention efficacy (e.g., perceived stress,\n      cognitive/perceptual changes), examine the cost-efficacy of the yoga intervention, and\n      examine the relationship between maintenance of yoga practice during the post-treatment\n      period and smoking status. This study builds on our programmatic line of research developing\n      innovative, theory-driven smoking cessation therapies."
