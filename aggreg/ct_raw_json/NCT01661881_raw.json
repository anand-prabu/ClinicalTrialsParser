This treatment will consist of Rituximab\n      given by infusion into a vein (intravenous) on day 1 of each cycle and cytarabine by\n      infusion into a vein (intravenous) every 12 hours on days 1 and 2 of each cycle. It is\n      expected that those 3 cycles will be delivered in the hospital, over 2-3 days each time.\n\n      It is expected that patients will proceed to autologous stem cell transplantation at the\n      conclusion of this study.
