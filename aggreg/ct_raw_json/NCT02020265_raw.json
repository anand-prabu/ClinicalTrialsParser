Three groups of soldiers, while\n      in operational activity will go through 24 sessions of 3 different methods of EEG-NF; our\n      newly developed NF via MLI, a standard procedure for NF via A/T and a placebo NF. Difference\n      between the groups in regard to their emotion regulation capability will be tested by fMRI\n      with regard to amygdala activation following EEG-NF LMI as well as two stress challenge\n      tests."
