      A Phase III, Open Label, Randomised Study of AZD9291 versus Platinum-Based Doublet
      Chemotherapy for Patients with Locally Advanced or Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
      whose Disease has Progressed with Previous Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Tyrosine Kinase
      Inhibitor Therapy and whose Tumours harbour a T790M mutation within the Epidermal Growth
      Factor Receptor Gene

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase III, open label, randomized study assessing AZD9291 (80 mg, orally, once
      daily) versus platinum-based doublet chemotherapy (standard of care) in subjects with
      confirmed diagnosis of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) mutation positive NSCLC, who
      have progressed following prior therapy with an approved Epidermal Growth Factor
      ReceptorTyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) agent and whose tumours harbour a T790M
      mutation within the EGFR Gene. Subjects must be chemotherapy naive and must agree to provide
      a biopsy for central confirmation of T790 mutation status following confirmed disease
      progression on their first line EGFR-TKI treament (e.g. erlotinib, gefitinib or afatinib).
      The primary objective of the study is to assess the efficacy of AZD9291 versus
      platinum-based doublet chemotherapy by assessment of progression free survival (PFS)
      according to RECIST 1.1
