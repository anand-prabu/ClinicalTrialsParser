AurA regulates cell division by\n      controlling the transition from G2 to M phase.  Overexpression of AurA is associated with\n      resistance to taxanes.\n\n      The study will be conducted in two sequential phases:\n\n      Dose Escalation Phase with the purpose to determine the maximum tolerated dose and the\n      recommended Phase 2 dose of TAS-119 given in combination with paclitaxel\n\n      An Expansion Phase in which additional patients will be enrolled to further evaluate the\n      safety and preliminary efficacy of the recommended Phase 2 dose of TAS-119 in combination\n      with paclitaxel, during which a subgroup of patients will be evaluated for DDI between\n      paclitaxel and TAS-119 via PK assessment."
