            "textblock": "The study is being done to examine the effects of a medication called mifepristone in\n      children with Cushing's disease. Since a child's body may absorb and use mifepristone in a\n      different way than adults, it is important to have information about the amount of\n      mifepristone to give children and what will happen to it. Mifepristone has been FDA approved\n      for use only in adults with Cushing's syndrome, and it is important to learn if mifepristone\n      improves the symptoms and signs of Cushing's disease in children. The study is limited to\n      children with Cushing's syndrome due to a pituitary tumor (Cushing's disease) and will not\n      enroll children with Cushing's syndrome due to other causes. The study will investigate how\n      children's bodies absorb and process mifepristone, how it works in children and what effect\n      it has on the use of sugar in the body, on the child's weight and on growth hormone. An\n      important part of the study is to evaluate the side effects of mifepristone in children."
