  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cigarette smoking evokes major changes in the biology of the airway epithelium, the cell
      population that takes the brunt of the stress of cigarette smoke and the cell population
      central to the pathogenesis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung cancer.
      The focus of this study is to identify the differences that two popular alternative nicotine
      delivery strategies, shisha and electronic cigarettes, have on the airway epithelium
      compared to cigarette smoking. We hypothesize that both alternative nicotine delivery
      strategies disorder airway epithelial biology, but in different ways than does cigarette
      smoking.

    <description>We will measure the effect that shisha smoking has on the small airway epithelium (SAE) by measuring parameters such as the SAE gene expression, DNA methylation, telomere length and cilia length in &quot;pure shisha smokers&quot; (i.e., non-cigarette smokers.) We will compare these parameters to the same parameters  measured in non-smokers and cigarette smokers.</description>

    <description>We will measure the small airway epithelium (SAE) of cigarette smokers who switch to smoking electronic cigarettes by measuring parameters such as the SAE gene expression, DNA methylation, telomere length and cilia length. We will compare these parameters to the same parameters measured in cigarette smokers who stop smoking completely.</description>

    <description>Nonsmoker is defined as someone who has smoked &lt;100 cigarettes or &lt;10 shisha pipes per lifetime and whose urine nicotine &lt;2 ng/mL and/or urine cotinine &lt;5 ng/mL, at entry into the study.</description>

    <description>Current smoker is defined by self-report and urine nicotine &gt;30 ng/ml and/or urine cotinine &gt;50 ng/ml. Subjects must be a current smoker willing to stop smoking. Subjects in Group D will stop smoking after the baseline bronchoscopy, and switch to taking a smoking cessation medication called varenicline. We will provide subjects with the smoking cessation medication as part of this study. They will also receive phone calls to help with smoking cessation counseling.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Group E - Current smokers who switch to electronic cigarettes</arm_group_label>
    <description>Current smoker is defined by self-report and urine nicotine &gt;30 ng/ml and/or urine cotinine &gt;50 ng/ml. Subjects must be willing to switch from tobacco cigarettes to electronic cigarettes. Subjects in Group E will switch to using electronic cigarettes after the baseline bronchoscopy. The nicotine dose that will be given to each subject will be determined by the study physician based on the urine smoking metabolite test. It will be adjusted depending on whether the subject is a light smoker or heavy smoker. Light smoker is defined as having either a urine nicotine value from 2ng/ml-1000ng/ml or a urine cotinine value from 5ng/ml-1000ng/ml. Heavy smoker is defined as having either a urine nicotine or cotinine value of over 1000ng/ml. We will provide the subjects with the electronic cigarettes to use as part of this study.</description>
