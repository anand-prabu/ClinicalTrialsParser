Participants will be randomly assigned to 2 groups:\n      tramadol/APAP group and non tramadol/APAP group. Participants in tramadol/APAP group will\n      receive celecoxib 200 milligram (mg) and fixed dose combination of tramadol (37.5 mg)/APAP\n      (325 mg) as add on therapy, while the participants in non-tramadol/APAP group will receive\n      celecoxib 200 mg only. The total duration of the study will be 4 weeks. The participants in\n      both the groups will be given celecoxib 200 mg once daily for 4 weeks. In addition, the\n      participants in the tramadol/APAP group will be given add-on tramadol/APAP doses 3 times a\n      day for 4 weeks. Participants will be asked to return for follow-up at Weeks 2 and 4.\n      Efficacy will be assessed using 100 millimeter (mm) Visual Analog Scale (VAS) while QOL will\n      be assessed using the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI).
