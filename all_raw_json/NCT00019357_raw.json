Determine the feasibility of expansion and the reinfusion of specific T-cell\n      lines (peptide-specific activated lymphocytes), in combination with interleukin-2, in\n      patients who were vaccinated with ras peptides. II. Assess immunologic status or antitumor\n      response that may occur with this treatment in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: Autologous peptide-specific activated lymphocytes (PAL), previously harvested from\n      the patient following vaccination on a different protocol, are expanded and reinfused\n      intravenously; this is followed by a 4 hour observation period. Patients then receive\n      interleukin-2 (IL-2) administered subcutaneously 5 days a week for 2 weeks; the first dose\n      of IL-2 is administered at least 4 hours after PAL infusion. Patients are followed once a\n      month for 2 months after treatment.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 150 patients will be accrued for this study."
