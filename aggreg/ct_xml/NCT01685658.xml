  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study was to demonstrate the non-inferiority of intravenous
      paracetamol relative to intravenous ketoprofen when treating renal colic in an emergency
      ward. Efficacy was measured by the change in visual analog scale for pain at 30 minutes.

      The secondary objectives of this study are:

        -  To compare the efficacy (non-inferiority) of intravenous paracetamol and ketoprofen at
           90 minutes (visual analog scale for pain).

        -  To compare both arms in terms of other administered drugs (for pain).

        -  To observe and compare side effects between the two arms: cutaneous manifestation,
           edema, bronchospasm, nausea, vomiting, headache, palpitation, chest pain, dizziness,
           disturbance of consciousness, dyspnea, acute retention of urine.

        -  To determine predictors for the use of intravenous morphine when treating renal colic.
