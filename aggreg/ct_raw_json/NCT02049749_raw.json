Goals are to decrease stress for caregivers, improve child behavior, and enhance the caregiver-child relationship, family stability, and wellness.  The training teaches parents to follow a child's lead thus building a connection and promoting positive behaviors.  The focus is on giving attention to child's pro-social behavior and ignoring minor misbehavior. The second phase teaches techniques for giving effective commands.",
