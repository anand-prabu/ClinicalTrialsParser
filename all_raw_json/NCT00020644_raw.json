Courses repeat every 2 weeks (for patients on dose levels 1-5) and every 4 weeks (for\n      patients on dose levels 6 and 7) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable\n      toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of gemcitabine until the maximum tolerated\n      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 3 of 6\n      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 27 patients will be accrued for this study."
