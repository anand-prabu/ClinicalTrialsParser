    <textblock>
      Cangrelor is a potent intravenous P2Y12 receptor inhibitor with rapid onset and offset of
      action associated with a greater reduction in ischemic events, including stent thrombosis,
      in patients undergoing stent procedures who have not been pretreated with clopidogrel. In
      vitro investigations have shown cangrelor to be associated with more rapid, potent, and
      consistent platelet inhibition in patients on maintenance prasugrel therapy exposed to a
      re-loading dose of prasugrel. However, if cangrelor exerts similar effects in ticagrelor
      treated patients remain unknown. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the effects on
      platelet function achieved after in vitro incubation with cangrelor in patients on
      ticagrelor maintenance dose who receive a loading dose of ticagrelor.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A higher degree of platelet inhibition remains the goal in the peri-interventional period in
      patients undergoing percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) as this is associated with a
      lower rate of adverse ischemic events. Ticagrelor and prasugrel are novel and potent
      generation oral P2Y12 receptor inhibitors associated with a greater reduction in ischemic
      events compared with clopidogrel. However, both prasugrel and ticagrelor have recently
      showed variability in pharmacodynamic (PD) response, particularly in patients with
      ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) undergoing primary PCI, exposing these patients
      to an increased risk of thrombotic complications. These findings support the need for
      intravenous agents with more rapid platelet inhibiting effects. Cangrelor is a potent
      intravenous P2Y12 receptor inhibitor with rapid onset and offset of action associated with a
      greater reduction in ischemic events, including stent thrombosis, in patients undergoing PCI
      who have not been pretreated with clopidogrel. In vitro PD investigations have shown
      cangrelor to be associated with more rapid, potent, and consistent platelet inhibition in
      patients on maintenance prasugrel therapy exposed to a re-loading dose of prasugrel.
      However, if cangrelor exerts similar effects in ticagrelor treated patients remain unknown.
      The aim of the present study is to evaluate the PD effects achieved after in vitro
      incubation with cangrelor in patients on ticagrelor maintenance dose who receive a loading
      dose of ticagrelor. The proposed study will have a prospective, randomized, parallel design
      in which patients on chronic ticagrelor therapy will be assigned to receive a reloading dose
      of 90 or 180 mg ticagrelor. PD assessments will be done before and after incubation with
      cangrelor at 3 time-points. The study hypothesis is that in vitro incubation with cangrelor
      will lead to incremental P2Y12 receptor blockade, the extent of which will be inversely
      related to dose of ticagrelor.
