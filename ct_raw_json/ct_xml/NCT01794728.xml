      The How the Elderly Live with Pain in Heart Failure (HELP-HF) study provides the opportunity
      to assess the complaints of pain in a cohort of HF patient admitted to Thomas Jefferson
      University Hospital (TJUH). Additional information on their existing co-morbid conditions,
      an inventory of their prescribed medications, and details regarding the type of treatment
      interventions (over the counter analgesia and other comfort practices) they report using
      will be collected.
