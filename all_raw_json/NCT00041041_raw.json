To evaluate the cytostatic, anti-tumor activity of Gleevec (Imatinib Mesylate) through\n      the probability of surviving progression-free for at least 6 months in patients with\n      recurrent or persistent epithelial ovarian or primary peritoneal carcinoma receiving\n      Gleevec.\n\n      II. To determine the frequency and severity of adverse effects of Gleevec in this cohort of\n      patients as assessed by CTC.\n\n      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. To determine the distribution of the overall survival. II. To determine the distribution\n      of progression-free survival. III. To estimate the clinical response rate (partial and\n      complete response as defined under the RECIST criteria).\n\n      IV. To assess the effects of prognostic variables: initial performance status, platinum\n      sensitivity, and mucinous (or clear cell) histology).\n\n      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. To determine the levels of expression of c-KIT and its ligand, stem cell factor (SCF) in\n      archived, formalin fixed, paraffin embedded primary tumors collected prior to the initiation\n      of first-line chemotherapy.\n\n      II. To determine the levels of expression of platelet derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR)\n      and its ligand PDGF in archived, formalin fixed, paraffin embedded primary tumors collected\n      prior to the initiation of first-line chemotherapy.\n\n      III. To determine the levels of expression of AKT2 and its activated form, phospho-AKT2, in\n      archived, formalin fixed, paraffin embedded primary tumors collected prior to the initiation\n      of first-line chemotherapy.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.\n\n      Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate twice daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28\n      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then\n      annually thereafter."
