Tissue ultrafiltration refers to the removal\n      of muscle interstitial fluid by the ECSPRESS PMFC.  The primary objective of the study is to\n      demonstrate whether the removal of interstitial fluid by the ECSPRESS PMFC/FC catheters\n      decrease the incidence of fasciotomy in the Treatment group when compared to the Control\n      group.  Fasciotomy was chosen as the primary outcome because it is clearly defined and\n      clinically relevant; reduction of fasciotomy is of clear clinical benefit.  Enrolled\n      patients may have isolated tibia fractures OR be multiple trauma patients (those with\n      another major fracture in a different body region or two distinct body system injuries,\n      excluding those with injuries to the opposite leg that would preclude them from completing\n      required tests)."

The catheters will be used for up to 24-hours after surgical\n      fixation of the affected lower leg in order to (1) measure and record muscle compartment\n      pressure, and (2) remove interstitial fluid in the subset of subjects that are randomized to\n      the Treatment Group.  Subjects will be followed closely during the 24 hours the catheter is\n      inserted to gather muscle pressure data, occurrance of a fasciotomy, adverse events, etc.\n      and then followed up at 2 weeks, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months post study enrollment\n      after which the subjects participation in the study will be completed.
