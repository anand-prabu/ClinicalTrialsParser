This 3 year\n      placebo-controlled, double-blind randomized controlled trial will evaluate the safety,\n      efficacy and health outcomes of oropharyngeal administration of OMC/OMM in a sample of 300\n      (150 in each arm) extremely premature infants with the following aims: Aim 1. To determine\n      if oropharyngeal administration of OMC/OMM to extremely premature infants will reduce the\n      risk of late-onset sepsis  or death as the primary outcome, and necrotizing enterocolitis\n      and ventilator-associated pneumonia  as pre-planned secondary outcomes. Aim 2: To determine\n      if extremely premature infants who receive OMC/OMM via the oropharyngeal route have a\n      shorter time to reach full enteral feeds and a shorter length of hospital stay. Aim 3: To\n      determine if oropharyngeal administration of OMC/OMM will have immunostimulatory effects, as\n      measured by changes in  urine lactoferrin and stool microbiota. Results will confirm whether\n      extremely premature  infants demonstrate a host-immune response to this intervention and\n      whether there is a beneficial effect on common morbidities in these high risk patients."
