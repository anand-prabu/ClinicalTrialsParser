Participants  may receive erythrocyte transfusions to achieve this\n                  hemoglobin level at the discretion of the investigator; however, initial study\n                  drug treatment must not begin earlier than the day after the erythrocyte\n                  transfusion.\n\n               -  Hepatic:  Bilirubin no more than 1.5 times upper limits of normal (ULN) and\n                  alanine aminotransferase (ALT) no more than 2.5 times ULN.  If the liver has\n                  tumor involvement, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase\n                  (ALT) equaling 5 times ULN are acceptable.\n\n               -  Renal:  calculated creatinine clearance at least 45 milliliters per minute\n                  (mL/min)\n\n          -  Have a performance status of less than or equal to 1 on the Eastern Cooperative\n             Oncology Group (ECOG) scale and life expectancy of more than 12 weeks.\n\n          -  Have discontinued all previous therapies for cancer (including chemotherapy,\n             radiotherapy, immunotherapy, and investigational therapy) for at least 21 days for\n             myelosuppressive agents or 14 days for nonmyelosuppressive agents prior to receiving\n             study drug, and recovered from the acute effects of therapy (treatment-related\n             toxicity resolved to baseline) except for residual alopecia.  At the discretion of\n             the investigator, participants with breast or prostate cancers progressing on\n             therapies may have that treatment continued while receiving study drug.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  Have received treatment with a drug that has not received regulatory approval for any\n             indication within 14 or 21 days of the initial dose of study drug for a\n             nonmyelosuppressive or myelosuppressive agent, respectively.\n\n          -  Have serious preexisting medical conditions that, in the judgment of the\n             investigator, would preclude participation in this study (for example, inflammatory\n             bowel disease or history of major surgical resection involving the stomach or small\n             bowel).\n\n          -  Have central nervous system (CNS) malignancy, except:\n\n               -  Participants with treated CNS metastases are eligible for this study if they are\n                  not currently receiving corticosteroids and/or anticonvulsants, and their\n                  disease is asymptomatic and radiographically stable for at least 60 days\n                  (screening not required).\n\n               -  Participants with glioblastoma are eligible.\n\n          -  Have an acute leukemia.\n\n          -  Have received an autologous or allogeneic stem-cell transplant.\n\n          -  Females who are pregnant or lactating.\n\n          -  Have active bacterial, fungal, and/or known viral infection (for example, human\n             immunodeficiency virus [HIV] antibodies, hepatitis B surface antigen [HBSAg], or\n             hepatitis C antibodies).  Screening is not required for enrollment.\n\n          -  Have malabsorptive syndromes, enteropathies, gastroenteritis (acute or chronic), or\n             diarrhea (acute or chronic)."
