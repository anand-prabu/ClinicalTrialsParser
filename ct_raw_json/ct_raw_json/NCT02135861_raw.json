            "textblock": "Transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) channel blockade may be promising in the\n      treatment of pulmonary oedema and dyspnoea in heart failure (HF) patients by re-establishing\n      the alveolar septal barrier. Dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) Magnetic Resonance Imaging\n      (MRI) is an established technique for assessing changes in vascular permeability and\n      interstitial water volume. The aim of this study is to establish the potential utility of\n      DCE-MRI as a novel endpoint for dose ranging and proof of mechanism studies of TRPV4\n      blockers. The DCE-MRI markers of vascular permeability and pulmonary oedema will be measured\n      in HF patients and healthy volunteers (HV) at rest to determine if there is a difference\n      between the two populations. In addition, exercise induced changes relative to rest in\n      interstitial volume and exchange rate will be evaluated in both HV and HF patients.\n\n      This study will enrol a sufficient number of subjects to have up to 24 evaluable subjects\n      (up to 12 HV and up to 12 HF patients). An evaluable subject is defined as a subject that\n      has MRI data of sufficient quality to enable DCE-MRI modelling both Scan Visit 1 and Scan\n      Visit 2. The study will consist of five visits wherein the first visit will be a screening\n      visit. The second visit will be the first scanning visit and will take place within 35 days\n      of the first visit. The third visit/second imaging will take place after approximately one\n      week. Third imaging visit will incorporate a bicycle exercise challenge prior to imaging and\n      will occur approximately one to three days after the second imaging session. The final\n      contact will be a follow-up phone call, which will take place up to 1 week later."
