The baseline medication will include - in concordance with European League Against\n      Rheumatism (EULAR)-guidelines and the provisional 'Nederlandse Vereniging voor\n      Reumatologie(NVR)'-guidelines - Methotrexate (MTX) for all patients. The medicine regimes\n      are part of the ongoing cohort studies from which the patients will be recruited. Evaluating\n      the medicine effects is not part of the 'Echografie bij Vroege Artritis (EVA)(Ultrasound in\n      Early Arthritis)' study. All consecutive Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) patients will be asked to\n      participate in this study.  They will receive oral and written information about the EVA\n      study.\n\n      Approximately two weeks after this first consultation the patient returns to his or her\n      rheumatologist for the diagnosis and accompanying treatment. If the patient decides to\n      participate in this study they fill out the informed consent form. The patient will be asked\n      to fill out the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) and the Short Form-36 (SF-36). After\n      this, at baseline, at three months and at 12 months, Metatarsophalangeal (MTP) 2-5(dorsal\n      aspect) and Metacarpophalangeal (MCP) 2-5(dorsal, palmar, lateral) and wrists of each\n      patient will be examined with ultrasound by a single rheumatologist per centre specialized\n      in Ultrasound (US). This rheumatologist will be unaware of the clinical, laboratory and\n      radiographic findings."
