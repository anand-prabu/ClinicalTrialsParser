Samples obtained will be stored by the sponsor for future testing. In\n      addition, demographic and clinical patient information will be collected. The study will be\n      conducted in North America. The study population will include IBD patients in North America\n      with HSTCL who are identified through the sponsor's adverse event reporting systems. Cases\n      of HSTCL will be identified through postmarketing adverse event reporting (eg, spontaneous\n      reports, reports from late phase clinical trials, reports from patient registries) or from\n      the sponsor's new or ongoing clinical trials. Eligible for enrollment are male or female\n      patients of any age who have a confirmed diagnosis of HSTCL. There is no study-related\n      therapeutic intervention and this protocol will not restrict or introduce any therapeutic\n      interventions, including medications. All patients will continue to be managed by their\n      personal physicians. No healthy subjects will be enrolled in this study."
