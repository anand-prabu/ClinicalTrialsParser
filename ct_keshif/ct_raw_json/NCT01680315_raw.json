Food intake is not only regulated by\n      appetite and satiety signals - external cues also play an important role.\n\n      It has been observed that food intake and the pleasure derived from consumption is affected\n      by manipulation of the external cues.\n\n      The investigators will assess the contribution of food anticipation (calorie information)\n      and actual consumption of a test food (calorie intake) on in satiety responses (such as\n      ghrelin responses, appetite and subsequent food intake). The investigators expect the\n      information on the amount of calories, rather than the actual amount of calories in the\n      food, to predict the ghrelin responses and the subsequent intake of a second meal."
