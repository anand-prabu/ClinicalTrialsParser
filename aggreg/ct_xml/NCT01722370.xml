  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) may develop low oxygen levels,
      because of damage to their lungs. Long term oxygen therapy (LTOT) is given for at least 15
      hours per day, and has established indications and benefits in COPD. However, the
      indications for and benefits from ambulatory oxygen supplementation (oxygen just when
      walking or exercising) are less well understood, in part due to heterogeneity of previous
      study designs, and lack of long term follow up. This is a pilot study of supplementary
      ambulatory oxygen in COPD, which allows us to ascertain mechanisms of disease by measuring
      their degree of systemic inflammation pre and post oxygen supplementation, and measuring
      changes in gene expression in muscles by means of microarray profiling. Secondly, our study
      will utilise follow up of clinical parameters including home activity monitoring to
      ascertain medium/long term benefits of oxygen supplementation in a real life setting. Our
      hypothesis is that exertional hypoxia results in muscle dysfunction and this could be
      prevented by oxygenation.
